40|$|In <b>roll-based</b> {{printing}} systems, {{controlled release}} of liquid ink to the substrate surface is achieved through {{the transport of}} the liquid ink {{through a series of}} ink transfer rollers in the form of splitting liquid bridges. An in-depth understanding of the liquid transport process through the ink transfer rollers is essential for advancing the <b>roll-based</b> printing technology and achieving the highest quality printing. In this study, the phase-field method is investigated to characterize the liquid bridges in <b>roll-based</b> printing systems. Phase-field models of two-phase flow systems are being used increasingly often in a variety of applications ranging from microfluidics to turbulent flows. However, there are limited implementations of the phase-field method to simulate the liquid ink transport in <b>roll-based</b> printing systems. There are advantages of the phase-field method over other methods that are generally used for simulating the liquid transport in <b>roll-based</b> printing systems such as the volume of fluid method and the moving mesh methods. This study demonstrates that the phase-field method is an effective tool to simulate the liquid ink transport in <b>roll-based</b> printing systems that facilitates the treatment of certain characteristics of the ink flows such as moving and deforming interfaces, topology changes, and slipping contact lines. In the phase-field simulations described in this study, the liquid ink transport between the rollers is approximated as the stretching and splitting of liquid bridges with pinned or moving contact lines between vertically separating surfaces. The interface separating the liquid and the surrounding air is represented as a diffuse interface with finite thickness across which the two phases mix. First, the simulation conditions that yield accurate results are determined by examining the effect of the phase-field parameters and the mesh characteristics on the simulation results. The simulation results show that a sharp interface limit is approached when the capillary width is decreased keeping the mobility proportional to the capillary width squared. This limit best represents real interfaces having molecular thickness in the micron-scale flows investigated. Close to the sharp interface limit, the mobility changes over a specified range are observed to have no significant influence on the simulation results. The computational mesh is segmented into regions of varying mesh fineness or adaptive mesh refinement is implemented to reduce the computational cost of resolving thin interfaces in the simulations. The simulation results are validated against data reported in existing studies of liquid ink transport in <b>roll-based</b> printing systems for selected capillary width and mobility values. Next, the liquid ink transport from the axisymmetric cells on the surface an ink-metering roller to the surface of stamp features is simulated. The function of the cells on an ink-metering roller is to control the amount of liquid ink delivered to the stamp surface. The resolution of printing is limited by the width of the cell openings, since uniform inking of the stamp requires the width of the cell openings to be smaller than the size of the stamp features. The cell geometries explored in the simulations are selected to enable printing with higher resolution than the current industry standards. Increasing the resolution of printing would improve the performance of printed products and expand their range of functionality. The results of the simulations indicate that under negligible inertial effects {{and in the absence of}} gravity, the amount of liquid ink transferred from a cell with low surface wettability to a stamp with high surface wettability increases as the cell sidewall steepness and the cell surface wettability decrease, and the stamp surface wettability and the capillary number increase. The amount of liquid ink removed from the cell does not change significantly as the cell depth increases above a certain value. High-resolution printing strategies, which indicate how the printing parameters should be manipulated to more precisely control the printed layer thickness, to eliminate printing defects, and to minimize cell clogging, are derived by analyzing the simulation results. The cells with different sidewall inclination angles are used to represent the cells with irregular surface topography on novel materials and novel roller designs that could be used for stamp inking during high-resolution <b>roll-based</b> printing, such as the pores on porous materials and the cells fabricated with poor control over cell geometry due to manufacturing difficulties at small length scales. The variations in the printed layer thickness with the cell sidewall inclination angle is found to be significant (~ 10 - 100 nm for cells with 2 -[mu]m opening width) indicating that the variations in cell geometry should be minimized when designing advanced rollers for use in high-resolution <b>roll-based</b> printing. by Fahri Erinc Hizir.

40|$|Soft {{lithography}} is {{a printing}} process that uses small features on an elastomeric stamp to transfer micron and sub-micron patterns to a substrate. Translating this lab scale process to a <b>roll-based</b> manufacturing platform allows precise {{control of the}} stamp contact region {{and the potential for}} large area, high rate surface patterning. In this manner, emerging devices can be produced economically, including flexible displays, distributed sensor networks, transparent conductors, and bio-inspired surfaces. Achieving and maintaining collapse-free contact of the soft stamp features is a necessary condition for printing. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, stamp behavior is examined at two length scales. First, microfeature collapse is examined across a range of dimensionless aspect ratios and pattern ratios to determine the collapse mode and the feature stiffness. Second, behavior of roll-mounted stamps is investigated on the macroscopic scale. The results of these analyses, simulations, and experiments show that contact is prohibitively sensitive as the feature scale shrinks to single microns or below. In the second part of the thesis, methods are developed to reduce the contact sensitivity. A compliant stamp architecture is introduced to tune the mechanical response of the stamp. Next, a new process for manufacturing cylindrical stamps is developed that removes limitations of planar stamp templates. The third part of the thesis addresses process control. A parallel kinematic stage is designed to manipulate the height and pitch of a roll over a substrate with submicron precision. A hybrid state-space / classical feedback control approach is used to achieve high bandwidth servo control in the presence of coupling and unmodeled dynamics. Using optical instrumentation, the stamp contact pattern is monitored and can be controlled using camera images as a control variable. Ultimately, a practical method of impedance control is implemented that demonstrates excellent disturbance rejection. The results of this thesis provide models for stamp behavior at the local microscale and the <b>roll-based</b> macroscale. These results illustrate the high sensitivity of contact to displacement disturbances in <b>roll-based</b> lithography, but also provide valuable design insight towards designing stamps and processing machinery that are robust to these inherent disturbances. by Joseph Edward Petrzelka.

Assuming that the supply chain operates with {{the same set of}} policies regardless of the width interval value, we illustrate that the value of risk pooling diminishes as the interval widens. Due to the presence of a counteracting effect, we also demonstrate that increasing the width interval does not always reduce the amount of inventory requirements.

40|$|High speed video {{observations}} of free flying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the dengue and yellow fever vector, along with custom measurement methods, enable measurement of wingbeat frequency, body position and body orientation of mosquitoes during flight. We find these mosquitoes flap their wings at approximately 850 Hz. We also generate body yaw, body pitch and wing deviation measurements with {{standard deviations of}} less than 1 degree and find that sideways velocity and acceleration are important components of mosquito motion. Rapid turns involving changes in flight direction often involve large sideways accelerations. These do not correspond to commensurate changes in body heading, and the insect's flight direction and body heading are decoupled during flight. These findings call in to question the role of yaw control in mosquito flight. In addition, using orientation data, we find that sideways accelerations are well explained by <b>roll-based</b> rotation of the lift vector. In contrast, the insect's body pitch angle does not correlate with its forward acceleration. This implies that controlling body roll is important to mosquito dynamics. The dynamic importance of stabilizing body pitch and body yaw is less clear...|$|E
40|$|We used {{videography}} {{to investigate}} direct lateral maneuvers, i. e. ‘sideslips’, of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. M. sexta sideslip by rolling their entire body and wings to reorient their net force vector. During sideslip they increase net aerodynamic force by flapping with greater amplitude, (in both wing elevation and sweep), {{allowing them to}} continue to support body weight while rolled. To execute the roll maneuver we observed in sideslips, they use an asymmetric wing stroke; increasing the pitch of the roll-contralateral wing pair, while decreasing that of the roll-ipsilateral pair. They also increase the wing sweep amplitude of, and decrease the elevation amplitude of, the contralateral wing pair relative to the ipsilateral pair. The roll maneuver unfolds in a stairstep manner, with orientation changing more during downstroke than upstroke. This is due to smaller upstroke wing pitch angle asymmetries as well as increased upstroke flapping counter-torque from left-right differences in global reference frame wing velocity about the moth's roll axis. Rolls are also opposed by stabilizing aerodynamic moments from lateral motion, such that rightward roll velocity will be opposed by rightward motion. Computational modeling using blade-element approaches confirm the plausibility of a causal linkage between the previously mentioned wing kinematics and roll/sideslip. Model results also predict high degrees of axial and lateral damping. On the time scale of whole and half wing strokes, left-right wing pair asymmetries directly relate to the first, but not second, derivative of roll. Collectively, these results strongly support a <b>roll-based</b> sideslip {{with a high degree}} of roll damping in M. sexta...|$|E

The combined techniques enable the organic DFB laser to be uniformly fabricated over large surface areas upon a flexible plastic substrate, with an approach that is compatible with <b>roll-based</b> manufacturing. Secondly, laser pump threshold from a distributed feedback (DFB) structure, based upon a second order grating in a dye-doped polymer, has been efficiently reduced by implementing a resonant optical pumping scheme. The proposed scheme couples the excitation laser light into a resonant mode and {{takes advantage of the}} intensified electromagnetic field. For a Bragg grating having a periodicity of 400 nm, a Rhodamine 590 doped polymer laser operates at 584 nm and concurrently supports a resonance mode at 532 nm which is the excitation laser wavelength. Pumped under the resonant condition, the DFB laser exhibits a pump threshold reduction of 25 -fold. In addition, the resonant optical pumping technique also enhances the light conversion efficiency by a factor of 23. This technique improves the performance of organic DFB lasers. Finally, we demonstrate that a dielectric nanorod structure could be used to enhance the label-free detection sensitivity of the vertically emitting distributed feedback laser biosensor (DFBLB). We show that the use of the nanostructured film results in a three-dimensional volume overlap between the DFBLB resonant mode and the region in which the biomolecule adsorption can occur.

The overall manufacturing costs have been reduced by 61 percent through implementation of the improvements developed under this program. Development {{of the ability to}} use a 1 -mil substrate, rather than the standard 2 -mil substrate, results in a 50 percent cost-saving for this material.

These include detailed parameter optimization of deposition temperatures, process gas flows, carrier gas flows, and web speeds. An overall process throughput improvement of 275 percent was achieved based on this work. The new alignment technique was developed for the laser scriber and printer systems, which improved registration accuracy from 100 microns to 10 microns.

40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} {{is a form}} of {{soft lithography}} that uses a molded elastomeric stamp to print patterns with micron and sub-micron scale features. This is an effective low-cost technique for replicating master patterns onto substrates. However, the traditional embodiment of using a planar stamp with a planar substrate is limited in both scale and speed. In order to achieve higher production rates, the lab scale plate-to-plate microcontact printing method must be developed into a <b>roll-based</b> manufacturing process. The marriage of the precision of microcontact printing with the speed of traditional press printing will fill a niche in manufacturing capabilities. Large area, high rate patterning of micron and sub-micron scale features will help to enable the economic manufacturing {{of a wide range of}} emerging technologies. Specifically, this continuous microcontact printing process could be used to make flexible displays, thin film photovoltaic cells, transparent conductors, desalination membranes, and other large-scale surface modifications. This thesis details the development of a precision roll-to-roll microcontact printing machine. This pilot-scale web-handling machine serves as the platform for research on the continuous microcontact printing process. Specific consideration is given to the design of a precision print head that is capable of maintaining consistent contact pressure even while printing at high speeds. As well, a novel camera system is developed to achieve in-situ real-time inspection of the contact region between the stamp and the substrate. The visual data from this sensor is used as feedback for the controller, enabling the print head to maintain the desired evenly distributed pressure along the entire stamp width. Results show that the closed-loop control of print contact is able to compensate for eccentricities and disturbances in the system, significantly decreasing variation in print pressure. These tests show promise for the usefulness of this novel process control technique, rather than traditional downstream sensing. As well, this pilot-scale machine succeeds in serving as a platform for continuous roll-to-roll microcontact printing research that will help to guide the scale-up of the process into a high rate manufacturing technique. by Adam M.
