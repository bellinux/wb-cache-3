5000|$|Momohime (Momohime) is Kurohime's second {{alternate}} form, {{between the}} ages of 13 and 15. With Shirohime slain by Dark Rei, the original curse on Kurohime was broken. Unfortunately, the trauma of losing Zero resulted in Kurohime unable to access her full powers and limiting the recovery of her proper form. Informed by Yamatohime that reviving Zero will enable her to fully regain her power and form, Kurohime <b>received</b> <b>a</b> magical Lotus which when plucked, will cause her to briefly transform at the cost of losing a memory of Zero. She also <b>receives</b> <b>a</b> sword <b>blade</b> called Yamato-Dachi, which once empowered with the magic of the four spirit kings will be able to resurrect Zero. Upon reception, Yamoto-Dachi promptly fuses with Senryu, changing it into Yamato Senryu which can assume the form of either a gun or a katana. Kurohime was then launched from Yamatohime's prison inside of a giant peach which was found by an old couple, who upon finding her inside gave her the name Momohime (peach princess), a name which Kurohime finds exceedingly annoying. As Momohime, Kurohime's magic is slightly stronger than Himeko but still heavily inferior to that of her true form. She also is a bit more mature than Himeko, willingly repaying kindness and helping those in need, but still has quite a temper to those who irritate her.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>blade</b> server is <b>a</b> stripped-down server {{computer}} with a modular design optimized to minimize the use of physical space and energy. Blade servers have many components removed to save space, minimize power consumption and other considerations, while still having all the functional components {{to be considered a}} computer. Unlike a rack-mount server, <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> server needs <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, providing services such as power, cooling, networking, various interconnects and management. Together, blades and the <b>blade</b> enclosure, form <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> system. Different blade providers have differing principles regarding what to include in the blade itself, and in the <b>blade</b> system as <b>a</b> whole.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>blade</b> {{connector}} is <b>a</b> type {{of single}} wire connection using <b>a</b> flat conductive <b>blade</b> which is inserted into <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> receptacle. Usually both blade connector and blade receptacle have wires {{attached to them}} either through of the wire to the blade or crimping of the blade to the wire. In some cases the <b>blade</b> is <b>an</b> integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> receptacle is pushed onto the <b>blade</b> to form <b>a</b> connection.|$|R

The students were midway through their first day of the new school year. Two other cars were damaged in the accident. In serious condition at Mercy Hospital were William L.
