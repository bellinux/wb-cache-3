There were 144 researchers registered in the database and linked to 25 institutions. These researchers published a total of 12, 997 full-text articles, 6, 927 of which were published in the last 5 years. Category 1 <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> (n= 77) were responsible for 53. 5 % of this production; Category 2 <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> (n= 65) were responsible for 45. 1 %; Senior <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> (n= 2) were responsible for 1. 4 %.

40|$|International audienceWe {{claim that}} the models needed to {{describe}} scientific creativity (and, in particular, suitable to effectively detect it) {{have to be very}} sophisticated. Indeed, the process of creating original and predictive scientific theories is manifestly the most complex ever investigated by the human mind (There are also some paradoxical aspects in the action of a mind that is investigating its own way of functioning, but we are confident that {{it will be possible to}} avoid them). In mathematical physics one of the most complex state space structures is given by Fréchet Metric Manifolds. We conjecture that they will be needed to model the state of complexity of the mind of a scientist (However, we will not be surprised if an even more complex structure could be needed). The obtained models have a very important application: they are essential to design and rule the selection process that assigns a university chair (or a <b>research</b> <b>grant).</b> Recently some algorithms have been introduced to calculate some bibliometric indices. We claim that it is not reasonable to use them to evaluate the scientific quality of researchers, chair or <b>grant</b> <b>holders,</b> departments or whole universities. Instead, the only presently viable process must involve carefully designed procedures, similar to those used for forming juries. These procedures must be enforced to rule the formation and functioning of ad hoc peer committees entrusted to evaluate academic institutions and nominate professors, chairs or <b>research</b> <b>grant</b> <b>holders.</b> Bibliometrics and Scientometrics are too young as disciplines and therefore it is not possible yet, by means of the theoretical insight gained thanks to them, to design a more effective evaluation process. Only when game and artificial intelligence theories become sufficiently advanced will it become possible to efficiently replace selection peers committees (i. e. academic juries...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{consists of an}} exploratory study which looks to assess the needs for intervention in self-career management. The participants consisted of 62 graduates from the Universidade do Minho, currently <b>research</b> <b>grant</b> <b>holders,</b> of both sexes (40, 64. 5 % women), aged between 22 and 49 years old (M= 29. 73; DP= 6. 15). The assessment was conducted using the questionnaire, “A minha inscrição no Seminário Gestão Pessoal da Carreira versão B: motivações e receios (My enrollment in Self-Career Management Seminar version B: motivations and concerns). ” This is composed of five questions which address the expectations, motivations and concerns associated with the participation in the seminar. The use of the content analysis proposed by Bardin (2004) revealed reduced levels of concern on the participants pertaining to self-awareness, adaptability to the labor market, as well as management of life roles. In contrast, the need for reevaluation of the vocational path, {{in the sense of}} reflecting about choices, behaviors and past decisions, as well as the definition of future objectives and development of an integrated plan of action, constitute themselves as the main focus of concern. It is therefore suggested, as other authors have (e. g., Luzzo, 2000; Whiston & Buck, 2008), that the development of interventions should focus on an initial assessment of the specific needs of the target population.

40|$|This {{communication}} {{presents a}} specialized preventive career intervention – the Career Self-Management Seminar (CSMS; Taveira et al., 2006 – forms A and B). This intervention {{is designed to}} promote graduate students’ transition to Master and PHD degrees and/or to the work-market (version A); or {{the transition to a}} new job/position of PHD students and <b>research</b> <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> (version B). Both versions of the Seminar promote self-reflection and career exploration, and life-career decision-making and planning skills, in the context of group career counselling sessions. Special attention is given to the building of a solid and strong helping relationship. The focus {{on the quality of the}} counselling relationship is associated with the concern of promoting positive emotional attachment, necessary to students engagement in career exploration and change; and also, to prevent clients’ drop out from the seminar (e. g., Taveira, 1997; Gelso & Cárter, 1985; Horvath & Luborsky, 1993; Horvath, 2000). The clients’ reactions to CSMS helping relationship were measured twice along the intervention A with 36 undergraduates (12 men and 24 women, mean age= 22, 89), and the intervention B with 34 graduates (11 men and 23 women, mean age= 27, 59). The quality of the career exploration process of participants was also observed in both groups, before and after the intervention (pre and post-test moments).

40|$|In this paper, I hope {{to offer}} a global picture of what is {{happening}} in the world of qualitative data archiving. Qualidata is in a strong position to be able to offer this insight as it was the world's first initiative to pioneer preservation of qualitative social science data on a national scale. This was facilitated by the Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC), Britain's largest sponsor of social science research, implementing a mandatory policy for <b>research</b> <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> to offer datasets of all kinds created in the course of their research. The policy has been met with both great support and animosity from the research community. In this paper I examine some of the reasons why the concept of sharing qualitative data generates such mixed feelings. Qualidata's work has provided sparks of inspiration to a number of research groups across the world beginning to consider the systematic preservation of qualitative data. Over the past four years we have been approached by embryonic "qualidata" projects for advice on issues surrounding archiving and providing access to qualitative data. Many have used Qualidata procedures as a starting point for developing their own archiving procedures (which were devised initially from a cross-fertilisation of UK Data Archive and traditional archiving procedures). Typically these groups tend to be sociologists, and surprisingly have had little or no contact with the social science Data Archives in their own countries. Furthermore, we are still not aware of any other national funders of social research across the world who have realised the added value that archiving of qualitative data can bring. I hope to provide a quick world tour of progress in the field and then suggest some of the key objectives that I think need to be met in order to achieve a respectable tradition and infrastructure for preserving and re-using qualitative data. I will touch on optimal and cost effective models for qualitative data archiving, discuss issues surrounding the documentation of data, and finally, address the need for meaningful collaboration at the international level, such as by creating a Network for Qualitative Data Archiving (INQUADA).

40|$|Once {{again this}} {{publication}} is produced to celebrate and promote good {{teaching and learning}} support and to offer encouragement to those imaginative and innovative staff who continue to wish to challenge students to learn to maximum effect. It is hoped that others will pick up some good ideas from the articles contained in this volume. We have again changed our approach for this 2006 / 07 edition (our fourth) of the Aston Business School Good Practice Guide. As before, some contributions were selected from those identifying interesting best practice on their Annual Module reflection forms in 2005 / 2006. Other contributors received HELM (Research Centre in Higher Education Learning and Management) small <b>research</b> <b>grants</b> in 2005 / 2006. Part of the conditions were for them to write an article for this publication. We have also been less tight {{on the length of}} the articles this year. Some contributions are, therefore, on the way to being journal articles. HELM will be working with these authors to help develop these for publication. The themes covered in this year?s articles are all central to the issues faced by those providing HE teaching and learning opportunities in the 21 st Century. Specifically this is providing support and feedback to students in large classes, embracing new uses of technology to encourage active learning and addressing cultural issues in a diverse student population. Michael Grojean and Yves Guillaume used Blackboard™ to give a more interactive learning experience and improve feedback to students. It would be easy for other staff to adopt this approach. Patrick Tissington and Qin Zhou (HELM small <b>research</b> <b>grant</b> <b>holders)</b> were keen to improve the efficiency of student support, as does Roger McDermott. Celine Chew shares her action learning project, completed as part of the Aston University PG Certificate in Teaching and Learning. Her use of Blackboard™ puts emphasis on the learner having to do something to help them meet the learning outcomes. This is what learning should be like, but many of our students seem used to a more passive learning experience, so much needs to be done on changing expectations and cultures about learning. Regina Herzfeldt also looks at cultures. She was awarded a HELM small <b>research</b> <b>grant</b> and carried out some significant new research on cultural diversity in ABS and what it means for developing teaching methods. Her results fit in with what many of us are experiencing in practice. Gina leaves us with some challenges for the future. Her paper certainly needs to be published. This volume finishes with Stuart Cooper and Matt Davies reflecting on how to keep students busy in lectures and Pavel Albores working with students on podcasting. Pavel?s work, which was the result of another HELM small <b>research</b> <b>grant,</b> will also be prepared for publication as a journal article. The students learnt more from this work that any formal lecture and Pavel will be using the approach again this year. Some staff have been awarded HELM small <b>research</b> <b>grants</b> in 2006 / 07 and these will be published in the next Good Practice Guide. In the second volume we mentioned the launch of the School?s Research Centre in Higher Education Learning and Management (HELM). Since then HELM has stimulated a lot of activity across the School (and University) particularly linking research and teaching. A list of the HELM seminars for 2006 / 2007 is listed as Appendix 1 of this publication. Further details can be obtained from Catherine Foster (c. s. foster@aston. ac. uk), who coordinates the HELM seminars. For 2006 and 2005 HELM listed, 20 refereed journal articles, 7 book chapters, 1 published conference papers, 20 conference presentations, two official reports, nine working papers and £ 71, 535 of grant money produced in this research area across the School. I hope that this shows that reflection on learning {{is alive and well in}} ABS. We have also been working on a list of target journals to guide ABS staff who wish to publish in this area. These are included as Appendix 2 of this publication. May I thank the contributors for taking time out of their busy schedules to write the articles and to Julie Green, the Quality Manager, for putting the varying diverse approaches into a coherent and publishable form and for agreeing to fund the printing of this volume...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{test the}} use of Best Worst Scaling (BWS) {{experiments}} in valuing different types of biomedical and health research impact, and (2) to explore how different types of research impact are valued by different stakeholder groups. Design: Survey-based BWS experiment and discrete choice modelling. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: Current and recent UK Medical <b>Research</b> Council <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> and {{a representative sample of}} the general public recruited from an online panel. Results: In relation to the study’s two objectives: (1) We demonstrate the application of BWS methodology in the quantitative assessment and valuation of research impact. (2) The general public and researchers provided similar valuations for research impacts such as improved life expectancy, job creation and reduced health costs, but there was less agreement between the groups on other impacts, including commercial capacity development, training and dissemination. Conclusion: This is the second time that a discrete choice experiment has been used to assess how the general public and researchers value different types of research impact, and the first time that BWS has been used to elicit these choices. While the two groups value different research impacts in different ways, we note that where they agree, this is generally about matters that are seemingly more important and associated with wider social benefit, rather than impacts occurring within the research system. These findings are a first step in exploring how the beneficiaries and producers of research value different kinds of impact, an important consideration given the growing emphasis on funding and assessing research on the basis of (potential) impact. Future research should refine and replicate both the current study and that of Miller et al. (2013) in other countries and disciplines. Strength...|$|R

Full {{details of the}} questionnaires {{are available in the}} accompanying codebooks in Arabic and English. The removal of President Morsi by the Egyptian Army following mass public protests against his rule raises profound questions about the democratic commitments of Egyptian citizens. Previous <b>research</b> by the <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> in 2011 produced three results of great relevance to the present political situation. First, Egyptian public opinion appeared overwhelmingly supportive of democracy. Second, differences between supporters of different parties were minimal. A third feature of public opinion, however, illustrated clearly the nature of the country’s current democratic cross-roads because in 2011 there were strong levels of support for a ‘guardian army’ among supporters of all parties. Clearly, Egyptian public opinion cannot now hold on the lines of 2011. But, in what directions is it breaking? The answers may be crucial to the democratic future and governability of the country. The project will conduct two nationally representative samples of Egyptians, and using the data, the project will inform beneficiaries about the democratic commitments of Egyptian citizens and will create a new and unique publicly-accessible survey database that can be a basis and anchor for further academic research on Egypt...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} limited {{research}} {{on the impact of}} research funding for small, institutional grants. The IWK Health Centre, a children and women's hospital in Maritime Canada, provides small amounts (up to $ 15, 000) of research funding for staff and trainees at all levels of experience through its <b>Research</b> Operating <b>Grants.</b> These grants are rigorously peer-reviewed. To evaluate the impact of these grants, an assessment was completed of several different areas of impact. Findings An online questionnaire was sent to 64 Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators from <b>Research</b> Operating <b>Grants</b> awarded from 2004 to 2006. The questionnaire was designed to assess five areas of potential impact: (1) research, (2) policy, (3) practice, (4) society and (5) personal. Research impact reported by participants included publications (72 %), presentations (82 %) and knowledge transfer beyond the traditional formats (51 %). Practice impact was reported by 67 % of participants, policy impact by 15 % and societal impact by 18 %. All participants reported personal impact. Conclusions Small <b>research</b> <b>grants</b> yield similar impacts to relatively large <b>research</b> <b>grants.</b> Regardless of the total amount of research funds awarded, rigorously peer-reviewed research projects have the potential for significant impact at the level of knowledge transfer and changes in clinical practice and policy. Additional findings in the present research indicate that small awards have the potential to have significant impact on the individual <b>grant</b> <b>holder</b> across a variety of capacity building variables. These personal impacts are particularly noteworthy in the context of developing the research programs of novice researchers. </p...|$|R
