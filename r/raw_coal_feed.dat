40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{undertaken}} to assess the relationship between raw coal and effluent quality of Zarand coal washery plant, Kerman province in southeast Iran. Coal samples, <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> <b>feed,</b> washed fine clean coal and middling were collected. In washing process, raw water (intake to washery) and effluent samples generated in the washeries, namely, fine coal jig under water and tailing pond water were collected during August-September 2009. In coal samples, trace elements were determined in various fractions of Zarand coal washery. Parameters such as pH, temperature, colour, odour, TSS, oil and grease, COD, and trace and heavy metals were measured in washery processing. TSS, COD and oil and grease were very high in water samples. Trace elements like Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cr, Mn and As {{were found to be}} present in the process water indicating that these elements are not released by coal during washing...|$|E
40|$|Beneficiation of coal {{refers to}} the {{production}} of wash coal from raw coal with the help of some suitable beneficiation technologies. The processed coal is used by the different steel plants to serve their purpose during the manufacturing process of steel. The present paper deals with the optimal planning for blending raw coal of different grades used for beneficiation with a view to satisfy the requirements of the end users with desired specifications. The input specifications of coal samples are known whereas the output specifications are imprecise in nature. The aim of the work is to fix the level of the raw coal from different coal seams to be fed for beneficiation to meet the desired target of yield and ash percentage to maximum extent. Further, it is also desired by the decision-maker (DM) to restrict the input cost of raw coal to be fed for beneficiation. The problem is modeled as multicriteria decision-making problem with imprecise specifications. Fuzzy set theoretic approach has been used and a corresponding model has been developed. The solution of the problem would enable the DM to optimize the <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> with existing available specifications from different collieries along with the overall degree of satisfaction.

40|$|To {{carry out}} washery {{optimization}} calculations {{in a digital}} computer, both the <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> characteristics and separator efficiency performance must {{be reduced to a}} form that is both accurate and easv to translate into code. A systematic analysis has been made of mathematical representation for partition curves and separation characteristics for froth flotation machines. A number of representations of the partition curves {{have been found to be}} useful. The programs developed accept conventional partition data or modelled partition curve parameters. Flotation performance is specified according to a two-rate constant kinetic model. Feed coal characteristics used are typical for coal preparations plants in China. Optimization of the process is carried out by maximization of yield, and three programs have been developed for the purpose. The programs can deal with any one of seven plant flowsheets commonly used in China. One program can be applied to determine the optimal ash content of clean coal for either each category of separator or each coal feed group. The other two programs are very useful to determine the optimal cut points of separators being installed in a plant. The computing techniques applied in both the programs are the Rosenbrock pattern search and the so-called “Replacement Method”. The cubic spline interpolation techniques have been applied in a number of calculations with success. All the programs have been proved to be effective and convenient tools for the design and operation of coal preparation plants...|$|E

Therefore, a standard specimen was prepared by wrapping it with a material similar to <b>raw</b> <b>coal.</b> Firstly, the <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> was cut into coal blocks whose sizes are slightly smaller than the standard specimen size. Meantime, we ensured that the bedding plane is parallel to the horizontal plane and the <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> was cut along different cleat orientations.
