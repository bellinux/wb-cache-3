40|$|The {{abrasive}} {{properties of}} tooth pastes are usually investigated by brushing natural teeth {{which have been}} activated by irradiation, and subsequently measuring the radioactivity of the abraded particles (RDA-, REA-values). The standard REA and RDA measurements using actual tooth material represent the practical situation very well, however, the measuring procedure is complicated and expensive. In addition, the measurement technique and the biological variation of individual teeth result in a large scatter of the obtained data. Therefore, another approach was chosen, simulating the tooth by a dental composite filling material and utilizing a test set-up which was developed earlier for measuring the abrasion behaviour of dental materials. This test {{is based on an}} arrangement of a brush and a specimen which rotate in opposite directions in a tooth paste slurry under loading conditions (force, velocity, etc.) which are close to tooth cleaning conditions. The material loss is measured by weighing the samples (at least 5) after a well defined cleaning and drying procedure. Various widely used commercial tooth pastes covering a broad spectrum of abrasion levels (i. e. RDA-values) were investigated. The results show a reasonably small scatter (typical standard deviations 10 %) and a high reproducibility of the abrasion values. The abrasion caused by mild and abrasive tooth pastes differs typically by a factor 5 - 10. The method seems to be more accurate, faster, easier to perform and less expensive than the abrasion test based on <b>radioactive</b> <b>marking</b> and thus can be a reliable alternative to differentiate between pastes with different abrasivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} influence of ectomycorrhiza on the uptake and distribution of calcium in pine seedlings (Pinus sylvestris). A focal point of interest was the apoplastic permeability of the fungal sheath of the fungi Suillus bovinus and Rhizopogon roseolus. Using different methods (micro- and macroautoradiography, liquid scintillation spectrometry, atom absoption spectrometry, EDXS), the distribution of calcium within the mycorrhizae and the uptake into the shoots were examined in order to obtain detailed knowledge of the transport processes in the mycorrhizal roots. Using the radiotracer 45 Ca, an apoplastic transport through the fungal sheath of the fungi Suillus bovinus and Rhizopogon roseolus could be proven. This was shown by microautoradiographs, which established <b>radioactive</b> <b>marking</b> in the cell walls of the fungal sheath, the harting net and the stele. However, a part of the calcium was precipitated by the fungi by means of exudation of oxalic acid in form of calciumoxalat, and therefore existed in a physiologically inactive form. Another part of the disposable calcium was bound to free cation-binding sites of the cell walls, and therefore temporarily unavailable for transport into the shoot. The absence of the fungal sheath and its ?buffer-effect? explains the faster transport of 45 Ca into the shoot of non-mycorrhizal pine. The transport capability of calcium into the shoot was also a distinguishing factor between the two fungal partners. Rhizopogon roseolus displayed a higher calcium intake, which can be explained by its thinner fugal sheath. Additionally, using X-ray microanalysis, higher S-contents could be shown to exist in the cell walls of Suillus bovinus. This could be an indication for a higher hydrophobin accumulation and therefore also a higher hydrophobicity compared to Rhizopogon roseolus. Exposure in an aqueous milieu resulted for Suillus bovinus in lower S-contents, which can be explained by a diffusion of the hydrophobines into the surrounding medium. Experiments with different external calcium concentrations (1 mM and 50 mM) showed that an increased calcium supply primarily influenced the calcium concentration in the shoots of the non-mycorrhizal pines. While the calcium was transported relatively freely into the shoot by the non-mycorrhizal roots, the ectomycorrhizae held back part of the excess calcium. Investigating the vacuolar polyphosphate granules of the fungal partners it could be shown that the composition of Suillus bovinus strongly depended on external factors. It could be proven that {{in the presence of a}} surplus of calcium, even when using cryotechiques, calcium is nevertheless present to a large degree in the polyphosphate granules. In this thesis it could be shown that the apoplastic transport of calcium through the fungal sheaths of Suillus bovinus and Rhizopogon roseolus is possible. However, a part of the calcium is held back by the mycorrhizae, and is therefore temporarily unavailable for further transport into the shoot. Most important for the transport processes in the fungal sheaths are, beside the species of the symbiotic partners, the form of the fungal sheaths and the experimental conditions...|$|E

This binding pattern {{is the basic}} principle of modern genetic technologies. Joseph Gall and Mary Lou Pardue published a paper in 1969 demonstrating that <b>radioactive</b> <b>marked</b> ribosomal DNA {{can be used to}} detect its complementary DNA sequence in a frog egg, known as the first researchers who use DNA probes to perform in situ hybridization. RNA probes were proved to be able to perform the same function and also used with in situ hybridization. Fluorescent dyed probes replaced radio labeled probes due to the consideration of safety, stability, and ease of detection. Detecting a DNA sequence is similar to [...] "looking for a needle in a haystack, with the needle being the DNA sequence of interest and the haystack being a set of chromosomes". The ability of the DNA helix to disassociate, re-anneal and the remarkable accuracy of base-pairing grants riboprobes the ability to locate its complementary DNA sequence on chromosomes.|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{influence of}} the well casing in reservoir defomation measurements by the <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Marker</b> Tecnique (RMT) is investigated. The issue is quite important as RMT data {{may be used for}} a most representative estimate of the in situ vertical rock compressibility cM (i. e., a basic parameter to predict the land settlement due to gas/oil field development or the land uplift due to underground fluid injection). A geomechanical Finite Element (FE) model is implemented to evaluate the disturbance caused by the stiffness of the steel casing and the surrounding cement on the amount of deformation around the borehole as detected by RMT. The FE model is integrated by a class of elasto-plastic Interface Finite Elements (IE) specifically designed to account for the potential sliding of the different materials (i. e., along the contact surfaces between the steel casing and the cement, and the cement and the exploited formation). The numerical simulations make use of real casing data and geomechanical information from the Northern Adriatic basin, Italy. The results show that sliding is not likely to occur along the contact surfaces and RMT appears to be a reliable tool for assessing the actual geomechanical properties of the depleted formation at a depth larger than 1000 m where the in situ deformation is negligibly affected by the casing stiffness. In shallow softer units the compaction as measured by RMT is progressively influenced by casing, with a corresponding likely underestimate of cM...|$|R
40|$|Kyleo® {{with two}} known active {{substances}} (ai) is an innovative, modern herbicide for resistance management. Kyleo® contains 160 g/l 2, 4 -D and 240 g/l glyphosate. With an application rate of 5, 0 l/ha, {{it shows a}} far better, faster effect on weeds such as field horsetail (Equisetum arvense), volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and couch grass (Agropyron repens) compared to a tank mix or the reference products (RP). This is explained by an unique new formulation technology {{that for the first}} time combines 2, 4 -D as acid and glyphosate as MIPA salt together with FHS. The new form of 2, 4 -D is lipophilic with better leaf absorption and greater photolytic degradation in the upper layers of soil. Tests with <b>radioactive</b> <b>marked</b> substances have verified the systemic properties of both ai compared to RP. The displacement of 2, 4 -D into the plant roots was demonstrated 48 h after application (hpt). 98 % glyphosate absorption was observed in rape and couch grass – 10 % (rape) respectively 25 % (couch grass) greater than with RP. Higher absorption of the ai is characterised by a swifter effect, with stronger, visible symptoms after 24 h in rape and 96 h in couch grass. The rainfastness of Kyleo® was tested in greenhouse (GH) trials with rape. Comparability of the test objects was simulated with a uniform glyphosate quantity of 360 g/ha and 10 l/m² simulated precipitation. 24 % improved effect compared to RP was verified for 1 hpt rainfall, while 4 % improved effect was recorded for rain simulation after 6 hpt. GH trials with wheat and a comparable glyphosate application quantity of 290 g/ha revealed differences of 23 % and 22 % compared to RP for rain simulation of 1 hpt and 6 hpt. Kyleo® stands out with a swift effect and better rainfastness. The results presented here prove a systemic mode of action, good rainfastness and swift effect of Kyleo...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{phenotype}} of tumor associated immune cells of equine cutaneous skin tumors was examined. Using {{a wide spectrum}} of monoclonal antibodies as well as in situ hybridizing and RT-PCR a snapshot of the infiltration pattern of immune cells was taken and possible conclusions were considered. In the context of this study 200 equine sarcoids, 32 papillomas, 30 melanomas, 29 squamous cell tumors and 27 fibrosarcomas from the files of the Institute for Veterinary Pathology of the Free University of Berlin were rediagnosed using H&E staining. After rediagnosing 179 equine sarcoids, 15 papillomas, 27 melanomas, 25 squamous cell tumors and 19 fibrosarcomas were available for further investigations. Firstly, these tumors were examined for different tumor associated immune cells by means of immunohistochemical methods. The antibodies directed against human CD 3, CD 79 a, MAC 387 (monocytes/macrophages) and S 100 showed a positive reaction in equine tissues. Since the MAC 387 was positive on both, monocytes and macrophages, equine CD 68 was amplified and verified by using RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridizing (35 S-RNA <b>radioactive</b> <b>marked</b> probe). The S 100 antibody indicates likewise a wide reaction spectrum, which contains both epidermal Langerhans cells as well as melanocytes and peripheral nerves. For a specific Langerhans cells detection equine CD 1 a was amplified and verified by RT-PCR in equine skin. During the process of malignant transformation from "normal" cell to tumor cell, modifications of the cell surface (e. g. expression of tumor antigens, loss of MHC molecules) can occur, which enable a recognition of the tumor cells by the immune system. Humoral and also cellular immune reactions, in which antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes are involved, lead to the development of specific antibodies and killer cells against the detected tumor antigens. Between the both effector systems of the immune system exist a very complex linkage of specific and nonspecific cooperative regulations. Cell necrosis induced by tumor growth provoke inflammation reactions in the enviroment. In that process antigen presenting cells (APC), for example dendritic cells, play an important role. APC phagoticytize tumor cell fragments, present them in processed form to T cells together with MHC molecules or activate natural killer cells directly. In this work CD 68 positive macrophages and T cells were observed as the most frequent cell population in all examined tumors, with exception in fibrosarcomas. This is in agreement with other authors in humans. In all examined patients potentially cytotoxic effector cells, indicated by the presents of T cells in all tumor, could be observed. These results show an activity of the immune system against that tumors. Despite their potential cytotoxic effects, the T cells observed showed no sufficient tumor control in vivo, since in most cases the tumors did not indicate signs of regressions. Immune cell infiltrates of the examined fibrosarcomas differed from that of other tumors by the fact that lymphocytes played only a subordinated role, while antigen presenting cells were dominating...|$|R
40|$|High Level Waste samples contain {{elevated}} {{concentrations of}} <b>radioactive</b> cesium requiring <b>marked</b> dilution {{of the waste}} to facilitate handling in non-shielded facilities. The authors developed a sample treatment protocol, using ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) to remove sufficient cesium to allow handling of the samples with minimal dilution. The sample treatment protocol includes the following steps: pH adjust the sample to the range of 0. 01 to 1. 0 M acidity; mix 30 mL of acidified sample with 40 - 60 mg of AMP; cap and shake the mixture for 30 - 60 seconds; filter AMP from the liquid using 0. 45 PTFE syringe filters; and send filtrate directly forward for analysis. To develop the method, SRTC performed {{a series of tests}} with three different salt solutions designed to determine the propensity of ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) to bind some of the common analytes such as the actinides (Pu, Am, Np, U), strontium, or the metals (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se) regulated by the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA).

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of ultrastructural and biochemical effects of Tris and ionophores X 537 A and A 23187 on bovine parathyroid tissue is presented. When parathyroid slices were incubated with 3 H-leucine and 3 H-lysine for 10 minutes alone or with Tris (50 mM), A 23187 (9. 5 - 19 microM) or X 537 A (8. 5 - 17 microM), the incorporation of the amino acids into radioactive proparathormone (proPTH) was similar, indicating that biosynthesis of the hormone was not affected. After 120 minutes of incubation, however, Tris inhibited the conversion of proPTH to parathormone (PTH), judged by a decrease in cellular and secreted radioactive PTH and a corresponding increase in radioactive cellular proPTH. These changes were accompanied by marked dilatation of Golgi membranes. With both concentrations of A 23187 and the low concentration of X 537 A there were no changes in amounts of radioactive proPTH, moderate decreases in cellular and secreted radioactive PTH, and little discernible distension of the Golgi membranes. At 17 microM X 537 A there was moderate increase in amount of <b>radioactive</b> proPTH, a <b>marked</b> decrease in amount of radioactive PTH and swelling of the Golgi membranes. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} Tris inhibited conversion of proPTH to PTH by disrupting the Golgi zone-the site of conversion of proPTH to PTH; that A 23187 and the low concentration of X 537 A decreased production of PTH by enhancing its degradation; and that X 537 A at the higher concentration acted both by inhibiting conversion of proPTH to PTH and by enhancing the degradation of PTH...|$|R
40|$|ONE of the {{hypotheses}} advanced {{to explain the}} anuria or oliguria of acute tubular necrosis is that the glomerular filtrate is passively reabsorbed through the tubules which have been stripped of epithelium. Moreover, {{it has been suggested}} that the rise in urine volume in the early diuretic phase results from a relining of the tubules by division of surviving cells (Oliver, 1954). This process is well demonstrated in mercury poison-ing. Noltenius, Schellhas & Cehlert (1963), using <b>radioactive</b> thymidine to <b>mark</b> the synthesis of new DNA, found that the regeneration com-menced after a latent period of 72 hr from the mercury poisoning and spread upwards from the lowest end of the proximal convoluted tubule. If this hypothesis to explain the anuria or oliguria is correct and if one could hasten the process of relining of the tubules, one might shorten the period of oliguria and improve the prognosis in mercury poisoning and in other varieties of acute tubular necrosis. In this connection the work of Haddow (1954) and Taylor, Threlfall & Buck (1966) is of special interest. Certain pteridines such as folic acid given intravenously to rats causes a marked and rapid increase in kidney weight. This increase in weight is associated with an outburst of mito-tic activity and an increase of cell numbers. It therefore seemed worth while to test the effect of folic acid on the speed of regeneration of tubules in animals suffering from acute tubular necrosis induced by mercury and on their sur-vival.

(It takes about 3 hr.) - Resuspend in H 2 O, and microfuge 5 min. Spotting more than 3 µl is tedious, so don't use much H 20. On the other hand, I wouldn't use much less than 6 µl so as to have good recovery. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") 7. Spot 1 µl PAA standards (about 0. 3 µg each of PSer, PThr, and PTyr) on a cellulose thin layer chromatography plate and then spot your sample. We use 0. 1 mm EM cellulose plates - You can spot the whole sample if you are skillful and have no choice because you don't have many counts. - Spot 0. 25 - 0. 30 µl at a time and dry with house air, blown through a plugged pipet, between applications. *How do I wet the plate? We use a blotter that has four, 2 cm, circular holes cut out of it, one for each origin. We cut the holes with a sharp cork borer. The blotter can be made from a good grade of blotting paper, or two layers of Whatmann 3 MM sewn together. It should be wet, but not dripping. For the first dimension, you wet the plate with pH 1. 9 buffer. * 8. Electrophorese at pH 1. 9, 1. 5 KV, 20 min in the first dimension. 9. Let plate air dry well. *How do I wet the plate for the second dimension? Use three rectangular pieces of Whatmann 3 MM that have been wet with pH 3. 5 buffer. Wet the bottom of the plate below the lower two origins. Keep the paper at least 1 cm away from where the PAAs are. Then wet the area between the 4 origins. Finally wet the top of the plate. The blotters should be quite damp, but not soaking wet*. 10. Rotate 90 ° counter clockwise. Electrophorese at pH 3. 5, 1. 6 KV, 13 min in the second dimension. *The above electrophoresis times are appropriate when you are using a Salk/TVL/MBVL type electrophoresis rig. A knock off of this is sold by CBS scientific. If you are using another rig, you will have to optimize your electrophoresis times*. 11. Dry plate in oven. 12. Spray plate with ninhydrin sol'n for several seconds. Incubate in oven until can see purple spots of PAA standards. 15 min should be plenty. 13. Mark the plate with radioactive ink so that you can extrapolate where the origins were and can align the film unambigously with the plate and the PAA markers. 14. Expose the plate to flashed film with a screen a - 70 °C. Film is much preferable to the phosphorimager because it is transparent and is exactly {{the same size as the}} plate and this facilitates alignment of the film and the plate. In the rare case that you need quantification, you can use the phosphorimager. 15. After developing the film, trace the locations of the PAA standards and the <b>radioactive</b> ink <b>marks</b> onto a Xerox transpancy and save this in your notebook. This is what a perfect plate looks like: ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") ### Recipes: In general, you will need 2 liters of each buffer. 1. pH 1. 9 buffer. - 88 % Formic acid 	 50 ml - Acetic acid 	 156 ml - H 2 O 	 1794 ml - Don't use the 98 % formic acid and don't adjust the pH. - pH 3. 5 buffer - Pyridine 	 10 ml - Acetic acid 	 100 ml - 100 mmolar EDTA 	 10 ml - H 2 O 	 1880 ml - Don't bother to adjust the pH. *There have been occasional problems with badly smeared PAAs during electrophoresis at pH 3. 5. Something seems to leach out of the wicks and make the PAAs relatively insoluble. Tony thinks it is aluminum. Bart thinks that it's calcium. In any case, this problem can be prevented by including 0. 5 mM EDTA in the 3. 5 buffer*. ### References: This two dimensional technique was originally developed, in large part by [Tony Hunter]([URL] for analysis of cell extracts or proteins eluted from ground up gels.
