In the rats receiving small doses of kidney-fixing antibody and immunization to the heterologous gamma globulin a lag period existed between the appearance of circulating antibody and kidney-fixed host antibodies and the appearance of renal injury. This delay apparently reflects the need for a continuing antigen-antibody reaction for some time in order to produce detectable injury with the small amounts of reactants involved.

Fourteen days post-transection, the spinal mice were robotically trained to step {{in the presence of a}} 5 -HT agonist, quipazine, for a period of six weeks. In this pilot study nine animals were divided into three groups, each receiving a different control strategy: a fixed training trajectory (Group A), a variable training trajectory without interlimb coordination imposed (Group B) and a variable training trajectory with hindlimb bilateral coordination imposed (Group C). Preliminary results indicate that Group A recovers more slowly than the two groups <b>receiving</b> <b>variable</b> modes of robotic training. Groups B and C show higher levels of recovery than Group A in terms of the number of steps performed during testing sessions, as well as in their step periodicity and shape consistency.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to corre-late the type and {{frequency}} of cell death in human lym-phocytes <b>receiving</b> <b>variable</b> doses of X-irradiation. Monocyte-depleted lymphocyte fractions were exposed in vitro to variable doses of X-rays of 0 - 20 Gy (0 - 2000 rads) and incubated for 4 and 16 h. An assessment of the mode of cell death (apoptosis vs. classical necrosis) was carefully evaluated using a multidisciplinary approach using light, fluorescence and electron microscopy (EM), and dye cx-clusion assays. Eosin Y exclusion assays indicated the ab-sence of classical necrosis occurring in short-term cultures (4 h postirradiation). An assessment of cell counts, however, revealed a mean decrease of 4 % at 0 Gy and 13 % at 10 - 20 Gy (1000 - 2000 rads). The predominant mode of cell death was apoptosis, but the percent apop-totic cells (determined by EM) did not parallel this in-crease in cell loss with increasing radiation and actually decreased at doses above 5 Gy (500 rads). The discrepancy between percent cell loss and percent apoptosis was cx-plained by a proposed change in overall duration of the apoptotic process. In long-term cultures (16 h postirradia-tion), a combination of classical necrosis, classical apop-tosis, and combined apoptosis and necrosis (secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells) was apparent and was as-sociated with a marked decrease in viability. Irradiation effects on lymphocytes showing none of the morphologic features of apoptosis or classical necrosis in short-term culture were evidenced by an increase in nuclear loba-tion. The results of this study indicate that the vast majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes are radioresis-tant.

METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with nAMD, who, after three loading doses of intravitreal ranibizumab (0. 5  mg each), were re-treated for fluid seen on optical coherence tomography. After exclusion of eyes with previous treatment, follow-up less than 12  months, or missed visits, 99 patients {{were included in the}} analysis. The influence of baseline characteristics, initial VA response, and central retinal thickness (CRT) fluctuations on the VA stability from month 3 to month 24 were analyzed using subgroups and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Mean follow-up duration was 21. 3  months (range 12 - 40  months, 32 patients followed-up for ≥ 24  months). Secondary loss of VA (loss of five letters or more) after month 3 was seen in 30 patients (mean VA improvement from baseline + 5. 8 letters at month 3, mean loss from baseline - 5. 3 letters at month 12 and - 9. 7 at final visit up to month 24), while 69 patients maintained vision (mean gain + 8. 9 letters at month 3, + 10. 4 letters at month 12, and + 12. 8 letters at final visit up to month 24). Secondary loss of VA was associated with the presence of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) at baseline (p 0. 01), but not with baseline fibrosis/atrophy/hemorrhage, CRT fluctuations, or initial VA response. Chart analysis revealed additional individual explanations for the secondary loss of VA, including retinal pigment epithelial tears, progressive fibrosis, and atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue damage due to degeneration of PED, retinal pigment epithelial tears, progressive fibrosis, progressive atrophy, or massive hemorrhage, appears to be relevant in causing secondary loss of VA despite vascular endothelial growth factor suppression.

The present study examined whether training directed toward a specific basis of UFOV loss (slower speed of processing) is more effective than simple practice at increasing field size. Individuals received one or three types of training. Individuals who received variable duration training first performed the UFOV task at a pre-determined duration. Every time the individual obtained a field size of 30 degrees or greater across 2 consecutive blocks of trials, the duration of the visual display was decreased 25 milliseconds. Individuals who received force-drop training also initially performed the UFOV task at a pre-determined duration. On the third day of training, the duration of the visual display was decreased 25 milliseconds regardless of the individual’s performance. On the fifth day of training, the duration of the visual display was again decreased 25 milliseconds regardless of the individual’s performance. Individuals receiving constant training simply practiced the task at the pre-determined duration across all days of training. Consistent with past research, training improved peripheral localization performance. Further, improvement in peripheral localization performance was greatest in the distractor condition among individuals <b>receiving</b> <b>variable</b> duration training. Variable duration training may be a more effective strategy for increasing the UFOV due to its challenging nature. Specifically, since the duration of the visual display is directly linked to the individual’s own performance, motivation and interest in the training task may be maintained for a longer period of time. Further, the heightened motivation and interest may facilitate a greater degree of learning in the training setting which in turn influences the amount of training that will be retained and utilized in real-world settings...|$|E
40|$|From the 1950 s through 1989, the F Area Seepage Basins at the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{received}} {{low level}} radioactive wastes resulting from processing nuclear materials. Discharges of process wastes to the F Area Seepage Basins followed by subsequent mixing processes within the basins and eventual infiltration into the subsurface resulted in {{contamination of the}} underlying vadose zone and downgradient groundwater. For simulating contaminant behavior and subsurface transport, a quantitative understanding of the interrelated discharge-mixing-infiltration system along with the resulting chemistry of fluids entering the subsurface is needed. An example of this need emerged as the F Area Seepage Basins was selected as a key case study demonstration site for the Advanced Simulation Capability for Environmental Management (ASCEM) Program. This modeling evaluation explored {{the importance of the}} wide variability in bulk wastewater chemistry as it propagated through the basins. The results are intended to generally improve and refine the conceptualization of infiltration of chemical wastes from seepage basins <b>receiving</b> <b>variable</b> waste streams and to specifically support the ASCEM case study model for the F Area Seepage Basins. Specific goals of this work included: (1) develop a technically-based 'charge-balanced' nominal source term chemistry for water infiltrating into the subsurface during basin operations, (2) estimate the nature of short term and long term variability in infiltrating water to support scenario development for uncertainty quantification (i. e., UQ analysis), (3) identify key geochemical factors that control overall basin water chemistry and the projected variability/stability, and (4) link wastewater chemistry to the subsurface based on monitoring well data. Results from this study provide data and understanding {{that can be used in}} further modeling efforts of the F Area groundwater plume. As identified in this study, key geochemical factors affecting basin chemistry and variability included: (1) the nature or chemistry of the waste streams, (2) the open system of the basins, and (3) duration of discharge of the waste stream types. Mixing models of the archetype waste streams indicated that the overall basin system would likely remain acidic much of the time. Only an extended periods of predominantly alkaline waste discharge (e. g., > 70 % alkaline waste) would dramatically alter the average pH of wastewater entering the basins. Short term and long term variability were evaluated by performing multiple stepwise modeling runs to calculate the oscillation of bulk chemistry in the basins in response to short term variations in waste stream chemistry. Short term (1 / 2 month and 1 month) oscillations in the waste stream types only affected the chemistry in Basin 1; little variation was observed in Basin 2 and 3. As the largest basin, Basin 3 is considered the primary source to the groundwater. Modeling showed that the fluctuation in chemistry of the waste streams is not directly representative of the source term to the groundwater (i. e. Basin 3). The sequence of receiving basins and the large volume of water in Basin 3 'smooth' or nullify the short term variability in waste stream composition. As part of this study, a technically-based 'charge-balanced' nominal source term chemistry was developed for Basin 3 for a narrow range of pH (2. 7 to 3. 4). An example is also provided of how these data could be used to quantify uncertainty over the long term variations in waste stream chemistry and hence, Basin 3 chemistry...|$|E

40|$|Compressed sensing (CS) is {{very closely}} related to error {{correcting}} codes and {{can be seen as}} source coding using linear codes over real numbers. We propose CS sampling/reconstruction algorithms based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with verification decoding. Since most of the interesting applications of CS require very sparse (or compressible) signals, the natural mapping to coding implies high-rate codes. Therefore, we derive the scaling law of the density evolution (DE) [1] analysis and stopping set analysis as the code rate goes to 1. An important implication of this work is that our randomized reconstruction system allows linear-time reconstruction of strictly-sparse signals with a constant oversampling ratio. In contrast, all previous reconstruction methods with moderate reconstruction complexity have an oversampling ratio which grows logarithmically with the signal dimension. Encoding and Decoding Algorithms Based on LDPC codes with verification decoding, the encoding algorithm can be described as follows. Based on the bipartite graph structure, LDPC codes can be decoded efficiently using iterative MP algorithms. The average performance of MP decoding algorithms can be analyzed with DE or extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts [3]. In CS systems, this is called randomized (or nonuniform) reconstruction. Decoding can also be analyzed using combinatorial methods such as stopping set analysis [2] and [4]. In CS systems, this is called uniform reconstruction. Another criterion, which is between uniform reconstruction and randomized reconstruction, is what we call uniform-in-probability reconstruction. A CS system achieves uniform-in-probability reconstruction if, for any signal in the signal set, most randomly chosen measurement matrices achieve successful decoding. The analysis of this paper gives the following bounds on the decoding thresholds. In the stopping set analysis for q-SC, we can define En,j,k(α, β) as the average number of stopping sets with |T | = nα correctly <b>received</b> <b>variable</b> nodes and |U | = nβ incorrectly <b>received</b> <b>variable</b> nodes where n is the code length.
