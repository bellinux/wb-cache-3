5|$|In the 1870s, the {{municipal}} government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating {{to share the}} spoils of political office.

The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Mayor</b> of Buffalo, provided {{that the rest of}} the ticket was to his liking. When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent. He took office January 2, 1882.|$|E

5|$|In an {{arrangement}} that predates the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a District Attorney independent of the mayor's office. Dilworth had been elected to the office in 1951 but resigned in 1955 to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>mayor.</b> Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman and former assistant district attorney, was elected to fill the unexpired term. Blanc was a veteran of both World Wars who, during his time on the council, led an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. In 1957, he ran for a full four-year term, but his connection with machine politics led Clark and Dilworth to withhold their endorsement of him. The Republican nominee was Emil F. Goldhaber, a local lawyer who {{had worked in the}} state attorney general's office and in private practice. He was unopposed in the primary. The split in the Democratic leadership made the district attorney's race the liveliest of the campaign, according to Philadelphia Inquirer writer Joseph H. Miller.|$|E

5|$|Keenly {{interested}} in the well-being of citizens and affairs related {{to the development of}} the growing town, he was nominated for and eventually elected to Edmonton Town Council as an alderman in 1903, finishing first of nine candidates, with 421 votes. His term was to last two years, but was truncated by a year by Edmonton's incorporation as a city, which meant that the entire city council was elected afresh in the 1904 election. In that election he was again elected to a two-year term, finishing first of seventeen candidates, but this time resigned one year into his term in order to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>mayor</b> in the 1905 election. May's time on council included the time in which Alberta was incorporated as a province; as an alderman he voiced his support for a lavish celebration to be in Edmonton, which was to be the capital city of the new province. While sitting on council, he also voted against a proposed bylaw that would have permitted suffrage for women in civic elections; he had initially voted in favour of the law, but had later reconsidered and reversed his vote, effectively killing the bill. The vote previously had been in favour of the bill, by a margin of one vote.|$|E
