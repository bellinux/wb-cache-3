The company, {{progressive}} for its time, established a dispensary on site that was staffed five {{hours each day}} by two doctors. It also started its own insurance company about the same time. The main factory building and the associated warehouses covered another {{six and a half}} acres. The sections of the plant were joined by a company-designed trolley system used to transport parts. At the time, it manufactured steam and gasoline traction engines, mounted steel water tanks, self-lift plows, farm wagons, corn planters, traction hauling wagons, traction steam shovels, threshing machinery and all required attachments, riding and walking cultivators, single and double row stalk cutters and gasoline tractors. At its height, it called itself [...] "The Largest Tractor Company in the World" [...] and employed 2,600 men, manufacturing eight different tractors along with motor cultivators and trucks. The company offered a broad line of tractors and engines, ranging from one - <b>row</b> <b>cultivator</b> to a huge [...] tractor.|$|E
40|$|Formation of ridges during row {{cultivation}} creates microsites {{that could}} enhance spatial heterogeneity of soil properties, such as organic C, and thereby influence soil microbial communities. A {{study was conducted}} during 2003 near Shelton, NE, on a corn (Zea mays L.) field mapped using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). New ridges were built each year with a <b>row</b> <b>cultivator</b> when corn reached the V 3 –V 4 growth stage. Cultivation increased labile C fractions and soil microbial biomass in the row position for all ECa classes. Canonical discrimination analysis showed no clear differences in relative abundance of specific microbial groups among ECa classes or between row and furrow position, except for enhanced mycorrhizal biomass in the row. Microbial biomass responded strongly to changes in C redistribution, but was not accompanied by {{a significant change in}} the abundance of specific microbial groups. Labile C fractions (coarse and fine particulate organic matter) and crop residues in diverse stages of decomposition are associated with diverse microbial groups. Thus, row cultivation for weed control creates a biologically enhanced root zone that may improve early season performance of corn...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of organic}} matter {{management}} and soil loosening on the synchrony between soil N mineralization and crop N demand were studied in a field experiment. Four different levels {{of organic matter}} (OM) were applied to a crop rotation during 12 years by various applications of animal manure, straw incorporation and catch crop growing. A spring barley crop was grown to test {{the influence of the}} previous OM applications. Soil loosening with a <b>row</b> <b>cultivator</b> was carried out one, two or three times {{in the first part of}} the growth season to examine the potential for adjusting soil N mineralization by soil tillage in cropping systems with different OM input. Immediately before each of the soil loosenings and again after one, two and three weeks, plant biomass and soil were sampled from subplots. Soil receiving only mineral fertilizer without extra input of organic matter generally contained less nitrate than soil with annual supply of animal slurry, straw and catch crop material. Soil loosening raised the nitrate content compared with undisturbed soil. The maximum increase in soil nitrate after soil loosening was estimated to 27 kg NO 3 -N ha- 1 14 days after soil loosening. The soil loosening only had a minor influence on N and dry matter (DM) in the barley harvested at the same time as the soil sampling. 	The temporal pattern of both DM production and N uptake were more influenced by OM levels than by soil loosening. Barley grown on soil without extra OM input and with all N supplied with mineral fertilizer developed faster in the first part of the growth season than barley receiving part of its N input with slurry. However, the N uptake in dry matter was less affected causing higher N concentrations in DM on soil with extra annual OM inputs. At maturity, both grain DM yield and N uptake were highest at soil with the highest OM input. The soil loosening did not significantly influence barley dry matter yield but the total N uptake was slightly higher (5 kg N ha- 1) with only one soil loosening. It appears that application of OM as slurry, straw and catch crop had a pronounced influence on crop development and N availability but soil loosening did not significantly improve the synchrony between soil N mineralization and crop N demand. ...|$|E

50|$|The {{distribution}} of main workers in 2001 by different categories reveals that almost 21 percent are cultivators while another 6 percent are agricultural laborers. This is quite understandable {{in the district}} where rural population percentage is low as 37 percent.

40|$|The {{potential}} of adjusting soil N mineralization by soil tillage {{in the growing}} season was investigated in winter wheat on a coarse sandy loam. In two succeeding years, wheat was sown at 25 cm row spacing on plots where four different organic matter (OM) management strategies regarding pig slurry application, straw incorporation and catch crop growing had been applied for the previous 13 years. Soil tillage {{was carried out in}} spring with a <b>row</b> <b>cultivator,</b> a PTO-driven row rotovator or a brushweeder. Soil inorganic N content was determined in tilled and undisturbed soil during four weeks after tillage. In the first experimental year, gross nitrogen transformation rates were measured by 15 N pool dilution techniques in row rotovated soil and in undisturbed soil at two of the four OM levels. The three types of soil tillage caused higher inorganic N levels in both years with an extra 7 - 9 µg g- 1 soil in the tilled soil than in the undisturbed reference soil. The N uptake in the above-ground wheat biomass harvested in spring did not respond to tillage or to the increased inorganic N content in soil. There was no effect of tillage on N transformation as measured by 15 N pool dilution. The higher inorganic N content in disturbed soil in the field was therefore assumed to be mainly caused by reduced crop N uptake rather than an increased N mineralization. In the first year, the grain yield of the mature winter wheat was lower after row cultivation than after rotovation and brushweeding but the grain yield after soil tillage was not significantly different from the undisturbed soil. The N uptake in grain was 4 - 5 kg N ha- 1 higher after rotovation and brushweeding compared to undisturbed soil. In the second year, the grain yield was highest after brushweeding whereas {{there was no difference in}} yields between the two other tillage techniques and the undisturbed soil. Soil tillage carried out in the second year did not influence grain N uptake. The N concentration in wheat grain was unaffected by soil tillage in both years. No interactions between tillage and organic matter management were observed. Thus, in regularly ploughed soil as studied here, soil tillage in the growing season does not seem to have a potential for significantly enhancing N availability or improving synchronization between crop demand and N mineralization...|$|E

40|$|Animal-drawn {{mouldboard}} ploughs are more expedient at controlling weeds among crops grown in <b>rows</b> than <b>cultivators</b> or hand labour. In Zimbabwe many smallholder farmers own just {{one piece of}} animal-drawn equipment, a mouldboard plough. To weed their maize and cotton crops they remove the mouldboard and cultivate with just the ploughshare. It means three or four passes {{up and down the}} row, and some hand weeding between plants. That requires some 85 labour hours/hectare, compared to 132 labour hours for just hand weeding. Using a proper cultivator reduces labour requirements to 68 hours/hectare. Research by the Silsoe Research Institute in collaboration with the Department of Research and Specialist Services in Harare Zimbabwe, is showing that even less labour is required if farmers do not remove the mouldboard from their ploughs. Using the complete plough takes 55 labour hours/ hectare, as the plough passes up and down the row just once. Hand weeding is eliminated at first weeding because the action of the plough ridges up the row-crops, smothering weeds around the plants in the process. Weeding with just the plough-share has other disadvantages. Yields seem to be lower than from crops that have been hand weeded or crops weeded with a cultivator. Leaving the mouldboard on the plough brings yields up to the same level-and Gives the best return for labour. The technique is also the most efficient at retaining moisture in the soil when furrows created between the crop rows are tied.

50|$|Some tractor {{manufacturers}} produced matching {{equipment that}} could be directly mounted on the tractor. Examples included front-end loaders, belly mowers, <b>row</b> crop <b>cultivators,</b> corn pickers and corn planters. In most cases, these fixed mounts were proprietary and unique to each make of tractor, so an implement produced by John Deere, for example, could not be attached to a Minneapolis Moline tractor. Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semipermanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware. Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis. As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time. An implement generally would be mounted {{at the beginning of}} its season of use (such as tillage, planting or harvesting) and removed only when the likely use season had ended.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{computer-based}} {{signal processing}} and sensor technology to guide and control {{different types of}} agricultural field implements increases the performance of traditional implements and even {{makes it possible to}} create new ones. This thesis increases the knowledge on vision-based perception for mechatronic weed control. The contributions are of four different kinds: First, a vision-based system for row guidance of agricultural field machinery has been proposed. The system uses a novel method, based on the Hough transform, for row recognition of crop rows. Second is a proposal for a vision-based perception system to discriminate between crops and weeds, using images from real situations in the field. Most crops are cultivated in rows and sown in a defined pattern, i. e. with a constant inter-plant distance. The proposed method introduces the concept of using these geometrical properties of the scene (context) for single plant recognition and localization. A mathematical model of a crop row has been derived that models the probability for the positions of consecutive crops in a row. Based on this mathematical model two novel methods for context-based classification between crops and weeds have been developed. Furthermore, a novel method that combines geometrical features of the scene (context) and individual plant features has been proposed. The method has been evaluated in two datasets of images of sugar beet rows. The classification rate was 92 % and 98 %, respectively. The third contribution is the design of a mobile agricultural robot equipped with these perception systems and a mechanical weeding tool intended for intra-row weed control in ecologically cultivated crops. The fourth contribution is a demonstration of the feasibility of the perception systems in real field environments, especially with respect to robustness and real-time performance. The row guidance system has been implemented in three different <b>row</b> <b>cultivators</b> and performed inter-row weed control at two commercial farms. The robot has proven to be able to follow a row structure by itself, while performing weed control within the seed line of a crop row, i. e. intra-row cultivation.

5000|$|To {{the extent}} that {{cultivating}} is done commercially today (such as in truck farming), it is usually powered by tractors, especially row-crop tractors. Industrial cultivators can vary greatly in size and shape, from 10 ft to 80 ft wide. Many are equipped with hydraulic wings that fold up to make road travel easier and safer. Different types are used for preparation of fields before planting, and for the control of weeds between <b>row</b> crops. The <b>cultivator</b> may be an implement trailed after the tractor via a drawbar; mounted on the three-point hitch; or mounted on a frame beneath the tractor. Active cultivator implements are driven by a power take-off shaft. While most cultivator are considered a secondary tillage implement, active cultivators are commonly used for primary tillage in lighter soils instead of plowing. The largest versions available are about 6 m wide, and require a tractor with an excess of [...] (PTO) to drive them.|$|R
40|$|Flaming is {{a thermal}} weed control method that can kill weeds within or between crop rows using heat. Mechanical {{cultivation}} is another weed control method which undercuts weeds between crop rows to kill them. A combination flamer/cultivator implement {{was designed to}} take advantage of the good qualities of both flaming and cultivation to provide excellent organic weed control. Flaming hoods were designed in the spring of 2010 and retrofitted on an existing <b>row</b> crop <b>cultivator.</b> The hoods were tested in corn and soybean field studies in the summer of 2010. Of the seven treatments tested, a treatment of flaming combined with cultivation applied twice during a season produced the highest weed control and crop yield, while maintaining low crop injury and weed dry matter. The flaming hoods were redesigned in the spring of 2011 to be easier to manufacture. New torches were developed to replace the commercial torches previously used. A flow mixer enhanced heat transfer by reducing or eliminating film evaporation. Reducing the primary air intake decreased flame liftoff length and improved stability. The new hoods and torches were tested in the same seven field treatments during the summer of 2011. Flaming combined with cultivation twice performed best overall again, although the actual values of the performance parameters were lower than in 2010. There are several factors which may have caused worse results in 2011 than in 2010. These include changes in weed composition and density, equipment, climate, and planting date. Gas temperature measurements were conducted on three of the hood/torch configurations used in the field studies, as well as on open, unhooded torches. Thermocouple heat losses due to radiation were accounted for, and ranged from 0. 9 percent to 29. 4 percent. The hooded torches were far superior to the open torches, increasing the high-temperature region length by approximately 200 mm. The 2010 hood provided temperatures that were 36 percent higher at the hottest cross-section than the 2011 hood, but the latter performed better overall. Adviser: George Gogo...|$|R
