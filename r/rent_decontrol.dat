5000|$|<b>Rent</b> <b>decontrol,</b> 1950-51. Allen and Councilman Ed J. Davenport were {{leaders of}} a drive asking the federal {{government}} to lift wartime rent controls on rentals in the city, and when the City Council voted in favor, petitions were circulated to recall the two men. When {{the federal government}} declined to lift the controls, an [...] "explosive situation" [...] of [...] "near-riot proportions" [...] broke out in the City Council chamber, with Allen threatening to [...] "break every bone" [...] in the head of the chairman of a Tenants Council. The next year, though, after the controls had been lifted, he called for imposition of new limits unless [...] "rent gougers" [...] ceased imposing increases of 50% to 100%.|$|E

After nine ballots, Council chose Cavanagh over Laurence Decore {{to serve}} out his term, but when ran {{to retain the}} {{position}} in the 1977 election, he finished third, nearly ten thousand votes behind victor Cec Purves and under a thousand behind Decore (he did finish well ahead of former mayor Ivor Dent, however). He stayed out of politics for six years following this defeat, serving {{as chair of the}} Government of Alberta's Alberta <b>Rent</b> <b>Decontrol</b> Appeal Board (tasked with the elimination of provincial rent controls) from 1977 until 1980 and as a communications advisor for the Alberta Energy Company Ltd. from 1980 until 1984. He also rejected overtures from Neil Stanley Crawford to run for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative, commenting later that he had little interest in sitting as a backbencher after serving as mayor of Edmonton, and that Premier Peter Lougheed had not been prepared to promise him a cabinet position.|$|E
40|$|Intertenancy <b>rent</b> <b>decontrol</b> (referred to in Ontario as vacancy decontrol) {{forms the}} headstone of the Ontario rent-control system. The {{transition}} from a relatively rigid rent-control regime to intertenancy decontrol created distortions in the rental market, the most significant being {{the creation of a}} two-tier rent system with rent on decontrolled units above the rent that would have existed in the absence of controls. As an intertenancy system matures, maturation diminishes these distortions and recontrol provisions provide protection for long duration tenants. Alternative options for terminating intertenancy decontrol while retaining rent control all entail significant economic costs compared to the mature decontrol regime presently in Ontario. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{introductory}} chapter {{is to provide a}} review of the evolution of housing policy from the nineteenth century to 1979. It was during this period that present-day housing markets evolved and present-day causes for concern emerged. During the latter years of this period, owner-occupation succeeded private renting as the dominant form of housing tenure, and the number and proportion of local authority dwellings reached its peak, but housing needs were far from satisfied in each of the housing sectors. This chapter specifically examines: The Victorian origins of housing policy. The development of housing policy, 1914 – 39, emphasising rent control and decontrol in the private rented sector, the introduction of housing subsidies in the local authority sector, and the gradual expansion of owner-occupation. Post-war housing policy, 1945 – 51, focusing on the extension of rent control and the increase in subsidies to local authority housing. The ‘consensus years’, 1952 – 79, reviewing <b>rent</b> <b>decontrol</b> and the introduction of rent regulation, house-building in the local authority sector, private sector rehabilitation, housing associations, and the substantial growth of owner-occupation. Housing finance reform. The changing pattern of tenure, 1913 – 79, and its regional distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{consists}} of my job-market paper. The foreclosure rate of sub-prime mortgages increased markedly across 2003 - 2007 borrower cohorts-sub-prime mortgages originated in 2006 - 2007 were roughly {{three times more}} likely to default within three years of origination than mortgages originated in 2003 - 2004. Many have argued that this surge in sub-prime defaults represents a deterioration in sub-prime lending standards over time. I quantify the importance of an alternative hypothesis: later cohorts defaulted at higher rates in large part because house price declines left them more likely to have negative equity. Using loan-level data, I find that changing borrower and loan characteristics explain approximately 30 % of the difference in cohort default rates, with almost of all of the remaining heterogeneity across cohorts attributable to the price cycle. To account for the endogeneity of prices, I employ a nonlinear instrumental-variables approach that instruments for house price changes with long-run regional variation in house-price cyclicality. Control function results confirm that the relationship between price declines and defaults is causal and explains the majority of the disparity in cohort performance. I conclude that if 2006 borrowers had faced the same prices the average 2003 borrower did, their annual default rate would have dropped from 12 % to 5. 6 %. The second chapter is joint with David Autor and Parag Pathak. Externalities from the attributes and actions of neighborhood residents onto the value of surrounding properties and neighborhoods are central to the theory of urban economics and the development of efficient housing policy. This paper measures the capitalization of housing market externalities into residential housing values by studying the sudden and largely unanticipated 1995 elimination of stringent rent controls in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which had previously muted landlords' incentives to invest in their properties and altered the assignment of residents to locations. Pooling administrative data on the universe of assessed values and transacted prices of all Cambridge residential properties between 1988 and 2005, we find that <b>rent</b> <b>decontrol</b> genrated substantial, robust price appreciation at decontrolled units and nearby never-controlled units, accounting for an estimated 30 percent of the $ 7. 8 billion in Cambridge residential property appreciation during this period. The majority of this contribution is due to induced appreciation of never-controlled properties, while residential investments can explain only a small fraction of the total. The third chapter is joint with Denis Chetverikov and Bradley Larsen. We present a methodology for estimating the distributional effects of an endogenous treatment that varies at the group level when there are group-level unobservables, a quantile extension of Hausman and Taylor (1981). Standard quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in this setting, even if the treatment is exogenous. Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators, we derive weak conditions on the growth of the number of observations per group that are sufficient for consistency and asymptotic normality. Simulations confirm the superiority of this grouped instrumental variables quantile regression estimator to standard quantile regression. An empirical application finds that low-wage earners in the U. S. from 1990 - 2007 were significantly more affected by increased Chinese import competition than high-wage earners. We also illustrate the usefulness of the estimation approach with additional empirical examples from urban economics, labor, regulation, and empirical auctions.
