5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until <b>recurrence</b> is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of <b>recurrence</b> compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a <b>recurrence,</b> just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. <b>Recurrence</b> is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. <b>Recurrence</b> is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{general the}} {{product-type}} iterative methods utilize three-term <b>recurrences</b> {{only in its}} algorithm for accleration of convergence rate. However, computational cost of three-term <b>recurrences,</b> i. e., computation of inner products, needs large amount. Accordingly it is crucial for us to devise an efficient iterative method using partly two-term <b>recurrences</b> without degradation of convergence rate. In this paper, we propose an advanced GPBiCG AR 2 method by means of intelligent determination of two-term or three-term <b>recurrences.</b> Keywords: GPBi-CG method, GPBiCG AR method, Two-term <b>recurrences,</b> Three-term <b>recurrences,</b> advance...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} site of <b>recurrence</b> {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the {{first-line}} treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal <b>recurrence</b> has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common <b>recurrence</b> sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
5|$|Women with {{endometrial cancer}} {{should not have}} routine {{surveillance}} imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because {{it is unlikely to}} detect a <b>recurrence</b> or improve survival, and because it has its own costs and side effects. If a <b>recurrence</b> is suspected, PET/CT scanning is recommended.|$|E
5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent <b>recurrence.</b> Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} <b>recurrence.</b> These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} <b>recurrence</b> than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of <b>recurrence.</b> Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{follow-up}} examinations in cutaneous melanoma is to detect development of second melanomas or tumor <b>recurrences</b> in an early phase of development. Early detection of <b>recurrences</b> has prognostic impact for the patients. More than 80 % of all <b>recurrences</b> are primarily detected during follow-up examinations when a structured stage-adapted schedule is applied. In the majority of cases, <b>recurrences</b> are detected by physical examinations. Lymph node ultrasound enables early detection of locoregional <b>recurrences</b> before they become palpable and represents a sensitive examination method. Further imaging techniques in primary tumors are dispensable. In primary melanomas and particularly in those with a tumor thickness of less than 1 mm a reduction of the kind and frequency of technical examinations can be recommended according to recent publications. Hence the costs of follow-up examinations can be reduced clearly without increased risk for the patients. In stage III patients an intensified schedule including imaging techniques can help in increasing the early detection of <b>recurrences...</b>|$|R
