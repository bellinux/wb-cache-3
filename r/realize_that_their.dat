5|$|Though they aren't very {{enthusiastic}} {{at the idea}} of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E

Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge. The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.|$|E
25|$|The third film, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) {{opens in}} 1912 with a thirteen-year-old Indiana (River Phoenix) {{attempting}} to recover an ornamental cross belonging to Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, a task which he finally completes in 1938. Indiana {{and his friend}} Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) are assigned by American businessman Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) to find the Holy Grail. They are teamed up with Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), following on from where Indiana's estranged father Henry (Sean Connery) left off before he disappeared. It transpires that Donovan and Elsa are in league with the Nazis, who captured Henry Jones {{in order to get}} Indiana to help them find the Grail. However, Indiana recovers his father's diary filled with his research, and manages to rescue him before finding the location of the Grail. Both Donovan and Elsa fall to the temptation of the Grail, while Indiana and Henry <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> relationship with each other is more important than finding the relic.|$|E

500|$|The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter {{has been}} praised for {{teaching}} children about literature and history. [...] Theresa Tighe of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch commented that [...] "grown-ups might like Colbert's book, too, because it painlessly exposes youngsters to Shakespeare, Chaucer, Ovid, Flaubert and more." [...] In addition, Candice Nguyen of The Oakland Tribune said [...] "parents may actually appreciate this book more when they <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children are receiving subtle history lessons while they read Harry Potter books and actually enjoying it." [...] The Sunday Tasmanian noted that [...] "understanding the derivatives of language, both made up and actual {{such as the}} French, can only enrich the vocabulary of children." ...|$|E
500|$|Army {{leaders say}} having a large ground army is still {{necessary}} for deterrence and [...] "regime change" [...] operations. They also <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> equipment will be mostly modernized versions of current {{equipment for the}} rest of the decade. Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics designs had passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network. Short-term incremental upgrades will be applied to existing weapons systems to keep them from becoming obsolete, and advanced technologies available in the future will be used to build entirely new systems when funding is restored.|$|E

500|$|Jarmusch {{wrote the}} script for the film under the working title [...] "One Night in Memphis", without ever having been to the {{southern}} city. The idea for [...] "Far From Yokohama", the first segment, he took from a one-act play he had been writing before filming Down by Law (1986). The play – unrelated to Elvis or Memphis – concerned a constantly argumentative young couple, one of whom gradually comes to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> fighting is a unifying force in the relationship. The interconnected stories were inspired by Jarmusch's dwelling on literary forms, and specifically the work of Chaucer, Italian episodic films and Japanese ghost story cinema. As with his other films, Jarmusch's starting point for writing Mystery Train was the actors and characters he had foremost in mind. The great number of these collaborators contributed to it being [...] "the most complicated film to write and execute" [...] according to the director.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E
500|$|The firebombing {{campaign}} against major cities ended in June. On {{the first day}} of the month 521 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were dispatched in a daylight raid against Osaka. While en route to the city the Mustangs flew through thick clouds, and 27 of the fighters were destroyed in collisions. Nevertheless, 458 heavy bombers and 27 P-51s reached the city and the bombardment killed 3,960 Japanese and destroyed [...] of buildings. On 5June, 473 B-29s struck Kobe by day and destroyed [...] of buildings for the loss of 11 bombers. A force of 409 B-29s attacked Osaka again on 7June; during this attack [...] of buildings were burnt out and the Americans did not suffer any losses. Osaka was bombed for the fourth time in the month on 15June when 444 B-29s destroyed [...] of the city and another [...] of nearby Amagasaki; 300,000 houses were destroyed in Osaka. This attack marked the end of the first phase of XXIBomber Command's attack on Japan's cities. During May and June the bombers had destroyed much of the country's six largest cities, killing between 112,000 and 126,762 people and rendering millions homeless. The widespread destruction and high number of casualties from these raids caused many Japanese to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> country's military was no longer able to defend the home islands. American losses were low compared to Japanese casualties; 136 B-29s were downed during the campaign. In Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, Kobe, and Kawasaki, [...] "over 126,762 people were killed... and a million and a half dwellings and over [...] of urban space were destroyed."

Instead of forming a literary club, women in Galveston created a scientific club, which also focused on learning.|$|E

She sought to create a broadly inclusive collection of photographs that together suggest a vital interaction between three aspects of urban life: the diverse people of the city; the places they live, work and play; and their daily activities. It was intended to empower people by making them <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> environment was a consequence of their collective behavior (and vice versa). Moreover, she avoided the merely pretty in favor of what she described as [...] "fantastic" [...] contrasts between {{the old and the}} new, and chose her camera angles and lenses to create compositions that either stabilized a subject (if she approved of it), or destabilized it (if she scorned it).|$|E
