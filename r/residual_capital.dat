It must be recognised, however, that its profitable use by Industry is dependent upon an easily applicable and theoretically acceptable method of evaluation within corporate capital budgeting procedures. Increasingly, analysts have come to acknowledge the need to integrate corporate investment and financing decisions insofar as concerns the acquisition of industrial plant and equipment. However, traditional methods of lease evaluation fail to examine its integrative nature, and in consequence, they neglect the critical interdependencies which encompass the simultaneous decision process. Extant lease evaluation models also fail to consider the consequences of the earnings generated by the "Residual Capital Balances". That is, the working capital freed when leasing is strategically used to relax what otherwise would be an unacceptable shortage of funds. Such earnings are a fundamental part of an integrated lease cash-flow profile under certain circumstances: namely, the use of leasing as part of a "Planned Financing Mix", as opposed to its use as an emergency or "spill-over" financing when no <b>residual</b> <b>capital</b> occurs. On the basis of extensive empirical study into the circumstances under which U. K. financial management had recourse to leasing, a hypothesis was developed to explain the role of leasing in corporate financial planning and debt management. The research proceeds to establish models for the evaluation of leasing under "spill-over" conditions (where all otherwise available sources of finance are, or appear to be, exhausted) and "Planned Financing" conditions (when the use of leasing in quantitative terns is formally envisaged as part of the corporate financing policy). In this way it is possible to determine the risks implicit in the haphazard use of leasing together with the benefits available to its planned use...|$|E

40|$|Co-operative {{firms have}} been the subject of {{criticism}} by many economists, who base their arguments on property rights and agency theory: members do not control management, investments are short term, accumulated investments are below the economic optimum, etc. Nevertheless, many co-operative organisations do function well for their members. An analysis of the assumptions underlying the criticism reveals that this is not generally justified. As it focuses mainly on the functioning of capital markets, it disregards the vertically integrated character of the co-operatives, i. e. that their purpose is to counteract market failures on product markets. For many co-operatives, however, the critique is valid. Individual ownership in the form of tradable residual rights is thus motivated in many co-operatives.

The {{definitive}} version is freely available at: [URL] concerns regarding the increasing contribution of services installations to total project cost have highlighted {{the need to}} develop new methods of designing, procuring, constructing, utilising and disposing of services components. Additionally, the shift in operational focus of many industrial sectors towards short term requirements for built space to perform a particular function requires a new approach to the recovery of services components. The UK national health service is illustrative of a construction industry client whose operational need, in terms of supporting built estate, can be met with utilisation of reusable services components. The varied influences on the manner by which healthcare services are provided necessitate a short term approach to functional space provision and therefore frequency of change in the services requirements of internal space. Packaged reusable services components reduce the cost of services installation adaptation through recovery of <b>residual</b> un-depreciated <b>capital</b> and un-utilised physical life embodied in the functionally redundant components recovered from applications of short term duration. The paper concludes that reuse has been identified as valid business practice and is considered appropriate for use {{in the development of the}} readily adaptable buildings required by construction industry clients.

The reasons for {{the difference between the}} corporate market value and book value are also analyzed, and the impacts of both financial and nonfinancial perspectives on the corporate value are explored. The component items of net income are found to be more effective in explaining the value of a company than merely looking at the bottom line. It is concluded that RI and EVA have significant and similar explanatory power in terms of evaluating the performance of the information electronics industry. Moreover, a review of the nonfinancial performance of information electronics companies on the basis of segmented samples reveals significant results in terms of explaining the value of the upstream, midstream, and downstream companies.

40|$|In the Yellow River basin, China, {{ecosystems}} {{suffer from}} the overexploitation and utilization of water resources, resulting in various environmental impacts. Consideration {{must be given to}} both human and ecosystem water requirements in water resources management. A water footprint (WF) is a tool for estimating industrial, agricultural, commercial and household water requirements and for examining the impact of consumption on water resources. The study attempts to establish an approach to analyse the dynamic processes and driving forces that result in certain WFs. Using input–output tables for provinces and municipalities, we calculate water use coefficients, the total WF and the net external WF of consumption in China’s Yellow River Basin. A biproportional algorithm is employed to revise the input–output tables for analysing the temporal dynamics of the WF. The factor analysis and linear regression were used to analyse the main influencing factors of WF. Results indicate that the coefficient for water use by primary industries is highest and that coefficients for provincial water use differ significantly. Second, household consumption and <b>residuals</b> from <b>capital</b> accumulation constituted approximately half of the total WF of the Yellow River basin in 2002 and also differed significantly among provinces. Third, the ratio of the net external WF to the total WF increased, and the ratio of final consumption to the total WF declined during the period examined. Fourth, output by secondary industries correlated most strongly with the WF, followed by area under irrigation, per capita meat consumption, water consumption per 10, 000 -yuan increase in added value and population...|$|R
3000|$|We {{apply to}} the {{concrete}} setup of a bank engaged into bilateral trade portfolios the XVA theoretical framework of [...] (Albanese and Crépey 2017), whereby so-called contra-liabilities and cost of capital are charged by the bank to its clients, {{on top of the}} fair valuation of counterparty risk, in order to account for the incompleteness of this risk. The transfer of the <b>residual</b> reserve credit <b>capital</b> from shareholders to creditors at bank default results in a unilateral CVA, consistent with the regulatory requirement that capital should not diminish as an effect of the sole deterioration of the bank credit spread. Our funding cost for variation margin (FVA) is defined asymmetrically since there is no benefit in holding excess capital in the future. Capital is fungible as a source of funding for variation margin, causing a material FVA reduction. We introduce a specialist initial margin lending scheme that drastically reduces the funding cost for initial margin (MVA). Our capital valuation adjustment (KVA) is defined as a risk premium, i.e. the cost of remunerating shareholder capital at risk at some hurdle rate.|$|R

This phenomenon suggests a paradoxical revolving door of a bi-directional flow of capital, i. e. where capital enters {{the country in the}} guise of external borrowing and simultaneously slips out of the country as private capital flight. The research question addressed by this paper is whether such a financial revolving door relationship exists in Nigeria, just as previous empirical researches had established in a number of countries. The paper utilises a simultaneous equation model and three stage least square estimation technique (3 SLS), in addition to two-way Granger causality tests, to obtain statistical evidence that confirms the existence of a financial revolving door relationship between the two endogenous variables. In addition, existence of stronger causality from debt to capital flight is instrumental in showing that growing public deficit and the resulting increase in external debt is being used as a transfer mechanism for capital flight...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new way}} of measuring residual income, originally introduced by Magni (2000 a, 2000 b, 2000 c, 2001 a, 2001 b, 2003). Contrary to the standard <b>residual</b> income, the <b>capital</b> charge is equal to the capital lost by investors. The lost capital may be viewed as (a) the foregone capital, (b) the capital implicitly infused into the business, (c) the outstanding capital of a shadow project, (d) the claimholders' credit. Relations of the lost capital with book values and market values are studied, as well as relations of the lost-capital residual income with the classical standard paradigm; many appealing properties are derived, among which a property of earnings aggregation. Different concepts and results, provided by different authors in such different fields as economic theory, management accounting and corporate finance, are considered: O'Hanlon and Peasnell's (2002) unrecovered capital and Excess Value Created; Ohlson's (2005) Abnormal Earnings Growth; O'Byrne's (1997) EVA improvement; Miller and Modigliani's (1961) investment opportunities approach to valuation; Keynes's (1936) user cost; Drukarczyk and Schueler's (2000) Net Economic Income, Fernández's (2002) Created Shareholder Value, Anthony's (1975) profit. They are all conveniently reinterpreted within the theoretical domain of the lost-capital paradigm and conjoined in a unified view. The results found make this new theoretical approach a good candidate for firm valuation, incentive compensation, capital budgeting decision-making. ...|$|R

From a growth accounting approach, it describes the regional evolution of total factor productivity (TFP'), based on a private inputs production function. A stricter measure of efficiency is then quanti-fied, which is not equivalent to Solow's <b>residual,</b> since public <b>capital</b> {{is included in the}} production function and constant returns to scale are not imposed. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} measures of total factor productivity and efficiency, the study discusses the existence of technological convergence among Spanish regions and the role played in it by public capital. The renewed interest in the analysis of the process of growth reflected in economic literature in recent years has also occurred in the case of the Spanish economy, with some peculiarities which are worth mentioning. In the 1980 s, two important institutional changes took place: a profound political and administrative decentralization, the regions now being autonomous in many decisions on public expenditure, and the incorporation of Spain into the European Community, which as it is well known has a powerful regional policy. Both changes have meant that the analysis of regional economies, and especially their growth paths, have received much more attention from politicians and economists, and even from the population in general. In particular, intense discussion has taken place regardin...|$|R
