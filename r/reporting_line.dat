The NGAWW issued its first air warning on 3 February after spotters at Tufi observed Japanese aircraft heading towards Port Moresby to attack {{it for the first}} time. During the first month of operations 16 stations were established, with positions set up along the Papuan coast {{as well as in the}} mountains near Port Moresby. The control station for this group was located at Awala, while there was a rear link to company headquarters at Rouna, approximately [...] from Port Moresby. However, whilst the outer perimeter was able to provide the anti-aircraft defences at Port Moresby with approximately an hour's warning of an air raid, the system would be unable to track approaching aircraft if they changed course after crossing the <b>reporting</b> <b>line.</b> As a consequence a second, inner perimeter, was established in March, at a range of [...] from Port Moresby to provide ten minutes' warning of an attack.|$|E

40|$|Profile of a Merger: In 2009, {{the dean}} of {{libraries}} {{and the director of}} the university press at Utah State University proposed a departmental merger to their central administration. They argued that through restructuring <b>reporting</b> <b>lines</b> so that the press became a department of the library at least three important benefits could be achieved. First, the central administration was at the time hoping to cut costs by consolidating operations in various parts of the university; merging the staff <b>reporting</b> <b>lines</b> of the university press into the library offered an opportunity for consolidation. Secondly, integrating the press into the library promised it some relief from the structural vulnerability it had suffered historically as a department among “other instructional activities” reporting directly to the provost. And for the university library, to move the press into a structural collaboration would bring an established publisher of e-books into the library, representing a steady source of book-length content for the digital institutional repository that the library was consciously building. In short order, and spurred by the impacts of the Great Recession on higher education, the merger was approved...|$|R

In each, {{the head of the}} new operational model had direct contact with the firm’s CEO, and in two cases (Electrolux and Lantmännen) a direct <b>reporting</b> <b>line</b> to the top level. The importance of top-management support has been underscored by almost all change theories and practitioners (e.g., Kotter 1996) and has also been emphasized by scholars studying transformations from dynamic capabilities and ambidexterity perspectives (Tushman and O’Reilly III 1997; Birkinshaw et al. 2016). Such top-level management support is clearly visible here. Additionally, the Greenhouse has board-level support, which provides long-term development stability, a factor not so commonly identified in other studies (Alänge and Steiber 2009).|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} examine the role of presidential {{leadership}} in internationalization on historically Black college and university (HBCU) campuses. HBCUs comprise a small but important segment of U. S. higher education, as {{they are responsible for}} 20 % of African American graduates in the country. Unfortunately, many of these institutions have yet to address the urgent need to internationalize their campus in a systematic, relevant way. This research study was conducted on the campuses of three public HBCUs working to advance internationalization. This study explores answers to the following questions: (a) What {{is the role of the}} President in advancing or sustaining internationalization on an HBCU campus? (b) What is the relationship between the President and the Senior International Officer (SIO) ? and (c) What leadership frames do the Presidents use to advance or sustain comprehensive internationalization? Site visits to each institution included interviews with the President, the Provost, the SIO, and faculty. ^ Results show that the Presidents recognized their responsibility to articulate why internationalization is important for the university and how it aligns with the mission of preparing students to navigate a globally connected world. Results indicate that the Presidents impact how internationalization gets implemented through direct and indirect interaction with the SIO and by sustaining a strong infrastructure, particularly in the form of a unit responsible for internationalization initiatives. The findings indicate that while the SIO does not report directly to the President, a more effective <b>reporting</b> <b>line</b> assigns the SIO a faculty rank with a <b>reporting</b> <b>line</b> to the Provost. Analysis of the data shows that each President utilized at least one dominant leadership frames identified by Bolman and Deal (2013), two of them also exhibited a secondary frame, and none applied a multi-frame approach. With longer time at the institution, these leaders may discover the need to incorporate different leadership frames to respond to rising challenges. This study affirms the importance of presidential leadership factors in the successful implementation of internationalization on these campuses. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{provides a}} focused study on eighty-five comprehensive community colleges {{located within the}} states of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. Specifically, the study is focused upon twenty-five basic student service functions and 250 mid-level managers within four distinct student service areas. First, the focus on basic student service functions centers upon their absence or presence at the institutions. This situation is analyzed {{with regard to the}} effect of institutional headcount enrollment and <b>reporting</b> <b>lines</b> for the mid-level managers. Second, the focus on mid-level managers revolves around their perceptual differences in regard to institutional priority and their individual priority for the basic student service functions. ^ Findings of the study are presented in tables of descriptive and inferential data. The chi-square statistic was utilized to determine the statistical significance of headcount enrollment and <b>reporting</b> <b>lines.</b> The analysis of variance statistic was utilized to identify statistically significant interaction in regard to perceptual differences within the mid-level managers. ^ Conclusions of this study support the premise that headcount enrollment does influence the presence of certain student service functions while <b>reporting</b> <b>lines</b> for mid-level managers have a limited influence on the presence of basic student service functions. In addition, mid-level managers were generally in agreement about perceived institutional priority for the basic student service functions but had some significant differences in regard to what they felt the priorities should be for selected student service functions. When viewed collectively, the mid-level managers felt that all of the basic student service functions were assigned a lower priority by the institution than they thought appropriate. This was verified by utilizing the t-test statistic which yielded statistically significant differences for all of the student service functions. ^ Future research possibilities are unlimited and necessary to further understand the complexities of the management relationship and its consequences for departmental productivity and efficiency. This is particularly true when institutional and departmental priorities are potentially in conflict. ...|$|R
