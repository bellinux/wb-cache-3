5000|$|Measuring {{inflation}} {{in an economy}} requires objective means of differentiating changes in nominal prices on {{a common set of}} goods and services, and distinguishing them from those price shifts resulting from changes in value such as volume, quality, or performance. For example, if the price of a 10 oz. can of corn changes from $0.90 to $1.00 {{over the course of a}} year, with no change in quality, then this price difference represents inflation. This single price change would not, however, represent general {{inflation in}} an overall economy. To measure overall inflation, the price change of a large [...] "basket" [...] of <b>representative</b> <b>goods</b> and services is measured. This is the purpose of a price index, which is the combined price of a [...] "basket" [...] of many goods and services. The combined price is the sum of the weighted prices of items in the [...] "basket". A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the unit price of an item by the number of that item the average consumer purchases. Weighted pricing is a necessary means to measuring the impact of individual unit price changes on the economy's overall inflation. The Consumer Price Index, for example, uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer's overall spending is spent on specific goods and services, and weights the average prices of those items accordingly. Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price. To better relate price changes over time, indexes typically choose a [...] "base year" [...] price and assign it a value of 100. Index prices in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price. While comparing inflation measures for various periods one has to take into consideration the base effect as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} product {{evolution}} applies to products changing physically over time, but serving the same function, e. g., the broom and dustpan {{being replaced by}} the vacuum cleaner. A new method of price linking, the <b>representative</b> <b>good</b> approach (RGA), is proposed for measuring product evolution using historical documents. The RGA can shed light on evolutionary patterns of technological change, {{and serve as a}} check against other methods of quality measurement like conventional price linking and hedonics. Using the SEARS CATALOG, dramatically-different rates of product evolution were estimated for cameras, fans and air conditioners, gas ranges, shoes, and sofas, from 1928 to 1993. ...|$|R

40|$|Standard {{measures}} of consumer price inflation {{are based on}} a bundle of <b>representative</b> <b>goods.</b> It is well known that this approach might overstate inflation for new products and products with fast increasing quality. For this reason, hedonic adjustment methods have been proposed and introduced in official statistics for some products like personal computers. In this contribution, we consider the application of a hedonic regression to digital cameras, which have been introduced in the product bundle of the German consumer price index in 2003 – so far without hedonic quality adjustment. We present first results on hedonic price measurement for digital cameras in Germany for the time period 1999 to 2004. The results are based on data sampled from public interest journals and advertisements. [...] Hedonic regression,hedonic price index,quality adjustment...|$|E
40|$|Value {{density is}} often {{considered}} {{when considering the}} choice whether to ship cargo by air or by water. However, although cargo value is directly linked to the overall cost of shipment, it is the deciding factor in mode choice only for those cargoes with either an extremely high or extremely low value per pound. For cargo in some middle range other criteria, such as density of stowage, perishability, reliability of service, or {{the need for more}} accurate demand forecasting must be considered. The characteristics of international cargoes shipped by both modes in 1992 are examined and a logistics cost for the distribution of <b>representative</b> <b>goods</b> is calculated. A schedule of premiums is developed, which shows the transportation premium arrange of cargo value densities and stowage densities could support if transit time were reduced from the longer times associated with water transport to the shorter times found in air travel. The volume of mode-converted cargo is projected for the year 2030 and the number of aircraft required to transport the cargo is estimated. Cover titleDecember 1994 Also issued as an M.

40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{details of}} {{changes to the}} CPI basket of <b>representative</b> <b>goods</b> and services, the new CPI expenditure weights and {{an analysis of the}} main changes in weights. Summary 	We added 15 items to the CPI basket and removed 12. 	The CPI’s scope has been extended to include purchases of pets. 	Housing and household utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services had the biggest increases in weight. The weights for recreation and culture, household contents and services, communication, education, food, and alcoholic beverages and tobacco also increased. 	Increases were influenced by higher spending on restaurant meals and ready-to-eat foods, cigarettes and tobacco (due to higher prices), rent, furniture and furnishings, and insurance. 	Health had the biggest decrease in weight. The weights for clothing and footwear, and transport also decreased. 	The decrease in the relative weight for health was influenced by a refinement to our method for calculating out-patient services – to exclude more non-household income from industry income information. 	We reviewed the methods we use to calculate weights for construction of new dwellings (part of home ownership), and dwelling and contents insurance, to ensure we account for effects from the 2010 / 11 Canterbury earthquakes appropriately. No major changes were made to construction. However, we did change the method we use for dwelling and contents insurance...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a set of}} {{explicit}} functional relationships that link energy and the economy. Despite the reliance on energy permeating the whole economy, no such complete relationships had been presented before. How related are energy and the economy? What role does energy play in the economic growth? Motivated to seek an explicit functional answer, I theorize the role of energy and then test it with economic models, using data for 16 OECD countries from 1980 to 2001. First, I find that energy is a cross-country <b>representative</b> <b>good</b> whose prices are equalized when converted to a reference currency. Thus, energy prices satisfy the purchasing power parity. For all but one country, the half life of the real energy exchange rate {{is less than a}} year and as low as six months, shorter than those derived by other real exchange rate measures. Second, considering energy a cross-time <b>representative</b> <b>good,</b> I obtain that a country's utility function is inversely proportional to both its income share of energy and its energy price. I also obtain an explicit, unified two-dimensional (cross countries and time) production function with energy and non-energy as the two inputs. Third, I conclude a cross-country parity relationship for income shares of energy, similar to that for energy prices. (cont.) Further, I provide an intertemporal connection between the trajectory of the income share of energy and the productivity growth of the economy. Lastly, I demonstrate the tradeoffs between energy efficiency and economic wellbeing, with the energy price being the medium for the tradeoffs. One may apply the functional roles of energy offered in this paper to help frame the current global-scale issues that are energy relevant. by Vincent H. Chang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: Solar {{cells of}} the full {{efficiency}} spectrum of two industrial solar cell producers have been analysed. The aim was to account quantitatively for the different efficiency classes by appropriate extension of a one dimensional model, which is once developed for the special cell process. Lateral inhomogeneities influencing the cell efficiency significantly were determined and taken into account as far as possible. In the first step for each cell process a one dimensional model was developed which describes a <b>representative</b> <b>good</b> cell of this process. In the next step cells from the full efficiency spectrum of each cell producer were analysed in detail and it was attempted to integrate their properties into the model. One result {{is that in the}} majority of cases low performance is caused by more than one cell parameter. Furthermore these parameters often are laterally inhomogeneous, integration was still mostly possible by suitable averaging procedures. Which parameters are laterally inhomogeneous was found to depend on the starting material {{as well as on the}} specific production process...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{establish}} the personal income distribution from the elementary constituents of a free market; products of a <b>representative</b> <b>good</b> and agents forming the economic network. The economy is treated as a self-organized system. Based {{on the idea that}} the dynamics of an economy is governed by slow modes, the model suggests that for short time intervals a fixed ratio of total labour income (capital income) to net income exists (Cobb-Douglas relation). Explicitly derived is Gibrat’s law from an evolutionary market dynamics of short term fluctuations. The total private income distribution is shown to consist of four main parts. From capital income of private firms the income distribution contains a lognormal distribution for small and a Pareto tail for large incomes. Labour income contributes an exponential distribution. Also included is the income from a social insurance system, approximated by a Gaussian peak. The evolutionary model is able to reproduce the stylized facts of the income distribution, shown by a comparison with empirical data of a high resolution income distribution. The theory suggests that in a free market competition between products is ultimately the origin of the uneven income distribution. ...|$|R
