40|$|Pathogen {{attack and}} {{herbivore}} infestation {{have a major}} impact on plant health. In a model study, these two plant health issues were simulated to study whether plant health can be monitored at greenhouse scale through the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in greenhouse atmosphere. To simulate pathogen attack and herbivore infestation, we repeatedly stroked the stems of tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) and repeatedly <b>removed</b> their <b>side</b> <b>shoots.</b> In addition, we studied the effect of fruit picking on the concentration of plant-emitted VOCs in greenhouse atmosphere. Analysis of air samples obtained before these treatments revealed up to 17 VOCs that are known to be released from tomato plants, of which the most dominant one was the monoterpene ß-phellandrene. When plants were 7 weeks old, the concentration of this VOC was approximately 0. 06 ppbv before treatment. When plants were 12 weeks old, this concentration was raised to approximately 0. 14 ppbv. Stroking of the stems, <b>removing</b> the <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> and fruit picking resulted in an increase in the concentrations of all mono- and most sesquiterpenes up to 60 -fold, which was expected because these VOCs are well-known constituents of trichomes. The treatments did not result in substantially increased concentrations of the stress-related compounds ¿-copaene, methyl salicylate and (E,E) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyl- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tridecatetraene. In contrast to stroking and fruit picking, shoot removal resulted in the emission of the lipoxygenase-derived product (Z) - 3 -hexenol in greenhouse atmosphere expressing cell membrane degradation. The findings presented in this paper focus on the feasibility of monitoring plant health through the analysis of VOCs in greenhouse air, but findings might also be relevant for atmospheric chemistry...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods for}} restricting plant height (CCC {{application}} and excision {{of the main}} shoot apex) were applied to okra cv. ‘Boyiatiou’ {{with the aim of}} assisting crop management and optimizing yield. Apex excision 26 or 40 days after transplantation (DAT) effectively restricted plant height, but either had no effect (40 DAT) or reduced the number of <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> per plant (26 DAT). Moreover, although the length of <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> increased after apex excision, the number of nodes per <b>side</b> <b>shoot</b> was not affected. Hence pod number and weight was less than in the control (untreated). CCC application (500 and 2000 ppm) reduced plant height due to a reduction in internode length; however, when applied at the time of transplantation (0 DAT) (both concentrations) or 26 DAT (2000 ppm) it also caused a reduction in node number on the main stem. CCC did not affect the number of <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> or the number of nodes per <b>shoot,</b> and <b>side</b> <b>shoot</b> length decreased due to shorter internode lengths. The number and weight of pods per plant was reduced by 2000 ppm CCC irrespective of the time of application, but was not affected by 500 ppm CCC at 0 DAT (pod number) or 40 DAT (pod weight and number). We conclude that the application of 500 ppm CCC at 40 DAT may aid okra cultivation since it reduces overall plant size (height and diameter) without adversely affecting yield, and may thus assist crop management (e. g. easier hand-harvesting) and permit an increase in plant density...|$|R

40|$|The name {{broccoli}} comes mainly {{due to its}} appearance: broccoli {{comes from}} the Latin Brachium, which means strong arm or branch. Broccoli itself has lots of arms or branches that grow from the main stem. Broccoli doesn’t {{have a long history}} in Romania, it’s cultivated on small parcels by small gardeners for their own consumption and the broccoli that we find in supermarkets are mostly imported from other countries and it’s quite expensive. Broccoli is very good against cancer and in Romania cancer rate is growing every year that’s why people should start eating broccoli. It’s also a good source of vitamins (A, B 2, C) also calcium, potassium. Romania also has a temperate climate that is recommended for broccoli growing. We can grow it in early spring, spring and autumn. That’s why we tried in our research to find the best way to produce broccoli. We tested three hybrids: Fiesta F 1, Marathon F 1 and Belstar F 1, also different densities and different ways to set the crop in the field (with two rows or three rows). After we cut the main broccoli sprouts, secondary sprouts (also called <b>side</b> <b>shoots)</b> will start developing. <b>Side</b> <b>shoots</b> will vary in size and weight, depending on the hybrid but as general information, <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> are smaller than main broccoli heads.

30|$|There {{have been}} many studies on glass {{particle}} contamination from glass ampules during the injection of glass ampules, but only the contamination from direct IV bolus injection has been measured. This research aimed to study the difference in glass particle contamination from ampules with different intravenous administration methods commonly used in clinical practice. Four methods were studied: IV bolus injection directly after immediate aspiration, IV bolus injection directly after 2  min’ delayed aspiration, IV bolus injection directly after aspiration with a filter needle, and <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> to an infusion set with an in-line filter. 45 ampules per method {{for a total of}} 180 ampules were used. The number and length of glass particles were measured using a slide scanner. Aspiration was performed without specifically using a slow aspiration method. The longest glass particle was observed in the immediate aspiration group. The <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> group showed the lowest maximum number of glass particles per ampule. The <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> group also showed the smallest number of glass particles, but it was statistically insignificant. Using a filter needle syringe and 2  min’ delayed aspiration, which are frequently recommended to minimize contamination, may not be as effective as commonly believed, unless combined with a slow and low pressure aspiration method. Using a <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> to an infusion set with an in-line filter may minimize glass particle contamination from ampules even without a slow and low pressure aspiration method, but more evidence from a larger study is needed.|$|R

30|$|Prior studies used a {{microscope}} to measure glass particles in a slide or a paper sampled from a syringe aspirated from opened glass ampules. These studies estimated glass particles {{introduced into the}} body when a single dose of a glass ampule is injected directly. However, there are other commonly used methods to inject drugs into the vein, such as direct IV bolus injection, <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> into the Y-shape injection port of the infusion set with in-line filter, and infusion after mixing the drug with other IV solutions, as well as using an intermittent infusion device such as injection adapter caps. For inpatients, <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> using a Y-shape infusion set or infusion after mixing the drug with other IV solution is more frequently used than direct IV bolus injection. Y-shape infusion sets for <b>side</b> <b>shooting</b> commonly contain a 15  µm filter {{at the end of}} the set, but filters of various sizes are used in different hospitals and departments.

50|$|Wisteria flowers {{develop in}} buds {{near the base}} of the {{previous}} year's growth, so pruning back <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> to the basal few buds in early spring can enhance the visibility of the flowers. If it is desired to control the size of the plant, the <b>side</b> <b>shoots</b> can be shortened to between 20 and 40 cm long in midsummer, and back to 10 to 20 cm in the fall. Once the plant is a few years old, a relatively compact, free-flowering form can be achieved by pruning off the new tendrils three times during the growing season; in June, July and August, for the northern hemisphere. The flowers of some varieties are edible, and can even be used to make wine. Others are said to be toxic. Careful identification by an expert is strongly recommended before consuming this or any wild plant.|$|R
