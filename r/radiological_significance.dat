40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} reproducibility {{and clinical}} relevance of quantitative EEG parameters in ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Methods EEG {{was recorded in}} 31 patients suffering from subacute ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Ten age-matched control subjects were included as a reference group. Intra-recording, intrarater and interrater reproducibility was calculated for standard EEG measures and for a pair wise derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI). Correlations between EEG parameters, clinical status and volume of ischemia on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were calculated. Results pdBSI was sensitive to asymmetry in the amplitude and frequency domain in a random white noise model and in a simulated sinusoidal model. Minimal Cronbach alpha for intra-recording, intra- and inter-rater reproducibility ranged between 0. 95 and 0. 99 for standard spectral parameters and between 0. 96 and 0. 99 for pdBSI. We found {{a significant difference in}} pdBSI between stroke patients and control or TIA (p = 0. 0003). pdBSI correlated significantly with NIH stroke scale at admission and DWI volume across different levels of stroke probability (Spearman’s ρ = 0. 64 – 0. 70 and 0. 79 – 0. 84, respectively, p < 0. 00001 for both). Conclusions pdBSI displays high multilevel reproducibility and reliably discriminates between stroke and TIA patients or control subjects, and correlates significantly with clinical and <b>radiological</b> status. <b>Significance</b> Based on this methodological analysis, reliable EEG parameters can be evaluated in a general stroke population for clinically relevant state and outcome measures. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of volatile alkyl iodides other than methyl iodide during a serious nuclear reactor accident may have <b>radiological</b> <b>significance.</b> The hypothesis that radioactive alkyl iodides, other than methyl iodide, could form from paint solvents under {{the conditions of}} a serious nuclear accident in light water reactors (under boiling water reactor (BWR) and pressurised water reactor (PWR) conditions) was tested using stable elemental iodine, a gamma irradiator and gas chromatography equipment. It was found that methyl and isopropyl iodides were formed from the texanol ester, which is used in many modern water-based paints. Methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl iodides were formed from a hydrocarbon solvent (white spirit) commonly used in paint products used in the past. These results suggest that further work on the formation and behaviour of the higher alkyl iodides (containing more than one carbon atom) under the conditions of a serious nuclear accident is justified...|$|E

Some processes and situations cause a local increase of both radionu-clides ’ concentrations of up to 10 – 100 times the normal levels. Due to the additional irradiation doses to the population, 210 Pb has <b>radiological</b> <b>significance.</b> Taking into account these reported levels, we estimate a minimum required sample volume of 300 – 500 m 3. We apply 2 aerosol samplers (TF 1 A- 2 and Staplex Inc.) coupled with a 4 ″ diameter filter (synthetic Petrianov fabric) for the sites at Zhovty Wody and Dneprodzerzhinsk, both in the Dnipropetrovs’k region, as well as background sam-ples from Kiev. Sample destruction allows one to prepare and measure LS total beta spectra with observed 210 Pb betas. The total beta spectra present varying combinations of beta components that require complicated analyses. We tested and applied beta-spectra decomposition to separate the 210 Pb beta peak for calculating corresponding activities...|$|E
40|$|This study employs thermal and {{epithermal neutron}} {{activation}} analysis (NAA) to quantitatively and specifically determine absorption dose rates to various body parts from uranium, thorium and potassium. Specifically, {{a case study of}} bauxite residue (red mud) from an industrial facility was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the NAA approach for radiological safety assessment, using small sample sizes to ascertain the activities of (235) U, (238) U, (232) Th and (40) K. This proof-of-concept was shown to produce reliable results and a similar approach could be used for quantitative assessment of other samples with possible <b>radiological</b> <b>significance.</b> (238) U and (232) Th were determined by epithermal and thermal {{neutron activation analysis}}, respectively. (235) U was determined based on the known isotopic ratio of (238) U/(235) U. (40) K was also determined using epithermal neutron activation analysis to measure total potassium content and then subtracting its isotopic contribution. Furthermore, the work demonstrates the application of Monte Carlo Neutral-Particle (MCNP) simulations to estimate the radiation dose from large quantities of red mud, to assure the safety of humans and the surrounding environment. Phantoms were employed to observe the dose distribution throughout the human body demonstrating radiation effects on each individual organ. status: publishe...|$|E

A literature study rounds up the information on anthropogenic sources containing natural radioactivity and thus representing a radiation source generally to be considered for assessments. Some of these sources are discussed in more detail, indicating their <b>radiological</b> <b>significance</b> for the population and the environment in Bavaria.

Also, 238 U has {{affinity}} for electron donor (e.g. oxygen) and therefore deposits {{itself in the}} tissues of the lung and lining on the bones marrows {{which can lead to}} cancer of the blood (leukemia). 232 Th which is also an alpha particle emitter settles in the lining of the bones which can lead to bone cancer (Cember and Johnson 2009). Although 40 K is not considered to be of <b>radiological</b> <b>significance,</b> the body’s control system of blood pressure and volume is dependent on the activity concentration of potassium in the body and an abnormality in the control of this activity concentration level in the body by the body system presents a general potential for High Blood Pressure and subsequent cancer induction with a lifetime cancer Mortality Risk of 0 814 Bq- 1 for ingestion (ANL 2005). However, {{studies have shown that the}} total amount of potassium in the human body is maintained constant at a fixed body mass. The activity concentration of K- 40 in potassium in plants extracts and raws is not different from those in foods or in the human body. Intake of additional potassium through food intake simply results in a reduction in the biological half-life of potassium in the body and resultantly no increase in the dose from K- 40. This implies that potassium is homeostatic within the body (Tahir and Alaamer 2008); (Tahir et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} air {{contamination}} in a Nuclear Medicine Center (NMC) {{provided with a}} cyclotron {{for the production of}} radiopharmaceuticals is based on an automatic systems for air sampling and measurements. An important control for the assessment of dose to the population is aimed at the measurement of air concentration of stack release and inside the cyclotron vault during irradiation. The frequency of sampling can be setup as continuous with respect to the stack effluent release and cyclic for other work environments. The gamma-ray spectrometric measurement are made on-line and for a short time by using a shielded Marinelli beaker filled with sampled air and a gamma detector. The use of this system allow us to have very numerous air concentration data and a software for the analysis is needed. In this work is presented the analysis of the main data recorded in “San Gaetano” NMC at Bagheria (Italy) and are highlighted some anomalous events that have been happened some years ago. An evaluation with a common Gaussian Plume air dispersion modelling code allow us to verify the no <b>radiological</b> <b>significance</b> of the stack effluent releases in terms of potential dose to population reference group, sited more than 100 m away from the plant.

Therefore, a baseline study of natural (238 U, 210 Pb, 226 Ra, 232 Th, 228 Ra, 228 Th, 40 K) and anthropogenic (137 Cs) radionuclides {{was carried out}} on Tema Harbour (Greater Accra, Ghana) surface sediments and on their <b>radiological</b> <b>significance.</b> Grab surface sediment samples were collected from 21 stations within the Tema Harbour and their radioactivity concentrations measured by gamma spectrometry. The mean sediment radioactivity concentrations (Bq kg− 1 dw) were 34 for 238 U, 210 for 210 Pb, 14 for 226 Ra, 30 for 232 Th, 29 for 228 Ra, 31 for 228 Th, 320 for 40 K, and 1. 5 for 137 Cs. Large 238 U/ 226 Ra disequilibria were observed in the harbour sediments and a complex dynamics of several mixed sources of sediments within the Tema Harbour can be inferred from the spatial variations in the radioactivity concentrations. The estimated total absorbed dose rate in air (D), radium equivalent activity (Raeq), external hazard index (Hex), annual gonadal dose equivalent (AGDE) and annual effective dose equivalent (AEDE) indicated no significant radiological risks from the sediment radioactivity concentrations. Application of the Environmental Risk from Ionising Contaminants Assessment and Management tool (ERICA) confirmed that the potential dose rates to biota from the sediment radioactivity concentrations are unlikely to pose appreciable ecological risks. The radioactivity levels are compared with levels reported in sediments from other coastal areas of the world...|$|E
