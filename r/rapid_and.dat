5|$|A turn-of-the-20th-century {{apartment}} construction boom {{allowed the}} expansion of Chicago's African American ghetto southward, and the original inhabitants mostly left the area. The transition was <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> marked with conflicts such as the Race Riot of 1919. Some white Protestants left to form an exclusive residential community in the South Shore community area. In 1906 they formed the South Shore Country Club, which excluded Blacks and Jews from membership.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in late 1917, the Western Front {{fell into}} its usual lull {{over the winter}} months. In early 1918, it became {{apparent}} to the Allies that a large German offensive was pending. This Spring Offensive commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German armies striking hard near the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British Fifth Army, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a staggering blow, it began a <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> at times panicked withdrawal. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened.|$|E
5|$|Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands {{decided that}} the only way in which reform could be {{provoked}} would be by <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> uncompromising enforcement.

5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> {{sustained}} decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively <b>rapid,</b> <b>and</b> bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|Development {{within the}} Albert Dock was <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> the newly renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready {{in time for}} the 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race. The race was a big success for the city with over one million {{visitors}} into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to Granada Television.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} of <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> {{successful}} campaigns starting in 262, he crossed the Euphrates and recovered Carrhae and Nisibis. He then took the offensive to the heartland of Persia, and arrived at the walls of its capital Ctesiphon. The city withstood the short siege but Odaenathus reclaimed the entirety of Roman lands occupied by the Persians {{since the beginning of}} their invasions in 252. Odaenathus celebrated his victories and declared himself King of Kings, crowning his son Hairan I as co-king. By 263, Odaenathus was in effective control of the Levant, Mesopotamia and Anatolia's eastern region.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E
5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front {{and his ability to}} inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E

5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} has {{undergone}} {{one of the}} most <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> wide reaching natural expansions of any bird species. It was originally native to parts of Southern Spain and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa and humid tropical and subtropical Asia. In the end of the 19th century it began expanding its range into southern Africa, first breeding in the Cape Province in 1908. Cattle egrets were first sighted in the Americas on the boundary of Guiana and Suriname in 1877, having apparently flown across the Atlantic Ocean. It was not until the 1930s that the species is thought to have become established in that area.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce <b>rapid</b> <b>and</b> uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E
