Newsround praised the song by saying [...] " [...] sounds <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> – {{making the most}} of her soulful R voice and hitting all the (incredibly) high notes on this Eastern-themed piece of pop!" [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote that, [...] "The Hindi original, which soundtracks the Bollywood dance routine {{at the end of the}} movie, is far more urgent and atmospheric, but this remake works nicely enough as a slick, shamelessly opportunistic PCD single.

40|$|Sahiba Sisters Foundation, {{an activist}} {{organization}} foremost preoccupied with Muslim women's realities, {{was invited to}} participate in the <b>Rights</b> <b>at</b> <b>Home</b> Project in early 2002. Initially there was a level of apprehension about working with an institution that was primarily an academic institution, with academics who mastered theories but may not have hands on experience with complex situations on the ground. Also worrisome was the prospect of putting too much energy in empirical issues and methodological frameworks rather than on developing flexible responses to the needs of people on the ground. But the idea of working towards societal transformation using local knowledge and capacities was attractive to Sahiba. Indeed the <b>Rights</b> <b>at</b> <b>Home</b> approach filled a gap in local advocacy strategies since it went beyond idealistic notions of social justice and <b>rights.</b> Rather, <b>Rights</b> <b>at</b> <b>Home</b> promised to demystify and authenticate juridical positions and interpretations that were impacting the Islamic community in the area of family relations...|$|R

500|$|Bryan Enk, {{writing for}} UGO, {{states that the}} myth-making story of Söze's origins is a classic ghost story that would be <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in horror fiction. Writing about psychopaths in film, {{academic}} Wayne Wilson explicitly compares Söze to Satan and assigns to him demonic motives. Wilson states that Söze allows himself to be caught just to prove his superiority over the police; this compromises his ultimate goal of anonymity, but Söze can not {{resist the urge to}} show off and create mischief. In The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Lewis Call states that Söze's mythological status draws the ire of the authoritarian government agents because he [...] "represents a terrifying truth: that power is ephemeral, and has no basis in reality." [...] According to Call, Söze's intermediaries – the [...] "usual suspects" [...] themselves – are more useful to the police, as they represent an easily controlled and intimidated criminal underworld, in direct contrast to Söze himself.|$|E
500|$|Wasteland Angel {{received}} average reviews upon release, garnering {{a rating}} of 55% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Gamers Daily News' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level, stating, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I squealed with delight when I {{got to see the}} carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes." [...] Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine {{did not appear to be}} designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as [...] "more than a little jarring." [...] While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, [...] "Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they feel <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with the frantic, arcade-style action." [...] Ultimately, Huinker did not recommend the game, but Lindsey called it [...] "the most fun game that I have played this year".|$|E

Likewise, Bernard Zuel The Sydney Morning Herald cited [...] "Suga Mama" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "good moments" [...] on B'Day, writing: [...] "... followed by a dud ... the slinky funk of 'Suga Mama' is trodden on by the mechanical 'Upgrade U' and then trampled by the posturing and eventually annoying 'Ring the Alarm'". Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that Rich Harrison [...] "delivers again with 'Suga Mama', twisting a vintage Soul Searchers sample into a gritty, loping groove. Beyonce sounds <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> on this one ... And while it doesn't quite eclipse 'Crazy in Love', it's still B'Days finest moment."

Her voice projects an appealing innocence [...] 'But Beautiful' and 'Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye'". Rating it {{four out of five}} stars, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy complimented the vocal mix on the album, adding that [...] "Cheek to Cheek may not be the glittering spectacle we've come to expect from Lady Gaga, but with Tony Bennett's guidance the pair have delivered an authentic and solid jazz record that respects the genre's generous history. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars and praised Gaga's vocals. Dolan felt the album [...] "proves she can be a sophisticated lady". Charles J. Gan from Associated Press also praised Bennett and Gaga's singing, writing that [...] "Had she been born in an earlier era, Gaga would have been <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in an MGM musical". Idolator's Bianca Gracie described the album as [...] "a refreshing listen that highlights the undeniable talent of both Bennett and Gaga and how well they work together". Writing for the National Post, Mike Doherty observed that Gaga took [...] "liberties with the beat, bends notes, purrs and whoops away" [...] with the vocals, while Bennett was able to complement with his characteristic [...] "dapper approach".|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street.

He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really made me feel like [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is that if you want to put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E
