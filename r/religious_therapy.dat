This study examined the use of CAM and beliefs about CAM as expressed by patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Taiwan. Methods TBI patients and their accompanying relatives were interviewed by using a structured questionnaire at an outpatient clinic in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Results A total of 101 patients with TBI participated in the study. Sixty-four (63 %) patients had used at least one form of CAM after sustaining TBI. CAM users had used an average of 2. 72 forms of CAM after sustaining TBI. The most frequently used CAM category was traditional Chinese medicine (37; 57. 8 %), followed by folk and <b>religious</b> <b>therapies</b> (30; 46. 9 %), and dietary supplements (30; 46. 9 %). The majority of the patients (45; 70. 3 %) did not report CAM use because they felt it was unnecessary to do so. Patients who used CAM had a significantly stronger positive belief in CAM {{than those who did}} not (t = − 2. 72; P =. 008). After using CAM, most of the patients (54; 85 %) perceived moderate satisfaction (2. 89 ± 0. 44), according to a 4 -point Likert scale. Conclusion Although the use of CAM is common for TBI patients receiving conventional medical health care in Taiwan, most patients did not inform health care personnel about their CAM use. TBI patients perceive combined use of CAM and conventional medicine as beneficial for their overall health. </p...|$|R

The main targets was to describe and study the different methods that are being used in the treatment, including vocational training, encounter groups and <b>religious</b> <b>therapy,</b> and by this see how the rehabilitation program worked. The treatment programme is compared with current rehabilitation programs in Norway. Methods: I worked four months at the programme as a volunteer, participating in the daily life of the programme. By this I collected qualitative data by the use of participant observation. Results: The programme included only males, aged from 15 - 45 years old, most of whom had either used alcohol, marihuana or cocaine only, or a combination of these. The treatment was intended to last for 4 months. Many clients quit the program before planned. There was no systematic follow up of the clients after discharge. The use of previous drug addicts as staff had both positive and negative aspects. The mandatory <b>religious</b> <b>therapy</b> was strongly rejected by some of the clients. Conclusion: The programme is a low budget rehabilitation program in a third world country. It is probable that this dictates the way the programme is run. Most of the methods used are still practised in Norwegian rehabilitation programs. The strong religious aspect is not suitable for everyone, and the clients need to be informed about this upon admission...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Infertility {{patients}} are a vulnerable group that often seeks a non-medical solution for {{their failure to}} conceive. World-wide, women use CAM for productive health, but {{only a limited number}} of studies report on CAM use to enhance fertility. Little is known about traditional and <b>religious</b> forms of <b>therapies</b> that are used in relation to conventional medicine in Turkey. We investigated the prevalence and types of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) used by infertile Turkish women for fertility enhancement. Methods A face-to-face questionnaire inquiring demographic information and types of CAM used for fertility enhancement were completed by hundred infertility patients admitted to a primary care family planning centre in Van, Turkey between January and July 2009. Results The vast majority of infertile women had used CAM at least once for infertility. CAM use included religious interventions, herbal products and recommendations of traditional "hodja's" (faith healers). Of these women, 87. 8 % were abused in the last 12 months, 36. 6 % felt not being supported by her partner and 80. 5 % had never spoken with a physician about CAM. Conclusions Infertile Turkish women use complementary medicine frequently for fertility enhancement and are in need of information about CAM. <b>Religious</b> and traditional <b>therapies</b> are used as an adjunct to, rather than a substitute for, conventional medical therapy. Physicians need to approach fertility patients with sensitivity and should be able to council their patients about CAM accordingly. </p...|$|R

40|$|Conversion {{disorder}} {{remains a}} mystery that has only become more complicated with {{the decline of the}} scientific status of psychoanalysis (e. g., Piper, Lillevik, & Kritzer, 2008; Rofé, 2008) and recent neurological findings suggest that this behavior is controlled by biological mechanisms (van Beilen, Vogt, & Leenders, 2010). Moreover, existing theories have difficulty explaining the efficacy of various interventions, such as psychoanalysis, behavior therapy, drug therapy and <b>religious</b> <b>therapy.</b> This article reviews research and clinical evidence pertaining to both the development and treatment of conversion disorder and shows that this seemingly incompatible evidence can be integrated within a new theory, the Rational-Choice Theory of Neurosis (RCTN; Rofé, 2010).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the experience of aphasia in Khayelitsha, a township on the outskirts of Cape Town characterised by poverty, violence, limited resources and a culture and language that differs from the setting of most speech and language services in South Africa. It is based on three years of intermittent fieldwork that entailed participant observation of the everyday life of five adults living with aphasia and interviews with participants, kin and healthcare workers in various settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, this thesis has aimed to provide an ethnographic account of cultural frameworks of interpretation of communication impairment following stroke and of the daily reality of life for adults living with aphasia in this setting. An exploration of causal notions in this setting provided interesting commentary on social and cultural processes and how people, caught up in these processes, search for meaning and for cure. Participants entertained plural notions of causation of aphasia and explored numerous therapeutic avenues. The wide variation in causal notions included biomedical causes, social and behavioural determinants, and the influences of supernatural powers, such as witches and ancestors. Similarly participants experienced aphasia through multiple healing systems, including traditional, biomedical and <b>religious</b> <b>therapy</b> options. All however seemed to be ambiguous sources of help. Whilst encounters with the health system presented serious challenges to participants, traditional and religious avenues for help were obscured by a burgeoning and not always ethical open market offering miracle cures. An articulation of the circumstances of this group of adults provided further commentary on the influence of the social context on aphasia. In a context where sociopolitical processes have had a disintegrating effect on social cohesion, questions of support, care and security were of primary concern. Prejudices towards the elderly and women were more acutely felt and vulnerability, isolation, insecurity and fluidity of circumstance emerged as overarching themes. The central argument in this thesis is that the genesis of these experiences can be found in contextual factors in Khayelitsha, such as poverty, inequality, urbanisation and changing cultural paradigms. These emerging themes highlight the disjunctions between the medical alignment of the discipline of speech language therapy in South Africa and the capacity for socially-engaged practice. They also highlight the socio-cultural complexity of the experience of aphasia, specifically the influences of culture and poverty. There is thus theoretical and clinical relevance in using anthropological objectives to explore the world of the adult living with aphasia and the interface between context and service provision. Interventions and healthcare communications that will make a meaningful difference to adults with aphasia in a setting such as Khayelitsha are proposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} text is an ethnography of {{the therapeutic}} itineraries {{of people with}} HIV/Aids. The {{goal is to make}} an approximation of the relationship between health/illness and religion, from the assessment of therapeutic constructed and experienced. The idea that guides the study is that, although biomedicine holds the legitimate monopoly of therapeutic solutions, it does not constitute a single reference for thinking about them. Therefore, assuming the existence of numerous therapies, the objective is to map the joints that are established between the biomedical and religious solutions in context of the epidemic. The ethnography at the Centro de Referência e Treinamento in STD/Aids in São Paulo – a center that serves HIV-infected patients – has shown complex itineraries in which the subjects use a range of therapies and blend biomedical treatments and <b>religious</b> <b>therapies.</b> The ethnographic enterprise tried to follow these paths and verify how these people represent, articulate and experience these therapies. For the patients from this study, the relationship announced between the categories of disease and treatment does not separate the religious and biomedical therapies: instead, it was observed a continuum between the two healing practices. And those who circulate among them by promoting the articulation of their symbols make them in their therapeutic itinerary always suitable for further transformation. O texto que se segue é uma etnografia dos itinerários terapêuticos de pessoas com HIV/Aids. O objetivo é efetuar uma aproximação das relações entre saúde/doença e religião a partir da apreciação desses itinerários construídos e experienciados. A idéia que norteará o estudo é a de que, embora a biomedicina detenha o monopólio legitimado das soluções curativas referentes às questões de enfermidade, ela não se constitui como referência única para pensá-las. Por isso, admitindo a existência de numerosas terapias, intenta-se aqui mapear as articulações que se estabelecem entre as soluções biomédicas e religiosas no contexto da epidemia. A etnografia realizada no Centro de Referência em DST/Aids da cidade de São Paulo – centro que atende pacientes soropositivos – permitiu verificar itinerários complexos nas quais os sujeitos recorrem a diversas terapias e mesclam os tratamentos biomédicos oficiais a terapias religiosas. O empreendimento etnográfico procurou seguir essas trajetórias e verificar como essas pessoas representam, articulam e vivenciam essas terapias. Pondero que na acepção dos soropositivos ouvidos, a relação que se anuncia entre as categorias da doença e tratamento não separa a terapia biomédica da religiosa: ao invés disso, foi possível observar um continuum entre as duas práticas curativas. E aqueles que por elas circulam promovem a articulação dos universos simbólicos de cada qual, compondo-os em seu itinerário terapêutico sempre passível de transformação. TED...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Analisar intervenções religiosas emergentes para recuperação da dependência de drogas. PROCEDIMENTOS METODOLÓGICOS: Estudo qualitativo exploratório realizado em São Paulo, SP, em 2004 e 2005. Foram conduzidas 85 entrevistas em profundidade com ex-usuários de drogas que haviam utilizado recursos religiosos não-médicos para tratar a dependência de drogas e estavam abstinentes há pelo menos seis meses. Os grupos religiosos analisados foram católicos, evangélicos e espíritas. As entrevistas continham questões sobre dados sociodemográficos, religiosidade do entrevistado, história do consumo de drogas, tratamentos médicos para dependência de drogas, tratamento religioso e prevenção ao consumo de drogas pela religião. ANÁLISE DOS RESULTADOS: Houve diferenças no suporte ao dependente de drogas em cada grupo. Os evangélicos foram os que mais utilizaram a religião como forma exclusiva de tratamento, apresentando repulsa ao papel do médico e a qualquer tipo de tratamento farmacológico. Os espíritas foram os que buscaram mais apoio terapêutico à dependência de álcool, simultaneamente ao tratamento convencional, justificado pelo maior poder aquisitivo. Os católicos utilizaram mais a terapêutica religiosa exclusiva, mas relataram menos repulsa a um possível tratamento médico. A importância dada à oração como método ansiolítico era comum entre os três tratamentos. A confissão e o perdão - por meio da conversão (fé) ou das penitências, respectivamente para evangélicos e católicos - exercem apelo à reestruturação da vida e aumento da auto-estima. CONCLUSÕES: Segundo os entrevistados, o que os manteve na abstinência do consumo de drogas foi mais do que a fé religiosa. Contribuíram para isso o suporte, a pressão positiva e o acolhimento recebido no grupo, e a oferta de reestruturação da vida com o apoio incondicional dos líderes religiosos. OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} role of {{emerging}} religious interventions in the recovery from drug addiction. METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES: An exploratory qualitative study {{carried out in the}} city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, in 2004 and 2005. In-depth interviews were held with 85 former drug users who had turned to non-medical religious resources for the treatment of their drug addiction and who were free from drugs for at least six months. The religious groups included in the analysis were Catholics, Evangelicals and Spiritualists. The interviews contained questions relating to sociodemographic data, the religiosity of the interviewee, his or her history of drug consumption, medical treatment for drug addiction, religious treatment and prevention of drug consumption through religion. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS: There were differences between the religious groups {{in the way that the}} drug addict was supported. The group that most used religion as an exclusive form of treatment was the Evangelicals, who rejected the intervention of a doctor andr any kind of pharmacological treatment. The Spiritualists most turned to therapeutic support for alcohol dependence, as well as conventional treatment, on account of their greater purchasing power. Catholics generally relied exclusively on <b>religious</b> <b>therapy,</b> but were less likely to reject the possibility of medical treatment. The importance given to prayer as an anxiolytic method was common in the three treatments. Confessions and pardons - in the forms of (faith) conversions and penitence for Evangelicals and Catholics respectively - served to help to rebuild people's lives and restore their self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: According to the interviewees, what helped them to maintain their abstinence from drugs was more than just religious faith. Other factors included the support, positive pressure and welcoming offered by the group, and the offer to rebuild their lives with the unconditional support of religious leaders...|$|E

Several discursive discrepancies are detected in interviews, except with one (anonymous) member of the Ilemera community centre, who speaks out on sensitive issues in defiance of her moral and financial benefactor (a Christian branch). Such confidential talks count as a backstage phenomenon, or even performance, which I consider as valuable as community performance in pursuit of the epidemiological and social reality in Ilemera...|$|R
50|$|Recreational staff usually {{include an}} {{activity}} director and possibly activity assistants {{depending on the}} size of the nursing home. The activity director job requires an associates degree or a bachelors degree and allows for further certifications through the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation. Activities are planned that aim to meet each residents emotional, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual, and vocational needs. The transition from being independent to having to depend on others and be away from home is often times very difficult, which is why activities are important to combat depression and anxiety. Some of the different activities that may be offered include hosting birthday parties, celebrating holidays, book clubs, musical events, outdoor activities, discussion and social groups, exercise, arts and crafts, pet <b>therapy,</b> <b>religious</b> services and community outings. Volunteer involvement is also an important part of nursing home activities given that volunteers can act as a link between the nursing home and the outside community.|$|R

Results: In some of the cases, religious beliefs seemed to provide a containment of maladaptive behaviors, partly through prayer and through {{a sense of belonging}} to the religious community. In other cases, it proved difficult to separate the concept of a punitive God from the illness process. Discussion: The cases are discussed with reference to a limited empirical literature. Similarities are noted between some religious institutions and eating disorder treatment regimes. This paper explores management issues, including the use of pastoral counseling and the ethics of addressing <b>religious</b> beliefs in <b>therapy.</b> We note the benefits of a rapprochement between psychiatry and religion. © 2000 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|From {{the ancient}} times {{up to this}} date, it has been thought that {{religion}} and spirituality have important effects on human being's mental life. However, some psychologists and psychotherapists have ignored this role,and thus neglected to {{study the effects of}} applying religion and spirituality in psychotherapy. However, many psychologists and psychotherapists have recently studied the relationship between religion or spirituality and mental health; or used religious interventions in psychotherapies. Although different kinds of religious psychotherapies have been proposed, no comprehensive theory has been presented in this area. In this article a scientific,comprehensive and applied spiritual method of psychotherapy is suggested. <b>Religious</b> Cognitive- Emotional <b>Therapy</b> (RCET) is a new form of cognitive therapy that uses the basic religious beliefs and insights in psychotherapy. RCET is a new integration of cognitive, humanistic, and existential psychotherapies that takes into account religious beliefs and insights of the clients. RCET is an effective method of psychotherapy for the treatment of those who suffer from identity crisis, depression, and anxiety; and it can be developed to address other psychological disorders as well. Because RCET is a new approach, practically is needed to do further theoretical research in this area...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} built upon the {{assumption}} that religiosity is an important dimension in human mental life, and that this dimension shouldn‘t be excluded from therapy. It is maintained that recent changes in psychodynamic theory and practice have implications for the discipline’s attitudes toward, understanding of, and treatment of religion and religiosity. A contemporary psychodynamic approach to religiosity is presented. A main characteristic {{of this approach is}} that it focuses on God as an object representation, and that it seeks to understand the developmental history and the function of an individual‘s representation of God. From this basis, it is argued that religiosity can represent an important developmental dimension for an individual, and it is proposed that active exploration of religious material can become a positive force in the therapeutic process. Thoughts concerning the role of the psychologist when confronted with <b>religious</b> themes in <b>therapy,</b> are presented, and whether work with religious material may represent a particular therapeutic challenge. Finally we discuss how psychodynamic theories {{can be used as a}} theoretical frame of reference and as a therapeutic tool in the therapeutic processs. The importance of theoretical knowledge in therapeutic work with religious themes is underscored...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of <b>religious</b> cognitive behavioral <b>therapy</b> in improving subjective well-being of chronic kidney disease patients. The hypothesis of the study was that there is a significant difference in the subjective well-being between experimental and control groups. Four chronic kidney disease patients with age between 22 - 45 years old, Muslim, and suffering chronic kidney disease more than 6 months participated this study. The design of this experiment was a quasi experiment with pretest-posttest control group design and follow up. Data were collected with satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) from Diener, Emmons, Larsen and Griffin 2 ̆ 7 s Scale (1985) and Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) from Watson, Clark, and Tellegen 2 ̆ 7 s scale (1988). Independent sample t-test was conducted to analyze the data. The result showed that there was a difference life satisfaction between the experimental and control group (t= 4, 287, p = 0, 005 (p< 0, 0 l). Also, there were difference on an affection score between the experimental and control group (t = 4, 407, p = 0, 005 (p< 0, 0 l) ...|$|R
