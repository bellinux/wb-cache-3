40|$|SummaryIntegrated HIV- 1 genomes {{are found}} within {{actively}} transcribed host genes in latently infected CD 4 + T cells. <b>Readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> {{of the host}} gene might therefore suppress HIV- 1 gene expression and promote the latent infection that allows viral persistence in patients on therapy. To address the effect of host gene readthrough, we used homologous recombination to insert HIV- 1 genomes in either orientation into an identical position within an intron of an actively transcribed host gene, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Constructs were engineered to permit or block <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> of HPRT. <b>Readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> inhibited HIV- 1 gene expression for convergently orientated provirus but enhanced HIV- 1 gene expression when HIV- 1 {{was in the same}} orientation as the host gene.

Mutagenesis and molecular cloning identified the nasFEDCBA operon encoding enzymes for the uptake and reduction of nitrate and nitrite to ammonium, and the adjacent nasR regulatory gene. Analysis of nasF operon expression revealed that transcription is activated by the Ntr (general nitrogen regulation) system in response to nitrogen limitation. Transcription antitermination control in response to nitrate and nitrite is mediated by the NasR protein.

40|$|Diverse {{mechanisms}} for transcription antitermination are widespread (24, 47). Recently, a new type, {{in which the}} ribo-some and the TnaC leader peptide control Rho-dependent transcription termination upstream of the tnaAB operon, was characterized for Escherichia coli (Fig. 1) (1, 34, 49). Remarkably, the nascent leader peptide directs formation of a stereospecific tryptophan-binding site near the peptidyl transferase center. Bound tryptophan inhibits peptidyl transferase activity, prevent-ing release factor cleavage of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro (TnaC-tRNAPro). The stalled ribosome blocks the RNA entry site for Rho factor, allowing <b>transcription</b> <b>readthrough.</b> In this issue, Luis Rogelio Cruz-Vera and Charles Yanofsky show that conserved TnaC residues Asp- 16 and Pro- 24 are required for tryptophan inhibition of ribosome release (9).

40|$|ABSTRACT Transcription {{termination}} by RNA polymerase (Pol) II is {{an essential}} but poorly understood process. In eukaryotic nuclei, the 39 ends of mRNAs are generated by cleavage and polyadenylation, and the same sequence elements that specify that process are required for downstream release of the poly-merase from the DNA. Although Pol II is known to bind proteins required for both events, few {{studies have focused on}} Pol II mutations as a means to uncover the mechanisms that couple polyadenylation and termination. We performed a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to isolate mutations in the N-terminal half of Rpb 2, the second largest Pol II subunit, that conferred either a decreased or increased response to a well-characterized poly(A) site. Most of the mutant alleles encoded substitutions affecting either surface residues or conserved active site amino acids at positions important for termina-tion by other RNA polymerases. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that transcript cleavage at the poly(A) site was impaired in both classes of increased <b>readthrough</b> mutants. <b>Transcription</b> into downstream sequences beyond where termination normally occurs was also probed. Although most of the tested readthrough mutants showed a reduction in termination concom-itant with the reduced poly(A) usage, these processes were uncoupled in at least one mutant strain.

Since the rRNA genes in D. melanogaster are organized in tandem arrays, this implies that <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> of one unit can occur up to, and possibly through, the promoter of the next unit. <b>Readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> might be a component of transcription enhancement in a tandem array of genes...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type early {{activity}} of the adenovirus 5 E 1 b gene promoter requires <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> originating from the adjacent upstream E 1 a gene. This unusual mode of viral transcription activation was identified by genetic manipulation of the mouse βmaj-globin gene transcription termination sequence (GGT) inserted into the E 1 a gene. To facilitate further study of the mechanism of readthrough activation, the activities of GGT and a composite termination sequence CT were tested in recombinant adenoviruses containing luciferase reporters driven by the E 1 b promoter. There was a strict correlation between readthrough and substantial downstream gene expression, indicating that interference with downstream transcription was not a unique property of GGT. Blockage of <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> of E 1 a had no apparent effect on early expression of the major late promoter, the next active promoter downstream of E 1 b. A test for epistatic interaction between termination sequence insertions and E 1 a enhancer mutations suggested that readthrough activation and E 1 a enhancer activation of the E 1 b promoter are mechanistically distinct. In addition, substitution of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter for the E 1 b promoter suppressed the requirement for readthrough. These results suggest that readthrough activation is a “local” effect of a direct interaction between the invading transcription elongation complex and the E 1 b promoter. DNase I hypersensitivity footprinting provided evidence that this interaction altered an extensive E 1 b promoter DNA-protein complex that was assembled {{in the absence of}} <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli {{transcriptional}} antiterminator protein BglG inhibits transcription {{termination of}} the bgl operon {{in response to the}} presence of β-glucosides in the growth medium. BglG is an RNA-binding protein that recognizes a specific sequence partially overlapping the two terminators within the bgl transcript. The activity of BglG is determined by its dimeric state which is modulated by reversible phosphorylation. Thus, only the nonphosphorylated dimer binds to the RNA target site and allows <b>readthrough</b> of <b>transcription.</b> Genetic systems which test dimerization and antitermination in vivo were used to map and delimit the region which mediates BglG dimerization. We show that the last 104 residues of BglG are required for dimerization. Any attempt to shorten this region from the ends or to introduce internal deletions abolished the dimerization capacity of this region. A putative leucine zipper motif is located at the N terminus of this region. The role of the canonical leucines in dimerization was demonstrated by their substitution. Our results also suggest that the carboxy-terminal 70 residues, which follow the leucine zipper, contain another dimerization domain which does not resemble any known dimerization motif. Each of these two regions is necessary but not sufficient for dimerization. The BglG phosphorylation site, His 208, resides at the junction of the two putative dimerization domains. Possible mechanisms by which the phosphorylation of BglG controls its dimerization and thus its activity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTranscripts encoded by the cis-acting antitermination sites (put sites) of lambdoid phage HK 022 promote <b>readthrough</b> of {{downstream}} <b>transcription</b> terminators. Proper conformation of {{the transcripts}} {{is essential for}} activity, since put mutations that prevent the formation of predicted RNA stems prevented antitermination, and suppressor mutations that restore the stems restored antitermination. Antitermination {{does not appear to}} require proteins other than RNA polymerase, since put-dependent readthrough of multiple sequential terminators was observed in a purified transcription system consisting of template, polymerase, substrates, and buffer. Transcription of put also increased the elongation rate of polymerase, very likely by suppressing pausing. A mutation that alters the zinc-finger region of the β′ subunit of polymerase specifically prevented the put-dependent increases in terminator readthrough and elongation rate. The simplicity of HK 022 antitermination contrasts with that of other known antitermination pathways. We propose that the central effector is a transcript that directly alters the elongation properties of RNA polymerase...|$|R
40|$|SummarySome Ts {{in nuclear}} DNA of trypanosomes and Leishmania are {{hydroxylated}} and glucosylated to yield base J (β-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil). In Leishmania, about 99 % of J {{is located in}} telomeric repeats. We show here {{that most of the}} remaining J is located at chromosome-internal RNA polymerase II termination sites. This internal J and telomeric J can be reduced by a knockout of J-binding protein 2 (JBP 2), an enzyme involved in the first step of J biosynthesis. J levels are further reduced by growing Leishmania JBP 2 knockout cells in BrdU-containing medium, resulting in cell death. The loss of internal J in JBP 2 knockout cells is accompanied by massive readthrough at RNA polymerase II termination sites. The <b>readthrough</b> varies between <b>transcription</b> units but may extend over 100 kb.

40|$|Recombinant {{simian virus}} 5 (rSV 5) mutants {{containing}} substitutions in the M-F intergenic region were generated {{to determine the}} effect of increased <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> on the paramyxovirus growth cycle. We have previously shown, using an SV 5 dicistronic minigenome, that replacement of the 22 -base M-F intergenic region with a foreign sequence results in a template (Rep 22) that directs very high levels of M-F <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription.</b> An rSV 5 containing the Rep 22 substitution grew slower and to final titers that were 50 - to 80 -fold lower than those of wild-type (WT) rSV 5. Cells infected with the Rep 22 virus produced very low levels of monocistronic M and F mRNA, consistent with the M-F readthrough phenotype. Surprisingly, Rep 22 virus-infected cells also displayed a global decrease in the accumulation of viral mRNA from genes located upstream and downstream of the M-F junction, and overall viral protein synthesis was reduced. Second-site revertants of the Rep 22 virus that had regained WT transcription and growth properties contained a single base substitution that increased the M gene end U tract from four to eight residues, suggesting that the growth defects originated from higher-than-normal M-F <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription.</b> Thus, the primary growth defect for the Rep 22 virus appears to be in viral RNA synthesis and not in morphogenesis. A second rSV 5 virus (G 14), which contained a different foreign M-F intergenic sequence, grew to similar or slightly higher titers than WT rSV 5 in some cell types and produced ∼ 1. 5 - to 2 -fold more mRNA and viral protein. The data support the hypothesis that inhibition of Rep 22 virus growth is due to increased access by the polymerase to the 5 ′ end of the genome and to the resulting overexpression of L protein. We propose that the elevated naturally occurring M-F readthrough which is characteristic of many paramyxoviruses serves as a mechanism to fine-tune the level of polymerase that is optimal for virus growth...|$|E
40|$|The avian {{leukosis}} virus ΔLR- 9 causes a high frequency of B-cell lymphomas within weeks after injection into 10 -day-old chicken embryos. These lymphomas result from proviral integrations into the oncogene c-myb. In contrast, LR- 9, which lacks the 42 -nucleotide gag gene deletion of ΔLR- 9, {{does not cause}} a high frequency of c-myb-associated short-latency lymphomas. Although viral replication rates and spliced env mRNA levels {{were found to be}} similar for both viruses, ΔLR- 9 exhibited an increase in <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> compared to LR- 9. The ΔLR- 9 deletion is located in the region of the gag gene corresponding to the matrix (MA) protein {{as well as in the}} negative regulator of splicing (NRS) element.

One of the mutant viruses induced an even higher incidence than ΔLR- 9 of short-latency lymphomas with viral integrations into c-myb. Thus, we propose that disruption of the NRS sequence promotes <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> and splicing to the downstream myb gene, causing overexpression of a slightly truncated Myb protein, which induces short-latency tumors...|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{vaccinia virus}} A 18 R gene {{function}} {{results in an}} aberrant transcription profile termed promiscuous transcription, defined as transcription within regions of the genome which are normally transcriptionally silent late during infection. Promiscuous transcription results {{in an increase in}} the intracellular concentration of double-stranded RNA, which in turn results in activation of the cellular 2 - 5 A pathway and subsequent RNase L-catalyzed degradation of viral and cellular RNAs. One of three hypotheses could account for promiscuous transcription: (i) reactivation of early promoters late during infection, (ii) random transcription initiation, (iii) <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> from upstream promoters. Transcriptional analysis of several viral genes, presented here, argues strongly against the first two hypotheses. We have tested the readthrough hypothesis by conducting a detailed transcriptional analysis of a region of the vaccinia virus genome which contains three early genes (M 1 L, M 2 L, and K 1 L) positioned directly downstream of the intermediate gene, K 2 L. The results show that mutation of the A 18 R gene results in increased <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> of the M 1 L gene originating from the K 2 L intermediate promoter. A 18 R mutant infection of RNase L knockout mouse fibroblast (KO 3) cells does not result in 2 - 5 A pathway activation, yet the virus mutant is defective in late viral gene expression and remains temperature sensitive.

A ctf mutant strain, termed s 141, shows a <b>transcription</b> <b>readthrough</b> phenotype and stabilizes a dicentric chromosome fragment in two assays for kinetochore integrity. Previously, these assays led to the identification of two essential kinetochore components, Ctf 13 p and Ctf 14 p. Thus, s 141 represents another ctf mutant involved in the maintenance of kinetochore integrity. We cloned and mapped the gene complementing the ctf mutation of s 141 and showed that it {{is identical to the}} S. cerevisiae NUP 170 gene. A deletion strain of NUP 170 (nup 170 Delta::HIS 3) has a Ctf(-) phenotype similar to the s 141 mutant (nup 170 - 141) and also exhibits a kinetochore integrity defect. We identified a second nucleoporin, NUP 157, a homologue of NUP 170, as a suppressor of the Ctf(-) phenotype of nup 170 - 141 and nup 170 Delta::HIS 3 strains. However, a deletion of NUP 157 or several other nucleoporins did not affect chromosome segregation.

ToxT, a regulator whose initial transcription {{depends on the}} ToxR regulator, positively modulates expression of CT and TCP. To help understand control of CT and TCP in El Tor vibrios, we monitored ctxAB and ToxR-dependent toxT transcription by time course primer extension assays. AKI conditions stimulated CT synthesis with an absence of ctxAB transcription during static growth followed by induction upon shaking. ToxR-dependent toxT transcription was induced {{at the end of}} the static growth period but was transient, stopping shortly after shaking was initiated but, interestingly, also if the static phase was prolonged. Immunoblot assays showed that ToxR protein levels were not coincidentally transient, implying a protein on/off switch mechanism for ToxR. Despite the transient activation by ToxR, transcription of ctxAB was maintained during shaking. This finding suggested continued toxT expression, possibly through relay transcription from another promoter. The 12. 6 -kb distant upstream tcpA promoter responsible for expression of the TCP operon has been proposed to provide an alternate toxT message by <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription.</b> Activation of the tcpA promoter is supported by increased expression of TcpA protein during the shaking phase of the culture. <b>Readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> of toxT from tcpA would be compatible with reverse transcription-PCR evidence for a toxT mRNA at times when ToxR-dependent transcription was no longer detectable by primer extension...|$|E

The position of the ebgA gene within that 9. 6 -kilobase sequence was identified by insertional inactivation by means of the transposon gamma-delta. In addition to the gamma-delta insertions that inactivate ebgA by disrupting the coding sequence, seven additional gamma-delta insertions reduce expression of the gene by a factor of greater than 200 by insertions elsewhere into the replicon. One of these insertions is into the pBR 322 sequence itself. This action at a distance to reduce expression requires that gamma-delta is cis with respect to the ebgA gene. The effect is independent of the orientation or position of gamma-delta within the replicon, but it does depend both upon the orientation of the ebgA-bearing sequence within the replicon and upon the total size of the replicon. <b>Transcription</b> <b>readthrough</b> (promoter occlusion) does not explain this phenomenon, and we suggest that the presence of gamma-delta may alter the local supercoiling in the region of the ebgA promoter {{in such a way as}} to inhibit transcription.

40|$|The pks {{genes are}} the largest antibiotic- {{encoding}} gene cluster in Bacillus subtilis and encode the Pks enzymatic complex that produces bacillaene. Bacillaene plays important roles in the fitness of B. subtilis during competition with other bacterial species. In this dissertation, I investigate the regulatory mechanisms used by B. subtilis to control {{the expression of the}} pks genes and the production of bacillaene. First, I focus on understanding the transcriptional regulatory network that coordinates the activation of the pks genes. My results indicate that multiple transcriptional regulators, in particular the stationary phase regulators Spo 0 A and CodY, coordinate the control of the pks gene activation. Also, cells dedicated to the formation of biofilms and spores but not motility induce the expression of the pks genes. I discuss these findings in light of their roles during bacterial competition. I also identified multiple regulatory elements along the pks genes. Promoters upstream of pksB, pksC and pksS are active during vegetative growth while a promoter upstream of pksG is active only during spore formation. The activity of the pksG promoter is exclusive to the nascent spores and not the mother cells. In addition to promoters, a cis-regulatory element at the intergenic region of pksC and pksD promotes <b>readthrough</b> of <b>transcription</b> terminators along the pks genes. Finally, I focus on the function of PksA, previously presumed to regulate the pks genes. I have found that PksA is not involved in the control of the pks gene expression. Instead, PksA negatively regulates the expression of ymcC. My data suggests that YmcC is not involved in bacillaene production but, consistent with structural prediction, I have found that YmcC is a membrane protein produced during sporulation. I hypothesize the function of YmcC during spore maturation or germination and propose experiments to elucidate this role. In general, this dissertation contributes to the understanding of pks gene regulation and its implications in the competitive fitness of B. subtilis.

40|$|The M 2 gene of {{respiratory}} syncytial (RS) virus has two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 encodes a 22 -kDa protein termed M 2 - 1. The M 2 - 1 protein contains a Cys 3 -His 1 motif (C-X 7 -C-X 5 -C-X 3 -H) near the amino terminus. This motif is conserved in all human, bovine, and ovine strains of RS virus. A similar motif {{found in the}} mammalian transcription factor Nup 475 {{has been shown to}} bind zinc. The M 2 - 1 protein of human RS virus functions as a transcription factor which increases polymerase processivity, and it enhances readthrough of intergenic junctions during RS virus transcription, thereby acting as a transcription antiterminator. The M 2 - 1 protein also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein. We examined the effects of mutations of cysteine and histidine residues predicted to coordinate zinc in the Cys 3 -His 1 motif on transcription antitermination and N protein binding. We found that mutating the predicted zinc-coordinating residues, the cysteine residues at amino acid positions 7 and 15 and the histidine residue at position 25, prevented M 2 - 1 from enhancing transcriptional readthrough. In contrast, mutations of amino acids within this motif not predicted to coordinate zinc had no effect. Mutations of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues in the Cys 3 -His 1 motif also prevented M 2 - 1 from interacting with the nucleocapsid protein. One mutation of a noncoordinating residue in the motif which did not affect <b>readthrough</b> during <b>transcription,</b> E 10 G, prevented interaction with the nucleocapsid protein. This suggests that M 2 - 1 does not require interaction with the nucleocapsid protein in order to function during transcription. Analysis of the M 2 - 1 protein in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed two major forms distinguished by their mobilities. The slower migrating form was shown to be phosphorylated, whereas the faster migrating form was not. Mutations in the Cys 3 -His 1 motif caused a change in distribution of the M 2 - 1 protein from the slower to the faster migrating form.

We previously {{reported that the}} introduction of a certain rpoB mutation (rpoB 5) into Bacillus subtilis enables the cells to overproduce NTD. B. subtilis mini-Tn 10 transposant libraries have been screened for genes that affect NTD production. Inactivation of ccpA, which encodes a major transcriptional regulator of carbon catabolite regulation, markedly reduced NTD production. By contrast, inactivation of glcP, which is situated just downstream of ntdABC and encodes a glucose/mannose:H+ symport permease, stimulated NTD production. Overexpression of glcP led to the repression of ntdABC expression (and thus NTD production) in response to GlcP-mediated glucose uptake. These results suggest that CcpA-mediated catabolite activation of ntdABC expression occurs in response to the increase of the in vivo concentration of fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate via glucose- 6 -phosphate and that GlcP-mediated glucose repression of ntdABC expression occurs in association with the increase of the in vivo concentration of unphosphorylated glucose. In addition, Northern analysis showed that glcP is transcribed from the ntdABC promoter through <b>transcription</b> <b>readthrough</b> at the ntdABC transcription terminator site, which enables NTD to function as a modulator of glucose uptake through the stimulation of ntdABC-glcP transcription, even in wild-type (rpoB+) cells.

A strong Rho-dependent termination site, timm, is located downstream of both promoters. When P 4 immunity is expressed, transcription starting at PLE is efficiently terminated at timm, whereas transcription from PLL is immunity insensitive and reads through timm. We report the identification of two nested genes, kil and eta, located in the P 4 left operon. The P 4 kil gene, which encodes a 65 -amino-acid polypeptide, is the first translated gene downstream of the PLE promoter, and its expression is controlled by P 4 immunity. Overexpression of kil causes cell killing. This gene is the terminal part of a longer open reading frame, eta, which begins upstream of PLE. The eta gene is expressed when transcription starts from the PLL promoter. Three likely start codons predict a size between 197 and 199 amino acids for the Eta gene product. Both kil and eta overlap the timm site. By cloning kil upstream of a tRNA reporter gene, we demonstrated that translation of the kil region prevents premature transcription termination at timm. This suggests that P 4 immunity might negatively control kil translation, thus enabling transcription termination at timm. Transcription starting from PLL proceeds through timm. Mutations that create nonsense codons in eta caused premature termination of transcription starting from PLL. Suppression of the nonsense mutation restored <b>transcription</b> <b>readthrough</b> at timm. Thus, termination of transcription from PLL is prevented by translation of eta...|$|R
40|$|Helitrons are {{a family}} of mobile {{elements}} that were discovered in 2001 and are now known {{to exist in the}} entire eukaryotic kingdom. Helitrons, particularly those of maize, exhibit an intriguing property of capturing gene fragments and placing them into the mobile element. Helitron-captured genes are sometimes transcribed, giving birth to chimeric transcripts that intertwine coding regions of different captured genes. Here, we perused the B 73 maize genome for high-quality, putative Helitrons that exhibit plus/minus polymorphisms and contain pieces of more than one captured gene. Selected Helitrons were monitored for expression via in silico EST analysis. Intriguingly, expression validation of selected elements by RT–PCR analysis revealed multiple transcripts not seen in the EST databases. The differing transcripts were generated by alternative selection of splice sites during pre-mRNA processing. Selection of splice sites was not random since different patterns of splicing were observed in the root and shoot tissues. In one case, an exon residing in close proximity but outside of the Helitron was found conjoined with Helitron-derived exons in the mature transcript. Hence, Helitrons have the ability to synthesize new genes not only by placing unrelated exons into common transcripts, but also by <b>transcription</b> <b>readthrough</b> and capture of nearby exons. Thus, Helitrons have a phenomenal ability to “display” new coding regions for possible selection in nature. A highly conservative, minimum estimate of the number of new transcripts expressed by Helitrons is ∼ 11, 000 or ∼ 25 % {{of the total number of}} genes in the maize genome...|$|R
40|$|SI {{mapping of}} Xenopus laevis ribosomal RNA transcripts, both in oocyte {{microinjection}} experiments and in vivo, shows {{that all but}} 212 bp of the so-called "non-transcribed " spacer (NTS) of the ribosomal DNA repeat is transcribed {{as part of the}} primary ribosomal transcript. The 40 S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is therefore a processing intermediate. The primary ribosomal transcript co-terminates with the previously described spacer transcripts [Moss (10) ], at a site 213 bp upstream of the 40 S pre-rRNA initiation site. This mode of transcription suggests a simple mechanism for the recently proposed phenomenon of "readthrough-enhancement", [Moss et al (9), Moss (10) ], where <b>readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> from an upstream gene may enhance transcription of a gene immediately downstream in the tandem ribosomal repeat...|$|E
40|$|The /epA operon of Bacillus subtilis {{was found}} to be bicistronic and to consist of the two genes lepA and hem#, which encode a {{putative}} GTP-binding protein and an oxygen-independent coproporhyrinogen 111 oxidase, respectively. The lepA operon is located immediately upstream of the dnaK operon. Both operons are transcribed in the same direction and are not separated by an obvious transcription-terminator-like structure. The lepA operon is preceded by a potential vegetative promoter, and there is a putative strong intergenic terminator between lepA and hemN. Northern biot experiments revealed only a transcript corresponding to lepA, but expression of hem # was demonstrated in slot-blot and immunoblot experiments using antibodies raised against Histagged HemN. The data suggest that most of the transcripts originating at the potential vegetative promoter are terminated at the intergenic terminator. <b>Readthrough</b> <b>transcription</b> into the downstream dnaK operon was not found...|$|E
40|$|Yeast Npl 3 is {{a highly}} abundant, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, RNA-binding protein, related to {{metazoan}} SR proteins. Reported functions of Npl 3 include transcription elongation, splicing and RNA 3 ' end processing. We used UV crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC) to map precise RNA binding sites, and strand-specific tiling arrays {{to look at the}} effects of loss of Npl 3 on all transcripts across the genome. We found that Npl 3 binds diverse RNA species, both coding and non-coding, at sites indicative of roles in both early pre-mRNA processing and 3 ' end formation. Tiling arrays and RNAPII mapping data revealed 3 ' extended RNAPII-transcribed RNAs in the absence of Npl 3, suggesting that defects in pre-mRNA packaging events result in termination <b>readthrough.</b> <b>Transcription</b> readthrough was widespread and frequently resulted in down-regulation of neighboring genes.

40|$|We have {{reported}} previously the isolation and genetic characterization of mutations in the gene encoding the largest subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), {{which lead to}} 6 -azauracil (6 AU) -sensitive growth. It was suggested that these mutations affect the functional interaction between RNAPII and transcription-elongation factor TFIIS because the 6 AU-sensitive phenotype of the mutant strains {{was similar to that}} of a strain defective in the production of TFIIS and can be suppressed by increasing the dosage of the yeast TFIIS-encoding gene, PPR 2, RNAPIIs were purified and characterized from two independent 6 AU-sensitive yeast mutants and from wild-type (wt) cells. In vitro, in the absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a 3 -fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent <b>transcription,</b> <b>readthrough</b> or cleavage. However, stimulation of the ability of the mutant RNAPIIs to cleave nascent RNA and to read through intrinsic arrest sites was observed at TFIIS:RNAPII molar ratios greater than 600 : 1. Consistent with these findings, the binding affinity of the mutant polymerases for TFIIS was found to be reduced by more than 50 -fold compared with that of the wt enzyme. These studies demonstrate that TFIIS has {{an important role in the}} regulation of transcription by yeast RNAPII and identify a possible binding site for TFIIS on RNAPII...|$|R
40|$|The mating {{response}} of Enterococcus faecalis cells carrying the conjugative plasmid pCF 10 {{is controlled by}} multiple regulatory circuits. Initiation of transcription of the prgQ conjugation operon {{is controlled by the}} peptide receptor protein PrgX; binding of the pheromone peptide cCF 10 to PrgX abolishes PrgX repression, while binding of the inhibitor peptide iCF 10 enhances repression. The results of molecular analysis of prgQ transcripts and genetic studies suggested that the elongation of prgQ transcripts past a putative terminator (IRS 1) may be controlled by the interaction of nascent prgQ mRNAs with a small antisense RNA (Anti-Q) encoded within prgQ. Direct evidence for interaction of these RNAs, as well as the resulting effects on <b>readthrough</b> of prgQ <b>transcription,</b> has been limited. Here we report the results of experiments that (i) determine the inherent termination properties of prgQ transcripts in the absence of Anti-Q; (ii) determine the direct effects of the interaction of Anti-Q with nascent prgQ transcripts in the absence of complicating effects of the PrgX protein; and (iii) begin to dissect the structural components involved in these interactions. The results confirm the existence of alternative terminating and antiterminating forms of nascent prgQ transcripts in vivo and demonstrate that the interaction of Anti-Q with these transcripts leads to termination via inhibition of antiterminator formation. In vitro transcription assays support the major results of the in vivo studies. The data support a model for Anti-Q function suggested from recent studies of these RNAs and their interactions in vitro (S. Shokeen, C. M. Johnson, T. J. Greenfield, D. A. Manias, G. M. Dunny, and K. E. Weaver, submitted for publication) ...|$|R
40|$|The eight ccm genes {{located at}} minute 47 on the Escherichia coli chromosome, {{in the order}} ccmABCDEFGH, encode homologues of {{proteins}} which are essential for cytochrome c assembly in other bacteria. The ccm genes are immediately downstream from the napFDAGHBC genes encoding a periplasmic nitrate reductase. CcmH was previously shown to be essential for cytochrome c assembly. Deletion analysis and a two-plasmid strategy have now been used to demonstrate that CcmA, B, D, E, F and G are also essential for cytochrome c assembly, and hence for cytochrome-c-dependent nitrite reduction. The ccm genes are transcribed from a ccmA promoter located within the adjacent gene, napC, which is the structural gene for a 24 kDa membrane-bound c-type cytochrome, NapC. Transcription from this ccmA promoter is induced approximately 5 -fold during anaerobic growth, independently of a functional Fnr protein: it is also not regulated by the ArcB-ArcA two-component regulatory system. The ccmA promoter {{is an example of}} the 'extended - 10 sequence' group of promoters with a TGX motif immediately upstream of the - 10 sequence. Mutagenesis of the TG motif to TC, CT or CC resulted in loss of about 50 % of the promoter activity. A weak second promoter is suggested to permit transcription of the downstream ccmEFGH genes in the absence of <b>transcription</b> <b>readthrough</b> from the upstream napF and ccmA promoters. The results are consistent with, but do not prove, the current view that CcmA, B, C and D are part of an essential haem transport mechanism, that CcmE, F and H are required for covalent haem attachment to cysteine-histidine motifs in cytochrome c apoproteins in the periplasm, and that CcmG is required for the reduction of cysteine residues on apocytochromes c in preparation for haem ligation...|$|R
