5|$|When a {{tropical}} cyclone crosses the subtropical ridge axis, normally through {{a break in}} the high-pressure area caused by a system traversing the Westerlies, its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north. When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component, the cyclone has begun <b>recurvature,</b> entering the Westerlies. A typhoon moving through the Pacific Ocean towards Asia, for example, will recurve offshore of Japan to the north, and then to the northeast, if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds (blowing northeastward) around a low-pressure system passing over China or Siberia. Many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner, which move from west to east {{to the north of the}} subtropical ridge. An example of {{a tropical}} cyclone in <b>recurvature</b> was Typhoon Ioke in 2006, which took a similar trajectory.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} began to reorganize, the forward motion had become {{virtually}} stationary but later began {{to increase as}} Arlene turned northeastward, beginning <b>recurvature</b> into the main belt of the Westerlies. Ships {{in the vicinity of}} the depression reported that it had regained gale-force winds on August8, resulting in advisories on Arlene being re-initiated around that time. Later that day, a Navy reconnaissance plane found hurricane-force winds around the center of the storm, resulting in Arlene being upgraded to a minimal hurricane a second time.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Erika of August 2015 was {{the deadliest}} natural {{disaster}} in Dominica since Hurricane David in 1979. The fifth named storm of the season, Erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles. Hostile conditions, including dry air and wind shear, inhibited significant development, and Erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50mph (85km/h). Contrary to predictions of a northwesterly <b>recurvature,</b> the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the Leeward Islands and emerged over the Caribbean Sea on August27. Erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day, dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the Dominican Republic. The remnant system persisted for several more days, ultimately moving across the Gulf of Mexico before dissipating over Georgia on September2.|$|E
5|$|Very minimal impact {{occurred}} {{as a result}} from Hurricane Alberto. Dakar, Senegal, received 25mm (1in) of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city. A discussion was issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm until it safely passed. Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto. This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began to turn to the south, away from the Azores. Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States {{a few days after the}} storm's <b>recurvature.</b> No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland, but it was estimated that winds of at least tropical storm force were experienced there. Otherwise, there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto.|$|E
5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural {{changes in the}} storm related to the small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the <b>recurvature</b> became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took it along the eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a bit more, reaching its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16.|$|E
5|$|During <b>recurvature,</b> Typhoon Tip passed about 65km (40mi) east of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached 72km/h (44mph), with gusts to 112km/h (69mph). Sustained wind {{velocities}} in Japan are not known, {{though they}} were estimated at minimal typhoon strength. The passage of the typhoon through the region resulted in {{millions of dollars in}} damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country. Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44fishermen dead or unaccounted for. A Chinese freighter broke in half {{as a result of the}} typhoon, though its crew of 46 were rescued. The rainfall led to over 600mudslides throughout the mountainous regions of Japan and flooded more than 22,000homes; 42people died throughout the country, with another 71missing and 283injured. River embankments broke in 70 places, destroying 27 bridges, while about 105 dikes were destroyed. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left homeless. Tip destroyed apple, rice, peach and other crops. Five ships sank in heavy seas off the coast and 50-story buildings swayed in the capital, Tokyo. Transportation in the country was disrupted; 200 trains and 160 domestic flights were canceled. Tip was described as the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years.|$|E
500|$|Though a {{tropical}} cyclone typically moves {{from east to}} west in the tropics, its track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow, such as the jet stream or an extratropical cyclone. This motion, termed [...] "recurvature", commonly occurs near {{the western edge of the}} major ocean basins, where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical cyclones are common. An example of tropical cyclone <b>recurvature</b> was Typhoon Ioke in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Eighteen {{hours later}} on Christmas Day, JTWC {{upgraded}} Fern to a typhoon, with winds of [...] JMA continued {{to keep it}} as a severe tropical storm at that time. On December 26 at 1200 UTC, Fern reached its peak at 150km/h(90mph) north of Yap after its <b>recurvature,</b> according to JTWC. JMA assessed that Fern reached its peak of , with a pressure reading of [...] twelve hours later. On December 28, Fern began to weaken when it encountered a shear line. On the next day, JTWC downgraded Fern back to tropical storm strength, with winds of [...] At the same time according to JMA, the storm had weakened to , with a pressure reading of [...] Both warning centers downgraded Fern into a tropical depression by December 30, as it continued to travel along a shear line. JTWC issued the final warning at 0600 UTC, while JMA stopped tracking the depression at 1200 UTC. JTWC continued to track the low until December 31, where it stalled north of Guam.|$|E
500|$|Thereafter, the {{hurricane}} began curving northward as {{it continued to}} intensify, reaching {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category3hurricane– a major hurricane– by September11. Two days later, the storm strengthened further into a Category4hurricane. As no reasonably quantifiable strengthening occurred afterwards, this also marked the storm's official peak intensity as maximum sustained winds were analyzed at [...] However, aircraft reconnaissance estimated wind speeds of at least [...] at roughly the same time frame. The storm's northward <b>recurvature</b> caused it to track just west of Bermuda late on September13. Afterwards, a weakening trend began as {{the hurricane}} tracked northeastward into more northerly latitudes. By September15, the storm had been downgraded to minimal hurricane intensity. After passing south of Cape Race later that day, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and continued to track northward until it was last noted by 1800UTC the next day near Greenland. During the storm's twelve-day trek, the hurricane tracked approximately , roughly equidistant to the distance between New York City and London.|$|E
500|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies. [...] When the subtropical ridge shifts due to ENSO, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. [...] Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years, while mainland China experiences much greater landfall frequency during La Niña years. [...] During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago, while in La Niña years the formation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position, shift west, which increases the threat to China. [...] In the Atlantic basin, the subtropical ridge position tends to lie about 5degrees farther south during El Niño years, which leads to a more southerly <b>recurvature</b> for tropical cyclones during those years.|$|E
500|$|The first {{statistical}} guidance {{used by the}} National Hurricane Center was the Hurricane Analog Technique (HURRAN), {{which was}} available in 1969. [...] It used the newly developed North Atlantic tropical cyclone database to find storms with similar tracks. [...] It then shifted their tracks through the storm's current path, and used location, direction and speed of motion, and the date to find suitable analogs. [...] The method did well with storms south of the 25th parallel which had not yet turned northward, but poorly with systems near or after <b>recurvature.</b> [...] Since 1972, the Climatology and Persistence (CLIPER) statistical model {{has been used to}} help generate tropical cyclone track forecasts. [...] In the era of skillful dynamical forecasts, CLIPER is now being used as the baseline to show model and forecaster skill. [...] The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Forecast (SHIFOR) has been used since 1979 for tropical cyclone intensity forecasting. [...] It uses climatology and persistence to predict future intensity, including the current Julian day, current cyclone intensity, the cyclone's intensity 12 hours ago, the storm's initial latitude and longitude, as well as its zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) components of motion.|$|E
500|$|The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) {{was subject}} to {{scrutiny}} {{in the aftermath of}} Winifred, and was criticized for its lack of advance warning. Advices and warnings were received by regional television and radio stations up to 15minutes late following issuance. Winifred's sudden and unexpected turn was little-anticipated by BoM meteorologists, with employees unable to verify the cyclone's centre from the Cairns radar until only about 9:30a.m. on 1February, with radar error of up to [...] observed. However, a Flash Tropical Cyclone Advice was immediately issued shortly thereafter, reaching media outlets near noon that day. Media outlets went suggested {{the creation of a new}} Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Townsville as a result, but the suggestion was dismissed, with a centre already established in Brisbane. A spokesman for the SES stated that no warning was given by the BoM at 9a.m., with the storm's alarming approach; the Service had initially been anticipating the storm's <b>recurvature</b> out to sea, only to receive a flash warning hours later. Months after Winifred, a Commonwealth inquiry sought to investigate misuse of National Disaster Relief Scheme funds related to Winifred, with a $145,000payment to a National Party official, Mike Behan, one of several abuses. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of December, twin monsoon troughs were {{established}} in the extreme western Pacific Ocean, which will later spawn storms Greg, and Fern itself in the northern hemisphere. The trough in the southern hemisphere spawned cyclones Ophelia, Phil, and Fergus. Around that time, convection began to increase near the equator, and {{was associated with a}} westerly wind burst. A low level circulation center was noted by JTWC on December 19 at 0600 UTC. Two days later, convection consolidated near the circulation center, and JMA began tracking it at 0000 UTC as a tropical depression. JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 1500 UTC, as sea level pressure began to deepen, and signs of upper level divergence were found in the system. The first advisory for Tropical Depression 42W followed three hours later, on December 17 at 1200 UTC. JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm on December 22 at 0000 UTC as it traveled westerly, and was given the name Fern. According to JTWC, the wind speeds meandered at minimal tropical storm strength. JMA proceeded to upgrade the depression into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC, with winds of , and a pressure reading of [...] On Christmas Eve, Fern slowly traveled toward Yap. The storm passed over Yap the next day, strengthening to [...] at 0000 UTC, according to JTWC. [...] JMA assessed Fern had winds of [...] at the same time. Fern also began its <b>recurvature</b> that day, beginning its turn north.|$|E
500|$|Approaching the Floridian coast as an intensifying hurricane, {{the storm}} {{initially}} {{turned away from}} the peninsula {{for a short period of}} time on August7, after nearly making landfall on West Palm Beach. Strong gusts of at least 30mph (50km/h) and squally weather impacted the city, but did not cause any damage. However, telecommunications in the city were temporarily disrupted due to the storm. In Jupiter, stronger gusts reaching 60mph (100km/h) were reported, but did not cause any damage as well. However, the hurricane's <b>recurvature</b> offshore was short lived, and the system eventually made its landfall near Fort Pierce, Florida early on August8. Offshore, the USAHS Algonquin, a cruise ship belonging to the Clyde-Mallory cruise line, was caught in the storm, but managed to reach its destination of New York, New York without any major problems. The Honduran freighter Lempira, which had also recorded the lowest barometric pressure associated with the hurricane, experienced considerable damage due to the strong seas. The ship lost all of its lifeboats, and as a result the United Fruit Company line was sent to accompany the damaged ship. Inland, damage was concentrated in an area extending from Jupiter to the border between Florida and Georgia. The hurricane's landfall on the peninsula was attended by torrential rainfall, which damaged crops, particularly citrus. Rainfall peaked at [...] in St. Cloud over a five-day period from August7–12. There, the nearby East Lake Tohopekaliga began to overflow, threatening property and crops. Losses to the citrus crop were estimated by the Florida Citrus Exchange to be equivalent to 1millionboxes of citrus. However, damage to citrus in the Kissimmee area was comparatively less, and was limited to unripe fruit. Lake Okeechobee's water level rose by [...] as a result of floodwater rushing into the lake. Damage along the lake's shores mostly occurred to the north. To the south, in Clewiston, minor damage was confined to trees and windows. Two deaths occurred in the vicinity of the Indian River; these were the only deaths associated with the hurricane in the state. Numerous highways were also washed out by the rains, especially on Florida's south-central east coast. Portions of State Road 4 were covered in debris strewn by strong winds. Damage to the state's road systems was estimated at $100,000 by the former Florida State Highway Commission. Bridges were also badly damaged, with some needing replacement.|$|E
