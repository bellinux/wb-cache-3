40|$|Innovation in {{wireless}} technologies {{is changing the}} Internet and the way users connect. It is now possible to communicate while on the move. However, the standard procedures that enable user mobility across networks do not match the requirements of real-time communications in terms of delay and packet loss. The FMIPv 6 protocol, lately accepted as standard for managing seamless mobility, addresses {{most of the problems}} related to handover latency. Yet, certain issues specific to wireless LAN, such as Access Point Discovery still prevent FMIPv 6 from making the entire <b>roaming</b> <b>procedure</b> seamless for Wi-Fi networks. In this article, we present an extension of the FMIPv 6 protocol that addresses these problems. Our proposal uses the geographical position of the devices in order to anticipate their moves and make them attach to the wireless access points that best fit their location and expected trajectory. We also present an evaluation of our work based on the implementation of the proposal...|$|R
5000|$|The {{differentiation}} between home network and visited network is technically {{given by the}} type of subscriber entry in a specific network. If a subscriber has no entry in the home subscriber register of the network (e.g. home location register (HLR) in GSM networks or local customer database in WLANs), the required subscriber data must first be requested by the visited network e.g. from the subscriber's home network in order that the subscriber can be authenticated and any authorization for using the network services can be checked. The [...] "visiting" [...] subscriber acquires an entry in a user database of the visited network (e.g. visitor location register (VLR)) and the authorized network services are enabled. For the <b>roaming</b> <b>procedure</b> in practice, the possibility of assigning the subscriber data is always indispensable in order that authentication, authorization and billing of the subscriber can be performed in the corresponding network. Thus, the term roaming is not linked to a specific network standard, but rather to the type of subscriber entry in the home subscriber register of the mobile radio network. If a subscriber can use their personal service profile, which they use in the home network, in the visited network as well, this is also referred to as Global Service Roaming Capability.|$|R

In the case of the generalized Ising model we explicitly study the ground state energy and the one–point function of the thermal operator in the short–distance limit, finding an oscillating behaviour related {{to the fact that the}} infinite series of boundary resonances does not decouple from the theory even at very short–distance scales. The analysis of the generalized Sinh-Gordon model with boundary reveals an interesting constraint on the analytic structure of the reflection amplitude.

However, current <b>roaming</b> <b>procedures</b> are too slow, to remain seamless for real-time applications. Multicast mobility still waits for a convincing design. This paper investigates the temporal behaviour of mobile IPv 6 under realtime requirements with dedicated focus on topological impacts. Extending the hierarchical mobile IPv 6 approach we suggest protocol improvements for a continuous handover, which may serve bidirectional multicast communication, as well. Along this line a multicast mobility concept is introduced as a service for clients and sources, as they are of dedicated importance in multipoint conferencing applications. The mechanisms introduced do not rely on assumptions of any specific multicast routing protocol in use...|$|E

The goal of this thesis is to model the security challenges imposed on infrastructurebased wireless access networks by inter-provider and inter-system roaming and handover procedures, to analyze current solutions in this model, and to develop new security solutions. In the first two parts of this thesis, the theoretical parts, we present new models for handover and roaming as well as new security solutions in a technology-independent way: In part II, the main part of this thesis, we develop a formal model for security-context transfer on various types of inter-provider handover procedures. As opposed to previous work our model explicitly captures security-context transfers on subsequent handover and handover after roaming. We present a thorough threat analysis of security solutions that are based on security-context transfers during inter-provider handover and define new security requirements based on this analysis. As state-of-the-art handover procedures do not meet our requirements, we present a new history-enriched, policy-based approach to enhance security-context transfers on inter-provider and inter-system handover. The main advantage of our new approach is that it allows mobile devices and networks to express policies with respect to whether or not a handover should take place, dependent on the history of previously used security mechanisms that is included in the security-context transfer. This protects users and providers from the impact of previously used weak security mechanisms. Moreover, in our procedures, users and networks can enforce policies with respect to the security mechanisms used after the current handover. This protects the handover participants from the impact of future use of weak security mechanisms. Furthermore, in part I, we model, classify and discuss roaming authentication protocols for wireless access networks in a technology-independent way. We introduce a new public-key-based approach for authentication upon roaming. As opposed to previous work on inter-provider roaming, our approach does not require a secure channel between the home and the foreign network. Moreover, as opposed to other public-key-based solutions, in our approach a mobile device is not required to obtain and validate a chain of public-key certificates. In the third part of this thesis, we analyze the roaming and handover procedures within and between GSM and UMTS. In particular, we present a man-in-the-middle attack against the authentication and key agreement based on UMTS-authentication vectors. This attack is enabled by a vulnerability in the inter-operation of UMTS with GSM. Furthermore, we discuss whether the inter-system handover procedures between GSM and UMTS meet the security requirements newly defined in the theoretical part. We show that attacks against the GSM encryption and a man-in-the-middle attack against the GSM authentication and key agreement {{have an impact on the}} security of a connection between a user and a UMTS network if a user is handed back and forth between UMTS and GSM. Finally, in the fourth part, we apply our new security solutions to roaming and handover between IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. In particular, we present a roaming authentication protocol EAP-TLS-KS that implements the new roaming solution. Furthermore we detail how the history-enriched, policy-based approach for inter-provider handover can be implemented in the WLAN context...|$|E

Due to its limited communication range, we need to deploy multiple access points (APs) to cover a large geographical area. To roam from one AP to another seamlessly, <b>roaming</b> <b>procedure</b> is necessary and it results in roaming delay. The delay can be divided into three parts: channel scan, authentication, and re-association. In these three parts, the channel scan time is the longest. Random scan is a new channel scan method to reduce the delay. The scheme divides the beacon interval into several sections. In each beacon interval, only one section will be scanned and it will take multiple beacon intervals to scan all the section to cover the entire beacon interval. The section sequence is randomly generated. In the thesis, we improved on the original random scan. The first improvement is to utilize the results from the previous scan in generating section sequence. From the results of the previous scan, we put the section where the AP is found to the first place of the section sequence. The second improvement is the removal of random scan threshold. Through experiments, we found that the setting of the random scan threshold depends on the speed of the mobile stations. A better alternative is to remove the threshold and scan the channels continuously. In simulations, we found that the new scheme improved the performance of random scan. 致謝 [...] . i 摘要 [...] ii Abstract [...] . iii 目次 [...] iv 圖目次 [...] vi 表目次 [...] . vii 第一章 緒論 [...] . 1 1. 1 簡介	 [...] 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的 [...] 1 1. 3 論文架構 [...] 2 第二章 802. 11 無線區域網路的基本架構 [...] . 3 2. 1 無線區域網路簡介 [...] 3 2. 2 無線網路基本架構 [...] 5 2. 3 無線網路基本元件 [...] 6 2. 4 無線區域網路系統服務 [...] 7 2. 4. 1 分散式系統服務 [...] 8 2. 4. 2 無線區域網路工作站服務 [...] . 10 2. 5 IEEE 802. 11 MAC協定 [...] 10 2. 5. 1 集中式協調機制 [...] . 12 2. 5. 2 分散式協調機制 [...] . 12 第三章 無線網路漫遊之隨機掃描 [...] 15 3. 1 漫遊程序簡介 [...] . 15 3. 2 隨機掃描的原理 [...] . 17 3. 3 隨機掃描的實例 [...] . 19 3. 4 隨機掃描的流程圖 [...] . 21 第四章 無線網路漫遊中隨機掃描之改良 [...] 23 4. 1 有記憶性的隨機掃描 [...] . 23 4. 2 提前執行的隨機掃描 [...] . 24 4. 3 提前執行的隨機掃描之門檻 [...] . 25 第五章 模擬結果與分析 [...] 26 5. 1 Network Simulator ns- 2 介紹 [...] . 26 5. 2 模擬環境之設定 [...] . 27 5. 3 有記憶性的隨機掃描之模擬 [...] . 28 5. 4 門檻對於提前執行的隨機掃描之效能影響 [...] . 32 第六章 結論與未來展望 [...] 37 參考文獻 [...] 3...|$|R
40|$|Research in Wireless Mesh Networking {{has been}} really active in the last years, {{with the birth of}} various ideas and the {{protocols}} that implement them. Nevertheless all the currently most deployed protocols have {{a lot of room for}} improvement and there are still open challenges that are meant to bring the performance to higher levels. Wireless Mesh Networks are involved in several studies also because of their applications which can be particularly useful in all those situations where wired infrastructures are not feasible. Common implementations rely on Layer- 3 addressing and routing, but doing Mesh networking on Layer- 2 address space is probably the best way for building a protocol needed to handle this kind of networks, since this task is not strictly related to the network (IP) layer. In particular, efficient client managing is not possible in case of a mesh routing protocol implemented on Layer- 3 and this is probably one of the most important tasks of the routing protocol (after establishing routes, of course). This technical report focuses on the client announcement and the roaming problems that a protocol, embedded between Layer- 2 and Layer- 3, has to face. In particular, it focuses on B. A. T. M. A. N. -Advanced and defines new mechanisms that are meant to improve the protocol performance in client management and roaming. The current client announcement mechanism suffers from several problems, in particular from a high protocol overhead. The new strategy described in this technical report is meant to reduce such overhead and to increase the robustness of the whole announcement strategy. Up to now B. A. T. M. A. N. -Advanced hasn't ever provided a real mechanism to handle the <b>roaming</b> <b>procedure,</b> so this is the first one accounting this issue in the protocol. Performance are increased dramatically thus making it possible to measure real benefits in the user communications. This is probably the most prominent result obtained in this work which actually brings new possibilities for further improvements and for designing new mechanisms. The B. A. T. M. A. N. -Advanced protocol is actually transparent to the network layer by design, so the base idea behind the new roaming mechanism is to keep such transparency providing an on-time re-routing of the batman encapsulated data packets to the new destination. In this way it is possible to avoid affecting upper layers keeping them unaware of roaming, thus keeping all the connections active. The new mechanisms have been tested in the worst case roaming scenario for B. A. T. M. A. N. -Advanced. Such scenario consists in a topology made up by a chain of nodes of length $N$ (the longer the chain, worse the performance) on top of which a client served by the first node and one served by the last one are communicating. In case of any client movement (e. g. roaming to an adjacent node) the time needed by the new routing information to be spread among the network, and consequently make the connection work again, is proportional to the number of links that separate the two involved nodes. The experimental results, that are reported at the end of the technical report, show that even in this particular scenario the performance improvement given by the new mechanism is significant. The tests have been performed in an emulated environment where virtual machines, which acted as nodes, were created using QEMU-KVM. Therefore it has been possible to use the real B. A. T. M. A. N. -Advanced code instead of a possible error-prone implementation for any of the known network simulators (NS- 2, NS- 3, OMNET++, etc.) ...|$|R

To {{deepen the}} student’s {{comprehension}} and visual impression of mining knowledge while avoiding {{the risk and}} cost of visiting real mines, a virtual mine teaching platform was developed with 3 DS as modelling tool and virtools as programming tool. Having this teaching platform, students can visually obverse the 3 D layout of mines and mining <b>procedures,</b> <b>roam</b> about the mine, and even manipulate the mining device interactively, get judgment of his actions. This teaching platform greatly enhance the efficiency, safety and quality of mining speciality education, it also has good prospect to mine staff training and mining experiment. 1 Foreword During the teaching process for mining speciality, {{it is always a}} difficult task to let students to deeply comprehend the structure and procedure of various stoping methods. Drifts and shafts are somewhat abstract, which needs a high spatial imagination ability. The video clip can do some help, but the visual impression is still not profound, and it lacks interactivity. Taking students to the real mine is a good way which is very visual and straight, {{but it is difficult to}} organize, and has high risks, mines are reluctant to take these risks. On the other hand, mine visiting is much time-consuming and money-consuming, low efficient. Furthermore, although it is very important for students to make a manipulation on mining device, students are seldomly allowed to have a try due to various reasons. As a teacher of mining speciality it always puzzles me to find a teaching method which is practical, visual and interactive. The emergence of virtual reality technique bring us a new approach. Compared with other auxiliary education methods, it has many advantages. As a new means of education and training, it has been applied in many industries such as aviation, military, so we start the trial development of a virtual mine which is mainly for metal mines...|$|R
