500|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/4 {{carried the}} 2 cm FlaK 30 mount {{on a special}} {{platform}} with fold-down side and <b>rear</b> <b>panels.</b> This platform was specifically designed for the Flak 30 mount and could not readily accept a Flak 38 mount or vice versa. To accommodate the gun mount the vehicle was both wider and taller than normal, namely [...] wide and [...] and weighed [...] empty. Four folding seats were fitted on the platform for the crew. Some of these gun mounts had a gun shield fitted. The ready ammunition bins fastened {{to the side and}} <b>rear</b> <b>panels</b> (four on each side and two in the rear) contained one 20-round magazine each.

Many riding saddles today are manufactured without properly placed rings, though rings can be added.

[...] There are other minor mechanical differences, too.|$|E
