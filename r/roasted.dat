Baba ghanoush, called salat ḥatzilim in Israel, is made with tahina and other seasonings such as garlic, lemon juice, onions, herbs and spices. The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an open flame so that the pulp has a smoky taste. A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called salat ḥatzilim b'mayonnaise.

5|$|FES is {{the oldest}} variant of Guinness that is still available, {{although}} its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an original gravity (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts. Black malt was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent <b>roasted</b> malt. From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using <b>roasted</b> malt in the beer's production to <b>roasted</b> barley. Amber malt continued {{to be added to}} the grist until 1940. Flaked barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist Kenny Rogers, co-founding and serving as CEO of Kenny Rogers Roasters, an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of Kenny Rogers Roasters {{was part of a}} larger movement in the restaurant industry toward healthier, take-home offerings. Roasters immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller <b>roasted</b> chicken chains. Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a <b>roasted</b> chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the <b>roasted</b> chicken market, sued Kenny Rogers Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994. Brown then took Roasters public and grew it to a chain of more than 1,000 restaurants before selling his interest in the franchise to the Malaysia-based Berjaya Group in 1996.|$|E

5000|$|Some meat {{markets will}} sell {{cross-rib}} pot <b>roast</b> under the generic name [...] "pot roast."

5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were <b>roasted</b> for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual <b>roasted</b> chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E

50|$|The Comedy Central <b>Roasts</b> are {{a series}} of annual celebrity <b>roast</b> {{specials}} that air on Comedy Central. The first official Comedy Central <b>Roast</b> premiered on August 10, 2003. The <b>roasts</b> have been produced at the rate of approximately one per year. There are 8-10 people invited who <b>roast</b> each other before finally <b>roasting</b> the Roastee and headline of each show. As of 2016, a total of 15 <b>roasts</b> have aired. Targets of <b>roasts</b> have tended to be actors (such as Pamela Anderson and James Franco) and comedians-turned-actors (such as Denis Leary and Joan Rivers), although they have also included musicians Flavor Flav and Justin Bieber, and future President of the United States, Donald Trump. The most recent <b>roast</b> was of Rob Lowe, which premiered on September 5, 2016.|$|R

25|$|The {{degree of}} <b>roast</b> {{has an effect}} upon coffee flavor and body. Darker <b>roasts</b> are {{generally}} bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter <b>roasts</b> have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer <b>roasting</b> times. <b>Roasting</b> does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during <b>roasting.</b>|$|R
