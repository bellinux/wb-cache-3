5000|$|Reinsurance sidecars, {{conventionally}} {{referred to}} as [...] "sidecars", are financial structures that are created to allow investors {{to take on the}} risk and return of a group of insurance policies (a [...] "book of business") written by an insurer or reinsurer (henceforth re/insurer) and earn the risk and return that arises from that business. A re/insurer will only pay ("cede") the premiums associated with a book of business to such an entity if the investors place sufficient funds in the vehicle to ensure that it can meet claims if they arise. Typically, the liability of investors is limited to these funds. These structures have become quite prominent in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as a vehicle for re/insurers to add <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capacity,</b> and for investors to participate in the potential profits resulting from sharp price increases in re/insurance over the four quarters following Katrina.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{two general}} objectives. The {{first is to}} investigate key factors affecting credit constraints conditions and to assess their effects on farm-households in the hinterland of Kinshasa. The second is to measure the efficiency of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and examine whether or notthe provision of microcredit to farm-households affects thier efficiency scores. Specifically, the dissertation examines the following: the difficulties {{in the provision of}} microcredit towards farm-households, the key drivers affecting the probability that a farm-household is credit-constrained, the production efficiency of farm-households and thier determinants, the impact of credit constraints on the technical and scale efficiency of farm-households, the effects of credit constraints on farm-household welfare distribution and the efficiency of MFIs. Furthermore,it investigates the trade-off between financial sustainability and social performance; and tests whether the provision of agricultural credit affects the efficiency of MFIs. Data used are cross-sectional and collected from households of hinterland of Kinshasa and MFIs operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Probit and logit models are applied to identify household and community characteristics affecting the probability that a farm-household is credit-constrained. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to measure the technical and scale efficiency of farm-households producing cassava. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is applied to compute the impact of credit constraints on the efficiency and the welfare of farm-households. Truncated regression (TR) is applied to identify the key drivers of the technical efficiency scores of farm-households. DEA is also applied to compute the efficiency of MFIs, while standard ANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests are applied to investigate whether or not the provision of agricultural microcredit affects the efficiency of MFIs. The results are presented in four core chapters with specific objectives. Chapter three is on the constraints to the financing of agriculture by MFIs and the factors affecting the probability that a farm-household is credit-constrained. The results establish the existence of a high prevalence of credit constraints among farm-households. The findings reveal that short loan terms; frequency of repayment not adapted to farm-households cash flows; lack of collateral requirements; high interest rates and small loan size provided by MFIs are among the key factors explaining a households decision not to apply for a loan. The findings also reveal that low returns and high systemic risks related to the agricultural activities are among factors constraining farm-households participation in microcredit programs. The results of the analysis show also that households are partially or totally rationed because ofinsufficient resources of MFIs. The results from logit and probit models show that household size, association participation, landholding property and remittances are significant covariates associated with credit constraints. This suggests that farm-household capital endowments, providing information on the <b>risk-bearing</b> and repayment <b>capacity,</b> are importantin explaining the probability of being credit-constrained. This findingis convincing evidence that MFIs from hinterland of Kinshasa are not pro-poor and challenges the assumption shared in the dominant literature that MFIs help to correct the imperfections of credit markets by increasing the access to credit of poor households, particularly farm households. Furthermore, this finding contrasts with the outcomes of large microfinance programs developed by NGOs under the welfarist framework, which effectively target the poorest. The fourth chapter estimates the technical and scale efficiency of cassava producing households andthe effect of credit constraints on the efficiency score distribution. This chapter also explores the key drivers affecting differences in terms of technical efficiency score distribution across farm-households. Thefindings reveal that on average, scale efficieny score is three times as big as the technical efficiency score under both Constant Returns to Scale and Variable Returns to Scale assumptions. This suggest that inffeciency in cassava production is more a technical than a scale issue. The results of analysis show that landholding property, formal education of the household, social capital and farm size are important factors increasing technical efficiency score of farm-households. The results of the analysis also show that constraints {{have a negative effect on}} technical efficiency score. However, the effect of credit constraints on scale efficiency score is found to be negative as expected, but the magnitude of causal inference remains non-statistically significant. Fifth chapter examines the effects of credit constraints on farm-household welfare. The findings reveal that, on average, credit constraintssignificantly reduce household food consumption, total expenditure and welfare index (1 USD and 2 USD). This confirms the hypothesis that credit constraints decrease household economic welfare. These results suggest that removing credit constraints among farm-households, for example through the strategy of microfinance, will substantially improve the economicwelfare of households. Thus, it will have a reducing effect on rural poverty by improving food consumption. However, the effect of credit constraints on non-food consumption is found to be negative, but not statistically significant. This insignificant effect of credit constraints on non-food consumption may possibly be due to small loan size and lack of good rural markets and infrastructure. Sixth chapter estimates the efficiency of microfinance organizations operating in the DRC, and tests whether there is a substantial difference in efficiency distribution between MFIs with and without the provision of agricultural credit. The findings reveal that the inefficiency in MFIs from the DRC is more scale inefficiency than technical inefficiency. Furthermore, the results show that many MFIs from the sample are working on the frontier of the double bottom efficiency line, and a higher level of average technical efficiency score in the double bottom efficiency model. This challenges what is often stated in the mainstream literature that social performance and financial sustainability are conflicting objectives. In addition, the results reveal non-substantial difference in efficiency distribution between MFIs with and without the provision of agricultural microcredit. The findings of this dissertation yield some policy implications. The findings imply, among other things, new ways to think about the role of the public sector, donors and traditional financial institutions in financing the small scale and local MFIs as most of them are liquidity-constrained. Lending technology applied in microfinance needs to be adapted to farm-households. Thus, the repayment frequency and loan maturity should be adapted to farm-household cash flows. The collateral should be diversified and extended to non-physical assets,such as land property and social pressure. This requires public interventions to promote social networks and improve farm-household access to landholding property, which will help collaterizing loans, and therefore reducing the risk of being credit-constrained. There is also need for MFIs to set up lending technology and innovations to provide adequate medium and long term credit adapted to the specific needs of agriculture. Toadress the isssue of high risk and low returns of agriculture, there isa need of public policy and investment to increase farmers access to new technology and innovations such as HYV, which will improve agricultural profitability. MFIs, especially NGOs with microcredit program, have an important role to play by providing high yielding input credit and various mechanisms, such as insurance, to cope with risks. Public investment in human capital and social capital is likely to improve agricultural efficiency since the education level of the household head and association participation are found to be positively correlated with the technical efficiency sore of farm-households. Furthermore, public investment with support of donors might create risk-guarantee funds to copewith systemic risk. Finally, the findings of this dissertationyield also some recommendations for further research. It would be important to go deeper, by testing how the profile and performance of MFIs affect the probability that a farm-household is rationed. Further researchmay be needed to examine how institutional design and the logical framework affect the outreach of MFIs and the poors access to microcredit. Research may also be needed to explore the key drivers affecting the efficiency of microfinance. There is need for a better understanding of thiscausal relationship in the dynamic and multivariate perspective, using for example, the panel data from a large geographical area. status: publishe...|$|R

CAT bonds and other risk-linked secu-rities are {{innovative}} financial vehicles that have an important role to play in fi-nancing mega-catastrophes and other types of losses. The vehicles are especially important because they access capital markets directly, exponentially expanding <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> beyond the limited capital held by insurers and reinsurers. The CAT bond market has been growing steadily, with record amounts of risk capital raised in 2005, 2006, and 2007.

CAT bonds now appear to be priced competitively with conventional catas-trophe reinsurance and comparably rated corporate bonds. CAT bonds have grown {{to the extent that they}} now play a major role in completing the market for catastrophic-risk finance and are spreading to other lines such as automo-bile insurance, life insurance, and annuities.

An effort is made to link this concept with the definitions of governance employed within the literature of transaction cost economics and corporate governance. The RBC approach distinguishes itself from extant views of project governance through its ability to quantitatively integrate organizational (e. g., delivery system), contractual (e. g., risk-sharing ratio) and financial (e. g., insurance cover) measures. This novel approach provides an avenue for incorporating the project's historical construction and operating data into the design of project governance; an advantage with the potential to exponentially increase as a torrent of digital data is made available through the deployment of emergent information technologies (e. g. building information modelling) ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presence}} of overlapping generations, markets are incomplete because {{it is impossible to}} engage in risksharing trades with the unborn. In such an environment the government can use a social security system, with contingent taxes and benefits, to improve risksharing across generations. An interesting question is how the form of the social security system affects asset prices in equilibrium. In this paper we set up a simple model with two risky factors of production: human capital, owned by the young, and physical capital, owned by all older generations. We show that a social security system that optimally shares risks across generations exposes future generations to a share of the risk in physical capital returns. Such a system reduces precautionary saving and increases the <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the economy.

The mainstream theoretical models on stock market crashes {{are rooted in}} rationalexpectations equilibrium models and classicalmarket microstructure models. Compared to theoretical works, there areeven fewer works done on the empirical side. This is because most ofthe theoretical models do not provide straightforward tests againstempirical data. Secondly, the relatively smallsample size (rare occurrence) of stock market crashes is always an obstacle forempirical testing. In this dissertation, we build a strategic trading model to link two major US stock marketcrashes: the 1987 crash and the 2010 Flash Crash. We then providecross-sectional empirical evidence to verify our model hypothesis and evaluate price impact dueto the information asymmetry effect and the limited <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> effect. We use statistical learningmethods to compare our model based predictors with other predictorsfor the maximum cross-sectional price drawdown of SP 500 stocks during the 2010 Flash Crash andcheck the robustness of ourfindings...|$|E
