6000|$|Saxton made {{a little}} {{impatient}} gesture. [...] "Then I guess {{you have got to}} learn, {{and there are plenty of}} men to be hired in the bush who do. You know how to <b>rough</b> <b>down</b> redwood logs and blow out rocks?" ...|$|R
60|$|The lane which Sir Daniel {{had been}} {{following}} {{came to an abrupt}} end. Before him there was a stretch of <b>rough</b> <b>down,</b> and the noise of the sea-surf was audible upon one hand. There were no guards in the neighbourhood, nor any light in that quarter of the town.|$|R

"You see," [...] said Sam Shipton, as Letta {{led them}} down the rugged mountain-side, [...] "we may as well make {{ourselves}} comfortable while we remain here, and I'm inclined {{to think that a}} hut, however <b>rough,</b> <b>down</b> in one of these charming valleys, will be more agreeable than the gloomy cavern on the mountain-top." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'So {{much the}} better, friend. Give me bone--bone and {{endurance}} for this <b>rough</b> <b>down</b> country. Your delicate Nisaeans {{are all very}} well {{for a few minutes}} over those flat sands of Egypt: but here you need a horse who will go forty miles a day over rough and smooth, and dine thankfully off thistles at night. Aha, poor little man!'--as a jerboa sprang up from a tuft of bushes at his feet--'I fear you must help to fill our soup-kettle in these hard times.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} don't fall in with any <b>rough</b> {{characters}} <b>down</b> there," [...] said Mrs. Dick Rover. [...] "They tell me {{there are some}} men in the oil fields who are anything but nice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{advice is}} good," [...] the man went on earnestly. [...] "They are a <b>rough</b> lot <b>down</b> there, and hang together. You {{will have to}} do it sudden, {{whatever}} you do, or you will get the hull neighborhood up agin you." ...|$|R

50|$|In late Medieval {{times the}} deer park fell into {{disrepair}} and was finally dispaled. Knights no longer took the <b>rough</b> ride <b>down</b> The Withens toward Wakefield tourney. The wild boars, stags and wolves were in serious decline and sheep were now the major local industry.|$|R
50|$|From {{the main}} road it is around 3.5 km <b>rough</b> road <b>down</b> towards the village. The main sources of income of this place was/is working in the Tea Garden but some are engage with {{agriculture}} and some went to work different parts of India and abroad.|$|R
60|$|He {{perceived}} {{at length}} that the strollers were {{not all of}} the same conditions. There were rough, brown cow-boys from La Junta and Cajon, and miners in <b>rough</b> dress <b>down</b> from the gulches for a night, but mainly the promenaders appealed to him with elegance of dress and manner.|$|R
6000|$|The two {{had hardly}} {{got out of}} the [...] "city," [...] and the {{thoroughly}} bad character of the road was already apparent. Riding over it was very much like sailing in a small boat on <b>rough</b> water--always <b>down</b> by the head or up by the stern, but seldom on an even keel.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} pore surface {{roughness}} on Knudsen diffusion in nanoporous media is investigated by dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and analytical calculations. A conceptual difference is {{found between the}} roughness dependence of the macroscopic, transport diffusivity and the microscopic, self-diffusivity, which is reminiscent of diffusion in zeolites, where a similar difference arises due to adsorption effects and intermolecular interactions. Because of the dependence of the self-diffusivity on molecular residence times, self-diffusion may be roughness dependent, while transport diffusion is not. Detailed proofs are given. The differences become significant when the pore surface is <b>rough</b> <b>down</b> to molecular scales, as is the case, e. g., for many common sol–gel materials. Simulations are in good agreement with analytical calculations for several tested rough, fractal pore structures. These results are important for the interpretation of experimental diffusion measurements and {{for the study of}} diffusion-reaction processes in nanoporous catalysts with a rough internal surface.

50|$|The Echo Camp Backtrack drive leads {{through some}} {{wonderful}} country {{and then over}} the hills (<b>rough)</b> and <b>down</b> onto the plains east of the Flinders Ranges. This joins another track back to Arkaroola via Claude’s Pass, Stubb’s Waterhole (including aboriginal cave paintings), Bararranna Gorge (an area where yellow-footed rock wallabies are commonly found), Welcome Pound and back to main road to the Arkaroola Village.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after {{exiting the}} park, the river quiets {{significantly}} before Big Spring Falls. The falls was recreated in 1995 when a dam built in 1908 was removed {{to help restore}} the river. The removal of the dam has allowed the sturgeon a greater range on the river. There is a small picnic area next to the falls, {{and a bit of}} a <b>rough</b> portage <b>down</b> to the water.|$|R
50|$|Victoria Jute Mills at Telenipara, Bhadreswar was {{established}} in 1885 and employs about 5,000 people. The mill is passing through a <b>rough</b> phase, closing <b>down</b> and opening off and on with militant labour in a volatile environment.|$|R
50|$|The Anatori River {{is a small}} {{river in}} a remote part of Tasman District in the far {{northwest}} of the South Island of New Zealand.The river rises as two streams (north and south branch) in the Wakamarama Range, running northwest then north for approximately 12 km. The river mouth is accessible via a <b>rough</b> road <b>down</b> the west coast from Farewell Spit and Collingwood, the nearest town. There is a tiny settlement, Anatori, at the river mouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{is to cut}} a slab of the rough rock with a slab saw, and next to stencil a shape from a template. The slab is then trimmed near the marked line using a diamond blade saw—called a trim saw. Diamond impregnated wheels or silicon carbide wheels {{can be used to}} grind the <b>rough</b> rock <b>down.</b> Most lapidary workshops and production facilities have moved away from silicon carbide to diamond grinding wheels or flat lap disks.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, Marcel and Paddy {{find the}} wolves and direct {{them to a}} train over a snowy {{mountain}} that will take them to Jasper. Climbing the mountain, Humphrey meets a grizzly bear cub whose never seen wolves, but a mishap gets the cub hurt angering a trio of adult grizzly bears. Kate comes to Humphrey's rescue and after a <b>rough</b> slide <b>down</b> the mountain manage to board the passing train before the bears devour them.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, in the north-west and {{south-west}} we saw--rare {{thing in}} Arabia!--Iris holding two perfect bows {{at the same}} time, {{not to speak of}} [...] "wind dogs." [...] Zephyrus, the wester, here a noted bad character, rose from his rocky couch strong and <b>rough,</b> beating <b>down</b> the mercury to 56 degrees F.: after an hour he made way for Eurus; and the latter was presently greeted by Boreas in one of his most boisterous and blustering moods.|$|R
50|$|The {{head of the}} Kentmere valley lies to the {{south-west}} of the {{fell with}} <b>rough</b> slopes leading <b>down</b> over scree to Kentmere Reservoir. Mardale Ill Bell sends out a short grass-topped spur, Lingmell End, which splits {{the head of the}} valley into two.|$|R

60|$|Andrew {{put on the}} {{waterproof}} {{jacket that}} had been given him, {{and looked at the}} pit. A <b>rough</b> ladder ran <b>down</b> its side, but the man at the windlass turned to him as he emptied a big can into the drainage trench.|$|R
60|$|Ambrose hurried {{the three}} women over the <b>rough</b> rocks, <b>down</b> the cliff. The cowboys below were {{saddling}} horses in haste. Evidently all the horses had been brought out of hiding. Swiftly, with regard only for life and limb, Madeline, Helen, and Christine were lowered by lassoes and half carried down to the level. By {{the time they were}} safely down {{the other members of the}} party appeared on the cliff above. They were in excellent spirits, appearing to treat the matter as a huge joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "They ain't {{no worse}} nor {{we had at}} home during the Spanish war, lad. I know one picture I see o' a <b>Rough</b> Rider riding <b>down</b> half a dozen Spanish soldiers. An' the truth o' the matter is, them Rough Riders didn't have no horses at all but fought on foot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I have {{no doubt}} we shall like it very much when we are once settled. They look a <b>rough</b> lot <b>down</b> below, and that sentry {{standing}} with a loaded musket at the gangway shows pretty well what sort of men they are. I am not surprised that the pressed men should try to get away, but I have no pity for the drunken fellows who joined when they had spent their last shilling. Our fishermen go on a spree sometimes, but not often, and when they do, they quarrel and fight a bit, but they always go to work the next morning.” ...|$|R
60|$|He nodded briefly, {{but without}} verbal salutation. He seemed to regard my remark {{as he would}} have {{regarded}} the unmannerly heckling of some one {{at the back of the}} hall. He proceeded evenly with his speech, and was still talking when Celia addressed her ball and drove off. Her drive, coinciding with a sharp rhetorical question from George, wavered in mid-air, and the ball trickled off into the <b>rough</b> half-way <b>down</b> the hill. I can see the poor girl's tortured face even now. But she breathed no word of reproach. Such is the miracle of women's love.|$|R
50|$|The {{pieces of}} wood between the notches are knocked off with an axe, this process called juggling or joggling. This results in a <b>rough</b> surface pared <b>down</b> just shy of the marked line. Scoring and juggling remove {{a fair amount of}} wood, make hewing easier and prevent long shreds of wood being torn off.|$|R
60|$|Amy, {{ashamed of}} her {{disposition}} to cry at the remembrance of the dear departed <b>rough</b> terrier, bent <b>down</b> {{to hide her}} glowing face, and {{held out her hand}} to the dog, which at last ventured to advance, still creeping with his body curved till his tail was foremost, looking imploringly at his master, as if to entreat his pardon.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall tell you," [...] Nigel declared, [...] "of a {{small country}} house I have in Devonshire. There are <b>rough</b> grounds {{stretching}} <b>down</b> to the sea and crawling up to the moors behind. My grandfather built {{it when he was}} Chancellor of England, or rather he added to an old farmhouse. He called it the House of Peace." ...|$|R
