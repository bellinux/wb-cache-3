5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they <b>roll</b> <b>with</b> their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing {{the ball with}} their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when {{elections for the}} Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and the other half non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African <b>roll</b> <b>with</b> both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
5|$|Systematic U.S. aerial {{operations}} against the Ho Chi Minh Trail had begun on 14 December 1964 with Operation Barrel <b>Roll.</b> <b>With</b> {{the onset of}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam in April 1965, the U.S. also expanded its interdiction effort in Laos by dividing the Barrel Roll area into two sections on 3 April. The former operation would continue in northeastern Laos while Operation Steel Tiger was initiated in the southern panhandle. The American headquarters in Saigon requested, and received, authorization to control bombing in the area adjacent to South Vietnam's northern provinces in Operation Tiger Hound on 3 December 1965.|$|E

He recorded the album {{in his home}} bedroom with a 4-track recorder and played guitar, bass, keyboard, and an organ. A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as {{falling in love with}} his wife and reconciling his love for rock and <b>roll</b> <b>with</b> the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle.|$|E

One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage <b>roll</b> <b>with</b> a salad and a truffle dressing. Other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and licorice, and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E
5|$|Kalighat {{painting}} {{originated in}} 19th century Kolkata {{as a local}} style that reflected a variety of themes including mythology and quotidian life. The Government College of Art and Craft, founded in 1864, has been the cradle as well as workplace of eminent artists including Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, and Nandalal Bose. The art college was {{the birthplace of the}} Bengal school of art that arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the prevalent academic art styles in the early 20th century. The Academy of Fine Arts and other art galleries hold regular art exhibitions. The city is recognised for its appreciation of Rabindra sangeet (songs written by Rabindranath Tagore) and Indian classical music, with important concerts and recitals, such as Dover Lane Music Conference, being held throughout the year; Bengali popular music, including baul folk ballads, kirtans, and Gajan festival music; and modern music, including Bengali-language adhunik songs. Since the early 1990s, new genres have emerged, including one comprising alternative folk–rock Bengali bands. Another new style, jibonmukhi gaan ("songs about life"), is based on realism. Key elements of Kolkata's cuisine include rice and a fish curry known as machher jhol, which can be accompanied by desserts such as roshogolla, sandesh, and a sweet yoghurt known as mishti dohi. Bengal's large repertoire of seafood dishes includes various preparations of ilish, a fish that is a favourite among Calcuttans. Street foods such as beguni (fried battered eggplant slices), kati roll (flatbread <b>roll</b> <b>with</b> vegetable or chicken, mutton, or egg stuffing), phuchka (a deep-fried crêpe with tamarind sauce) and Indian Chinese cuisine from Chinatown are popular.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of {{comparative}} tests on sections of asphalt pavement <b>rolled</b> <b>with</b> conventional steel-wheel rollers and those <b>rolled</b> <b>with</b> a ntb-ber-tire roller added between the steel-wheel breakdown and steel wheel finish roll-ers. Nuclear density and air voids were used as measures of potential differences between sections. Of the 15 projects tested, which included 90 comparisons of aver-ages and standard deviation, the sections <b>rolled</b> <b>with</b> the rubber-tire roller added were statistically significantly (a =. 05) "better " in only 11 percent. Sections <b>rolled</b> <b>with</b> the conventional steel-wheel rollers were statistically significantly (a =. 05) "better " in 13 percent. In the author's opinion, this does not indicate that the addi-tion of the rubber-tire roller was actually detrimental. There were most likely other variables in the pavement, rolling, and/or testing that created the differences. How-ever, {{it is obvious that}} this testing showed no consistent measurable benefit as a re-sult of the addition of a rubber-tire roller. FINAL REPOR...|$|R
