5|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by <b>reacting</b> K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by <b>reacting</b> thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by <b>reacting</b> thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by <b>reacting</b> neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} <b>reacting</b> different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then <b>reacting</b> it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by <b>reacting</b> neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
