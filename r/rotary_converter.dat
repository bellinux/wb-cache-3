2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} <b>rotary</b> <b>converter,</b> is not strictly a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E

50|$|General Electric {{installed}} <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> in B&O's powerhouse near Mt. Royal Station, {{having a}} combined capacity of 5,000 kW to convert 13,200-volt, 3 phase, 25-cycle AC to 675 volts DC. In 1936, these <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> {{were replaced by}} mercury arc rectifiers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> {{are still}} used as {{frequency}} converters.|$|R
50|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, 25 Hz power was much more readily available from commercial electrical utilities. The vast majority of urban subway systems used 25 Hz power to supply their lineside <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> used to generate the DC voltage supplied to the trains. Since <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> work more efficiently with lower frequency supplies, 25 Hz was a common supply frequency for these machines. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> have been steadily replaced over the past 70 years with, at first, mercury arc rectifiers and more lately solid-state rectifiers. Thus, the need for special frequency power for urban traction has disappeared, along with the financial motivation for utilities to operate generators at these frequencies.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> over the discrete motor-generator set is that the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> to be much smaller and lighter than a motor-generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a motor-generator set include adjustable voltage regulation which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater surge and transient protection, and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{envision}} {{what is happening}} in an AC-to-DC <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> is to imagine a rotary reversing switch that is being driven at a speed that is synchronous with the power line. Such a switch could rectify the AC input waveform with no magnetic components at all save those driving the switch. The <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the reversing switch, but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical.|$|E
50|$|At each facility, {{power from}} an AC power grid was {{converted}} to DC to feed into an overhead line or a third rail of a railway. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converter</b> plants {{were also used}} for coupling power grids of different frequencies and operation modes. The former Neuhof Substation {{was an example of}} the latter. Former machinery transmitters like the Alexanderson alternator were, strictly speaking, <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> plants.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the initial}} 600 volt direct current (DC) installation, Ultimo Power Station {{supplied}} three phase alternating current (AC) at 6600 volts, 25 cycles per second. Originally, this current was not stepped up for transmission. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> {{were used to}} convert the three phase AC to 600 volts DC for the tram supply. The 1500 volt DC heavy rail electrification commenced operation in 1926 and also initially utilised high capacity <b>rotary</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Paddington {{substation}} was automatic, {{equipped with}} an 1100 KVA transformer, a British-Thomson-Houston 1000 kW <b>rotary</b> <b>converter,</b> switchgear, support services, and an overhead crane (designed by the Tramways Department). The substation received 11000 volts AC electricity from the New Farm Power station, via an underground feeder cable. The transformer reduced this supply, which the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> then converted to 600 volts DC for the tramways network.|$|E

50|$|The {{technology}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> was replaced {{in the early}} 20th century by mercury-vapor rectifiers, which were smaller, did not produce vibration and noise, and required less maintenance. The same conversion tasks are now performed by solid state power semiconductor devices. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> remained in use in the West Side IRT subway in Manhattan into the late 1960s, and possibly some years later. They were powered by 25 Hz AC, and provided DC at 600 volts for the trains.|$|R

5000|$|William Le Roy Emmet (July 10, 1858 [...] - [...] September 26, 1941) was an {{electrical}} engineer who made major contributions to alternating current power systems including the design of large <b>rotary</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>rotary</b> phase <b>converter</b> is a {{three-phase}} motor with special starting arrangements and {{power factor correction}} that produces balanced three-phase voltages. When properly designed, these <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> can allow satisfactory operation of a {{three-phase motor}} on a single-phase source. In such a device, the energy storage is performed by the inertia (flywheel effect) of the rotating components. An external flywheel is sometimes found on one or {{both ends of the}} shaft.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} modern power {{semiconductor}} technology, <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> are still common for feeding railway systems with AC {{of a different}} frequency {{from that of the}} main electricity grid. In Europe, this would typically be for 15 kV AC railway electrification.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> {{plant is}} a {{facility}} at which {{one form of}} electricity is converted into another form of electricity by {{using a combination of}} an electric motor and an electric generator. The installed combinations of motors and generators at a plant determine the possible type(s) of conversion. Such facilities also allow the setting of voltages and frequencies, if appropriate equipment is installed. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converter</b> plants were commonplace in railway electrification before the invention of mercury arc rectifiers in the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The Reading's {{system used}} {{catenary}} electrified at 12 kV 25 Hz like the competing Pennsylvania Railroad's 1915 initial electrification and 1930s mainline expansion. Unlike the PRR's system, which included multiple power sources and an extensive high-voltage transmission network, the Reading's electrification was supplied solely by the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> station at Wayne Junction. Although ownership {{and operation of}} the system has changed, the system has remained essentially unchanged {{with the exception of}} the replacement of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> station at Wayne Junction with a solid-state cycloconverter in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> can {{be thought}} of as a motor-generator, where the two {{machines}} share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator which allows DC current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the slip rings which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator.|$|E

50|$|Traction {{power was}} at first {{supplied}} by two substations, transformed and converted from a 6,600 volt ac main fed from the docks generating station. The first was built three miles from Immingham by Siemens Brothers. Two Westinghouse 250 kW <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> produced 500 V DC for the trams. Traction feeders were installed every half-mile. The substation itself was a redbrick construction, built by Dennis Gill & Sons of Doncaster for £507. The 1913 extension was supplied by a substation within the dock estate. The second substation, continuously manned, was also built by Gill, for £707, next to the car sheds at Pyewipe. It contained three 250 kW Westinghouse <b>rotary</b> <b>converters.</b> One converter was used for lighting, one for traction and the third as a standby. From 26 November 1957 high tension power was drawn from the National Grid and the dock power station was closed down.|$|R

50|$|Originally, the {{conversion}} equipment usually consisted {{of one or}} more motor-generator sets containing three-phase synchronous AC motors and single-phase AC generators, mechanically coupled to a common shaft. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> were also used, especially where the desired output was DC current from an AC source.|$|R
50|$|Direct-current {{power was}} not entirely {{displaced}} by alternating current and was useful in railway and electrochemical processes.

50|$|AC {{replaced}} DC in most {{applications and}} eventually the need for local DC substations diminished along {{with the need for}} <b>rotary</b> <b>converters.</b> Many DC customers converted to AC power, and on-site solid-state DC rectifiers were used to power the remaining DC equipment from the AC supply.|$|R
