Keywords: Effects of Pre-questioning, Reading Comprehension Students {{have some}} {{problems}} in learning English, especially in reading comprehension. So that, English teacher should be creative in selecting the technique to teach reading. In this research, the researcher is interested in finding out the effects pre-questioning technique on the students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> in narrative text. The research problems are: 1) How is students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> before being taught by using pre-questioning technique?” 2) How is students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> after being taught by using pre-questioning technique? 3) Is there any significant different between students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> before and after being taught by using pre-questioning technique? The research objectives are: 1) To know the students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> before being taught by using pre-questioning technique, 2) To know the students’ reading comprehension after being taught by using pre-questioning technique, 3) To find out whether there is any significant effect of using pre-questioning technique on the students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement.</b> This research used pre-experimental research with quantitative approach. The population was all the students of the second grade which consists of 55 students. The researcher took of VIII. B class as the sample. The instrument {{of this research is}} test of data were collected by administering pre-test and post test. Data analysis of this research was using Paired Samples T test with SPSS 16. 0 for windows. This research reveals that the mean score before being taught by using pre-questioning technique was 70. 4074. Meanwhile the mean score obtained after using pre-questioning technique was 80. 0741. Tcount was 12. 756 and Ttablewas 2. 056 with significant level 0. 05 was 0. 00.

40|$|Reading Comprehension {{involves}} both lexical and grammatical aspects. I {{believe that}} in order to comprehend a reading passage well, one should have a wide range of vocabulary (=lexical aspect) and good knowledge of structure (=grammatical aspect), also a adequate general knowledge. Interested in finding out whether there is a positive correlation between the students' structure, vocabulary and general knowledge <b>achievements</b> and their <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement,</b> I decided to make a study on structure, vocabulary, general knowledge, and <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievements</b> of the first year students of SMA Stella Maris to see whether they really correspond to each other. The study in this paper makes use of one part of the statistical methodology of research that is the Correlation Analysis, which analyses the data to find out the degree {{of the relationship between the}} structure <b>achievement</b> and the <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement,</b> between the vocabulary <b>achievement</b> and the <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement,</b> and between the general knowledge and the <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement.</b> To obtain the data in the form of scores, first I made test items on structure, vocabulary, general knowledge, and reading comprehension. The total number of the test items is 70 items, which are all in the form of multiple-choice items. After computing the entire tests using Kuder-Richardson Formula 21 (KR 21), I found out that the reliability coefficient of the structure test is 0. 71, the reliability coefficient of the vocabulary test is 0. 73, the reliability coefficient of the general knowledge test is 0. 71, and the reliability coefficient of the reading comprehension test is 0. 74. These figures show that all the four test may be regarded satisfactory. To know the degree of the relationship, I use the Pearson Product Moment Correlation to obtain the correlation coefficient-The correlation coefficient tells us two things: the indication of the magnitude of the relationship, and the direction of the relationship. When two sets of variables are positively related, the increase of one variable is followed by the increase of the other variable. On the other hand, when they are negatively related, the increase of one variable is followed by the decrease of the other variable. After all scores are computed using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Formula, it can be seen that the correlation coefficient of the structure and <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> is 0. 81; the correlation coefficient of the vocabulary and <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> is 0. 77; and the correlation coefficient of the general knowledge and <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement</b> is 0. 79. This means that there is a significant correlation between the structure, the vocabulary, and the general knowledge achievements of the first year students of SMA Stella Maris and their <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>achievement...</b>|$|R
