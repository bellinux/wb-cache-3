5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E

5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
40|$|Resonance based target {{recognition}} {{has been}} well studied {{for the last three}} decades. The purely target dependent natural <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> are used as a feature set for target classification.

40|$|Abstract- Recently, {{resonance}} {{phenomenon in}} {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) is widely used to deliver power to a load over relatively large air gap via magnetic coupling. Since many reactive components in WPT system are contributed to the resonance phenomenon, there are many <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Theses <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> have different and distinguishing features. For this reason, {{the analysis of the}} resonant tank at various <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> is required to understand WPT system more easily. Therefore, in this paper, three <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> in series-series compensated WPT (SS-WPT) system are defined. And then, this paper is aiming to present the features of SS-WPT system in the major two of the three <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The analysis is supported with experimental results.

The two-colour FEL interaction is achieved using a series of undulator modules alternately tuned to two well-separated <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Using the broad bandwidth FEL simulation code Puffin, the electron beam is shown to bunch strongly and simultaneously at the two <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Electron bunching components are also generated at the sum and difference of the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency,</b> leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} is {{presented}} which permits {{the prediction of}} the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> created by antipodal finline waveguide to microstrip transitions. The transition is modeled as a tapered transmission line in series with an infinite set of coupled resonant circuits. The resonant circuits are modeled as simple microwave resonant cavities of which the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> are easily determined. The model is developed and the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> determined for several different transitions. Experimental results are given to confirm the models...|$|R
40|$|Resonance-based {{radar target}} {{recognition}} is {{premised on the}} observation of natural <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> so that target discrimination and classification can occur. This implies the use of ultra-wideband (UWB) radar in order to excite a sufficiently wide range of target frequencies, however developing practical UWB radar systems is a significant challenge. Furthermore, due the relative weakness of the late-time resonant target response, it is often not possible to isolate the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> under realistic noise conditions. To mitigate these limitations, this paper examines the feasibility of selective excitation of <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> using more traditional (narrow-to-medium band) excitation. Simulated target results are presented for which <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> are extracted, and the efficacy of selective excitation of these resonances is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|Frequencies {{at which}} the {{response}} amplitude is a relative maximum are known as the system's <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> or resonance <b>frequencies.</b> At <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies,</b> small periodic driving forces {{have the ability to}} produce large amplitude oscillations, due to the storage of vibrational energy.|$|R
5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E

In this paper, we propose the mutual coupling approach to derive the optimum free <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> and show the measured power transfer efficiency (PTE) using the transmission efficiency {{as well as the}} system energy efficiency. The results of the proposed approach exactly coincide with those of the previous work, and the fabricated prototype achieves the transmission efficiency of about 80 % by tuning the free <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> to the optimum values in the overcoupled state...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the central}} {{concepts}} in spectroscopy is a resonance and its corresponding <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency.</b> Resonances were first characterized in mechanical systems such as pendulums.
