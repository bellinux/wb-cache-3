30|$|Finally, the {{apparent}} {{reduction of the}} scarring effect associated with long-term unemployment suggests that activation policy need not be so heavily focused around durations, but instead should attempt {{to ensure that the}} claimants are equipped with the right skills and provided with the appropriate advice and training that would enable them <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> irrespective of their length of time spent in unemployment.|$|R
30|$|We {{present the}} {{estimation}} results {{for women and}} men separately. We test the robustness of our results and extend our results in two directions. We present estimation results where the coefficients are allowed to vary across two main occupational groups: female-dominated occupations, and integrated or male-dominated occupations. In addition, we estimate models where the coefficients of the work absence variables are allowed to vary depending on whether individuals change firms when they <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> after the work absence, or not.|$|R
40|$|A case-study {{approach}} is being used, to analyse {{the experiences of}} people who successfully <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> after a period out of work, and to develop understanding {{of the factors that}} unsuccessfully supported that transition. The research has to principal aims: To assess the impact of employment on the health of individuals, including on their wellbeing, health behaviours and demands on health services. There is a body of evidence about the impact of unemployment on health, but there has been perhaps less research on the impact of employment and, in particular, how transitions from unemployment to work impact on health. To identify the way in which key services, delivered both individually and alongside other services, have been instrumental in moving people with health issues towards and into <b>employment,</b> and helping <b>to</b> sustain and progress them once in employment...|$|R
30|$|The {{study also}} {{identifies}} that labour demand is evolving in an uneven pattern {{with respect to}} {{both male and female}} dominated industries. Over the period in question, <b>employment</b> growth appears <b>to</b> have been particularly skewed towards female dominated sectors, which has resulted in a substantial lowering in the likelihood that males will exit the Live Register 18 in any three-month period. Although no significant sectoral effects were obvious at the one-digit industry-level, the results point to the possible existence of structural unemployment within the male claimant population, with the risk likely to be high for persons previously employed in particular construction occupations. Activation policy has, to date, failed to identify or address the degree to which particular occupations have been disproportionately disadvantaged in terms of <b>re-entering</b> <b>employment,</b> and the results suggest that more action is required in this respect.|$|R
40|$|In Britain, {{part time}} {{employment}} is typically used to combine work and motherhood: 60 % of employed mothers in Britain work part time, and this usually involves {{a transition from}} full time employment around the first childbirth. Part time jobs are often situated in lower level occupational groups and so a transition from full <b>to</b> part time <b>employment</b> may reduce the wage. Using the British Household Panel Survey this study investigates the wage impact of switching from full <b>to</b> part time <b>employment.</b> Furthermore, mother-specific wage impacts of <b>re-entering</b> <b>employment</b> after childbirth via part time employment are analysed. A mother of one child receives a pay penalty of 7 %, switching <b>to</b> part time <b>employment</b> increases this <b>to</b> 13 %. Mothers who move from full <b>to</b> part time <b>employment</b> over childbirth receive lower wages than mothers who remained in full or part time employment over childbirth for 10 years after the birth...|$|R
30|$|Model  2 {{shows that}} {{accounting}} for the part-time rate in an occupation does not fundamentally affect the relationship observed. Accordingly, the proportion of women still has a negative impact on the mothers’ probability of returning, but the effect’s level of significance decreases. By contrast, the part-time rate alone {{does not have any}} significant impact on returning to the labour market. This contradicts our assumption made in hypothesis  2 that increasing part-time rates in occupations reduce the length of an interruption by offering better options for reconciling work and family. Obviously, high part-time rates in occupations are not sufficient to enable women <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> quickly following the birth of a child.|$|R

Rather, those who lose their jobs are much less likely <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> in later years. Our findings for women with disabilities suggest that adverse labor markets do not have a disproportionately large impact on employment exits, though they do induce program entry...|$|R

30|$|Fig.  1 {{shows the}} {{importance}} of statutory parental leave regulations, as most returns take place {{during the first three}} years of parental leave. In month  36 of the employment interruption we see a distinct step: Almost 20 % of the mothers who have not returned by then <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> in this month. The occupation only becomes relevant after the end of the statutory parental leave period. From this point, we observe significant differences in the return behaviour of women who had previously worked in a male-dominated occupation compared to women who had worked in an occupation dominated by women. 29 On the whole, women from male-dominated occupations return to the labour market more quickly and in a greater proportion than women from female-dominated occupations. Women who had worked in integrated occupations before the birth of the first child are in the middle.|$|R

30|$|This article {{documents}} {{a strong}} connection between unemployment and mental distress {{using data from}} the Spanish National Health Survey. We exploit the collapse of the construction sector to identify the causal effect of job losses in different segments of the Spanish labor market. Our results suggest that an increase of the unemployment rate by 10 percentage points due to the breakdown in construction raised reported poor health and mental disorders in the affected population by 3 percentage points, respectively. We argue that the size of this effect responds {{to the fact that the}} construction sector was at the center of the economic recession. As a result, workers exposed to the negative labor demand shock faced very low chances of <b>re-entering</b> <b>employment.</b> We show that this led to long unemployment spells, stress, hopelessness, and feelings of uselessness. These effects point towards a potential channel for unemployment hysteresis.|$|R
30|$|We {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} life-cycle motivational models which involve employers deferring compensation. These models imply tenure earnings slopes that are steeper than productivity increases as firms cause workers to post a quasi-bond that is repaid only later in tenure and dependent upon sufficient effort. In essence, the bond increases the cost of job loss and so creates effort incentives. The fact that workers are paid far more than their productivity late in their tenure makes mandatory retirement a frequent feature of deferred compensation. While this might create life-cycle efficiencies by increasing motivation, it creates difficulties for those older workers trying <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment.</b> They cannot be motivated by life-cycle profiles and they cannot be paid the same as others with their experience receiving wages above productivity because of such profiles. The consequence seems often to simply not hire older workers or to relegate them to non-career and part time jobs.|$|R
3000|$|Note {{that the}} IV {{estimates}} {{of the effect of}} unemployment on mental health are larger in magnitude than the OLS reported in Table  2. This larger effect corresponds to the sub-sample of the population on which the effect is identified, namely workers who lost their job {{as a consequence of the}} collapse of the construction sector. As discussed in Section 3, employment in construction fell by about 60 % between 2007 and 2013 and the large majority of those who lost their job in construction, 2.7 % of the active population, slipped into unemployment spells that lasted longer than one year. Accordingly, while workers negatively affected by an idiosyncratic shock can quickly find a new job in any other firm, workers laid off by the shut down of an entire sector find themselves trapped into unemployment. Failure <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> for those who try hardest might have very high costs on mental health. 28 [...]...|$|R
30|$|Once the {{individual}} is unemployed T_u, the second selection process takes place. The unemployed worker can <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> when he receives a job offer and accepts it. In Spain, the offer arrival rate for jobs with permanent contracts is notably lower than the rate for jobs with temporary contracts. Accordingly, although the design of UIS might influence the timing {{and the type of}} exit we have two competing effects in this case. Specifically, lengthier benefit entitlement periods lead to longer unemployment spells, which may negatively affect the arrival rate and types of job offers {{the individual}} receives (due to the depreciation of general human capital skills, negative signalling, etc.). However, the longer the benefit entitlement period and corresponding lengthier unemployment spell might give the worker adequate time to search for and find a good and durable job offer (i.e., employment with a permanent contract). Hence, there is a selection process wherein the composition of the subsample of job seekers (with respect to observables and non-observables) is different than the subsample of new job entrants.|$|R
30|$|Earlier {{research}} {{has established a}} substantial and persistent effect of displacement on labour market success. Especially in the USA, researchers {{have been interested in}} this phenomenon for decades 1. They have shown a severe and permanent drop in earnings after displacement. The European literature on displacement is more recent and focuses more on the incidence of (un)employment instead of just on earnings or wages 2. In general, the US literature has found that losses are primarily caused by lower wages in post-displacement jobs, whereas evidence from many European countries finds almost no wage losses for those who <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment,</b> but find significantly lower employment probabilities instead (Hijzen et al. 2010). Differences between age groups are found both in the USA and in Europe 3. Some studies explore the relation between labour market success after displacement and long tenure in the previous job (Hijzen et al. (2010), Kuhn (2002)) or changing industry (Burda and Mertens (2001), Huttunen et al. (2011)), but they do not analyse how these correlations differ between age groups.|$|R

40|$|The Work Programme’s use {{of severe}} social {{security}} benefit sanctions reflects British coalition ministers’ belief {{that many people}} on out-of-work benefits {{do not want a}} job. While a substantial empirical literature has repeatedly demonstrated that in fact unemployed benefit claimants possess the same work values as the employed and that the vast majority want paid work, it has ignored some conservative authors’ pleas to consider the views and experiences of people who work with the unemployed. Forty employees of agencies contracted to help unemployed people into employment were interviewed in summer 2011. Respondents had spent an estimated combined total of 147, 000 hours in the presence of people who have claimed Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) for over six months. Most said that between a quarter and half of their present clients did not want employment. This finding does not contradict existing research, given that most JSA claimants <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> within six months. However, all forty agreed that many others remained unemployed because they were choosy in the jobs they were willing to undertake, and,most strikingly, respondents overwhelmingly endorsed the view that a ‘dependency culture’ exists in households and neighbourhoods that have experienced joblessness for several generations...|$|R

30|$|Third, {{temporary}} contracts {{played a}} prominent role for labour market dynamics during the Great Recession {{in a number of}} European countries.

40|$|In this article, {{the effects}} of non-employment in early work-life on {{subsequent}} employment chances of individuals in the Netherlands are examined. A main concern is whether the experience of non-employment {{in the beginning of}} the career (permanently) damages a worker’s later employment opportunities (that is, the likelihood of exit out of and re-entry into employment). The empirical analysis is based on five retrospective life-history surveys collected in the Netherlands in the period 1992 – 2003, with full information on employment histories of individuals. The analytic sample consists of 7, 761 respondents, who left education since the 1950 s. The results of the empirical analysis first of all show that the duration of non-employment in the first 3 years after leaving education (and not the number of non-employment spells in that period) increases the likelihood of exiting employment in the subsequent time period (up until 15 years after leaving education). This finding holds for both men and women. Second, a negative duration effect of non-employment on the likelihood of <b>re-entering</b> <b>employment</b> after a job loss is found, but for men only. These results imply that non-employment in early work-life indeed has a scarring effect on subsequent employment chances of individuals in the Dutch labour market...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on a {{discussion}} of three concepts; trajectories, transitions and transformations. The paper will present a particular configuration of these concepts which presents a life course approach to work / learning transitions. This approach can be deployed with existing workers, those in precarious employment and those wishing <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> <b>employment</b> and / or re-engage with formal learning. Firstly {{the changing nature of}} transitions and transitional types will be discussed before exploring research involving learning identities and learning trajectories; (Gorard et al 2001). The notion of transitional labour markets (TLMs) and its implications for post compulsory education and training provision (Schmid 2002; Ziguras 2005; Anderson 2005) will then be discussed along with the pedagogic approaches of ‘biographicity‘ (Alheit, 2002) and transformative learning designs (Mezirow 1991). The lifecourse approach to work / learning transitions presented calls for an expanded understanding of the different types of transitions and the crucial role of identity (vocational and learner) in navigating these transitions. The paper will challenge the dominant conceptualisations of learning / work transitions and examine the restrictive structural factors within Australia’s education and training system, which inhibit successful transitions especially for those groups at risk of marginalisation in the changing labour market...|$|R
