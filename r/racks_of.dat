5|$|At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. The attackers, around thirty men, {{established}} a fire base in a house overlooking the car park. The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching the car park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.|$|E

25|$|Price lining {{is the use}} of {{a limited}} number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a {{tradition}} started in the old five and dime stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable price points for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of inflation or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> men's ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40.|$|E
25|$|In late 1997, the Internet {{market was}} moving towards 56K technology. As {{one end of}} a 56k {{connection}} must be digital, the <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> modems found in every ISP became redundant overnight and expensive CBD-hosted equipment offered by Cisco, Ascend and Livingston became a requirement in order to survive in the marketplace. In 1998, competitive pressure from budget national providers, led by One.Tel, started to reach the Perth market.|$|E
25|$|The Painting Gallery {{building}} is built underground with an entrance modeled on Agamemnon's Tomb. Paintings are {{displayed on a}} system of three revolving <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> carpeted panels. Johnson and Whitney acquired a large collection over 40 years, but much was sold to support the trust after Johnson's death. The gallery still includes a portrait of Johnson by Andy Warhol as well as works by Frank Stella, Jasper Johns, Julian Schnabel and Robert Rauschenberg. Whitney, a friend of Warhol, Johns and Rauschenberg, {{took the lead in}} shaping the art collection.|$|E

25|$|For example, one switch {{might send}} {{only the last}} four or five digits of a {{telephone}} number. In one case, seven digit numbers were preceded by a digit 1 or 2 to differentiate between two area codes or office codes, (a two-digit-per-call savings). This improved revenue per trunk and reduced the number of digit receivers needed in a switch. Every task in electromechanical switches was done in big metallic pieces of hardware. Every fractional second cut off of call set up time meant fewer <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> equipment to handle call traffic.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December news reached Alden and Barker that two days earlier Japanese {{aircraft}} had sunk the US gunboat USS Panay in the Yangtze River near Nanjing. Alden and Barker discreetly prepared <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> ammunition for their 4"/50 caliber guns, but the IJN ships continued to stand by and assist. President McKinley moved closer inshore and embarked about 400 of President Hoovers passengers and about 230 of her crew. Japanese Navy flat-bottomed boats brought them from the shore out to meet President McKinleys boats and a motor launch, which then ferried {{them out to the}} liner. President McKinley then left for Manila, leaving behind President Hoovers officers, steerage passengers and the last 100 of her crew on Kasho-to.|$|E

500|$|During the Second World War, {{the federal}} {{government}} built the $50 million Susquehanna Ordnance Depot to make TNT on , partially in the White Deer Hole Creek watershed. In the spring of 1942, residents were evicted by eminent domain from 163 farms and 47 other properties in Gregg Township in Union County and Brady, Clinton, and Washington Townships in Lycoming County. The village of Alvira in Gregg Township disappeared. Alvira was founded in 1825 as [...] "Wisetown" [...] and had 100 inhabitants by 1900. Although the inhabitants were told they could return after the war, almost all the buildings seized were razed. Only some cemeteries and the nearby [...] "Stone Church" [...] remain. Construction of the plant involved some 10,000 people, and it took 3,500 to 4,500 employees to run the plant with its more than 200 buildings and 149 storage bunkers for TNT and high explosives, as well as storage <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> bombs. However, the need for TNT was lower than originally estimated and the project was nearly abandoned. By 1945, the only workers left at the depot were guards.|$|E
500|$|Subwoofers {{received}} {{a great deal}} of publicity in 1974 with the movie Earthquake which was released in Sensurround. Initially installed in 17 U.S. theaters, the Cerwin Vega [...] "Sensurround" [...] system used large subwoofers which were driven by <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> 500 watt amplifiers which were triggered by control tones printed on one of the audio tracks on the film. Four of the subwoofers were positioned in front of the audience under (or behind) the film screen and two more were placed together {{at the rear of the}} audience on a platform. Powerful noise energy and loud rumbling in the range of 17Hz to 120Hz was generated at the level of 110–120 decibels of sound pressure level, abbreviated dB(SPL). The new low frequency entertainment method helped the film become a box office success. More Sensurround systems were assembled and installed. By 1976 there were almost 300 Sensurround systems leapfrogging through select theaters. Other films to use the effect include the WW II naval battle epic Midway in 1976 and Rollercoaster in 1977. Deep bass speakers were once an exotic commodity owned by audiophiles. By the mid-1990s, they were much more popular and widely used, [...] with different sizes and capabilities of sound output.|$|E
500|$|Gaga wore {{a myriad}} of costumes, {{including}} a feathered crown from Gympie milliner Cindy Vogels during [...] "I Won't Dance". Vogels was contacted by Brandon Maxwell Studios from New York—Gaga's stylist—for designer pieces available for the concert. According to the milliner the crown almost never reached Gaga since the entire shipment was seized in Anchorage, Alaska due to the feathers on the piece being subjected to wildlife import issues with US customs officials. After much paperwork for five days the millinery designs were finally released and arrived {{just in time for}} the Cheek to Cheek promotional photo shoot. Vogels recalled, [...] "It was nerve racking and exciting at the same time and a relief when the shipment was finally released from customs." [...] Maxwell said that he and his team did the wardrobe for the dancers and Gaga, and first took references from Wilson regarding the set and lighting designs. The team then started with eight full <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> clothing, between 200 and 300 dresses, and afterwards zeroed in on eight costumes for the show, along with its accessories. Regarding the absence of jewellery, Maxwell explained that most of the outfits [...] "were more about the silhouette and structure of gowns" [...] and too much of accessories would have been a distraction. He wanted the emphasis on Gaga's vocals, hence the jewellery usage was reduced. Designers used for the costumes include Roberto Cavalli, Michael Costello, Mathieu Mirano, Valentino as well as David Samuel Menkes, who created the leather jumpsuit. Gaga had wanted costumes with teal or turquoise colours and flowing gowns, belted in the middle. Maxwell took care to ensure that the dresses were not too tight in Gaga's abdomen area, since it would have been difficult for her to sing. Sandals were provided by Brian Atwood, Stuart Weitzman and Sophia Webster, while a pair of boots were designed by Giuseppe Zanotti. They created custom made shoes which made Gaga appear tall and move freely in the long gowns.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{weapon of}} the ARA units was the 2.75" [...] Folding Fin Aerial Rocket (FFAR). [...] While the B and C model UH-1s could carry up to 48 of these rockets in two <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> 24 each (XM-3 subsystem), the faster, more {{powerful}} Cobras could carry 76. In {{addition to the}} rockets, the UH-1s carried two M60 machine guns mounted in the cargo doors as defensive weapons operated by the aircraft's crew chief and a door gunner, while the Cobras were armed with 7.62mm miniguns and 40mm grenade launchers in a nose turret. [...] Some UH-1s were also armed with the AGM-22/SS-11 wire guided missile.|$|E
2500|$|Leonardo's {{notebooks}} {{also show}} cannons which he claimed [...] "to hurl small stones like a storm with {{the smoke of}} these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion." [...] He also designed an enormous crossbow. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the British Army, but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The [...] "fan type" [...] gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.|$|E

2500|$|Large-scale sound {{reinforcement}} {{systems are}} designed, installed, {{and operated by}} audio engineers and audio technicians. During the design phase of a newly constructed venue, audio engineers work with architects and contractors, {{to ensure that the}} proposed design will accommodate the speakers and provide an appropriate space for sound technicians and the <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> audio equipment. [...] Sound engineers will also provide advice on which audio components would best suit the space and its intended use, and on the correct placement and installation of these components. During the installation phase, sound engineers ensure that high-power electrical components are safely installed and connected and that ceiling or wall mounted speakers are properly mounted (or [...] "flown") onto rigging. When the sound reinforcement components are installed, the sound engineers test and calibrate the system so that its sound production will be even across the frequency spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Yes's line-up {{expanded}} to incorporate three former members (Wakeman, Howe and Bruford) joining {{forces with the}} band's five-man line-up, and oddly {{it was the first}} time Kaye and Wakeman had ever met, but both professed they took an instant liking to each other and got on well. They all toured together in 1991 and 1992, in a show called [...] "Around the World in 80 Dates," [...] with a revolving stage at the center of each venue. In 1994, Yes released Talk, Kaye's final album with them. Kaye only played the Hammond organ on Talk - all of the other keyboards being played by Trevor Rabin. On tour, Kaye used a couple of master keyboards, which played the sounds from large <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> synthesizer and sampler modules hidden beneath the stage. After Talk, Kaye offered to stay with the band in a management capacity, but this did not occur and his involvement with the band ceased.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{challenge}} with designing sound systems for live music clubs {{is that the}} sound system {{may need to be}} used for both prerecorded music played by DJs and live music. If the sound system is optimized for prerecorded DJ music, then it will not provide the appropriate sound qualities (or mixing equipment and monitoring equipment) needed for live music, and vice versa. A club system designed for DJs needs a DJ mixer and space for record players. Clubs tend to focus on either live music or DJ shows. However, clubs which feature both types of shows may face challenges providing the desired equipment and set-up for both uses. In contrast, a live music club needs a mixing board designed for live sound, an onstage monitor system, and a multicore [...] "snake" [...] cable running from the stage to the mixer. Lastly, live music clubs can be a hostile environment for sound gear, in that the air may be hot, humid, and smoky; in some clubs, keeping <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> power amplifiers cool may be a challenge. Often an air conditioned room just for the amplifiers is utilised.|$|E
