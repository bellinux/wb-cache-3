40|$|The {{performance}} of a model predictive controller depends {{on the quality of}} the plant model that is available.

The model consists of nonlinear modules for the individual process units of the milling circuit (such as the mill, sump and cyclone), which allow arbitrary milling circuit conﬁgurations to be modelled easily. This study aims to cast a complex problem of a ROM ore milling circuit into an RNMPC framework without losing the ﬂexibility of the modularised nonlinear model and implement the RNMPC using open-source software modules. The three controllers are compared in a simulations study to determine {{the performance of the}} controllers subject to severe disturbances and model parameter variations. The disturbances include changes to the feed ore hardness, changes in the feed ore size distributions and spillage water being added to the sump. The simulations show that the RNMPC and NMPC perform better than the PID controllers with regard to the economic objectives, assuming full-state feedback is available, especially when actuator constraints become active. The execution time of the RNMPC, however, is much too long for real-time implementation and would require further research to improve the efficiency of the implementation.

Through the closed-circuit test of flotation, the final index was the fluorite grade of the concentrate was 97. 69 % and the recovery was 48. 07 %. Intruduction The main composition of fluorite was CaF 2, was important for fluorine industrial mineral, and was widely used in metallurgy, smelting aluminum, glass, ceramics, cement, chemical and other relevant industries [1]. China is the dominating country in the field of fluorite mineral resources and fluorite production in the world, and its reserves ranked third in the world.

40|$|Ore {{breakage}} characterisation is {{a methodology}} {{that is used}} to determine the ore hardness, or resistance to breakage which can be compared across a database of different rock types. It thus develops a relationship between specific energy input and degree of breakage which can be applied to impact breakage in comminution devices. The present study is focussed on investigating the breakage properties of UG 2 chromitite, pyroxenite, spotted anorthosite and mottled anorthosite grab samples from <b>run-of-mine</b> (RoM) <b>ore</b> stockpile (particle selection method) and cut drill core particles (cut core method). A mineralogical analysis of UG 2 chromitite, pyroxenite, spotted anorthosite and mottled anorthosite was performed using Leica EZ 4 D optical microscope and QEMSCAN 650 F to determine their mineral composition and texture. The presence of cracks in chromitite stockpile and cut drill core samples was also explored using a Nikon XTH 225 ST micro-focus X-ray system. RoM ore stockpile and cut drill core particles of each of these rock types were subjected to impact breakage in the JK Rotary Breakage Tester (RBT). The progeny particle size distributions and degrees of breakage of UG 2 rock types obtained via the particle selection and cut core methods were compared. Standard breakage characterization models were fitted to the breakage data of different rock types and the relative hardness parameters compared. It was found that UG 2 chromitite comprised mainly fine, isolated, round chromite grains in a plagioclase matrix. Pyroxenite samples were found to be made up of granular orthopyroxene, interstitial plagioclase and clinopyroxene. The mineralogical analysis also revealed that spotted anorthosite primarily contains plagioclase with orthopyroxene crystals forming isolated "spots" creating a poikilitic texture. Mottled anorthosite is made up of mainly plagioclase. Results from breakage tests showed that the progeny particle size distributions and the degrees of breakage for particles sourced from the RoM ore stockpile breaks into a finer product compared to cut drill core samples. This was attributed to the presence of cracks in the RoM ore particles as revealed by the tomographic scans. No visible cracks were found in the cut core particle. The ore hardness parameters were determined from fitting the breakage data to standard impact breakage characterisation models (t 10 breakage and size dependent breakage model). Samples obtained via the particle selection method were consistently found to offer less resistance to impact breakage as shown by the higher Axb values compared to the cut drill core samples. Using the ore hardness classes presented by Napier-Munn et al (1999), UG 2 chromitite, spotted anorthosite, mottled anorthosite and pyroxenite were thus classified as very soft, soft to very soft, soft to very soft and medium to soft respectively. The hardness indicator, 3600. M. fmat. x, for each size class determined using the parameters obtained from the size dependent breakage model decrease with an increase in the parent particle size. This shows that particles become more resistant to impact breakage as the initial particle size increases. However, for pyroxenite, spotted and mottled anorthosite, the indicator decreases between the particle sizes 14 to 28. 6 mm but then increases for 41. 1 mm...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{performed}} at the University of Missouri-Rolla's Waterjet Laboratory have demonstrated clearly the ability of waterjets to disaggregate, in a single step, four different mineral ores, including ores containing iron, lead and copper products. The study focused mainly on galena-bearing dolomite, a lead ore, and compared the new technology with that of traditional mining and milling to liberate the valuable constituent for the more voluminous host rock. The technical term for {{the disintegration of the}} ore to achieve this liberation is comminution. The potential for energy savings if this process can be improved, is immense. Further, if this separation can be made at the mining face, then the potential energy savings include avoidance of transportation (haulage and hoisting) costs to move, process and store this waste at the surface. The waste can, instead, be disposed into the available cavities within the mine. The savings also include the elimination of the comminution, crushing and grinding, stages in the processing plant. Future prototype developments are intended to determine if high-pressure waterjet mining and processing can be optimized to become cheaper than traditional fragmentation by drilling and blasting and to optimize the separation process. The basic new mining process was illustrated in tests on two local rock types, a low-strength sandstone with hematite inclusions, and a medium to high-strength dolomite commonly used for construction materials. Illustrative testing of liberation of minerals, utilized a lead-bearing dolomite, and included a parametric study of the optimal conditions needed to create a size distribution considered best for separation. The target goal was to have 50 percent of the mined material finer than 100 mesh (149 microns). Of the 21 tests that were run, five clearly achieved the target. The samples were obtained as <b>run-of-mine</b> lumps of <b>ore,</b> which exhibited a great deal of heterogeneity within the samples. This, in turn, reduced the ability to apply detailed statistical tests to the product outcomes. Nonetheless, a regression analysis showed that operating pressures between 105 (10, 000 psi) and 140 (15, 000 psi) MegaPascals (MPa) at traverse speeds no greater than 10 cm/min (4 in/min), best generated the target result. Variation in other parameters, rotation speed, nozzle diameter, and nozzle separation angle, during the preliminary tests did not substantially change the product, and so were kept fixed during the ore mining tests. The experimental protocols were developed to include proper treatment of the lead-bearing materials, which may be considered hazardous. In anticipation of the creation of a mineral processing design for separation of the concentrates from the tailings (waste), assays were made of the metal content of each screen size for each of the 21 runs; with three screens and a pan for undersize, to give a total of 84 assays. This information will enable Dr. McNulty, project consultant, to create a flow sheet for the prototype mining machine. As a preliminary component to such a system, the experimental layout included a product-recovery system that delivered all of the fragmented product to the nest of screens which allowed study of the liberation at the different size levels. Where incomplete liberation is found, a secondary process was demonstrated for using pressurized cavitation to further comminute the material. This concept was successfully demonstrated, with a small cavitation chamber illustrating the much smaller space that such a tool requires, relative to conventional ball and rod mills. Additional testing is ongoing, external to this program, to find whether an one-step process using higher jet pressures and longer dwell times to achieve all the required comminution in mining, is more efficient than a two-step process in which normal jet pressures and feed rates do the initial mining, but full particle liberation is achieved only through secondary processing of the product in a cavitation chamber. Subsequent testing is also planned, to determine preferred methods for separating ore minerals from the waste. Tests with this system have included both the galena samples, and copper ores from Poland. The development of this tool lies within an expanding market for the use of high-pressure waterjet equipment across a broad spectrum of applications. As the industry develops new tools, it is anticipated that the research team will investigate the development of a prototype machine based on these tools, since this will simplify and speed up equipment development. It is hoped that once this is developed that can be taken into an active mine. Such a machine should be able to produce large enough samples to allow assessment of optimal operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} novel {{non-linear}} {{model of a}} <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore</b> grinding mill circuit, developed for process control and estimation purposes, is validated. The model makes use of the minimum number of states and parameters necessary to produce responses that are qualitatively accurate.

The model uses five states: rocks, solids, fines, water and steel balls. Rocks are defined as too large to be discharged from the mill, whereas solids, defined as particles small enough to leave the mill, consist of out-of-specification coarse ore and in-specification fine ore fractions. The model incorporates a unique prediction of the rheology of the slurry within the mill. A new hydrocyclone model is also presented. The model parameters are fitted to an existing plant’s sampling campaign data and a step-wise procedure is given to fit the model to steady-state data. Simulation test results of the model are compared to sampling campaign data of the same plant at different steady-state conditions.

40|$|A <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore</b> milling circuit is {{primarily}} used to grind incoming ore containing precious metals to a particle size {{smaller than a}} specification size. A traditional run-of-mine (ROM) ore single-stage closed milling circuit comprises of the operational units: mill, sump and cyclone. These circuits are difficult to control because of significant nonlinearities, large time delays, large unmeasured disturbances, process variables {{that are difficult to}} measure and modelling uncertainties. A nonlinear model predictive controller with state estimation could yield good control of the ROM ore milling circuit despite these difficulties. Additionally, the ROM ore milling circuit is an energy intensive unit and a controller or power optimizer could bring significant cost savings. A nonlinear model predictive controller requires good state estimates and therefore a neural network for state estimation {{as an alternative to the}} particle filter has been addressed. The neural network approach requires fewer process variables that need to be measured compared to the particle filter. A neural network is trained with three disturbance parameters and used to estimate the internal states of the mill, and the results are compared with those of the particle filter implementation. The neural network approach performed better than the particle filter approach when estimating the volume of steel balls and rocks within the mill. A novel combined neural network and particle filter state estimator is presented to improve the estimation of the neural network approach for the estimation of volume of fines, solids and water within the mill. The estimation performance of the combined approach is promising when the disturbance magnitude used is smaller than that used to train the neural network. After state estimation was addressed, this work targets the implementation of a nonlinear controller combined with full state estimation for a grinding mill circuit. The nonlinear controller consists of a suboptimal nonlinear model predictive controller coupled with a dynamic inversion controller. This allows for fast control that is asymptotically stable. The nonlinear controller aims to reconcile the opposing objectives of high throughput and high product quality. The state estimator comprises of a particle filter for five mill states as well as an additional estimator for three sump states. Simulation results show that control objectives can be achieved despite the presence of noise and significant disturbances. The cost of energy has increased significantly in recent years. This increase in price greatly affects the mineral processing industry because of the large energy demands. A <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore</b> milling circuit provides a suitable case study where the power consumed by a mill is in the order of 2 MW. An attempt has been made to reduce the energy consumed by the mill in the two ways: firstly, within the nonlinear model predictive control in a single-stage circuit configuration and secondly, running multiple mills in parallel and attempting to save energy while still maintaining an overall high quality and good quantity. A formulation for power optimization of multiple ROM ore milling circuits has been developed. A first base case consisted not taking power into account in a single ROM ore milling circuit and a second base case split the load and throughput equally between two parallel milling circuits. In both cases, energy can be saved using the NMPC compared to the base cases presented without significant sacrifice in product quality or quantity. The work presented covers three topics that has yet to be addressed within the literature: a neural network for mill state estimation, a nonlinear controller with state estimation integrated for a ROM ore milling circuit and power optimization of a single and multiple ROM ore milling circuit configuration.

40|$|In South Africa, where 75 % of {{the worlds}} {{platinum}} is produced, electricity tariffs have increased significantly over recent years. This introduces challenges to the energy intensive mineral processing industry. Within the mineral processing chain, <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore</b> milling circuits are the most energy-intensive unit processes. Opportunities to reduce the operating costs associated with power consumption through process control are explored in this work. In order to reduce operating costs, demand side management was implemented on a milling circuit using load shifting. Time-of-use tariffs were exploited by shifting power consumption of the milling circuit from more expensive to cheaper tariff periods {{in order to reduce}} overall costs associated with electricity consumption. Reduced throughput during high tariff periods was recovered during low tariff periods in order to maintain milling circuit throughput over a week long horizon. In order to implement and evaluate demand side management through process control, a load shifting controller was developed for the non-linear Hulbert model. Implementation of the load shifting controller was achieved through a multi-layered control approach. A regulatory linear MPC controller was developed to address technical control requirements such as milling circuit stability. A supervisory real-time optimizer was developed to meet economic control requirements such as reducing electricity costs while maintaining throughput. Scenarios, designed to evaluate the sensitivities of the load shifting controller, showed interesting results. Mill power set-point optimization was found to be proportionally related to the mineral price. Set-points were not sensitive to absolute electricity costs but rather to the relationships between peak, standard, and off-peak electricity costs. The load shifting controller was most effective at controlling the milling circuit where weekly throughput was between approximately 90 % and 100 % of the maximum throughput capacity. From an economic point of view, it is shown that for milling circuits that are not throughput constrained, load shifting can reduce operating costs associated with electricity consumption. Simulations performed indicate that realizable cost savings are between R 16. 51 and R 20. 78 per gram of unrefined platinum processed by the milling circuit. This amounts to a potential annual cost saving of up to R 1. 89 m for a milling circuit that processes 90 t/h at a head grade of 3 g/t. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

40|$|M. Sc. An {{estimated}} 98 % of {{the iron}} ore exploited {{in the world is}} used in the manufacture of pig iron and steel, which are non-substitutable backbones of modern society. The rapid increase of world steel production over the last few years, driven mainly by economic growth in China, have required an equal increase in iron ore production, from 876. 8 Mt in 2006 to 948. 1 Mt in 2007. The increased rate of exploitation of iron ores has resulted in a rapid depletion of known high-grade iron ore deposits. This, in turn, has led to a dramatic increase of prices, especially for highly thought-after high-grade lumpy iron ores from BIF-hosted deposits. In the absence of any major new discoveries of high-grade iron ore deposits, mining companies have turned to lower-grade materials to assess their beneficiation potential to expand their production base and beneficiation capacity, in order to satisfy future demand. Within this existing framework, this research project was initiated to assess the beneficiation potential of low-grade lumpy stockpiles and high-grade iron ore fines at Beeshoek Iron Ore Mine, owned by Assmang Ltd. The mine is located 7 km West of Postmasburg, in the Northern Cape Province of South-Africa, and processes currently 5. 60 million tons of uncontaminated <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore</b> per annum. Crushing, washing, classification and jigging are used to produce 2. 12 million tons of (37. 8 % of ROM) of lumpy iron ore product. The balance (3. 48 million tons) is currently not used, but is stockpiled or discarded. This includes 0. 90 million tons (16. 2 % of ROM) of ore-grade fines, 0. 86 million tons (15 % of ROM) of tailings sludge and 1. 74 million tons (31 % of ROM) of lumpy low grade material. Both ore-grade fines and low-grade lumpy material are discarded separately; they are currently considered as waste. The low-grade lumpy is stockpiled while the fines are used to fill-in mined-out open pits. The evaluation of the beneficiation potential of these two material streams is the main goal of this study. Representative samples were collected from ore-grade fines and the current stockpile for low-grade lumpy material. Hand sorting and lithological categorization of the lumpy material facilitated petrographic and mineralogical studies using light and scanning electron microscopy, as well as X-ray powder diffraction studies. Major and trace element geochemistry were determined using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and titrimetry (to accurately determine the concentration of iron). Whole rock densities were determined for all lithotypes recognized in the low-grade lumpy material. The grain size distribution was determined for the lumpy materials by actual measurement of the diameter of a representative number of particles, and for fines by sieve analysis.

The role of blasting in mining A major part of South Africa's economy is based on the mining of the rich mineral deposits that {{are to be found in}} the country. These mining operations are carried out both above ground (open-pit iron ore mines, for example) and below ground (gold, uranium and others). Open-pit mining, in particular, requires significant amounts of commercial blasting to dislodge the high volumes of material that have to be moved and processed. An average blasting block at Iscor's Sishen mine, for example, contains about 250 000 tons of material, although a world record was established in April 1981 when 7, 2 million tons of rock was broken during a single blast. The chemical quality of the final products is partly controlled by supplying the primary crusher at the mine with a suitable mixture of so-called <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore.</b> To determine which material from a specific blasting block may be sent to the plant, and to which waste dump the remaining material should be assigned, factors such as beneficiation properties of the raw material and the content of various by-products are considered. Samples are typically taken from alternate blast holes for every metre drilled. Each drill sample is divided into two parts by means of a riffler for a washed and unwashed sample. The washed samples are examined and the rock types noted. Subsequently, all the samples are grouped and analysed chemically and the densities of the different rock types are determined. The results are processed and those for the washed and unwashed samples correlated. The blasting blocks in the pit are demarcated by means of whitewash lines, according to the divisions on the blasting-block plans, and they are marked with signs to guide shovel operators. Primary drilling is performed by means of electrically-driven rotary drills. At the Sishen mine, 310 mm diameter blast holes are drilled in all rock types. The following table depicts typical drilling 2 patterns for various rock types: Rock type Pattern (m) Drill depth (m) Hard iron ore 2 x 8, 3 3, 0 Medium-hard iron ore 1 x 9, 3 2, 7 Quartzite 8, 2 x 9, 4 2, 5 Flagstone 8, 2 x 9, 4 5 Calcrete 8, 1 x 9, 3 0 Primary blasting is done at Sishen with Heavy Anfo, an explosive that is manufactured by mine personnel at the emulsion plant on site. The ingredients for the explosive blends are transported by pump trucks to the blasting blocks, where it is mixed and pumped down the blast holes. Good fragmentation of the blasted material is a prerequisite for high loading rates by the loading equipment. At Sishen and other similar mines, a blasting efficiency of 3, 2 tons of rock per kilogram of explosives used, is considered to be acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Open pit mines {{constitute}} {{more than}} half of global minerals production. Yet most of the large, high-grade, and close to the surface deposits have been depleted or are currently in production. Besides, volatility in commodity prices and stringent environmental regulations limit the up-scaling expansions in large open pits. Consequently, the mines are determined to increase their operational efficiency in order to thrive. This has recently led to major metallurgical improvements in the processing of ores; whereas the improvements in mining of the said ores are relatively overdue in terms of efficiency and technological advancement. This thesis concentrates on the mining activities and their efficiency in open pits with a focus on drilling, blasting, loading, and crushing. As all of these tasks revolve around the fragmentation of <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore,</b> their relationships and efficiencies are explored within the context of fragmentation. Fragmentation is a result of complex interactions between rockmass, blasting geometry, explosive, and timing sequence of blast holes. The influence of rockmass and timing sequence on fragmentation and efficiency are explored, as well as the target fragmentation for efficient loading and crushing. Moreover, the techniques for measuring fragmentation are evaluated as to whether they can benefit mines in terms of efficiency. As the circumstances in open pits are essentially site-specific, these issues are addressed as a case study of the Aitik mine in Sweden. The research comprised four elements. First, the influence of rockmass fractures on blast results and downstream efficiency was evaluated via full-scale field trials. The fractures in and around the case study mine were mapped using a photogrammetric technique and six production blasts were adapted to the major fracture sets to evaluate the effect of initiation direction on downstream efficiency. Second, the influence of the timing sequence of blast holes was explored within the theories of stress waves interaction and their consequent effect on fragmentation. Theoretical and numerical solutions were accompanied by six field trials in full-scale to evaluate the influence of short delay times on fragmentation and efficiency. Third, an empirical study was conducted to correlate fragmentation to the efficiency of loading and crushing; this was done to define a target fragmentation for the studied case. Finally, the techniques to assess fragmentation were discussed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings indicated that rockmass fractures have a significant influence on the quality of blasts and efficiency of downstream tasks. In the case study mine, adjustments to orientation of drill pattern and initiation direction of blasts suggested that careful experimentation in this regard can yield a favourable initiation direction with respect to existing discontinuities. Finer fragmentation and higher loading efficiencies can be achieved by adapting the blast designs to the existing fractures, which can lead to significant savings in the long run. On the contrary, the influence of stress waves interaction on blast results turned out to be marginal. Neither the theoretical and numerical solutions nor the field trials showed any significant improvements in blast results from short delays. In fact, it was found rather implausible to expect any noticeable improvements by using short delays. The empirical method to evaluate target fragmentation proved useful as well. It was shown that by incorporating different data from various sources in a mine, one can follow the ore from muckpile to loaders and then to crushers. Having a qualitative understanding of the fragmentation, and by developing tools to measure efficiency, one can estimate what fragmentation is most favourable for an efficient operation. Finally, two image-based methods to assess fragmentation were discussed in terms of repeatability and statistical significance. It was found that the scatter in both methods is rather large, introducing a certain ambiguity in representativeness of their results. Admittedly, it was found that in matters of long-term efficiency, the number, size and representativeness of assessed samples are of more importance compared to the accuracy of individual measurements...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} a three-year collaborative research project between the British Geological Survey (BGS), The Natural History Museum, London (NHM) and the Geological Survey Department, Cyprus (GSD). It was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, Cyprus. The objectives of the programme were to develop new methodologies for the exploration and exploitation of cupriferous sulphide ore and re-establish metalliferous mineral exploration research on Cyprus and within the GSD. Initially the project only involved the BGS, the NHM and the GSD. However, early on, it became apparent that mining and mineral exploration companies held key datasets, needed to develop the new methodologies. Therefore, negotiations were conducted with the Hellenic Mining Company, Eastern Mediterranean Minerals and Hellenic Copper Mines. These established a framework for collaboration and all parties signed a confidentiality agreement. This allowed the BGS–NHM–GSD team to use proprietary data in their combined metallogenic–prospectivity analysis and the companies to have exclusive access to project results for six months after project completion. The project comprised five distinct components: •	Technology transfer and institutional strengthening. •	Development of new metallogenic models for ophiolite–hosted mineralization, including an examination of gold-rich epithermal-style mineralization associated with submarine basalts. •	Mineralogical and metallurgical analysis of low-grade copper mineralization, with a review of solvent extraction electro-winning (SX-EW) technologies. •	The use of legacy and new data at the regional to district scales for GIS-based prospectivity modelling. This included a reinterpretation of geophysical data. •	A pilot study, using the prospectivity analysis, to define and test the mineralization potential of prospectivity anomalies. To facilitate technology transfer and institutional strengthening the project delivered a number of office and field-based seminars and workshops. These included training in the use of GIS for prospectivity analysis, examination of potential epithermal style mineralization, lectures on: (i) epithermal mineralization in the Aegean, (ii) VHMS mineralization in the Urals and (iii) SX-EW hydrometallurgical techniques—these were given to the Cyprus Society of Geologists and Engineers to ensure the widest dissemination. In addition, to give the project an international dimension, the prospectivity analyses were presented at two international conferences in Thessaloniki and Beijing. The project produced, using ArcSDM and a variety of geological, geophysical and remote sensing datasets, two prospectivity investigations: (i) a regional prospectivity map covering all of the Troodos Massif. This identified eight separate areas of high mineralization potential. The areas are generally located within 10 km of the boundary between the Troodos ophiolite and the autochthonous sedimentary cover sequences draping the ophiolite. (ii) A more detailed map focussed on an area of the northern Troodos. This identified drilling targets in the Memi–Alestos area. Key components to the prospectivity analysis undertaken by the project team included: (i) The digitisation of mineral occurrences and gossan distribution. (ii) The analysis of remote sensing data using band ratio image processing techniques to highlight regional alteration trends. (iii) The modelling and interpretation of airborne magnetic geophysics comprised the amalgamation of three generations of data into a single data set and the identification of lineaments and regions with positive and negative magnetic anomalies. In addition to the development of an ophiolite-hosted prospectivity GIS for the Troodos, the project addressed two new metallogenetic concepts for Cyprus—namely (i) The investigation of potential epithermal style VHMS mineralization using infrared spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction techniques. This study identified high temperature advanced argillic alteration phases and concluded that sub-seafloor boiling was responsible for some of the gold enrichment recorded in Cyprus-type VHMS mineralization (ii) The development of low-grade supergene Cu mineralization associated with massive sulphide mineralization. This showed that the favourable interplay between the mineralization and topography {{played an important role in}} the development of the large secondary low-grade orebodies. A strategy for exploring for such a supergene copper target would be to assess all surface gossans developed in topographic highs and seek potential downslope areas of mineralization—the use of high resolution digital elevation models provided by techniques such as LiDAR could be a way forward in this respect Professor John Monhemius, Imperial College London, undertook a review of the use of SX-EW hydrometallurgical techniques as applied to Cyprus. This study concluded that the decline in copper recoveries in the heap leach process used at Skouriotissa is due to increasing amounts of primary chalcopyrite, a refractory mineral that is very resistant to dissolution by oxidation, in the <b>run-of-mine</b> <b>ore</b> as mining gets deeper. Recent processes developed for the hydrometallurgical treatment of chalcopyrite all involve the use of extreme conditions, such as high temperature pressure leaching, ultra-fine grinding, or intensified bacterial leaching—these may not be appropriate for Skouriotissa and the best option for extending the life of the plant may be the discovery and exploitation of further reserves of supergene altered copper ores containing leachable copper oxide and secondary sulphide minerals This will allow production to continue using the heap leaching technology currently in use. If necessary, the effectiveness of this leaching method towards secondary copper sulphide minerals could be improved by introducing tanks for bacterially pre-oxidising the leach solutions under optimum conditions, prior to being sprayed on to the ore heaps. One key component of the project was to formulate and implement a pilot project based on the results of the regional GIS. The goal of the pilot project was to site a borehole to test if prospectivity analysis had the capability to predict the location of unknown mineralization. The application of a detailed prospectivity GIS using public domain and proprietary geophysical data focussed on the northern Troodos identified a high prospectivity zone in the Memi–Alestos region. Two boreholes were sited to test for the presence of mineralization beneath Upper Pillow Lava cover and one of these encountered over 20 m of argillically and propylitically altered lavas containing minor amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite. This shows that prospectivity analysis approach used in this project could be a useful tool for locating buried VHMS mineralization on Cyprus. This is especially so when high-resolution geophysical data are available. In terms of future work, the project identified development in the following areas: •	The need for national high-resolution geochemical and geophysical datasets to provide pre-competitive information for mineral exploration and environmental assessment •	The development of fuzzy logic techniques for prospectivity mapping •	Processing and interpretation of high-resolution airborne remote sensing data...|$|E
