5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} caused Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to cancel a rally and two fund-raising events in New Orleans. Governor Buddy <b>Roemer</b> issued for the Louisiana National Guard to be on standby for emergency duty. Officials closed several bridges across southeastern Louisiana and also canceled ferry travel across Lake Ponchartrain. In Pensacola, Florida, the Navy base moved the USS Lexington into the Gulf of Mexico during the hurricane, and also sent more than 100aircraft to a base in Ohio.|$|E
25|$|Coordination and {{responsibility}} for salvage of the George Prince and her vehicles was assumed by the state's Director of Administration, Charles <b>Roemer</b> II, father of future governor Buddy <b>Roemer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tiner himself {{ran for the}} U.S. House in {{a special}} {{election}} held on March 8, 1988, {{the same day as}} the presidential primaries. The opening developed when <b>Roemer</b> vacated his Fourth Congressional District seat to become governor. <b>Roemer</b> endorsed Tiner as his preferred successor.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time as Cohen was working on Karl Marx's Theory of History, American {{economist}} John <b>Roemer</b> was employing neoclassical economics {{in order to try to}} defend the Marxist concepts of exploitation and class. In his A General Theory of Exploitation and Class (1982), <b>Roemer</b> employed rational choice and game theory in order to demonstrate how exploitation and class relations may arise in the development of a market for labour. <b>Roemer</b> would go on to reject the idea that the labour theory of value was necessary for explaining exploitation and class. Value was in principle capable of being explained in terms of any class of commodity inputs, such as oil, wheat, etc., rather than being exclusively explained by embodied labour power. <b>Roemer</b> was led to the conclusion that exploitation and class were thus generated not in the sphere of production but of market exchange. Significantly, as a purely technical category, exploitation did not always imply a moral wrong (see section Justice below).|$|E
25|$|FBI Agent William F. <b>Roemer</b> {{wrote that}} he would go to DeStefano's house to {{question}} him about mob business and on a few occasions, DeStefano would walk down the stairs in his pajamas, exposing himself. Often DeStefano's wife would serve the agents coffee and the agents would comment that the coffee had a unique taste to it. Sam would claim the coffee was made from special Italian coffee beans that his wife brewed. Months later <b>Roemer</b> found out that DeStefano had been urinating in the coffee before it was served to the agents. <b>Roemer</b> wrote he could never drink coffee again in his life.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{month of}} Despot's death, Democratic Governor Charles E. <b>Roemer,</b> III {{switched}} his allegiance to the Republican Party. Roemer's switch did not unite the feuding wings of the GOP. Because he supported abortion, the right-to-life contingent of the party rejected <b>Roemer</b> and coalesced around then U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Rapides Parish. But few other Republicans would support Holloway. Holloway did win a preference poll among Republicans attending statewide endorsement caucuses. Also running for governor was the candidate who was anathema to party leaders: State Representative David Duke of Jefferson Parish. When all the smoke had cleared, Duke eliminated <b>Roemer</b> from a general election berth, and Edwin Edwards staged a fourth-term victory over the unpopular Duke.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the 2012 Republican race for {{president}} was shaped by the 13 presidential debates of 2011, which began on May 5. Gary Johnson and Buddy <b>Roemer,</b> both former Governors, were left out {{of most of the}} debates, leading to complaints of bias. On December 28, 2011, Johnson withdrew to seek the Libertarian Party nomination and on February 23, 2012, <b>Roemer</b> withdrew to seek the Reform Party and the Americans Elect nomination.|$|E

25|$|The GOP state {{convention}} {{in the spring}} of 1991 had endorsed neither Duke nor incumbent Democrat-turned-Republican Governor Buddy <b>Roemer,</b> but instead conservative U.S. Representative Clyde Holloway of Forest Hill in Rapides Parish. Holloway, now a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, finished far behind in the nonpartisan blanket primary. Duke then went into the general election with Edwards on November 16, 1991. <b>Roemer</b> finished a strong third but was eliminated in the primary.|$|E

25|$|The Picayune {{endorsed}} Governor candidate Edwin Washington Edwards in 1971 and 1975, {{but went}} {{against him in}} 1983 (endorsing incumbent David C. Treen), 1987 (endorsing challenger and eventual winner Buddy <b>Roemer)</b> and 1991 (endorsed <b>Roemer</b> in the primary, but switched to Edwards {{in the general election}} due to Edwards' opponent being former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke). The T-P also stung Edwards in 1979 even though he was barred from running for a third term, refusing to endorse Edwards' hand-picked candidate, Louis Lambert, in favor of Treen both in the primary and general election.|$|E
25|$|Wepolls hosted an {{alternative}} debate {{among the three}} candidates most often excluded {{from most of the}} other debates: Buddy <b>Roemer,</b> Gary Johnson and Fred Karger. It was held on December 15, 2011, at 11 pm EST.|$|E

25|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} early February, with Jason Ritter landing {{the lead role}} of Sean Walker. In late February, Željko Ivanek was cast as Blake Sterling, and Ian Anthony Dale signed on as Simon Lee. This was followed {{a few days later}} by the addition of Scott Patterson and Sarah <b>Roemer</b> to the cast. <b>Roemer</b> was cast as Sean's girlfriend, Leila Buchanan, with Patterson portraying her father, Michael. In late February, Laura Innes was cast as Sophia Maguire, a role which was originally envisioned as male. Blair Underwood came on board in early March in the role of President Eli Martinez, a role which was originally planned for a Hispanic actor. Finally, the addition of Taylor Cole completed the main cast.|$|E
25|$|Two lesser known {{candidates}} {{appearing in}} the first debate, Sarah Gonzales (who placed sixth) and Michael Oatman (who placed tied for third), placed ahead of their better known Republican and Green Party counterparts (Buddy <b>Roemer</b> and Gerard Davis respectively) in the Arizona Presidential Preference Election Results from February 28, 2012.|$|E
25|$|Sarah <b>Roemer</b> as Leila Buchanan – Sean's girlfriend, who is kidnapped. After being rescued, {{she tries}} to find her younger sister who has also been kidnapped. It is {{revealed}} {{that she and her}} little sister are half non-terrestrial as their father, Michael Buchanan, was one of the survivors of the 1944 crash.|$|E
25|$|Wilmette saw {{a growth}} in youth sports during this period. The boy's youth Wilmette Baseball Association {{was founded in}} 1951. In 1953 the village opened <b>Roemer</b> Park, a Little League {{baseball}} park with features such as a concession stand and scoreboard. By 1962 the Wilmette Baseball Association had more than 900 youth players (including Bill Murray) and 52 teams.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, a Republican, Jim McCrery, a Shreveport {{native who}} grew up in Leesville in Vernon Parish, won the {{district}} in another special election created by the election of Congressman Buddy <b>Roemer</b> of Bossier Parish, as governor. With relatively little difficulty McCrery remained in Congress until 2009, when he was succeeded by Republican John C. Fleming.|$|E
25|$|Criteria for {{inclusion}} in the debate did not allow several other candidates, or potential candidates, to participate in the debate, including Buddy <b>Roemer,</b> Gary Johnson, and Fred Karger, who did not meet the polling criterion of at least 1% in 5 national polls. Several other then-potential candidates, including Jon Huntsman, Rudy Giuliani, and Sarah Palin declined to participate in the debate.|$|E
25|$|Dean {{was elected}} Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on February 12, 2005, after all his opponents {{dropped out of}} the race when it became {{apparent}} Dean had the votes to become Chair. Those opponents included former Congressman Martin Frost, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, former Congressman and 9/11 Commissioner Tim <b>Roemer,</b> and strategists Donnie Fowler, David Leland, and Simon Rosenberg.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Wilson and Leach, <b>Roemer</b> also ran again in 1980. So did State Representative Forrest Dunn of Shreveport, a furniture store owner known for fiscal conservatism and frank expression of ideas who had supported President Ford over Jimmy Carter in 1976. Dunn's entry {{was believed to}} have attracted {{the same kinds of}} voters who might have otherwise preferred the Republican Wilson.|$|E
25|$|After Mohr {{worked for}} a short time as a farmer in Indiana, he moved to Louisville and married a countrywoman from Zweibrücken, Sofie <b>Roemer,</b> on 12 March 1852. In Louisville he again met several friends from Württemberg and made contact with several German pharmacists. Here Mohr again found more time for his botanical studies, which were {{supported}} by the Swiss paleobotanist and bryologist Leo Lesquereux.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, as his {{legislative}} term ended, Henry became Treen's commissioner of administration, a high position in state government, {{which had been}} filled under Edwards {{by none other than}} Roemer's often controversial father, Charles E. <b>Roemer,</b> II, also of Bossier Parish. As commissioner of administration, Henry pushed to fruition the plans and blueprints for the State Capitol Complex and the consolidation of state offices within the Capitol environs.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 1988, {{nearly a}} year before he left office as the mayor of Minden, Byars ran for Louisiana's 4th congressional {{district}} seat in a special election to choose a successor to Buddy <b>Roemer</b> who was elected in October 1987 as governor of Louisiana. Byars had indicated that his knowledge of budgets and municipal finance would have strengthened his candidacy {{despite a lack of}} name recognition outside of his city.|$|E
25|$|Criteria for {{inclusion}} in the debate did not allow several other candidates, or potential candidates, to participate in the debate, including Buddy <b>Roemer</b> and Fred Karger, who did not meet the polling criterion of at least 1% in 5 national polls. Mitt Romney met the debate criteria, but rejected the invitation to appear in the debate. Newt Gingrich originally had planned to attend the debate, but did not meet additional criteria of forming an exploratory committee.|$|E
25|$|In the September 1980 primary, Leach led with 35,847 votes (28.9 percent). <b>Roemer</b> {{was second}} with 33,049 (26.8 percent). Wilson {{finished}} third with 29,992 (24.4 percent). Campbell polled 14,666 votes (11.9 percent), and Dunn received 8,208 ballots (6.7 percent). Carter ran last with 1,329 (1 percent). As predicted by some Republicans, Dunn polled {{more than enough}} votes to keep Wilson from a first- or second-place primary finish, presuming that Dunn voters' second choice in most cases would have been Wilson.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{candidates}} started their campaigns in mid-2011, but after the first two primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, only four well-funded campaigns (Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, and Paul) remained for the Republican Party nomination; Gary Johnson had withdrawn to run on the Libertarian ticket, and Buddy <b>Roemer</b> sought the American Elect nomination. At the beginning of May, Gingrich and Santorum suspended their campaigns; Romney was widely reported as the presumptive nominee, with Paul the only other major candidate running an active campaign.|$|E
25|$|To better {{elucidate}} {{the findings of}} thought suppression, several studies have changed the target thought. <b>Roemer</b> and Borkovec found that participants who suppressed anxious or depressing thoughts showed a significant rebound effect. Furthermore, Wenzlaff, Wegner, & Roper demonstrated that anxious or depressed subjects {{were less likely to}} suppress negative, unwanted thoughts. Despite Rassin, Merkelbach and Muris reporting that this finding is moderately robust in the literature, some studies were unable to replicate results. However, this may be explained by a consideration of individual differences.|$|E
25|$|It was {{broadcast}} live {{for two hours}} on Fox News and FoxNews.com. Candidates participating in the debate included Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman Jr.. It was the first debate appearance by Huntsman, and the final appearance by Pawlenty. Criteria {{for inclusion in the}} debate did not allow several other candidates, or potential candidates, to participate in the debate, including Buddy <b>Roemer,</b> Gary Johnson, Thaddeus McCotter and Fred Karger, who did not meet the polling criterion of at least 1% in 5 national polls.|$|E
25|$|Waggonner {{said that}} he would remain neutral, but shortly before the primary he criticized Roemer's {{suggestion}} that the Red River navigation program might have to be scaled down or delayed as a means to fight excessive government spending and inflation. Political observers regarded Waggonner's criticism of <b>Roemer</b> as a factor in Roemer's failure to obtain a general election berth. For years, the Louisiana delegation, particularly Waggonner and Democratic U.S. Senators J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., and Russell B. Long, had worked to make the river navigable from Shreveport through Alexandria and south to Simmesport, on the Avoyelles and Pointe Coupee parish border.|$|E
