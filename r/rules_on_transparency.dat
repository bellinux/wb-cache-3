40|$|Nowadays, the {{transparency}} of governments {{with respect to}} the sustainability of public services is a very interesting issue for stakeholders and academics. It has led to previous research and international organisations (EU, IMF, OECD, United Nations, IFAC, G- 20, World Bank) to recommend promotion of the online dissemination of economic, social and environmental information. Based on previous studies about e-government and the influence of administrative cultures on governmental accountability, this paper seeks to identify political actions useful to improve the practices of transparency on economic, social and environmental sustainability in European local governments. We perform a comparative analysis of sustainability information published on the websites of 72 local governments in 10 European countries grouped into main three cultural contexts (Anglo-Saxon, Southern European and Nordic). Using international sustainability reporting guidelines, our results reveal significant differences in local government transparency in each context. The most transparent local governments are the Anglo-Saxon ones, followed by Southern European and Nordic governments. Based on individualized empirical results for each administrative style, our conclusions propose useful policy interventions to enhance sustainability transparency within each cultural tradition, such as development of legal <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>transparency</b> and sustainability, tools to motivate local managers for online diffusion of sustainability information and analysis of information needs of stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|In 2005, {{the first}} dispute {{settlement}} panels of the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{decided that the}} public could observe their oral hearings. Following three years of panel practice with open hearings where both parties requested public access, the Appellate Body in 2008 followed suit and held its first open hearings. Most people had believed this to be impossible without modification of the WTO Agreement, and WTO Members were far apart regarding the desirability and legality of open hearings. This controversy persists, but it has changed considerably, based on the entirely successful experience of open hearings to date, which has already prompted several WTO Members to change their position. The new practice is a historic and irreversible shift from sixty years of Practice under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and in the WTO. It is also remarkable {{given the importance of}} allowing public observation of judicial hearings, as it exists across the world both domestically and internationally. More than a quarter of WTO disputes currently have public hearings, and the future practice is likely to consolidate the trend. No political fallout has occurred so far, as it did on amicus curiae in 2000.

40|$|The {{negotiations}} between the EU and the US over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have generated {{a lot of discussion}} about investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). This discussion provided the inspiration for this thesis, with the TTIP in the background, setting the scene. In this thesis I study the nature of ISDS and the principle of transparency within investor-state arbitration. I aim to determine whether the use of ISDS is restricted to international arbitration and whether ISDS can be considered to constitute a system or regime. Furthermore, I consider whether the introduction of the UNCITRAL <b>Rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>Transparency</b> in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (2014, the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules) changes investor-state arbitration in relation to transparency. To achieve this, I examine ISDS provisions in several different international investment agreements (IIAs) and evaluate the ways in which transparency is incorporated into investment law. Moreover, I compare the provisions on transparency and confidentiality in institutional arbitration rules with the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules. I have formed several conclusions, including that the ISDS provisions may contain methods other than international arbitration and that ISDS does not constitute a system. Furthermore, the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules do change – theoretically, at least – investor-state arbitration to become more transparent. Whether the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules will make investor-state arbitration fully transparent depends on the actions of the contracting state parties when negotiating new IIAs and whether they choose to incorporate the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules in the IIAs already concluded...|$|E

40|$|Alfred Tennyson {{wrote in}} his {{stirring}} poem Ulysses, “Come my friends. 'Tis {{not too late to}} seek a newer world. ” Commentators similarly have been calling for a type of new world for investor-state arbitration through greater transparency. The 2014 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) <b>Rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>Transparency</b> represent a major milestone in realizing that new world, with the 2015 United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitration (Mauritius Convention) following closely on its heels in terms of timing and content. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the Transparency Rules and the Mauritius Convention will achieve their desired goals of bringing genuine transparency to the field of investor-state arbitration, especially since strong forces oppose such changes. By identifying and analyzing the ways that states have incorporated—and more importantly, failed to incorporate—provisions on transparency in their international investment agreements prior to the Transparency Rules and the Mauritius Convention, this Article shows the progressive nature of these two instruments. Indeed, the main core of transparency in investor-state arbitration emerged in the context of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and has been further advanced by such states as Canada and the United States. However, what this Article identifies as the NAFTA acquis on transparency largely has not been adopted by many of the thousands of international investment treaties now in existence. By highlighting the flaws within the Transparency Rules and Mauritius Convention, this Article cautiously predicts that these instruments will not have the dramatic impact on investor-state arbitration that one might have hoped for in the future...|$|E
40|$|PhDThis thesis {{analyses}} {{legal issues}} related to the participation in the Eurosystem by a national central bank (NCB). My aim is to develop principles {{that could be used for}} a national central bank law for a European Union Member State that has adopted the euro. The transfer of monetary policy to the supranational level has substantially changed the European central banking framework and confronted the NCBs with their new role as members of the Eurosystem. This membership has affected the governance structures of NCBs, with the emphasis on Governors and their independence. Most of the changes relate to the fulfilment of tasks of the Eurosystem and the level of independence needed by the NCBs to carry out these tasks. I have found that although there are differences amongst the Member States, the understanding of central bank independence is fairly similar throughout the EU. The accountability of the NCBs is driven not by the EU but by national rules, which is why the extent of reporting commitments varies between the Member States. The same is true of transparency, with some NCBs tending to be more open towards the general public than the others. However, it remains debatable whether there should be a harmonisation of <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>transparency</b> and accountability at the EU level and whether the establishment of such harmonised rules would set higher standards than the current average. A debate on whether the prudential supervision of credit institutions should be a European rather than a national matter has been going on for a number of years, and I would like to add to the discussion as far as the financial stability and ESCB-related tasks are concerned. Finally, on the basis of the Estonian NCB Statute, I suggest amendments reflecting best practices for central bank tasks, independence and accountability...|$|E
40|$|The {{past three}} decades have {{witnessed}} the fundamental achievements of China’s marketization. Through this process, state-owned enterprises have been restructured, monopoly is giving way to competition and private sectors are increasingly participating in public service provision. The concept of concession was first introduced in public utilities through the Circular on Questions Concerning the Ratification of Pilot Foreign Invested Concession Projects (1995), after which there were many experimental projects with BOTs and TOTs. In 2002, with the issuance of Opinions on Accelerating the Marketization of Urban Utilities, the concession system was officially introduced in public utility regulation. In the same year, the water pipelines were opened to foreign investment; concessions have since been extended into integrated municipal water groups. Concessions have become the major approach of public utility provision. In recent years, the accountability in concessions has raised wide concern. Problems exposed include fixed rate-of-return, state-owned assets losses, undue concession transfer, illegal concession award, unreasonable water tariff increase, and problematic service provision by private concessionaires. Commentators have claimed that an accountability gap exists in concessions. Taking water sector concessions as the subject of discussion, the author distinguishes three types of accountability: traditional bureaucratic accountability, legal accountability and public accountability. Through systematical examination of the problems, this dissertation attempts to achieve {{a better understanding of}} concession and its application in public utilities, and finds that the alleged accountability gap is attributed to traditional bureaucratic accountability and concession system per se. Four aspects of regulation in water concessions are considered: concessionaire selection; water pricing regulation; regulation by contract; and the regulatory framework. The findings suggest that under concessions, traditional bureaucratic accountability is neither adequate nor appropriate to hold the government accountable. More formal legal <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>transparency,</b> due process and public participation should be explored. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
