40|$|BACKGROUND Allergic {{sensitisation}} {{has been}} ascribed to a dysregulated relationship <b>between</b> allergen-specific <b>Th</b> 1, Th 2 and regulatory T cells. We hypothesised {{that the relationship}} between these T cell subsets could be better defined using a short-term allergen stimulation system followed by direct analysis of CD 154 -positive T cells. Using peripheral blood samples from birch pollinosis patients and healthy non-atopic controls, we sought to explore the frequencies and phenotype of birch-stimulated CD 154 -positive T helper cells following ex vivo birch allergen stimulation. RESULTS Activated CD 154 -positive Th 1, Th 2 and Tr 1 -like cells, that co-expressed IFNγ, IL- 4 and IL- 10 respectively, were identified in both birch-allergic and non-allergic participants. We observed a close correlation <b>between</b> <b>Th</b> 1, Th 2 and Tr 1 -like cell frequency in non-allergic volunteers, such that the three parameters increased together to maintain a low Th 2 : Th 1 ratio. The relationship <b>between</b> <b>Th</b> 1, Th 2 and Tr 1 -like responses was dysregulated in birch-allergic patients, with abrogation of the IL- 10 response and a higher Th 2 : Th 1 ratio. A close correlation was observed <b>between</b> <b>Th</b> 2 cell frequency and the absolute concentration of birch-specific IgE within the birch-allergic group, and we confirmed previous reports of a more differentiated T cell phenotype in allergic subjects. CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate an important balance between IFNγ, IL- 4 and IL- 10 [*]T cell responses to birch allergen in health, where Th 2 responses to allergens were frequently observed, but apparently balanced by Th 1 and regulatory responses. The detection of CD 154 positive T cells after short-term antigen stimulation may be a useful method for the detection of T cell responses to allergens when cost, speed and convenience are priorities...|$|R

40|$|CD 154 is a T cell {{activation}} marker, transiently expressed following ligation of the T cell receptor, therefore providing {{direct access}} to an antigen-specific T cell population. Using peripheral blood samples taken from allergic individuals and healthy non-atopic controls, this project identified and phenotyped CD 154 + T helper cells following ex vivo stimulation with native allergen extracts (birch pollen, cat dander, grass pollen). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with allergen extract for 16 hours {{in the presence of}} Brefeldin A. Responding CD 154 + T cells were identified and phenotyped using multiparametric flow cytometry. Activated CD 154 + TH 1, TH 2 and TR 1 -like cells, that co-expressed IFNγ, IL 4 and IL 10 respectively, were identified in allergic and non-allergic participants. A close correlation was observed <b>between</b> <b>TH</b> 1, TH 2 and TR 1 -like cell frequency in non-allergic participants, such that the three parameters increased together to maintain a low TH 2 :TH 1 ratio.

40|$|International audienceThyroid hormones (TH) {{are known}} to stimulate in vitro oxygen {{consumption}} of tissues in mammals and birds. Hence, in many laboratory studies a positive relationship <b>between</b> <b>TH</b> concentrations and basal metabolic rate (BMR) has been demonstrated whereas evidence from species in the wild is scarce. Even though basal and field metabolic rates (FMR) are often thought to be intrinsically linked it is still unknown whether a relationship <b>between</b> <b>TH</b> and FMR exists. Here we determine {{the relationship between the}} primary thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T 3) with both BMR and FMR in a wild bird species, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). As predicted we found a strong and positive relationship between plasma concentrations of T 3 and both BMR and mass-independent BMR with coefficients of determination ranging from 0. 36 to 0. 60. In contrast there was no association of T 3 levels with either whole-body or mass-independent FMR (R(2)  =  0. 06 and 0. 02, respectively). In accordance with in vitro studies our data suggests that TH {{play an important role in}} modulating BMR and may serve as a proxy for basal metabolism in wild birds. However, the lack of a relationship <b>between</b> <b>TH</b> and FMR indicates that levels of physical activity in kittiwakes are largely independent of TH concentrations and support recent studies that cast doubt on a direct linkage between BMR and FMR...|$|R

40|$|IL- 17 is a pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} {{implicated in}} autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The development/survival of IL- 17 -producing CD 4 T cells (Th 17) share critical cues with B-cell differentiation and the circulating follicular T helper subset was recently {{shown to be}} enriched in Th 17 cells able to help B-cell differentiation. We investigated a putative link <b>between</b> <b>Th</b> 17 -cell homeostasis and B cells by studying the Th 17 -cell compartment in primary B-cell immunodeficiencies. Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders (CVID), defined by defects in B-cell differentiation into plasma and memory B cells, are frequently associated with autoimmune and inflammatory manifestations but we found no relationship <b>between</b> these and <b>Th</b> 17 -cell frequency. In fact, CVID patients showed a decrease in Th 17 -cell frequency in parallel with the expansion of activated non-differentiated B cells (CD 21 (low) CD 38 (low)). Moreover, Congenital Agammaglobulinemia patients, lacking B cells due to impaired early B-cell development, had a severe reduction of circulating Th 17 cells. Finally, we found a direct correlation in healthy individuals <b>between</b> circulating <b>Th</b> 17 -cell frequency and both switched-memory B cells and serum BAFF levels, a crucial cytokine for B-cell survival. Overall, our data support a relationship <b>between</b> <b>Th</b> 17 -cell homeostasis and B-cell maturation, with implications for {{the understanding of the}} pathogenesis of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases and the physiology of B-cell depleting therapies...|$|R
