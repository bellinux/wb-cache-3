Since {{the area had}} become constrained for modern-day port operations, a section of riverfront {{to the north of}} the bridge had been selected for a new container terminal. Part of the existing areas of the harbor will be transformed into a <b>residential</b> <b>quarter.</b> The new container terminal is intended to raise the container volumes sufficiently to push the port back into the Top 5 of German river container ports.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 19th century on, a modern {{administrative}} and commercial centre began to spring {{up to the}} west of the old city, around the Barada, centred on the area known as al-Marjeh or the meadow. Al-Marjeh soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall on it. The courts of justice, post office and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanised <b>residential</b> <b>quarter</b> soon began to be built on the road leading between al-Marjeh and al-Salihiyah. The commercial and administrative centre of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, it was {{conceived}} of as a combined educational centre and a <b>residential</b> <b>quarter</b> for families associated with the then-nascent Yeshivat Har Etzion hesder yeshiva, an institution that by special arrangement with the government combines a five-year programme of religious study with army service. Graduates from these Gush Etzion yeshivot make up a disproportionately high percentage of fighting men in the elite units of Israel Defense Forces. It developed as a communal and service center in a predominantly agricultural region. For many years Alon Shvut housed the only health clinic, grocery, post office and bank in the area. It is currently classed as a Jewish locality, the only settlement in Gush Etzion to have that status.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the Cape route, caravel ships of Portuguese Franciscans and Dominicans set out to evangelize the no longer sealed lands of the East, and traversed the coasts in search of suitable centres for their operations. A legend tells how, when a caravel with some Franciscan missionaries was cruising up the Coromandel Coast, towards nightfall their attention was attracted by a light on shore and they decided to land there. They did, without knowing for some time that they had landed at the ruins of Betumah. But when they attempted to approach the light, it preceded them inland, across the ruins of the Nestorian town, over an empty stretch of ground, past (new) Mylapur and into a forest, where the light vanished. Here the Franciscans established a mission and built a church (still extant) in honour of Our Lady of Light in 1516, whence the locality, no longer a forest, but a wealthy <b>residential</b> <b>quarter,</b> is still known as The Luz—after Nossa Senhora da Luz (Portuguese for Our Lady of Light). The Dominicans followed in their wake, and in 1520 Fre. Ambrosio, O.P., was consecrated bishop for the Dominican missions at Cranganore and Mylapur.|$|E
500|$|The {{last two}} centuries of the third {{millennium}} BC saw widespread disruption of urban settlements in Syria and the abandonment of many cities; however, Qatna {{seems to be an}} exception, as it continued to grow.

The city may {{have been one of the}} urban centers of the Ib'al federation, perhaps the center of a king or prince. The early city occupied the acropolis, and none of its remains were found in the lower city. Most of the small settlements surrounding Qatna, [...] to , [...] appeared during this period; this might have been connected with the emergence of a central institution in the city.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the King took the throne, the city of Hanover was a densely packed {{residential}} town, and did not rise to the grand style of many German capitals. [...] Once the political crises of {{the first years of}} his reign had subsided, he set out to remedy this state of affairs. Ernest's support led to gas lighting in the city streets of Hanover, up-to-date sanitation {{and the development of a}} new <b>residential</b> <b>quarter.</b> [...] He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica's death, to leave standing the Altes Palais, where the two had lived since arriving in Hanover. Ernest's interest in and support of the railroads led to Hanover becoming a major rail junction, much to the nation's benefit. However, when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal [...] "this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this green field". The King finally gave his consent in 1844, and the opera house opened in 1852, a year after the King's death.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{expansion}} {{took place}} in the early 21st century when [...] "Master Horgan's Field" [...] adjacent to the northern boundary of the old graveyard was developed as a modern <b>residential</b> <b>quarter.</b> In earlier decades, the site was owned by Mr. Peter Horgan, a native of Kilmichael, County Cork, a place which won fame as the site of the famous ambush of the same name which took place there during the War of Independence, a fact of which the old master was very proud. Mr.Horgan was the long-time Principal of Bansha Boys National School in succession to Masters Pat Leahy and David Dee and also managed his own public house in Barrack Street. He also grew his own sallies on the river bank within the confines of his riverside garden, now sadly no more. These sallies made an occasional appearance in class and were an effective deterrent to wayward pupils. Nonthelass, he was a much loved character, reminiscent of Oliver Goldsmith's [...] "Village Schoolmaster". The only buildings on the site prior to development were the village telephone exchange erected in the 1960s and the [...] "Farmers Hall", a wooden building of fragile construction, which was erected in the mid 20th century by the young farmers association in the parish which was a precursor of Macra na Feirme. It was used for dancing, variety shows, [...] "pongo" [...] which was a form of modern-day bingo and on Sunday afternoons up to about 1962, as a rendezvous by locals who wished to tune into the commentary of major hurling and football matches relayed from Croke Park on [...] Radio Éireann.

The warmth of his reception was all that could be desired, and he alighted hastily in the first open space that presented itself.|$|E

60|$|It is {{said that}} living is dear in Gibraltar, {{especially}} {{in the matter of}} house rent. The houses in the town are like all the houses of Latin Europe in their gray or yellowish walls of stone or stucco and their dark-green shutters. There is an English <b>residential</b> <b>quarter</b> at the east end of the town, where the houses may be different, for all I know; the English of our driver or the hire of our state coach did not enable us to visit that suburb, where the reader may imagine villas standing in grounds with lawns and gardens about them. The English have prevailed nothing against the local civilization in most things, while they have infected it with the costliness of the whole Anglo-Saxon life. We should not think seven hundred dollars in New York dear for even a quite small house, but it has come to that in Gibraltar, and there they think it dear, with other things proportionately so. Of course, it is an artificial place; the fortress makes the town, and the town in turn lives upon the fortress.|$|E
60|$|Yet he was young, {{and it was}} not {{strange that}} in his idle moments his {{thoughts}} sometimes reverted to the pretty girl he had seen on the night of his arrival, nor that he should wish to parade his better fortune before her curious eyes. Neither was it strange that in this city, whose day-long sunshine brought every one into the public streets, he should presently have that opportunity. It chanced that one afternoon, being in the <b>residential</b> <b>quarter,</b> he noticed a well-dressed young girl walking before him in company with a delicate looking boy of seven or eight years. Something in the carriage of her graceful figure, something in a certain consciousness and ostentation of coquetry toward her youthful escort, attracted his attention. Yet it struck him that she was neither related to the child nor accustomed to children's ways, and that she somewhat unduly emphasized this to the passers-by, particularly those of his own sex, who seemed to be greatly attracted by her evident beauty. Presently she ascended the steps of a handsome dwelling, evidently their home, and as she turned he saw her face. It was the girl he remembered. As her eye caught his, he blushed with the consciousness of their former meeting; yet, in the very embarrassment of the moment, he lifted his hat in recognition. But the salutation was met only by a cold, critical stare. Randolph bit his lip and passed on. His reason told him she was right, his instinct told him she was unfair; the contradiction fascinated him.|$|E
