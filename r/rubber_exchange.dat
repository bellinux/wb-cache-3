40|$|A heat {{exchanger}} is a specialized device that assists in {{the transfer of}} heat from one fluid to the other. In some cases, a solid wall may separate the fluids and prevent them from mixing. In other designs, the fluids may be {{in direct contact with}} each other.

Heat <b>exchange</b> processes often contain time-delay. This paper deals with design of a universal digital control algorithm for control of a great deal of processes with time-delay. This algorithm is realized by the digital Smith Predictor based on polynomial approach - Linear Quadratic (LQ) method. For a minimization of the LQ criterion is used spectral factorization. The designed polynomial controllers were verified not only by simulation but also by a real-time control of an experimental laboratory {{heat exchanger}}...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{long term}} {{stability}} and durability of gaskets made of silicone <b>rubber</b> in proton <b>exchange</b> membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has important {{effect on the}} sealing and the electric-chemical performance of the fuel cell. In present paper, the time-dependent chemical degradation of a silicone rubber was studied in three simulated PEMFC environments. The test temperature was selected and used at 90 o C in this study according to the actual PEM fuel cell operation. Optical microscopy was used to show the topographical changes on the sample surface. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to study the surface chemistry of the gasket material before and after exposure to the simulated PEM fuel cell environments over time. The {{results show that the}} weight loss increased with the exposure time for the samples. Optical microscopy reveals that the surface conditions of the samples changed over time from initially smooth to rough, crack appearance and finally crack propagation. The ATR-FTIR results show that the surface chemistry changed significantly via de-crosslinking and chain scission in the backbone for the material over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{improvement}} of the mechanical properties of emulsified styrene butadiene <b>rubber</b> ion <b>exchange</b> membrane through blending with 60 nm carbon nanoballs is reported in this work. Homogeneous blending was achieved using a 200 W Probe Ultrasonicator at 60 % amplitude to produce a 160 Œºm thick nanocomposite ion exchange membrane. Weight concentrations varying from 0. 25 to 4 wt%CNB {{were added to the}} sulphonated styrene butadiene rubber in solution and cast by the evaporative technique. Mechanical testing was done using Hysitron Nanotensile 5000 Tester to evaluate the effects of blending. Tensile strength, œÉs, increased linearly (2 - 3. 88 MPa) with carbon nanoball volume fraction (Vf), achieving a maximum {{improvement of}} 94 % at 14. 2 % Vf. The Young‚Äôs modulus, E increased as a power function of Vf, reaching a maximum of 79 % (1 agglomeration. The fracture toughness, Uf. t increased as a power function of Vf up to a maximum improvement of 215 % (0. 84 ‚Äì 2. 65 MPa) at 14. 2 % Vf. Strain, e increased by a maximum of 63 % (0. 68 ‚Äì 1. 11) at 14. 2 % Vf. Higher ultrasonication amplitudes achieved superior dispersion effectiveness as compared to lower amplitudes. The nanofiller addition also significantly reduced degradation of mechanical properties with time. Below a critical nanofiller volume fraction, Vc, related to the fractional free volume of the polymer matrix, the E profile was consistent with existing models by Guth and Thomas. However, the coefficients of Vf, were significantly higher, which was attributed to the higher mechanical properties of carbon nanoballs as compared to the fillers assumed. Beyond Vc, agglomeration distorted the profile. The tensile strength profile for the well dispersed carbon nanoballs was different from the existing models by Nicolais and Narkis and Nielsen. It was concluded that the addition of [1 - 14 vol% (1 - 4 wt%) ] carbon nanoballs improved the mechanical properties by a margin between 79 % and 369 %. With good dispersion, it can also be shown that prediction of mechanical properties for a given Vf was possible. Further work on dispersion improvement was shown to have the potential to increase the mechanical properties by up to 700 %...|$|R
5000|$|In January 1962, the House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat) {{passed the}} Malaya <b>Rubber</b> <b>Exchange</b> (Incorporation) Bill. The Bill {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} a rubber market in Malaya and the formation of a Company set up and carrying on the business of a clearing house or settlement house, or both, to facilitate mercantile business, deal with all questions connected with the trade, marketing and distribution of rubber and the encouragement of research in the uses of rubber. It was also envisaged that the company act as arbitrators, or appoint arbitrators and umpires to mediate and settle disputes affecting rubber deals. The main object of the newly formed Malayan <b>Rubber</b> <b>Exchange</b> was identified as the promotion and development of the Malayan rubber industry, and the Penang Rubber Trade Association and its interests were represented through its ordinary membership in the new entity, these were further safeguarded through the appointment, by Government, of its President, Heah Joo-Seang to the Board of Directors of the new entity. Cheah Ewe-Keat, director of Harper Gilfillan a& Co. was selected Chairman of the Board of Directors of the new entity with Tee Teh, President of the Federation of Rubber Traders' Association as his Deputy Chairman.

5000|$|In May 1946 the Penang <b>Rubber</b> <b>Exchange</b> {{decided to}} make {{representations}} to the Chief Secretary of the Malayan Union (1) To fix the date {{for the restoration of}} Penang's free port status, and not to tax goods already in Penang; and (2) To ask that rubber duties be paid only at Butterworth and Prai, where customs houses had been opened. In early June a petition was sent to the Assistant Comptroller of Customs and Excise pointing out that excise duty levied on Penang [...] "constitutes an injustice to the local rubber trade." [...] The body alleged that [...] "large consignments of rubber, which ordinarily were forwardrd to Penang for sale," [...] had been [...] "diverted to Singapore to the detriment of Penang's interests" [...] {{as a result of the}} excise duty then being imposed. The Exchange asked that Penang, being a free port, should enjoy the same privilege as Singapore where no tax was being collected.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a notice}} in the Straits Times in August, Joo-Seang had bought from the Federation's Custodian of Property, about 26,000 acres of rubber estate land in Johore, at $6,000,000, {{by the start of}} October 1951. The {{transaction}} was the biggest of its kind up to that time involved property in the Kota Tinggi area and included Pengerang (4,632 acres), Senti (7,711), Belungkor (813), Telok Sengat (8,173), Sungei Ambok (843), Nanyo (3,089), Asahi (1,079), Sungei Seluyut (574), Tanjong Buai (132), and Buntu (425). This, {{on top of everything else}} he had done, pushed him to the forefront of the rubber business. He also actively led the industry to resolve issues. In February 1951 he convened and presided over a meeting of Penang merchants, both European and Asian, at the Penang <b>Rubber</b> <b>Exchange</b> to address the breakdown in discussions between the Penang Employers' Association and the owners of local lighters, the latter of whom were demanding a 25 percent increase in rates. The breakdown between the parties had negatively affected the trade of Penang. The matter, now being brought back to the table was resolved, and trading resumed.|$|E
5000|$|In early July N. L. Alexander, the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, {{called for}} a meeting between the Penang <b>Rubber</b> <b>Exchange</b> and the Penang Harbour Labour Association whose delegates {{informed}} those of The Exchange that, while no final strike decision had been taken, the reduced rates proposed by The Exchange and the Penang Chamber of Commere, had been rejected. Koh Pheah-Teng, Secretary of The Exchange acknowledged the rejection and said The Exchange appreciated the supporting grounds put forward by the labourers that (1) with rubber prices declining there was less {{work to be done}} and therefore less income to be had by the dock workers and (2) the cost of living had risen with the increased price of rationed foodstuff and workers were having a difficult time scraping by. He said, however, that handling charges in Penang were more than double the prevailing rates in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Perak and Kedah, as a result of which rubber originally intended for Penang had been diverted to other ports - North Perak and Kedah dealers saved on the higher handling charges in Penang by sending their rubber to Province Wellesley, for example. Pheah-Teng said that if labour costs were reduced, it would be the labourers themselves, and not just the rubber dealers who would benefit from the greater flow of trade through the island's port.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after, in 1913, the Penang Chamber of Commerce {{formed a}} Rubber Association {{to provide a}} market for this {{principal}} article of local agriculture through weekly auction sales. It was envisaged that large supplies of rubber would be attracted and {{that there would be}} regular buyers. When the idea for the Rubber Association was first mooted, Allen Dennys & Co., who had already been performing auctions in Penang since November 1912, in an earlier circular to their clients, asked them to favour the firm by appointing them as their agents, promising to defray all fees due to The Chamber out of the 1 per cent commission charged. The first auction was held on 12 November where 24,707 lbs. were offered of which 22,882 lbs were sold. In January 1915, at the annual general meeting of the Penang Chamber of Commerce, Messrs. Allen Dennys and Company asked for a fixed fee of $5 be paid in respect of each occasion a seller conducts a sale in the chamber, instead of the prevailing brokerage of one-eighth percent, pointing out that the firm had been the sole supporter of the association and that 91.50 percent of the fees had been borne by them. The committee discussing the issue, objected, pointing out that while the facts relating to the percentage of fees were admitted, that percentage it was also necessary to acknowledge that the business had increased by more than 150 percent {{since the start of the}} association fourteen months earlier. At this point Allen Dennys and Company withdrew from membership in the association, which brought sales in the association room to a halt. Other members were called upon to step forward and fill the place vacated by Allen Dennys and Company. In August 1915, at the half-yearly general meeting chaired by John Mitchell, it was revealed that the position remained the same as advised at the general meeting earlier - no member had come forward with any propositions and the committee had not taken any steps to re-establish sales under the Penang Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association. There was nothing more heard on the subject and the interests of members of Penang's rubber trade remained unrepresented until the advent of the Rubber Trade Association of Penang, in the form of its original incarnation, The Penang <b>Rubber</b> <b>Exchange.</b> Allen Dennys' firm, however, continued to hold rubber auctions, on their own. By late February 1917, the firm had conducted its 258th sale. The results of each of the firm's rubber auctions was published in the Straits Times, the last of which appeared in the issue of 18 May 1918.|$|E
