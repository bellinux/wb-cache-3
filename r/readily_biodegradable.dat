The comparative analysis between C/N 15 (k m =  68.1105), C/N 20 (k m =  80.1805) and control (k m =  62.4675) experiments revealed that cattle manure which contains <b>readily</b> available <b>biodegradable</b> materials, when coupled with sewage sludge and sawdust in the desired proportions; it does not satisfied the affinity of the compost mixture for microbial activities, and was further as evidenced with lesser r m values (C/N 15 : 0.5214; C/N 20 : 0.8297; control: 0.3330). As a result, these waste proportions do not suit well for the degradation process due to lesser availability of the carbon source as compared to C/N 25 and 30. It also might be due to insufficient aeration which resembles lesser r m values observed in C/N 15 (0.5214), C/N 20 (0.8297) and control (0.3330) experiments.

40|$|Waste-based {{biomass energy}} using bio-degradation {{technologies}} {{is a critical}} solution for both energy harvesting and biomass waste recycling. It has no region restriction and can potentially supply affordable energy for human development. It is an environmentally- and ecologically- friendly renewable energy technology minimizing environmental effects, conserving landfill space, and delivering bio-fuels and organic fertilizers. Primary and secondary costs are low and can be further reduced if the bio-degradation rate can be raised. ^ This study proposes an innovative, two-step renewable energy harvester using rapid waste bio-degradation technologies. The renewable energy harvester has two stages. Stage 1 is a fast biomass waste aerobic degradation system for generating bio-heat energy and effectively pretreating biomass feedstock to <b>readily</b> anaerobically <b>biodegradable</b> products. Stage 2 is a fast biomass waste anaerobic degradation system using the residuals from stage 1 for rapidly producing biogas energy and fertilizers. ^ Laboratory feasibility testing shows that: 1) stage 1 can obtain a sustainable heat recovery rate of 15. 0 - 18. 2 W/kg and about 50 - 90 % of energy can be reclaimed in about 4 - 6 days, 2) stage 2 can obtain an optimal 1. 6 - 1. 8 L of biogas production per L of wet biomass waste every day; 25 - 35 % of energy contained in the aerobically pretreated wet biomass mixture can be recovered in 8 - 12 days. In total, with the combination of fast aerobic and anaerobic bio-degradation processes, the majority of biomass energy can be reclaimed in around two weeks. It is 5 - 10 times faster than that of traditional bio-degradation technologies. ^ Wide use of this renewable energy harvester with rapid waste bio-degradation technologies for society can realize a number of benefits, such as producing renewable bio-heat and biogas energy for human life and development uses, saving limited, non-renewable fossil fuels, constantly delivering healthy bio-fertilizers, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving useable land, and protecting water and air quality. ...|$|R

Here we investigate the liquid crystalline structural features of poly(desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine dodecyl dodecanedioate), poly(DTD DD), a new bioresorbable poly(ester amide) that is currently studied in vivo as a slow-degrading implantable biomaterial for load bearing applications. Thermally induced structural changes in poly(DTD DD) were studied using simultaneously differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray scattering. The hexatic SmB organization of the polymer chains that exists at room temperature becomes progressively disordered upon heating, changing into a SmF phase and then into a smectic C phase at 60 °C before turning into a free-flowing melt at 130 °C.

A structural model with an interesting 3 -fold symmetry in the packing of the side chains around the rigid aromatic main chain, and the packing of these chains into fibrils is proposed.

The study further demonstrates that the photo-induced transformation of the pharmaceuticals was faster upon irradiation with a Hg lamp (UV light) than with a Xe lamp emitting a spectrum that mimics sunlight.

No cyto- and genotoxic effects were found in human cervical (HeLa) and liver (Hep-G 2) cells for any of the investigated compounds or their phototransformation products.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to define new methodologies and new Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) schemes for urban waste water reuse for the {{sustainable}} irrigation of energy crops. In the new proposed scheme, wastewater is sent to the WWTP characterized by simplified treatment schemes, able to remove pathogens and dangerous components for the environment, but releasing nutrients useful for the fertigation of energy crops. The more important advancement is that the proposed plant has a significant operational flexibility, guaranteed by the possibility of gradually changing the plant configuration passing from the configuration of the irrigation period to that of the period without irrigation. The proposed plant is also able to selectively remove only the harmful substances. The wastewater reclamation is obtained modifying a common activated sludge process with predenitrification. Numerical simulations have been performed by implementing the ASM 1 model using SIMULINK in MATLAB code. For the sedimentation tank the model proposed by Takács has been used. The developed model allows us to run simulations in nonirrigated and irrigated periods, which are characterized by different plant configurations. The simulation results show that the effluent concentrations of the various substances (<b>readily</b> and slowly <b>biodegradable</b> organic matter, nitrites, nitrates and ammonia) are highly variable depending on the plant configuration.

These processes are supported by sorption, sedimentation and assimilation. Thanks to these advantages, treatment wetland systems have been used in communal management for over 50 years. In recent years, thanks to its advantages, low operational costs and high removal efficiency, there is growing interest in the use of constructed wetlands for the treatment or pre-treatment of various types of industrial wastewater.

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most frequently ruptured ligament, accounting for an estimated 200, 000 injuries and approximately 100, 000 reconstructive surgeries {{each year in the}} United States. Due to the poor regenerative potential of the ACL and limitations of current ACL reconstruction techniques, development of a tissue engineered graft could have a significant clinical impact. Despite the robust and versatile properties of synthetic scaffolds, current iterations still have high failure rates due to degradation, wear, or fatigue. Polyurethanes utilizing ester-based soft segments were recently investigated as potential ligament grafts due to their established biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties, and exceptionally tunable structure. However, non-specific hydrolytic degradation makes it difficult to match tissue regeneration, resulting in premature graft failure or stress shielding of the neotissue. In contrast, a biomaterial that features system-responsive degradation would integrate with native ligament remodeling and thus provide effective load transfer. It is well established that a graded load transfer from the graft to the neotissue during remodeling is necessary for proper organization of connective tissues which is strongly correlated to the resulting mechanical properties. In this study, synthetic routes were first developed to create a linear polyurea elastomer system with appropriate chemistry to <b>readily</b> incorporate a <b>biodegradable</b> peptide diamine. Polyureas were selected due to their tunable segmental chemistry, high elasticity and fatigue strength, and mild reaction conditions that permits incorporation of biological molecules at ambient conditions. Collagen-mimetic soft segments were first created by conjugating an enzyme-labile peptide diamine and commercially available polyether diamines. Candidate prepolymers were then chain extended with hexamethylene diisocyanate and mixed diamines. Particular focus was given to identifying compositions that permitted high molecular weight generation without gelation. By varying soft segment chemistry, soft segment molecular weight, and the hard-to-soft segment ratio, a library of polyureas was developed. This library was then used to elucidate key structure-property relationships necessary to tune mechanical properties and degradation rates of candidate polyureas. Finally, the enzyme-mediated degradation of candidate polyureas with variable peptide concentrations was investigated. In summary, synthesis of a novel biomaterial that combines the strength and tunability of synthetic elastomers with cell-responsive degradation will assist in the development of an improved tissue engineered graft for ACL reconstruction...|$|R
