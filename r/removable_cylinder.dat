2500|$|After {{the first}} World war the company adopted a single model {{policy and the}} Forty was re-introduced with a 6.2-litre overhead-cam engine in unit with a 3-speed gearbox still using {{epicyclic}} gears and a worm drive rear axle. It was very expensive, dearer than a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and to maintain production a smaller car, the Twenty One joined the range in 1924. This had a 3.1-litre, six-cylinder engine, now with <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> head, mated to a four-speed conventional gearbox and four-wheel brakes. It grew to the 3.3-litre Twenty Three in 1926. [...] The Forty was finally replaced by the Thirty with straight-eight 4.4-litre engine in 1928. A further series of armoured cars was made in 1927, using a six-wheeled version of the Forty chassis.|$|E
5000|$|The cam was chain-driven, and the block, head, sump, rocker cover, intake manifold, {{and other}} parts were aluminum. It weighed only 146 kg, just 6 kg more than the {{previous}} , but produced [...] It had <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> liners, with both the aluminum oil pump and distributor driven off the crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|The new 10B {{debuted in}} 1902. It had a [...] (100 by 140 mm) {{vertical}} twin rated 12/14 hp by RAC, mounted in front, with <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> head, steering wheel (rather than bicycle handles or tiller), and chain drive. Delahaye also entered the Paris-Vienna rally with a [...] four; Pirmez was thirty-seventh in the voiturette class. At the same year's Ardennes event, Perrin's [...] four came tenth.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, {{commercial}} padlocks {{can also}} be included, although these rarely have <b>removable</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Standardised types of cylinder include: ...|$|R
25|$|Learning Technologies Inc. in Massachusetts {{offered the}} first easily {{portable}} planetarium in 1977. Philip Sadler designed this patented system which projected stars, constellation figures from many mythologies, celestial coordinate systems, and much else, from <b>removable</b> <b>cylinders</b> (Viewlex and others followed {{with their own}} portable versions).|$|R

5000|$|The Walther LG400 is an {{air rifle}} first {{introduced}} in 2010 as {{the successor to}} the Walther LG300. It is a PCP (pre-charged pneumatic) powered by compressed air from a <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder.</b> It {{was designed as a}} 10 metre air rifle for indoor competition use but has been successfully modified to 16 J power for Field Target (FT) [...] and Hunter Field Target (HFT) [...] outdoor use.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 1 is {{a double}} action only pepper-box weapon, and its <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{magazine}} fits {{into the side of}} a gun, being inserted and removed through a door {{on the left side of}} the gun. The frame, cylinder, door assembly, and action are made of aluminum, the trigger is made of self-lubricating nylon, and all other parts are made of stainless steel. The magazine holds six rounds.|$|E
5000|$|The Remington Model 1890 New Model Army was a {{revolver}} by the Remington Arms. It was a {{based upon the}} successful Remington Model 1875 and the lesser known Model 1888 with both revolvers having the same size, appearance, and the <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The 1890 Remington single-actions kept the solid frame and similar styling of the 1875 model, but lacking the large web under the ejector rod housing and equipped with checkered rubber grips. Like the 1875 model, the 1890 was suitably made for metallic cartridges, but only issued in [...]44-40 caliber.|$|E

2500|$|In many of {{the first}} {{generation}} of cartridge revolvers (especially those that were converted after manufacture), the base pin on which the cylinder revolved was removed, and the cylinder taken from the revolver for loading. Most revolvers using this method of loading are single-action revolvers, although Iver Johnson produced double-action models with <b>removable</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The removable-cylinder design is employed in some modern [...] "micro-revolvers" [...] (usually in [...]22 caliber), in order to simplify their design. These weapons are small enough to fit in the palm of the hand.|$|R
40|$|A 2 -watt, 4 -K helium {{refrigerator}} {{using the}} Gifford-McMahon/Joule Thomson cycle is described. The unit features a <b>removable</b> displacer <b>cylinder</b> and high-efficiency, low-pressure drop heat exchangers. These improvements {{result in a}} 100 percent increase in cooling power over the existing Deep Space Network system. The effects of the heat exchanger efficiency and Gifford-McMahon expander performance on refrigerator capacity are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Commercial {{vehicles}} {{based on}} the car chassis were also built from 1922 and became an increasingly {{important part of the}} company's output. Jowett first exhibited at the London Motor Show in 1921 and gradually broke out of their previous local market. In 1923 coil ignition and electric starting were added and the four-seater [...] "Long Four" [...] was introduced in tourer form priced from £245 followed in 1925 by a closed saloon model, the previous short-chassis two-seater continuing in production. In 1929, the engine received <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> heads to ease maintenance and braking was on all four wheels. Production was briefly suspended in September 1931 when fire swept through the works.|$|E
50|$|The Buick Straight 6 was {{an engine}} {{manufactured}} by Buick from 1914-1930. Engines from 1914-1916 {{are known as}} Series 50 engines and 1916-1923 were known as the Series 40. They were OHV, like their previous engines, as Buick had been using overhead valve engines since the Model B in 1904. The engine also had the starter and the alternator driven by one belt. The engine {{did not have a}} <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> head, meaning Pistons had {{to come out of the}} bottom of the engine. They had a displacement ranging from 191 to 331 cubic inches depending on year and model. The Buick Straight-8 engine replaced the straight 6 across the board in all models, starting in 1931.|$|E
50|$|Remington Model 1875 Single Action Army (a.k.a. Improved Army or Frontier Army) was a {{revolver}} by E. Remington & Sons. It {{was based upon}} the successful Remington Model 1858 with both revolvers having the same size, appearance, and the <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The new 1875 Remington differed mainly from the older 1858 percussion model by having a bored through cylinder chambered for metallic cartridges. Thus, in 1875, Remington entered the cartridge revolver market with this big-frame, army style revolver, intended {{to compete with the}} Colt Peacemaker. Ordinary citizens and Old West lawmen alike recognized the sturdy quality of the new Remington revolvers. This design was followed by the Model 1888 and the Model 1890.|$|E
5000|$|It {{features}} an exclusive high pressure {{direct fuel injection}} similar to the Pumpe Düse (PD) system found in Volkswagen's car engines, the Hydraulic Electronic Unit Injector - HEUI - with electro-hydraulic digital unit injectors and extended durability, developed by the partner company Siemens/VDO. [...] An important advantage is the <b>removable</b> wet <b>cylinder</b> liners which will assist with easier maintenance and lower costs.|$|R
2500|$|The Farman-Voisin biplane was {{powered by}} a {{water-cooled}} Antoinette V8 engine which developed [...] at 1,400 rpm. It used an early form of direct gasoline injection and weighed only 190 pounds in working order, including the water-filled cooling system. The engine block was cast aluminium, holding <b>removable</b> steel <b>cylinders.</b> [...] Levavasseur's Antoinette engines often included advanced features, including direct fuel injection and evaporative engine cooling.|$|R
50|$|Located near Lake Neuchâtel, Reuge {{is one of}} {{the last}} of the Swiss {{survivors}} making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without automatons in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they now also offer traditional looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around a 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with <b>removable</b> <b>cylinders</b> and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 45 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, still cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Frères or Paillard.|$|R

A further series of armoured cars was made in 1927, using a six-wheeled version of the Forty chassis.|$|E
50|$|The XU {{design was}} {{introduced}} in 1981 with the Peugeot 305. It was a SOHC or DOHC straight-4 design with two or four valves per cylinder, using petrol as fuel. It was applied transversely in front wheel drive vehicles only, tilted by 30°. Displacement ranged between 1580 and 1998 cc, and all production XU gasoline engines had a bore of 83 mm (3.3 in) or 86 mm (3.4 in). The engine uses in all models aluminium cylinder head. All models blocks are made, except XU10, in cast aluminium alloy with removable cast iron wet cylinder liners. XU10 blocks are made in cast iron, with bores machined directly in the block, without <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> liners. Its first Citroën application was on the Citroën BX in 1983, where it appeared in 1580cc format.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1982, the Renault Board {{proposed}} a new 1596 cm³ diesel engine with 55 bhp for the Renault 9. Known as [...] "F8M", the new engine {{was designed by}} engineer George Douin and his team and broke with tradition by featuring no <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> liners, thanks to advances in metals technology that significantly slow the wear of rubbing mechanical parts. The new 4- cylinder unit adopted an overhead camshaft driven by a toothed belt that also controls the diesel injection pump. A second belt rotates the alternator and water pump, while a vacuum pump located at the rear operates the brake servo. The cast iron block is topped by a light alloy cylinder head featuring Ricardo Comet prechambers. The engine is mounted transversely inclined rearwards 12°. A {{few months after the}} release of the Renault 9 Diesel, the Renault 11 was launched in April 1983, the diesel version being introduced in autumn 1983.|$|E
5000|$|Originally called CG guns (compressed gas guns), air guns {{utilizing}} prefilled <b>removable</b> gas <b>cylinders</b> {{as power}} source {{have now become}} known as CO2 guns due to the ubiquitous commercial use of bottled carbon dioxide gas. Most CO2 guns use a disposable cylinder called a [...] "Powerlet", that is often purchased with 12 g of pressurized CO2 gas, although some, usually more expensive models, use larger refillable CO2 reservoirs like those typically used with paintball markers.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} water-cooled, and is {{produced}} using cast-iron <b>cylinder</b> block, with <b>removable</b> wet type <b>cylinder</b> liners. The engine utilizes diesel fuel {{delivered in a}} direct injection method from individual electronically controlled and camshaft actuated unit pumps. The cylinder heads are separate units for each cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|... [...] Four-stroke, air-cooled, {{concentric}} {{torsion bar}} valve springs on roller bearings, hollow aluminum push rods with hardened steel tips, roller main bearings and big end rod bearings of [...] "Panhard Patent" [...] design {{with an additional}} set of smaller rollers carrying the roller cage (separator); non-removable <b>cylinder</b> heads, <b>removable</b> steel <b>cylinder</b> liners. The cylinder [...] "jugs" [...] pulled off the crankcase and pistons {{like those of the}} VW air-cooled engines. Soft engine mounts to smooth the roughness of the two-cylinder four-stroke engine, radial flow fan bolted to crank shaft, full cooling shroud, aluminum structure and cooling fins. Herringbone timing gears, steel pinion and a [...] "Celcon" [...] phenolic gear running with slight interference fit, permissible due to the flexibility of the [...] "Celcon".|$|R
5000|$|In 1905 the Stevens Motor Manufacturing Company built a V-twin {{motorcycle}} {{powered by}} a JA Prestwich Industries Ltd motor, with leading-link front forks and a swinging fork at the rear. [...] A new company, A J Stevens & Co (AJS), was founded in 1909 to manufacture motorcycles and at the 1912 London Motorcycle show they launched the 698cc side valve AJS Model D. Featuring cylinders at 50 degrees and chain drive to a three speed countershaft gearbox with a hand gear change, the original engines had quickly <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> heads but after problems with oil leaks a more permanent head was specified for 1913. [...] The side valve engine was lubricated by a 'total loss' system operated by a hand pump. Ignition was achieved with a Splitdorf Magneto and the fuel system featured an Amac automatic carburettor. The silencer was made from cast aluminium and the frame was a tubular 'diamond' construction, with Brampton bi-flex front forks, which had an unusual two way movement, and quickly detachable wheels. The sidecar version of the Model D proved particularly successful and became so popular that AJS {{were not able to}} meet demand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{new version}} of the five-bearing engine {{initially}} fitted on the Renault 12 retained the <b>removable</b> <b>cylinder</b> liners that Renault had long favoured. [...] It rejected the [...] "oversquare" [...] cylinder dimensions that had become fashionable with some European auto-makers during the 1960s. [...] Many components, such as the oil pump and the distributor were unchanged, while others, including the cylinder head, the valve gear and the engine block itself were only minimally updated. [...] The only completely reworked elements were the cylinder liners, the connecting rods, the pistons themselves and the crankshaft. [...] In the 1962 version of the engine the cylinders had been unevenly spaced in two groups of two, but in this new application they were equidistant in order to allow for the cylinder diameter, here increased to 73mm, to be combined with space for sufficient coolant to circulate around the cylinders. The longitudinal placement of the engine, most of its mass positioned ahead of the front wheels, allowed the R12 to have a very simple design of the gear-selector that was placed {{on the floor of the}} car, and not on the dashboard as with the R4 or on the steering column as with the R16. On the early cars the handle to operate the handbrake was placed under the dashboard. The handbrake was later relocated to a position between the two front seats.|$|E
50|$|The crude tinfoil {{phonograph}} {{proved to}} be of little use except as a novelty. It {{was not until the}} late 1880s that an improved and much more useful form of phonograph was marketed. The new machines recorded on easily <b>removable</b> hollow wax <b>cylinders</b> and the groove was engraved into the surface rather than indented. The targeted use was business communication, and in that context the cylinder format had some advantages. When entertainment use {{proved to be}} the real source of profits, one seemingly negligible disadvantage became a major problem: the difficulty of making copies of a recorded cylinder in large quantities.|$|R
