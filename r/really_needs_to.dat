25|$|Most of the {{butterfly}} colony areas still host economic {{activities such as}} subsistence farming and livestock raising. In some areas, such as Sierra Chincua, Cerro Pelon and El Rosario, there are still problems with illegal logging to supply local fuel needs {{as well as for}} raw materials for handicrafts. El Rosario is named after the local ejido which belongs to about 10,000 “campesinos” or rural farmers. Many of these people make a living through farming and the sale of handcrafts and foods to tourists. Information about the butterflies is insufficient as it is not know the full extent of their wintering areas, nor the ecology of the area. Because of this, it is not known how large the reserve <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be for the preservation of {{the butterfly}}.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|On a $25 million budget, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, [...] "Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those." [...] Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film. The scene featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, [...] "A director <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs." [...] He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing {{the outside of the}} prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.|$|E

2500|$|Schedeen awarded Arrows episode an 8.7 out of 10, stating, [...] "This Arrow episode worked {{much better}} as a 100th episode celebration than it did the middle act of the Invasion crossover. The Cisco/Team Arrow subplot did little to advance the larger narrative. On the other hand, the dream prison premise served as an emotionally rich and action-packed way to {{celebrate}} the show's first 100 episodes. But with only one episode left to go in this crossover, the pacing <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> pick up if fans {{are going to get}} the epic superhero mash-up they deserve." [...] Alasdair Wilkins for The A.V. Club gave Arrow an [...] "A", saying, [...] ""Invasion!" [...] could have been an unholy mess, balancing the needs of a three-part crossover with the Arrow-specific celebration of the 100-episode milestone. But the decision to focus on the show's past and bring back old favorites like Moira, Deathstroke, Robert, and Moira—Moira is worth listing twice—ends up giving the show a way to develop the power and the threat of the Dominators without this crossover just being three straight episodes of heroes and aliens punching each other. Tonight's episode also once again proves that Arrow doesn't need to be gloomy or choked by petty interpersonal conflict to tell effective stories". Wilkins concluded: [...] "If this is how Arrow marks 100 episodes, then here's to 100 more. If this isn’t the best episode in Arrows history, it's damn close." ...|$|E
60|$|Through the provision-ground we {{struggled}} up, among weeds {{as high as}} our shoulders; {{so that it was}} difficult, as usual, {{to distinguish}} garden from forest. But no matter to the black owner. The weeds were probably of only six weeks' growth; and when they got so high that he actually could not find his tanias {115b} among them, he would take cutlass and hoe, and make a lazy raid upon them, or rather upon a quarter of them, certain of two facts; that in six weeks more they would be all as high as ever; and that if they were, it did not matter; for so fertile is the soil, so genial the climate, that he would get in spite of them more crop off the ground than he needed. 'Pity the poor weeds. Is there not room enough in the world for them and for us?' seems the Negro's motto. But he knows his own business well enough, and can exert himself when he <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> do so; and if the weeds harmed him seriously he would make short work with them. Still this soil, and this climate, put a premium on bad farming, as they do on much else that is bad.|$|E

Her work consists of certain definite matters, which being done her time is her own; and if she have skill and address {{in the management of}} her duties, she may secure many leisure hours. As houses are now built, and with the many labor-saving conveniences that are being introduced, the physical labor of housework {{is no more than a}} healthy woman <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> keep her in health. In case, however, of those slight illnesses to which all are more or less liable, and which, if neglected, often lead to graver ones, the advantage is still on the side of domestic service. In the shop and factory, every hour of unemployed time is deducted; an illness of a day or two is an appreciable loss of just so much money, while the expense of board is still going on. But in the family a good servant is always considered. When ill, she is carefully nursed as one of the family, has the family physician, and is subject to no deduction from her wages for loss of time. I have known more than one instance in which a valued domestic has been sent, at her employer's expense, to the seaside or some other pleasant locality, for change of air, when her health has been run down.|$|E
