40|$|AbstractServo {{scanning}} 3 D micro electro {{discharge machining}} (3 D SSMEDM) method can automatically compensate the axial wear of micro <b>rod-electrode</b> in real time by preferably keeping a discharge gap. However, the depth errors of 3 D SSMEDM were even to 10 % due to the accumulation of layers’ thickness errors. In addition, the machining process with keeping the discharge gap must bring the initial errors of inclined or uneven workpiece-surfaces into dimensional errors, and also cause that 3 D structures cannot be machined on the workpieces with a hollow area. In this study, a layer depth constrained algorithm (LDCA) is proposed to solve the above problems. LDCA strategy is to control an electrode-feed maximum at every scanning spot during 3 D SSMEDM processes. By using LDCA, machining experiments were carried out on several typical micro cavities < 1 mm of rectangle, truncated cone and cross structure. The experimental results show: The accumulation errors of the layers’ thickness can be avoided, so the machined depth errors can be controlled < 2 μm. The designed 3 D structures can be machined in the workpieces with unknown hollow areas...|$|E
40|$|There are applications, {{which require}} MeV-range multiple-beams {{consisting}} {{of a large number}} of identical highly packed beamlets. The multiple-beam RFQ (MB-RFQ) arranged as a matrix array of longitudinal <b>rod-electrodes</b> is appropriate candidate. A configuration of MB-RFQ resonator should ensure identical quadrupole fields in every accelerating channel. The MB-RFQ resonators based on TEM transmission lines are studied. The resonators are designed by a periodical multiplication of a 4 -rod unit cell in transverse direction. To understand fields of resonator the normal mode technique is applied. Novel configurations of MB-RFQ resonators based on these normal modes are generated. The RF properties of resonators are verified with computer simulations done with MAFIA code. Beam dynamics study for the initial 400 -keV MB-RFQ has been performed using PARMTEQ code. The MB-RFQ parameters and the results of beam dynamics simulations are presented. The calculated beam transmission is 33 % at injection of 50 -keV, 20 mA deuteron beam. Comment: 7 pages, 19 figure...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{interest}} in using multiple-beam RFQ (MB-RFQ) with a high packing of beamlets {{for a variety of}} purposes. The principle of the MB-RFQ arranged as a matrix array of longitudinal <b>rod-electrodes</b> is known for a long time. It allows to reach a packing factor up to 40 %. The unsolved problem is to define such configuration of resonator, which preserves a high packing without disturbing RFQ fields and correctly excites electrodes surrounding every channel. According to the usual design principle, which is extended from a single-channel 4 -rod RFQ to MB-RFQ resonators, every electrode of MB-RFQ must be discretely connected with tank by coupling elements, while adjacent RFQ electrodes having different potentials cannot be interconnected by short-circuited couplers and the couplers may interconnect only next adjacent electrodes "in a chess order", avoiding adjacent electrodes. The principle reduces a packing factor considerably from the above value. A new principle for MB-RFQ is suggested. A high packing factor is preserved, because of discrete connections of adjacent electrodes are allowed. The beam dynamics in RFQ-channels is modified. Beams perform "slalom " motions, utilizing intrinsic transverse oscillations. Essential design issues are discussed...|$|R
