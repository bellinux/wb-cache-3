40|$|Restricted Access. Formulae {{are given}} for the {{aperture}} plane phase errors which are incurred in near-field <b>radioholography</b> of reflector antennas when a simple Fresnel correction is used. Approximate analytic expressions are derived for circular data windows and antennas with parabolic illumination taper. Infocus and defocused cases are treated. Numerical simulations are used for estimating errors for square data window...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{three-dimensional}} tomography based on <b>radioholography</b> measurements with the reference signal transmitted by the transmitter {{in the near}} zone and the receiver near zone. We {{solve the problem of}} repairing the object signal phase due to the reference signal in the near field in a wide frequency band and the consideration of analytical signals. Here are presented results of experimental studies on application of a tunable YIG (yttrium iron garnet) oscillator in the frequency range from 6. 5 to 10. 7 GHz for radio tomography of metal objects in air. Holographic principle is applied on the basis of measuring of the interference field amplitude by the detector diode. The interference occurs with the direct wave and waves scattered by the object. To restore the radio images the method of aperture synthesis and extraction of quadrature components at all frequencies sensing are applied. Experimental study on test object shows resolution about 15 mm...|$|E
