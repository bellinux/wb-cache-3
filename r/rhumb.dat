5|$|Gerardus Mercator (5 March 1512– 2 December 1594) was a 16th-century German-Flemish cartographer, {{geographer}} and cosmographer. He was {{renowned for}} creating the 1569 world map based on a new projection which represented sailing courses of constant bearing (<b>rhumb</b> lines) as straight lines—an innovation that is still employed in nautical charts.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or <b>rhumb</b> lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained his method.|$|E

5|$|In the 15th century, West European mariners—beginning with Portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using {{improvements}} on translated Islamic star {{charts and}} {{a variation on}} African fishing boats called the caravel. In 1473, Lopes Gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487; in 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India. In 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth, the Genovese Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient. Instead, he made landfall on {{an island in the}} Caribbean Sea. The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes, corn, and chili peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. In 1519, Juan Sebastián Elcano completed Magellan's Spanish expedition to sail around the world. These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings (<b>rhumb</b> lines) straight. In the Arctic, in 1594, the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while, in the south, Anthony de la Roché crossed the Antarctic Convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one British, one American, and one Russian—all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820. Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe. Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910, Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century. Despite a long-standing preference for autarky, China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties. In the early 15th century, Zheng He's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the African coast. Chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{navigation}} by loxodrome or <b>rhumb</b> line {{refers to}} a path of constant bearing; the resulting path is a logarithmic spiral, similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic Möbius transformation makes. See the geometric figures below.|$|E
25|$|Pedro Nunes, one of {{the first}} Europeans to apply {{mathematics}} to cartography, discovered the concept of <b>rhumb</b> lines, later applied to the Mercator projection, which, in 1569, revolutionized cartography. He was also the inventor of several measuring apparatus, including the nonius, to measure fractions of a degree.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Muslims from North America {{have used}} two rules to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} Qiblah. According to spherical calculations, a Muslim praying from Anchorage, Alaska would pray almost due north if determining the Qiblah. However, when one looks at the world on most Mercator map projections, Mecca appears to be southwest of Anchorage. The shortest <b>rhumb</b> line (line of constant bearing) from most points in North America to Mecca will point toward the southeast, but the distance to Mecca along this route on the actual surface of the earth is longer than the great circle route.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} {{regarding}} how one measures direction for this purpose. Some say one should face the direction {{which would be}} the shortest distance to Jerusalem, i.e. the arc of a great circle, as defined in elliptic geometry. Thus in New York one would face north-northeast. Others say one should face the direction along a <b>rhumb</b> line path to Jerusalem, which would not require an alteration of compass direction. This would be represented by a straight line on a Mercator projection, which would be east-southeast from New York. In practice, many individuals in the Western Hemisphere simply face due east, regardless of location. In the presence of an ark that does not face Jerusalem, one should pray toward the ark instead.|$|E
500|$|As the Chronologia {{was going}} to press in 1569, Mercator also {{published}} {{what was to become}} his most famous map: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata (A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation). As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the Age of Discovery the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a <b>rhumb</b> line) did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator's solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that the <b>rhumb</b> lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars [...] suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by Pedro Nunes. The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the Mercator Projection became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. At a later stage this mariner's map became a general purpose map of the world although its distortion at high latitudes was abundantly evident. Usage other than for marine charts is now deprecated and more suitable projections are available.|$|E

50|$|This {{business}} success led {{to changes}} in Maurice Dior's personal life. In 1905, the family left for the center of Granville and moved into a villa - Les <b>Rhumbs</b> - which Maurice's wife Madeleine decorated in the fashion {{of the time and}} where she created a garden sheltered from the wind. It is now home to the Musée Christian Dior. The family moved to the Parisian district of La Muette in 1910, to Rue Richard Wagner, later known as Rue Albéric Magnard, keeping Les <b>Rhumbs</b> as a holiday home. After the war, during which the Diors took refuge in Granville, they returned to Paris in 1918, living not far from their previous address. This new apartment once again demonstrated Maurice Dior's success: decorated in neo-Louis XVI style, two valuable paintings were displayed, a Boucher and a Lépicié, which Maurice Dior purchased on the advice of a friend.|$|R
500|$|In March 1932, the {{arrangements}} for flying between Lympne and Croydon in poor visibility were altered. If the cloudbase {{was less than}} [...] above sea level, or the visibility was less than , aircraft were prohibited from using the Croydon–Caterham–Penshurst–Lympne route, but were to use either the Croydon–Merstham–Edenbridge or Croydon–Chelsfield–Shoreham–Otford–Wrotham route. Alternatively a <b>rhumb</b> line course could be flown on the Croydon–Chelsfield–Lympne route. Aircraft not fitted with radios had to notify the officer in charge at their departure airport as to which route they intended to take before departure. Royal Air Force aircraft would avoid these routes as far as practicable in conditions of poor visibility. On 25 August the Folkestone Trophy Race was held at Lympne and was won by a Comper Swift. In November, {{it was reported that}} new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15-cm waveband at 2,000 Megahertz. The new radios were to be used for the announcement of the departure of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The new equipment was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933.|$|E
500|$|Tractatus de globis {{begins with}} a letter by Hues {{dedicated}} to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I's reign. However, he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the Spaniards and Portuguese {{if they had a}} complete knowledge of astronomy and geometry, which were essential to successful navigation. In the preface of the book, Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere, and refuted opposing theories. The treatise was divided into five parts. The first part described elements common to Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, including the circles and lines inscribed on them, zones and climates, and the use of each globe's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian. The second part described planets, fixed stars and constellations; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe, and discussed the length of the circumference of the earth and of a degree of a great circle. Part 4, which Hues considered {{the most important part of}} the work, explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun's position, latitude, course and distance, amplitudes and azimuths, and time and declination. The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on <b>rhumb</b> lines. In the work, Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the [...] "nautical triangle" [...] used for plane sailing. Difference of latitude and departure (or longitude) are two sides of the triangle forming a right angle, the distance travelled is the hypotenuse, and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course. If any two elements are known, the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of sines, tangents and secants.|$|E

[...] Portolan charts began being produced in Genoa in the late 13th century, and soon spread to Venice and Majorca.

50|$|A {{misunderstanding}} could arise {{because the}} term “rhumb” had no precise meaning {{when it came}} into use.

In his Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart [...] (1537), Nunes argued that a nautical chart should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused: a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{compass rose}} in the center can be {{overlooked}} – indeed, the circle itself can be ignored, as it is {{seems to have no}} other purpose than the construction of the rays that run across the grid. [...] The rose of interest is in the upper left corner of the square grid. From that corner, emanate a series of compass <b>rhumb</b> lines. [...] In his original 1436 tondo e quadro, Bianco has sixteen emanating rays – that is, Bianco includes half-quarter winds, or eighth-winds (otava), so that the emanating rays are at intervals of 5.625 degrees. [...] Other constructions of the circle-and-square, e.g. the Cornaro Atlas, use only eight rays emanating at quarter-wind distances (11.25 degrees). [...] Visually, these rays replicate the bottom right quarter of a 32-wind compass rose: East (0q), E by S (1q), ESE (2q), SE by E (3q), SE (4q), SE by S (5q), SSE (6q), S by E (7q) and South (8q).|$|E
2500|$|The Mercator {{projection}} is {{an example}} of a cylindrical projection in which the meridians are straight and perpendicular to the parallels. As a result, the map has a constant width and the parallels are stretched east-west as the poles are approached. Mercator's insight was to stretch the separation of the parallels in a way which exactly compensates for their increasing length, thus preserving shapes of small regions, albeit at the expense of global distortion. Such a conformal map projection necessarily transforms <b>rhumb</b> lines, sailing courses of a constant bearing, into straight lines on the map thus greatly facilitating navigation. That this was Mercator's intention is clear from the title: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata which translates as [...] "New and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation". Although the projection's adoption was slow, by the end of the seventeenth century it was in use for naval charts throughout the world and remains so to the present day. It's later adoption as the all-purpose world map was unfortunate step.|$|E

60|$|True and Magnetic Bearings.--The {{confusion}} between true {{and magnetic}} bearings is a continual trouble, {{even to the}} most experienced travellers. Sir Thomas Mitchell's exploring party very nearly sustained a loss by mistaking the one for the other. I recommend that the points of the compass, viz. North, N.N.E., etc., should be solely used for the traveller for his true bearings; and the degrees, as 25 degrees (or N. 25 degrees E.), for his magnetic. There would then be no reason why the two nomenclatures should interfere with one another, for a traveller's recollection of the lay of a country depends entirely upon true bearings--or sunrise, sunset, and the stars--and is expressed by North, N.N.E., etc.; but his surveying data which find no place in his memory, but are simply consigned to his note-book, are necessarily registered in degrees. To give every facility for carrying out this principle, a round of paper should be pasted {{in the middle of}} the traveller's pocket-compass card, just large enough to hide the ordinary <b>rhumbs,</b> but leaving uncovered the degrees round its rim. On this disk of paper the points of the compass (true bearings) should be marked so as to be as exact as possible for the country about to be visited.|$|R

Research objectives: selection of a complex of the technical and organizational decisions that allow us to reach target (permissible) limits of dispersion of harmful emissions, thereby, having minimized the risks of damage to the environment and health of the population. Materials and methods: as primary materials, we used forms of the state statistical reporting “ 2 tp-air”, volumes of maximum permissible emissions of the enterprise-the model site, data about technical and organizational decisions to reduce emissions to the atmosphere. The main methods of the research: geoinformation modeling, functional zoning, the structural analysis. Results: we simulated dispersion of priority pollutant of the leading source of construction dust emissions in the region, and we classified, by the degree of ecological and hygienic risk, the territory of the model site - town of Mikhaylovka. The activities to reduce the range of dispersion of harmful emissions are selected in the form of modernization of technological processes, installation of dust filters, improvement of the ventilation system, carrying out other organizational and technical activities {{to prevent the spread of}} dust on the territory of the enterprise and beyond. The environment protection effect of the activities proposed for realization is estimated. Proposals for further development of the analyzed industrial city are formulated. Conclusions: 1. The proposed solutions on modernization of the enterprise allow us to reduce the range of dust dispersion in concentrations that are more than maximum permissible concentration (MPC) by 2. 6 times (bringing them to the required limits); 2. The population living under the influence of dust in concentration of 0. 5 - 1 MPC, for which there is a risk of long-term health effects, will be reduced from 43 000 to 6 000 people; 3. The proposed activities for reduction of dust dispersion limits in all <b>rhumbs</b> contributes to the urban development of the previously contaminated territories, for example, for recreational purposes; 4.
