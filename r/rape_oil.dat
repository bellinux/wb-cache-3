40|$|This Licentiate thesis {{deals with}} {{small-scale}} extraction of <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil</b> {{and the use}} of this oil in an Elsbett engine tractor. Small-scale extraction of <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil</b> was studied in practical tests in the laboratory at Ultuna, Uppsala. The influence of the speed of the press screw, nozzle size and nozzle performance, the distance between the press screw and the press chamber head, the ambient temperature, and preheating of the seed with air was studied. At Sjösa farm a small plant for on-farm extraction of <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil</b> was built. The processing of three bigger batches of oil seed was studied. Data of interest were registered in an operating log. Capacity and oil extraction efficiency were studied. A tractor with an Elsbett engine was operated at Sjösa farm on the processed <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil.</b> Data of interest were registered in an operating log and with an automatic data collection system. The data obtained on the farm were used to conduct an energy analysis. The oil press has higher capacity with bigger nozzles and higher screw speeds. However, the amount of oil extracted from each seed increased if the nozzles were smaller and/or the press screw speed was lower. Nozzles with a long press nozzle channel gave a more solid meal. It was important that the temperature in the press chamber head reached a temperature of about 70 °C. The optimum seed moisture content (wet basis) was 7 - 8 per cent. Preheating with air usually improved the capacity, but there is a risk of over-drying so it must be done with care. Preheated seed involves a risk of getting too high levels of phosphorus in the oil. On the farm, the simplest way of cleaning the oil is settling. This can be done in three series-coupled sedimentation tanks. If the ambient temperature is + 20 °C and the settling height is 0. 6 m, about 18 days are needed for the settling. A tractor with an Elsbett engine can be operated almost {{in the same way as}} a conventional tractor. The differences are <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil</b> fuel, separate starting fuel, more frequent fuel filter exchange, electrical heating of the fuel system and about 10 per cent higher fuel consumption. Problems may occur when the <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil</b> stiffens at - 15 °C. To obtain a good energy balance it is important to have a high yield and low moisture contents. It is important also to have uses for the meal and straw. Direct seeding also improves the energy balance. The main conclusion of the project is that a system involving <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil</b> and the Elsbett engine works well technically. The system is not, however, competitive as there are cheap fossil fuels on the market, and the Elsbett engine has not yet entered serial production. In addition, the supply of <b>rape</b> seed <b>oil</b> in Sweden is limited, and the oil produced could be used for better purposes than as vehicle fuel...|$|R

It was tried to apply the Riedel’s type equation (Riedel, 1945 a, b) to the measured results to obtain relationship between the {{vapor pressure}} and the temperature.

In the case of Sesami oil the curve had the constant value in a range from 280 ℃ to 300 ℃.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether a PAH-containing oil phase arising from a novel soil remediation process for PAH contaminated soil, in which extraction is performed with a microemulsion, could be eliminated microbiologically in a fermenter. In addition, the possibility of microbiological 'polishing' of the extracted soil was investigated. Following extraction of the PAH contaminated soil with a microemulsion, a PAH-containing oil phase was produced which contained residual amounts of surfactant. It could be shown in a batch culture experiments that the PAH were degraded by a microbial mixed culture {{in the presence of the}} more easily degradable components of the microemulsion (<b>rape</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>rape</b> <b>oil</b> methylester, surfactant). In continuous culture experiments, it was found that almost complete degradation of the 5 PAH employed as a model contamination was achieved, although at high retention times <b>rape</b> <b>oil</b> methylester were also practically completely eliminated. Using different ratios of oil, PAH and surfactans as well as varying the inflow concentration of the mixture showed that the concentration of oil influenced the degree of PAH degradation. Increasing the proportion of oil in the mixture increased the percentual PAH elimination. Decreasing the proportion of oil caused a limitation. Limitation of PAH degradation due to lower oil concentrations could be relieved by addition of biological undegradable solvent heptamethylnonane. Experiments on the biological remedeation of soil extracted with a microemulsion were carried out using a phenanthrene-contaminated orthic luvisol. Biological activity after extraction was measurable in the form of increased respiration and bacterial count which correlated with the elimination of the substances applied (phenanthrene, oil, surfactant). Addition of allochthonous microorganisms was not necessary. The presence of oil and surfactant retarded phenanthrene degradation due to substrate competition. The treated soil appeared not to have a toxic influence on the soil microflora. (orig.)
