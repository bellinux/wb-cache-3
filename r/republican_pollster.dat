5000|$|By the 1990s Republicans were {{starting}} to win elections at the statewide and local level throughout the South, even though Democrats retained majorities in several state legislatures through the 2000s and 2010s. By 2014, the region was heavily Republican at the local state and national level. A key element in the change was the transformation of evangelical white Protestants in the south from a largely nonpolitical approach to a heavily <b>Republican</b> commitment. Pew <b>pollsters</b> reported that, [...] "In the late 1980s, white evangelicals in the South were still mostly wedded to the Democratic Party while evangelicals outside the South were more aligned with the GOP. But {{over the course of}} the next decade or so, the GOP made gains among white Southerners generally and evangelicals in particular, virtually eliminating this regional disparity." [...] Exit polls in the 2004 presidential election showed that Bush led Kerry by 70-30% among Southern whites, who comprised 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90-9 lead among the 18% of black Southern voters. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they voted for Bush by 80-20.|$|R

[...] Jones' campaign {{was supported by the}} unions Culinary and AFL-CIO, that both provided volunteers. In September, Jones was attacked in a television ad about Jones' incident while representing Las Vegas Sands as an attorney. The Review-Journal called the ad misleading. Two polls were conducted, the first in late September by the <b>Republican</b> <b>pollster</b> The Tarrance Group, and the second in early October by Democratic pollster Momentum Analysis. The difference between the candidates was in both polls within the margin of error. According to the poll by The Tarrance Group, Harris would get 45% of the votes and Jones 42%. The Democratic poll said Jones would get more with 46% of the votes, while Harris would get 44%. On November 4, Harris defeated Jones with 55% of the votes, resulting in a Republican majority in the Senate.|$|E
5000|$|Bush's broken promise was one {{of several}} {{important}} factors leading to Bush's defeat. In fact, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh in his book See I Told You So, believes Bush would have easily won re-election had he not increased taxes. <b>Republican</b> <b>pollster</b> Richard Wirthlin called his promise [...] "the six most destructive words in the history of presidential politics." [...] Ed Rollins has called it [...] "probably the most serious violation of any political pledge anybody has ever made." [...] White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the reversal the [...] "single biggest mistake of the administration." [...] Others disagree with this view. Richard Darman does not believe that the reversal {{played a central role in}} Bush's defeat; rather he argues that it simply became a focal point for discontent with an economic situation that Bush had little control over. Others feel that the reversal was politically disastrous, but also good for the country. Daniel L. Ostrander has argued that Bush's actions should be seen as a noble sacrifice of his own political future for the good of the nation's well-being.|$|E
50|$|During {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Loop said she supported raising funding for public education in order to - among other things - raise teacher's wages. She had no position on Question 3, which would have implemented a 2% margins tax on business to increase funding for public schools, because she argued it would hurt small businesses. Farley opposed the ballot measure, and said she advocated school choice. Independent American Kamerath, a licensed practical nurse, opposed Question 3 as well. Loop outraised Farley, having raised almost $340,000 in October. Farley raised about $285,000. According to two polls - both conducted in late September - Farley would get a majority. <b>Republican</b> <b>pollster</b> The Tarrance Group said Farley would get 43% of the votes, while Loop would get 36%. According to a poll by Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research those percentages would be 46% and 44% respectively. The polls predicted the winner right: Farley received 57% of the votes on November 4, while Loop got 39% of them. The GOP gained control over the Nevada Senate because of Farley's win.|$|E
50|$|Prominent <b>Republican</b> <b>pollster</b> V. Lance Tarrance, Jr. flatly {{denies that}} the Bradley effect {{occurred}} during that election, echoing the absentee ballot factor cited by DiCamillo. Tarrance also reports {{that his own}} firm's pre-election polls done for the Deukmejian campaign showed the race as having closed from a wide lead for Bradley one month prior to the election down to a statistical dead heat by {{the day of the}} election. While acknowledging that some news sources projected a Bradley victory based upon Field Poll exit polls which were also inaccurate, he counters that at the same time, other news sources were able to correctly predict Deukmejian's victory by using other exit polls that were more accurate. Tarrance claims that The Field Poll speculated, without supplying supporting data, in offering the Bradley effect theory as an explanation for why its polling had failed, and he attributes the emergence of the Bradley effect theory to media outlets focusing on this, while ignoring that there were other conflicting polls which had been correct all along.|$|E
5000|$|Nixon's use of {{the phrase}} {{was part of his}} {{strategy}} to divide Americans and to polarize them into two groups. He used [...] "divide and conquer" [...] tactics to win his political battles, and in 1971 he directed Agnew to speak about [...] "positive polarization" [...] of the electorate. The [...] "silent majority" [...] shared Nixon's anxieties and fears that normalcy was being eroded by changes in society.

5000|$|In December 2010, Media Matters for America {{released}} a leaked October 2009 e-mail between Fox News Washington managing editor Bill Sammon and the network's senior producers, {{which seemed to}} issue directives slanting Fox News' coverage of President Barack Obama's health care reform efforts. In the e-mail, Sammon instructed producers to not use the phrase [...] "public option" [...] when discussing a key measure of President Obama's reform bill, and instead use the terms [...] "government option" [...] or [...] "government-run health insurance," [...] noting negative connotations; Sammon also suggested that the qualifier [...] "so-called" [...] be said before any proper mention of the public option. Another e-mail by Fox News senior vice president Michael Clemente accepted Sammon's conditions. Critics claimed that Sammon took advice from <b>Republican</b> <b>pollster</b> Frank Luntz, who appeared on Hannity shortly before the e-mail was written and made the same suggestions in identifying the public option. Critics also noticed that reporters and panelists on Special Report with Bret Baier used the term [...] "public option" [...] before the e-mail was sent, but used the term [...] "government option" [...] immediately afterwards. Sammon, {{in an interview with}} Howard Kurtz for The Daily Beast, defended the directive and denied he was trying to skew Fox News' coverage.|$|E

It examines if and how the three models are related and what potential relationships between them tell theorists and researchers {{about the effects of}} mass media. As an introduction to this effort, this essay provides a very brief review of the three effects and their roots in media-effects research. Based on this overview, we highlight a few key dimensions along which one can com-pare, framing, agenda setting, and priming. We conclude with a description of the con-texts within which the three models operate, and the broader implications that these conceptual distinctions have for the growth of our discipline. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1460 - 2466. 2006. 00326. x In 1997, <b>Republican</b> <b>pollster</b> Frank Luntz sent out a 222 -page memo called ‘‘Language of the 21 st century’ ’ to select members of the U.
