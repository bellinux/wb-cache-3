5|$|Armageddon {{featured}} seven professional wrestling matches {{that involved}} different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines that had {{played out on}} Raw, SmackDown, and ECW on Sci Fi—WWE's television programs. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events that built tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches and competed either under their <b>real</b> <b>names</b> or stage names. The event featured wrestlers from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to the television program of the same name.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{has stated}} that the WWF {{intended}} to have Tekno Team 2000 win the WWF Tag Team Championship after two months in the promotion. After Watts' father, Bill Watts, began booking matches, the team was later sent to developmental territories to improve their skills. They returned to USWA in Tennessee, where they had wrestled a tag team match together in April 1995 under their <b>real</b> <b>names.</b> Competing as Tekno Team 2000, they defeated PG-13 on September 18. They began losing matches, however, while facing PG-13, The Heavenly Bodies, and The Bushwhackers. On October 30, Troy and Travis reversed their fortunes and defeated King Cobra and Spellbinder.|$|E

5|$|In April 2002, Fertig {{signed a}} {{developmental}} deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and {{was assigned to}} their development territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he continued to use the Seven gimmick. After wrestling sporadically in OVW throughout 2002 and 2003, against wrestlers including Chris Cage and Johnny Jeter, he joined the Disciples of Synn stable. Along with stable-mate Travis Bane, he won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on March 5, 2003, by defeating Lance Cade and Rene Dupree. After holding the championship for just over a month, {{they were forced to}} vacate it on April 10, when Bane suffered an injury. In late 2003 and early 2004, Seven and Bane began competing in dark matches prior to the Raw television show, using their <b>real</b> <b>names</b> of Kevin Fertig and Travis Tomko respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Cormier {{brothers}} were {{the sons of}} Edmond Cormier and Bernadette Doucette. They {{grew up on a}} farm in what is now Memramcook, New Brunswick. Four of the brothers had long careers as professional wrestlers, while a fifth, Malcolm Cormier, competed briefly before becoming a referee. None of the brothers wrestled under the family surname, however, as they all adopted ring names. One of the brothers explained that the brothers' <b>real</b> <b>names</b> were too hard to pronounce, so they adopted other names that were easier for international fans. Yvon Cormier was given the name The Beast, Jean-Louis was known as Rudy Kay, Leonce took the name Leo Burke, and Romeo competed as Bobby Kay. Malcolm, the oldest of the brothers involved in wrestling, used the name Mel Turnbow while working as a referee.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using <b>real</b> <b>names</b> or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the}} idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like <b>real</b> <b>names,</b> while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy is}} not like the real world, because <b>real</b> <b>names</b> and {{personal}} information are not known {{to everyone in the}} off-line world.|$|E

25|$|A fourth {{problem with}} using personas {{is that some}} {{organizations}} are not ready for the methodology. Creating hypothetical users with <b>real</b> <b>names,</b> stories and personalities may seem unserious and whimsical to some people, teams or organizations.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{government}} issued {{new rules}} on December 28, 2012 requiring Internet users {{to provide their}} <b>real</b> <b>names</b> to service providers, while assigning Internet companies greater responsibility for deleting forbidden postings and reporting them to the authorities. The new regulations, issued by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, allow Internet users to continue to adopt pseudonyms for their online postings, {{but only if they}} first provide their <b>real</b> <b>names</b> to service providers, a measure that could chill some of the vibrant discourse on the country’s Twitter-like microblogs. The authorities periodically detain and even jail Internet users for politically sensitive comments, such as calls for a multiparty democracy or accusations of impropriety by local officials.|$|E
25|$|Microcap fraud was {{explored}} in the anonymously written books License to Steal and in The Scorpion and the Frog. Both books explore pump-and-dump schemes {{in some detail}} but, unlike Born to Steal, do not provide the <b>real</b> <b>names</b> of the specific firms and people described.|$|E

25|$|Although each cast member's {{real name}} was always shown at the {{beginning}} of each episode, at the end of most episodes prior to 2006, one cast member would sign off using their anchor character's name, which is noted below where known.
