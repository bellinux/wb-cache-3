40|$|BACKGROUND: Trunk {{instability}} due to paralysis {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} posture and function in a wheelchair. The {{purpose of this study}} was to <b>record</b> <b>trunk</b> muscle recruitment patterns using surface electromyography from unimpaired individuals during wheelchair propulsion under various propulsion speed conditions to be able to design trunk muscle stimulation patterns for actual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury. METHODS: Fourteen unimpaired subjects propelled a test wheelchair on a dynamometer system at two steady state speeds of 0. 9 m/s and 1. 8 m/s and acceleration from rest to their maximum speed. Lower back/abdominal surface electromyography and upper body movements were recorded for each trial. Based on the hand movement during propulsion, the propulsive cycle was further divided into five stages to describe the activation patterns. FINDINGS: Both abdominal and back muscle groups revealed significantly higher activation at early push and pre-push stages when compared to the other three stages of the propulsion phase. With increasing propulsive speed, trunk muscles showed increased activation (...|$|R

Small kinematics, kinetics and energetics changes induced by Treadmill Walking (TW) as compared to Overground Walking (OW) {{have been reported in}} literature. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to characterize the differences between OW and TW in terms of stride-to-stride variability. Classical (Standard Deviation, SD) and non-linear (fractal dynamics, local dynamic stability) methods were used. In addition, the correlations between the different variability indexes were analyzed. Methods: Twenty healthy subjects performed 10 min TW and OW in a random sequence. A triaxial accelerometer <b>recorded</b> <b>trunk</b> accelerations. Kinematic variability was computed as the average SD (MeanSD) of acceleration patterns among standardized strides. Fractal dynamics (scaling exponent a) was assessed by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) of stride intervals. Short-term and long-term dynamic stability were estimated by computing the maximal Lyapunov exponents of acceleration signals...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} an extension ladder "walk-through" top design on kinetic and kinematic behaviors and the outward destabilizing forces induced on the ladder during transitioning at elevation. Thirty-two male participants performed stepping tasks between a ladder top and a roof at simulated elevation in a surround-screen virtual-reality system. The experimental conditions included a "walk-through" and a standard ladder top section supported on flat and sloped roof surfaces. Three force platforms were placed under the ladder section and in the roof to measure propulsion forces during transitions. A motion measurement system was used to <b>record</b> <b>trunk</b> kinematics. The frictional demand at the virtual ladder base was also calculated. The results indicate that under optimal ladder setup (angle 75. 52020), the frictional demand at the ladder base remains relatively small for all experimental conditions. Also, the "walk through" ladder top eased the ladder-to-roof transitions but not the roof-to-ladder transitions.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Patients {{with severe}} {{bilateral}} knee osteoarthritis (KOA) often suffer from {{low back pain}} (LBP). However, {{few studies have examined}} the relationship between LBP and KOA in downward reach and pick-up movements. [Subjects] Eight KOA patients with LBP (LBP group), 8 KOA patients without LBP (NLBP group), and 7 healthy participants (Control group), without osteoarthritis or low back pain, were recruited for this study. [Methods] All subjects were asked to pick up a bottle with one hand, placed at the diagonal {{on the opposite side of}} the body. A 3 D motion analysis system was used to <b>record</b> <b>trunk</b> and lower limb movements. [Results] The knee flexion angle on the side ipsilateral to the bottle was significantly smaller in both KOA groups than in the controls in the downward reach and pick-up movements. KOA patients showed a significantly lower trunk flexion angle and greater pelvis anterior tilt angle than the controls. In addition, no significant differences were found between the LBP and NLBP group. [Conclusion] We suspect that severe knee pain due to OA determines the priority of move-ment in strategic planning for the execution of pick-up movements. The knee strategy was abandoned by our severe knee OA patients, even when they had mild LBP...|$|R

40|$|Agility {{is vital}} to success in team sport {{competition}} with the trunk argued to {{play a key role}} in sport performance. This study explored the role of trunk control during a reactive change-of-direction task (R-COD) and field-based measures of athletic performance. Twenty male players completed field-based athletic performance assessments (modified Illinois agility test (mIAT), and three repetition maximum back squat (3 RM)), and five countermovement jumps (CMJ) and R-CODs during which, three-dimensional ground reaction forces (GRF) and kinematics were <b>recorded.</b> <b>Trunk</b> control was assessed as the sum of the trunk relative to the pelvis range of motion in all three plane during the R-COD. Participants with the highest (HIGH; n = 7) and lowest (LOW; n = 7) trunk range of motion values were grouped. The HIGH group achieved significantly shorter mIAT time duration, higher CMJ height, and lower knee flexion angles, greater trunk lateral flexion and rotation relative to pelvis, and greater angular momentum during the R-COD compared with the LOW group. Superior athletic performance was associated with decreased trunk control (high trunk range of motion) during the R-COD. Whilst this study suggesting that trunk control is a vital component of performance, it is unknown whether this trunk control is inherent or an effect of training history, nor does not support current optimal athletic performance recommendation of decrease trunk motion during R-CO...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{electromyography}} (sEMG) <b>recorded</b> {{from the}} <b>trunk</b> area may reflect underlying muscular function, {{and is the}} current standard for in vivo functional examination. However, sEMG of this area, including the low back musculature, usually encounters substantial interference from strong cardiac signals. It is therefore imperative to remove electrocardiogram (ECG) interference from sEMG data. This paper discusses a denoise method using independent component analysis (ICA) and a high-pass filter to effectively suppress the interference of ECG in sEMG <b>recorded</b> from <b>trunk</b> muscles. The performance of this technique was evaluated with simulation experiments. To compare {{the outcome of the}} ICA and filtering technique to the original sEMG signal, correlation coefficients in both time-domain waveform and frequency spectrum were computed. In addition, different filter bands were evaluated. The ICA ECG cancellation with a 30 Hz high-pass filter showed higher mean correlation coefficients in the time domain (0. 97 Â± 0. 08) and in the frequency spectrum (0. 99 Â± 0. 06) than any other techniques. This suggests that the ICA ECG cancellation technique with a 30 Hz high-pass filter would be the most appropriate method to extract useful sEMG signals from trunk muscles.

40|$|Decreased trunk muscle {{endurance}} {{has been}} identified as a risk factor for adolescent LBP, and poor lumbo-pelvic stability {{has been found to be}} associated with LBP in the adult population. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between adolescent LBP, trunk muscle endurance and poor lumbo-pelvic stability. Design: A cross sectional study. Participants: 80 adolescents in grade 8 to grade 11, aged 12 to 17 years, at three high schools in Gauteng, who agreed to participate in the study. Method: Data was collected by means of a validated questionnaire and physical tests. The active straight leg raise test was used to record the lumbo-pelvic stabilising muscles. The Sorensen, Shirado and side-bridge tests were used to <b>record</b> <b>trunk</b> extensor, flexor and side flexor muscle endurance, respectively. Results: The results revealed a lifetime prevalence of LBP of 82. 50 %, one year prevalence of 78. 80 % and point prevalence of 23. 80 %. Adolescents with LBP demonstrated decreased trunk extensor muscle endurance but increased trunk flexor muscle endurance (p= 0. 044), compared to non-LBP adolescents. Poor lumbo-pelvic stability was not associated with adolescent LBP, but was associated with decreased extensor trunk muscle endurance (p= 0. 031). Conclusion: There was an association between trunk flexor muscle endurance and adolescent LBP, and between decreased trunk extensor muscle endurance and poor lumbo-pelvic stability. No association was found between LBP and poor lumbo-pelvic stability...|$|R
