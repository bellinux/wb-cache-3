40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{responsiveness}} of the asthma control test (ACT) to detect changes at the initiation of therapy and its utilization in the initiation of asthma treatment. Methods This study was designed as a randomized clinical trial conducted in a primary care setting. The subjects were asthma patients who had not <b>received</b> <b>controller</b> therapy for at least two months. The patients were randomized into two groups: The Saudi Initiative for Asthma (SINA) group and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) group. Treatment in the SINA group was initiated at step 1 when the ACT scores ≥ 20, step 2 when the score between 16 - 19, and step 3 when the score Results Forty-five patients were analyzed in each group. The improvement in ACT score after treatment initiation was significantly higher when the SINA approach was used (2. 9 in the SINA group compared to 1. 7 in the GINA group (p = 0. 04)). The improvement in FEV 1 was 5. 8 % in the SINA group compared to 3. 4 % in the GINA group (p = 0. 46). The number of patients who achieved asthma control at the follow-up visit and required no treatment adjustment was 33 (73. 3 %) in the SINA group and 27 (60 %) in the GINA group (p = 0. 0125). Conclusion The ACT was responsive to change at the initiation of asthma treatment and was useful for the initiation of asthma treatment. Trial Registration number ISRCTN 31998214 </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundPatients {{who have}} asthma-related {{emergency}} department (ED) visits or hospitalizations {{are at risk}} for recurrent exacerbation events. Our objectives were to assess whether <b>receiving</b> a <b>controller</b> medication at discharge affects risk of recurrence and whether delaying controller initiation alters this risk. MethodsAsthma patients with an ED visit or inpatient (IP) stay who <b>received</b> a <b>controller</b> dispensing within 6 months were identified from healthcare claims. Cox proportional hazards of the time to first recurrence of an asthma-related ED or IP visit in the 6 -month period following the initial event were constructed, with time following discharge without controller medication as the primary predictor. ResultsA total of 6139 patients met inclusion criteria, 78 % with an ED visit and 22 % with an IP visit; 15 % had a recurrence within 6 months. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) associated with not having controller medication at discharge was 1. 79 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 42 – 2. 25). The controller-by-time interaction was significant (P< 0. 001), with hazard rising as time-to-controller initiation increased. Delaying initiation by 1 day approximately tripled the risk (HR 2. 95; 95 %CI 1. 48 – 5. 88). Sensitivity analyses, including accounting for controller fills prior to the index event, did not substantially alter these results. ConclusionsThis observational study shows that the risk of a recurrent asthma-related ED visit or IP stay increased as the time to initiate a controller increased. Our findings support the importance of early controller initiation following an asthma-related ED or IP visit in reducing risk of recurrence...|$|R

Otherwise, it checks the responses given Pk to Pj and dependentk(i) is false. Once it is verified, it assigns true to dependentk(i). Then it checks whether k {{is equal to}} i. If both are equal, a deadlock occurs, otherwise it sends the probe to next dependent process.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Direct {{memory access}} (DMA) is {{a feature of}} modern {{computers}} that allows certain hardware subsystems within the computer to access system memory independently of the central processing unit (CPU). Without DMA, when the CPU is using programmed input/output, it is typically fully occupied for the entire duration of the read or write operation, and is thus unavailable to perform other work. With DMA, the CPU initiates the transfer, does other operations while the transfer is in progress, and receives an interrupt from the DMA controller when the operation is done. This feature is useful any time the CPU cannot {{keep up with the}} rate of data transfer, or where the CPU needs to perform useful work while waiting for a relatively slow I/O data transfer. A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter is a type of "asynchronous receiver/transmitter", a piece of computer hardware that translates data between parallel and serial forms. The universal designation indicates that the data format and transmission speeds are configurable and that the actual electric signaling levels and typically are handled by a special driver circuit external to the UART. A UART is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. UARTs are now commonly included in microcontrollers. UART IP soft core based on DMA mode is proposed and well elaborated using the characteristic of DMA. The entire UART IP soft core in DMA mode mainly includes the following 5 sub-modules: UART send <b>controller,</b> UART <b>Receive</b> <b>controller,</b> Register file with the Interface of Avalon-MM Slave, Master Read type DMA controller with the interface of Avalon-MM Master and Master Write type DMA controller with the interface of Avalon-MM Master.
