5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth guitarfish <b>and</b> other <b>rays</b> are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) <b>and</b> <b>skates</b> (<b>Rajidae)</b> while others have them basal to all other rays except sawfishes (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the sawfishes rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that {{it is part of}} the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina).|$|R

50|$|The {{favorite}} prey of {{the great}} hammerhead are <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates,</b> especially stingrays. The venomous spines of stingrays are frequently found lodged inside its mouth and {{do not seem to}} bother the shark as one specimen caught off Florida had 96 spines in and around its mouth. Great hammerheads primarily hunt at dawn or dusk, swinging their heads in broad angles over the sea floor so as to pick up the electrical signatures of stingrays buried in the sand, via numerous ampullae of Lorenzini located {{on the underside of the}} cephalofoil. The cephalofoil also serves as a hydrofoil that allows the shark to quickly turn around and strike at a ray once detected. Off Florida, large hammerheads are often the first to reach newly baited sharklines, suggesting a particularly keen sense of smell.|$|R

40|$|The sharks, <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates</b> {{form one}} of the {{important}} commercial fisheries of India, the average annual landings for 10 years (1958 - 67) being 33, 442 m. tons. Of this, 15, 537 m. tons are landed along the east coast and 17, 605 m. tons along the west coast and the rest at Andaman and Nicobar and Laccadive groups of islands. Reports indicate that the Indian Ocean offers valuable fishing grounds for these fishes, especially for the larger varieties which can substantially augment the supplies of food, liver-oils, fins and shagreen. Along the east coast, good fishery for elasmobranchs exists along the coasts of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Madras State and in Andaman Islands. These fishes are caught almost round the year, the sharks on hook and line and in drift gill nets at depths varying from 16 to 100 metres <b>and</b> majority of <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates</b> in trawl nets, drift and bottom set gill nets and shore seines at depths ranging from 4 to 100 metres. The common species of sharks include the blacktip-finned sharks of the genus Carcharhinus, species of Scoliodon, the hammer-head sharks, Sphyrna spp., the tiger-shark, Galeocerdo cuvieri and the zebra shark, Stegostoma fasciatum. The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is occasionally landed. Rays of commercial importance are the cownose ray, Rhinoptera javanica shoals of which make frequent incursions into coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar, the butterfly ray, Gymmura poecilura, Himantura spp., Amphotistius zugei, Pastinachus sephen <b>and</b> the devil <b>ray,</b> Mobula diabolus. The common skates include Rhynchobatus djiddensis and Rhinobatus granulatiis and the saw-fishes of the genus Pristis. From the present trend, {{it would appear that the}} catches of elasmobranchs off the east coast could be substantially increased by extending fishing operations to deeper waters especially in the Gulf of Mannar and by the use of stronger nets from mechanised vessels. Fruitful results may also be expected along the east coast, including Andaman Islands by exploratory surveys to chart potentially rich grounds for these fishes...|$|R
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates,</b> as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|R

5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other <b>ray</b> <b>and</b> <b>skate</b> species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of <b>rays</b> are vestigial, <b>and</b> mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{variety of}} {{abnormalities}} {{have been described}} for sharks, <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates</b> across different ecoregions. Morphological and functional anomalies in these species, however, were not yet documented in distributions from the Canary Islands, the spiny butterfly ray Gymnura altavela (Linnaeus, 1758) and from in situ observations. The aim {{of the present study}} is to fill these knowledge gaps. Results: A female spiny butterfly ray G. altavela with an unfused anterior part of the right pectoral fin to the neurocranium was observed in the port of Sardina del Norte (Gran Canaria Island) during a visual scuba diving census. Conclusion: The size and the observation of the activities swimming, burying and preying confirmed the adaption of the specimen for the anomaly and underdeveloped electrosensory system in its survival. The limited knowledge of teratogens and their triggering factors, and the striking similarity with an anomaly reported for G. poecilura (Shaw, 1804) from South India, suggest genetic expression aberrations or mechanical obstructions during gestation as origin for the disorder...|$|R
