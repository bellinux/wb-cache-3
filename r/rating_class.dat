2500|$|The 12 Metre {{class is}} a <b>rating</b> <b>class</b> for racing sailboats that are {{designed}} to the International rule. It enables fair competition between boats that rate in the class whilst retaining the freedom to experiment with the details of their designs. The designation [...] "12 Metre" [...] does not refer to any single measurement on the boat, and is not referencing the vessels overall length, rather, measures the sum of the components directed by the formula which governs design and construction parameters. Typically 12 Metre class boats range from 65 to 75 feet (about 20 to 23 m) in length overall; they are most often sloop-rigged, with masts roughly 85 feet (26 m) tall.|$|E

40|$|The RMFAA tool is {{designed}} to help hoteliers identify the best level of aggregation to use in their revenue management forecasts of room demand. Hotel revenue managers (or revenue management systems) typically forecast the number of arriving guests (i. e., demand), for each day of arrival, for each length of stay, and each <b>rate</b> <b>class.</b> In making these forecasts, you have four options. First, you can forecast the total number of arrivals for a day and then break that number into length-of-stay and <b>rate</b> <b>classes</b> using historical proportions (i. e., full aggregation). Second, you can forecast the total number of arrivals for a particular day in each <b>rate</b> <b>class</b> and then break that number into lengths-of-stay using historical proportions (i. e., aggregation by <b>rate</b> <b>class</b> only). Third, you can forecast the total number of arrivals for a given day in each length of stay and then break that number into <b>rate</b> <b>classes</b> using historical proportions (i. e., aggregation by length of stay only). Finally, you can develop independent forecasts {{of the total number of}} arrivals for a day for each length-of-stay and <b>rate</b> <b>class</b> (i. e., no aggregation). Based on the data you provide, the RMFAA tool determines which of these forecasting approaches works best for your property. To use the tool with something other than the sample data it contains, youâ€™ll need to provide the historical numbers of arrivals, by day, by length of stay, and <b>rate</b> <b>class.</b> Ideally, you should use unconstrained demand information (i. e., requests) and have two or more years of data. **Version 1. 0. 1, released on January 12, 2010, fixed several bugs in the initial version of the tool. To use the new version, you will need to do two things: 1) install the new application file, and 2) copy the data from the earlier version of the spreadsheet into the new version of the spreadsheet. *...|$|R

50|$|Single fiber {{electromyography}} {{assesses the}} delay between the contractions of individual muscle fibers within a motor unit {{and is a}} sensitive test for dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction caused by drugs, poisons, or diseases such as myasthenia gravis. The technique is complicated and typically only performed by individuals with special advanced training. Surface EMG is used {{in a number of}} settings; for example, in the physiotherapy clinic, muscle activation is monitored using surface EMG and patients have an auditory or visual stimulus to help them know when they are activating the muscle (biofeedback). A review of the literature on surface EMG published in 2008 concluded that surface EMG may be useful to detect the presence of neuromuscular disease (level C <b>rating,</b> <b>class</b> III data), but there are insufficient data to support its utility for distinguishing between neuropathic and myopathic conditions or for the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular diseases. EMGs may be useful for additional study of fatigue associated with post-poliomyelitis syndrome and electromechanical function in myotonic dystrophy (level C <b>rating,</b> <b>class</b> III data).|$|E
50|$|Rating {{floors in}} the United States work by guaranteeing that a player will never drop below a certain limit. This also combats deflation, but the {{chairman}} of the USCF Ratings Committee has been critical of this method because it does not feed the extra points to the improving players.

40|$|Do bond issuers {{shop for}} a better credit rating? By {{utilizing}} a large sample of US bond issuers with ratings from Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, this paper analyses whether observed differences in average rating levels between the third agency Fitch and the mandatory agencies Moody's and S&P are due to issuers seeking only an additional rating if {{it is expected to}} give a more favorable picture of credit quality. In contrast to previous research, we also ask why some issuers possibly do expect to obtain an upwardly biased credit risk assessment from Fitch. The analysis reveals strong evidence of rating shopping behavior. In addition, issuers having an added incentive to press Fitch for a better rating are more likely to solicit a third rating. Finally, by comparing Fitch's <b>rating</b> <b>class</b> default probabilities estimated for issuers with and without an observed Fitch rating, we nd that the default risks associated with a particular <b>rating</b> <b>class</b> are signi cantly increased for the rst group...|$|E
