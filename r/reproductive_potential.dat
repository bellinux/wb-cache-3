5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential.</b> As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health.

25|$|Dispersal {{creates a}} {{relatively}} high mortality rate for sugarbeet root aphids. Additionally, alate aphids incur other disadvantages: if aphids fly then they may incur an additional cost in that their potential fecundity is further reduced {{and there is a}} further delay in the onset of reproduction. The combined effect is a marked reduction in <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential</b> and rate of increase. Although dispersal results in the colonization of suitable plants, it is not always clear what advantages there are in dispersing except from annual plants that are about to die. As dispersal can be costly in terms of fecundity or survival, or both, then sugarbeet root aphids are likely to delay departure until host quality falls below the average expectation for the habitat.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Is hunting {{detrimental}} to bear populations? Or do harvests stimulate compensatory reproduction and decrease natural mortality among the survivors? When the literature was reviewed to evaluate {{support for the}} various sides of this controversy, data were found still inadequate for conclusions to be drawn. At best, available information can aid in distinguishing which additional data are most critical and which hypotheses {{are most likely to}} be heuristic. Among six U. arctos populations in North America, those with lowest proportions of adult males had highest <b>reproductive</b> <b>potentials,</b> and vice versa. Likewise, within Yellowstone National Park, there was a strong negative correlation between numbers of adult males during a given year vs. number of offspring. However, those populations with highest <b>reproductive</b> <b>potentials</b> were also in the best habitats. So whether the former relationships were due to (a) effects of adult males on conception and survivorship, or (b) a coincidental product of nutritional differences, must still be tested. For 2 black bear (U. americanus) populations in Idaho, 1 in good habitat which was hunted heavily and the other in poorer habitat that was hunted lightly, higher natality in the former was attributed not to hunting but to better nutrition. When trophy hunting was simulated on a formerly little-exploited population of black bears in Alberta, the natality rate was not obviously altered. Dispersal of a once seasonally aggregated population of grizzly bears was apparently followed by marked increase in cub survival, perhaps because of lowered exposure of cubs to aggression by older bears. However, evidence does not confirm the idea that depletion of mature males substantially increases survivorship of cubs or otherwise offsets losses due to hunting. In fact, under some circumstances, trophy hunting may indirectly increase cub mortality. Aside from this aspect and the possible impacts of inverse culling on gene pools, trophy hunting may be les...|$|R
5000|$|A gamergate (...) is a mated worker ant that {{is able to}} {{reproduce}} sexually, i.e. lay fertilized eggs that will develop as females. Gamergates are restricted to taxa where the workers have a functional sperm reservoir ('spermatheca').

In gamergate species, all workers in a colony have similar <b>reproductive</b> <b>potentials,</b> but as a result of physical interactions, a dominance hierarchy is formed and only one or a few top-ranking workers can mate (usually with foreign males) and produce eggs.

25|$|Social insect {{males are}} {{often seen as}} mating machines, with an undiscriminating eagerness to mate. However, males {{encounter}} costs of unsuccessful mating in terms of energy investment. Therefore, P. dominula males are able to recognize female castes and preferentially choose reproductive females to workers, regardless of health or age. Males are able to differentiate castes through perceiving differences in chemical signals and physiological status. While males are able to discriminate between castes, they are not capable of discriminating between health, as males showed a strong preference for gynes, both healthy and parasite-castrated, compared to workers, because males distinguish females by CHC profiles, which are very similar between healthy and unhealthy gynes. Therefore, males {{are not able to}} evaluate the true <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential</b> of the females they encounter.|$|E
25|$|Although females often {{instigate}} sexual cannibalism, reversed sexual cannibalism {{has been}} observed in Micaria sociabilis and Allocosa brasiliensis. In a laboratory experiment on M. sociabilis, males preferred to eat older females. This behavior may be interpreted as adaptive foraging, because older females have low <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential</b> and food may be limited. Reversed cannibalism in M. sociabilis may also be influenced by size dimorphism. Males and females are similar sizes, and bigger males {{were more likely to}} be cannibalistic. In A. brasiliensis males tend to be cannibalistic in between mating seasons, after they have mated, gone out of their burrows to search for food, and left their mates in their burrows. Any females they cross during this period likely have little reproductive value, so this may also be interpreted as adaptive foraging.|$|E
25|$|Males {{who are in}} a {{committed}} relationship, in other words have a restricted sociosexual orientation, will have different sexual strategies compared to males who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation. Males with a restricted sociosexual orientation will be less willing to have sex outside of their committed relationship, and adjust their strategies according to their desire for commitment and emotional closeness with their partner. It has been found that such males are less likely to approach attractive females who have greater waist-to-hip ratios (0.68-0.72). It has been found that a greater waist-to-hip ratio, the ideal being 0.7, is associated with youthfulness, physical attractiveness and <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential.</b> Therefore, such females would be viewed as a risk to the male’s current sexual partner. Consequently, males will adjust their sexual strategies by showing less willingness to approach such females.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{endophytic}} symbioses confer {{protection from}} herbivores – only some species associations act as defense mutualisms. The {{difference between a}} mutualistic endophyte and a pathogenic one can be indistinct and dependent on interactions with other species or environmental conditions. Some fungi which are pathogens {{in the absence of}} herbivores may become beneficial under high levels of insect damage, such as species which kill plant cells in order to make nutrients available for their own growth, thereby altering nutritional content of leaves and making them a less desirable foodstuff. Some endomycorrhizae may provide defense benefits but at the cost of lost <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential</b> by rendering grasses partially sterile with their own fungal reproductive structures taking precedence. This is not unusual among fungi, as non-endophytic plant pathogens have similar conditionally beneficial effects on defense. Some species of endophyte may be beneficial for the plants in other ways (e.g. nutrient and water uptake) but will provide less benefit as a plant receives more damage and not produce defensive chemicals in response. The effect of one fungus on the plant can be altered when multiple strains of fungi are infecting a given individual in combination.|$|E
25|$|A more {{recently}} suggested defense mechanism of infidelity attracting more attention and {{research is the}} idea that a particular social group will punish cheaters by damaging their individual reputation (Fisher et al., 2009). The basis for this suggestion {{stems from the fact that}} humans have an unmatched ability to monitor social relationships and inflict punishment on cheaters, regardless of the context (Scheuring, 2010). This punishment comes in many forms, one of which is social gossip about the behaviour. Social Gossip ostracizes the individual from the group by damaging his or her reputation. This damage will impair the future benefits that individual can confer from the group and its individuals (Scheuring, 2010). A damaged reputation is especially debilitating when related to sexual and emotional infidelity because it can limit future reproductive mate choices within the group and will cause a net fitness cost that outweighs the fitness benefit gained from the infidelity (Fisher et al., 2010). Such limitations and costs deter an individual from cheating in the first place. Support for this defense mechanism comes from fieldwork by Hirsch and his colleagues (2007) that found that gossip about extramarital affairs in a small community in Mexico was particularly prevalent and devastating for reputation in this region. Specifically, adultery was found to cause an individual to be disowned by their family, decrease the marriage value of his/her family, cause an individual to lose money or a job, and diminish future <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential.</b> In this community, men having extramarital were extremely tactful in that they desired to do so in private areas with lower prevalence of women connected to the community such as bars and brothels, both areas of which had a high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STI's). The fact that men in this community were more willing to risk their own physical well-being in order to engage in extramarital sexual activity reveals a strong desire to maintain their social reputations, thus offering support for social punishment as a defense mechanism for preventing infidelity.|$|E

The first species is recognized mainly for causing the white tip disease of rice in Egypt and elsewhere (Youssef 2014) while A. fragariae and A. ritzemabosi are responsible for strawberry crimp disease known also as spring dwarf, spring crimp, or red plant (CABI 2018).

An unknown number were institutionalized in state-run mental hospitals. Hundreds of European gay men living under Nazi occupation were chemically castrated by court order. Although an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men were imprisoned in concentration camps, the number who died is uncertain.

LeVay writes that there are several possible mechanisms by which genes predisposing persons of one sex to homosexuality might increase the <b>reproductive</b> <b>potential</b> of persons of the opposite sex, for example, the economist Edward M. Miller's proposal that the inheritance of a limited number of [...] "feminizing" [...] genes might make males more attractive to females by giving them increased empathy and kindness, or rendering them less aggressive, in turn making them more successful in reproductive terms, while a larger number of feminizing genes might result in male homosexuality.

Soil seed banks have little potential {{as a source of}} tree regeneration in the Afromontane region given the lack of available seeds due to soil erosion or the failure to form persistent soil seed banks owing to the physiological requirements of seeds (Teketay and Granström 1995, 1997). Apart from a study carried out for Leptonychia usambarensis in Tanzania (Cordeiro et al. 2009), no studies have been conducted to characterize seed dispersal of tree species in Afromontane forests. Some studies conducted so far acknowledge the importance of this information for East African Afromontane forests (Aerts et al. 2006). In principle, recruitment limitation can be caused by limited seed availability or by constraints on seedling establishment (Clark et al. 1999, 2007; Nathan et al. 2000; Muller-Landau et al. 2002). Dispersal mediated recruitment limitation is especially severe with fleshy fruited trees (Rey and Alcántara 2000; Zywiec et al. 2013). While these limitations may promote coexistence in plant communities at stand levels (Herrera and Jordano 1981; Herrera et al. 1998; Abrams 2003), they severely inhibit ecosystem restoration (Holl 1998, 1999, 2008).|$|R
