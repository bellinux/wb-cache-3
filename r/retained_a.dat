5|$|Although Sadler was a {{committed}} Adventist {{for much of}} his early life, he stayed less involved after John Kellogg was excommunicated in 1907 {{in the wake of a}} conflict with Ellen G. White, the church's founder. The Sadlers became disenchanted with the church and subsequently criticized it. Sadler rejected some Adventist teachings, such as White's status as a prophetess and the importance of Saturday as Sabbath. He <b>retained</b> <b>a</b> positive view of White and rejected allegations that she was a charlatan.|$|E

5|$|At {{its first}} screening, {{the film was}} well {{received}} by critics and the public, and was later shown in Panama and Venezuela.

5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed.

The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and <b>retained</b> <b>a</b> scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|Constantine I {{completed}} {{the separation of}} military commands from the administrative structure. The vicarii and praefecti praetorio lost their field commands and became purely administrative officials. However, they <b>retained</b> <b>a</b> central role in military affairs, as they remained responsible for military recruitment, pay and, above all, supply. It is unclear whether the duces on the border now reported direct to the emperor, or {{to one of the}} two magistri of the comitatus.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community <b>retained</b> <b>a</b> fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland <b>retained</b> <b>a</b> small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E

5|$|Keynesian {{principles}} fared increasingly {{poorly on}} the practical side of economics – by 1979 {{they had been}} displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy.

5|$|Patronage is {{believed}} to have lapsed from the Sedley family to the Archbishop of Canterbury and then to Sir Joseph Aylosse before being conveyed by gift from a Mr. Serjeant Moses to the charity of the president and governors of Christ's Hospital in London in gratitude for a University of Cambridge scholarship he had received. As late as 1798 the parish was still paying its traditional castle-guard rent to Dover Castle and <b>retained</b> <b>a</b> court baron; this fee was a substitute for a feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle.|$|E
