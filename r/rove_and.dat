5|$|During the Middle Precambrian {{a shallow}} inland sea covered {{much of the}} Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, which are layers of {{sedimentary}} rocks which unconformably overlies 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. This group contains both the <b>Rove</b> <b>and</b> Gunflint Iron formations. The Rove Formation is {{the youngest of the}} many Animikie layers; it consists of gently tilted fine-grained sediments. It is composed of greywackes and black shale, and contains lower concentrations of iron and taconite than the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation does.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the experiments, the initial and final {{fracture}} behaviors in glass <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> glass cloth composites were investigated. After the production of two types of composite panels with the hand lay-up method, tensile and three-point bending tests on composites were conducted. Acoustic emission (AE) and optical microscopy (cross-sectional observation) analyses based on the various strain rates in bending tests were performed to see the fracture initiation and propagation in composites. The initial fractures were transverse cracks in the glass roving composites; these were delaminations in glass cloth composites. The final fractures were transverse cracks, delaminations, and fiber breakages in glass <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> glass cloth composites. In this study, the fracture process and mechanisms of glass <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> glass cloth composites were successfully identified by AE characteristics and cross-sectional observations...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} summary of data collected by Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency (TWRA) personnel for the statewide reservoir angler creel survey for the 2012 calendar year. Creel surveys {{were used to assess}} the fisheries of 16 reservoirs throughout Tennessee using two basic sampling methods; <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> access point. This overview contains descriptions of: 1) survey designs, 2) sampling methodologies, and 3) analytical methods. Each description is divided into <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> access point surveys. The roving survey descriptions give a more thorough account of the methodology; access point survey descriptions only list methods that differed from roving surveys. The <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> access point creel survey designs were adopted from methods described by Malvestuto et al. (1978), Malvestuto (1996) and St. John (1992). The intention of this narrative is to provide readers with a brief overview of the statistical sampling framework...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA multi-scale {{modeling}} {{framework is}} proposed for generating the effective nonlinear thermo-viscoelastic responses of multi-layered and thick-section composites. The modeling framework is demonstrated for multi-layered composite systems {{consisting of two}} alternating fiber-reinforced polymeric layers: unidirectional fiber (<b>roving)</b> <b>and</b> continuous filament mat (CFM). The viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric matrix is considered as stress-dependent and thermo-rheologically complex. Two simplified 3 D micromechanical models with periodic boundary conditions are formulated for the <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> CFM. In addition, a sublaminate model is developed for the 3 D effective homogenized through-thickness response of the <b>roving</b> <b>and</b> CFM layers. This framework provides an effective time-dependent material response while simultaneously recognizing the corresponding deformation at the microconstituents under overall thermo-mechanical loadings at the macro-level. Stress correction algorithms are developed at each scale to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy. Short-term (30 min) creep tests on off-axis multi-layered specimens are also conducted under combined stresses and temperatures to calibrate in-situ fiber and matrix properties and verify the predictions of the multi-scale framework. A time-shifting method is applied to create long-term material behaviors from the available short-term creep data. Verification of the multi-scale material framework is also done for the overall long-term responses. Finally, long-term structural analyses under thermo-mechanical loadings are conducted by integrating the multi-scale material framework to finite element (FE) structural analyses...|$|R
25|$|The College Republicans summer 1973 {{convention}} at the Lake of the Ozarks {{resort in}} Missouri was quite contentious. Rove's opponent was Robert Edgeworth of Michigan. The other major candidate, Terry Dolan of California, dropped out, supporting Edgeworth. A {{number of states}} had sent two competing delegates, because <b>Rove</b> <b>and</b> his supporters had made credential challenges at state and regional conventions. For example, after the Midwest regional convention, Rove forces had produced {{a version of the}} Midwestern College Republicans constitution which differed significantly from the constitution that the Edgeworth forces were using, in order to justify the unseating of the Edgeworth delegates on procedural grounds, including delegations, such as Ohio and Missouri, which had been certified earlier by Rove himself. In the end, there were two votes, conducted by two convention chairs, and two winners—Rove and Edgeworth, each of whom delivered an acceptance speech. After the convention, both Edgeworth and Rove appealed to Republican National Committee Chairman George H. W. Bush, each contending that he was the new College Republican chairman.|$|E
