This method is very popular among online consumers since this is the main mechanism to transfer money online. In addition, consumers are not required to give evidence to cancel a payment.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS TECHNICAL EXPERT GROUP ISSUES PAPER (RESTEG) # 8 TREATMENT OF <b>REVERSE</b> <b>TRANSACTIONS</b> 1. Because of the conceptual approach to the treatment of <b>reverse</b> <b>transactions</b> in macoeconomic statistics, it is important in compiling reserves data to avoid overstating a country’s foreign currency liquidity position. The Guidelines specify two approaches for dealing with this concern, but given the experience since the Guidelines were introduced this paper proposes a single approach. I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issue 2. The conceptual treatment of <b>reverse</b> <b>transactions</b> is set out in paragraph 418 of BPM 5 when describing the approach to repurchase agreements (repo). 1 This paragraph states that the economic nature of a repo {{is similar to that of}} a collateralized loan.

40|$|Abstract. Distributed {{cryptographic}} protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum use a {{data structure}} {{known as the}} block chain to synchro-nize a global log of events between nodes in their network. Blocks, which are batches of updates to the log, reference the parent they are extending, and thus form {{the structure of a}} chain. Previous research has shown that the mechanics of the block chain and block propagation are constrained: if blocks are created at a high rate compared to their propagation time in the network, many conflicting blocks are created and performance suf-fers greatly. As a result of the low block creation rate required to keep the system within safe parameters, transactions take long to securely confirm, and their throughput is greatly limited. We propose an alternative structure to the chain that allows for oper-ation at much higher rates. Our structure consists of a directed acyclic graph of blocks (the block DAG). The DAG structure is created by allow-ing blocks to reference multiple predecessors, and allows for more “for-giving ” transaction acceptance rules that incorporate transactions even from seemingly conflicting blocks. Thus, larger blocks that take longer to propagate can be tolerated by the system, and transaction volumes can be increased. Another deficiency of block chain protocols is that they favor more con-nected nodes that spread their blocks faster—fewer of their blocks con-flict. We show that with our system the advantage of such highly con-nected miners is greatly reduced. On the negative side, attackers that attempt to maliciously <b>reverse</b> <b>transactions</b> can try to use the forgiving nature of the DAG structure to lower the costs of their attacks. We pro-vide a security analysis of the protocol and show that such attempts can be easily countered. ...|$|E

In other words, it is akin to cash in that it only supports non-reversible <b>transactions.</b> <b>Reversing</b> <b>transactions,</b> even in case of a legitimate error, unauthorized use, or failure of a vendor to supply goods is difficult, if not impossible. The advantage of this arrangement is that the operating costs of the electronic currency system are greatly reduced by not having to resolve payment disputes. Additionally, it allows the electronic currency transactions to clear instantly, making the funds available immediately to the recipient. This means that using hard electronic currency is more akin to a cash transaction. Examples are Western Union, KlickEx and Bitcoin.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{activities that}} have different periods of duration. We define the profit intensity {{as a measure}} of this economic category. The profit intensity in a repeated trading has a unique property of attaining its maximum at a fixed point regardless of the shape of demand curves for a wide class of probability distributions of random <b>reverse</b> <b>transaction</b> (ie closing of the position). This type of market games is often considered in the research aiming at finding an algorithm that maximizes profit of a trader who negotiates prices with the Rest of the World (a collective opponent) that posses a definite and objective supply profile. Such idealization neglects the sometimes important influence of an individual trader on the demand/supply profile of the Rest of the World and in extreme cases questions the very idea of demand/supply profile. Therefore we put forward a trading model in which the demand/supply profile of the Rest of the World induces the (rational) trader to (subjectively) presume that he/she lacks (almost) all knowledge concerning the market but his/hers average frequency of trade. This point of view introduces maximum entropy principles into the model and broadens the range of economics phenomena that can be perceived as a sort of thermodynamical system. As a consequence, the profit intensity has a fixed point:the profit in tensity reaches its maximum when the probability of transaction is given by the Golden Ratio rule √(5) - 1 / 2. ...|$|R

This conclusion is <b>reversed</b> when <b>transactions</b> costs are {{introduced in the}} TEP market.

When costs per transaction are fixed, the above effects disappear for those firms participating in the market.
