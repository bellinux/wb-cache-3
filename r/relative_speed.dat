5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E
25|$|A fit adult {{creates a}} wake. Drag {{due to a}} wake is Newtonian drag, {{increasing}} with {{the square of the}} velocity. For example, if the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> between the water and the leg is twice as high on the thrust phase than on the recovery phase, the thrust is four times as high as the drag. Assuming the legs are recovered with a <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> between leg and body which amounts to the same as the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> between water and body, the legs must be kicked back with five times the mean velocity of the swimmer. This limits the top speed. Both effects together, velocity and frontal area, yield a thrust-to-drag ratio of 8 for the legs.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{influence}} of performance level, age and gender on pacing during a 100 -km ultramarathon. Results of a 100 -km race incorporating the World Masters Championships were used to identify differences in <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> in each 10 -km segment between participants finishing in the first, second, third and fourth quartiles of overall positions (Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Similar analyses were performed between the top and bottom 50 % of finishers in each age category, as well as within male and female categories. Pacing varied between athletes achieving different absolute performance levels. Group 1 ran at significantly lower <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than all other groups in the first three 10 -km segments (all P < 0. 01), and significantly higher <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than Group 4 in the 6 th and 10 th (both P < 0. 01), and Group 2 in the 8 th (P = 0. 04). Group 4 displayed significantly higher <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than Group 2 and 3 in the first three segments (all P < 0. 01). Overall strategies remained consistent across age categories, although a similar phenomenon was observed within each category whereby ‘top’ competitors displayed lower <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than ‘bottom’ competitors in the early stages, but higher <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> in the later stages. Females showed lower <b>relative</b> starting <b>speeds</b> and higher finishing speeds than males. ‘Top’ and ‘bottom’ finishing males displayed differing strategies, but this was not the case within females. Although pacing remained consistent across age categories, it differed with level of performance within each, possibly suggesting strategies are anchored on direct competitors. Strategy differs between genders and differs depending on performance level achieved in males but not females...|$|R

25|$|In November, OPERA {{published}} refined results {{where they}} noted {{their chances of}} being wrong as even less, thus tightening their error bounds. Neutrinos arrived approximately 57.8ns earlier than if they had traveled at light-speed, giving a <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> difference of approximately one part per 42,000 against that of light. The new significance level became 6.2sigma. The collaboration submitted its results for peer-reviewed publication to the Journal of High Energy Physics.|$|E
25|$|There {{were some}} {{attempts}} to derive the Lorentz transformation without the postulate of the constancy {{of the speed}} of light. Vladimir Ignatowski (1910) for example used for this purpose (a) the principle of relativity, (b) homogeneity and isotropy of space, and (c) the requirement of reciprocity. Philipp Frank and Hermann Rothe (1911) argued that this derivation is incomplete and needs additional assumptions. Their own calculation was based on the assumptions that: (a) the Lorentz transformation forms a homogeneous linear group, (b) when changing frames, only the sign of the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> changes, (c) length contraction solely depends on the <b>relative</b> <b>speed.</b> However, according to Pauli and Miller such models were insufficient to identify the invariant speed in their transformation with the speed of light— for example, Ignatowski was forced to seek recourse in electrodynamics to include the speed of light. So Pauli and others argued that both postulates are needed to derive the Lorentz transformation. However, until today, others continued the attempts to derive special relativity without the light postulate.|$|E

25|$|One noted {{galaxy cluster}} is 1E 0657-56, the Bullet Cluster. At a {{distance}} of 4 billion light years (redshift 0.296), this galaxy cluster is named for the shock wave seen in the intracluster medium, which resembles the shock wave of a supersonic bullet. The bow shock visible {{is thought to be}} due to the smaller galaxy cluster moving through the intracluster medium at a <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> of 3000–4000 kilometers per second to the larger cluster. Because this gravitational interaction has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years, the smaller cluster is being destroyed and will eventually merge with the larger cluster.|$|E
25|$|The {{impossibility of}} faster-than-light <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> only applies locally. Wormholes might allow {{effective}} superluminal (faster-than-light) travel {{by ensuring that}} {{the speed of light}} is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them outside the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space outside the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the wormhole would of course beat the traveler.|$|E

25|$|If the transmitter's {{output is}} {{coherent}} (phase synchronized), {{there is another}} effect {{that can be used}} to make almost instant speed measurements (no memory is required), known as the Doppler effect. Most modern radar systems use this principle into Doppler radar and pulse-Doppler radar systems (weather radar, military radar). The Doppler effect is only able to determine the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> of the target along the line of sight from the radar to the target. Any component of target velocity perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be determined by using the Doppler effect alone, but it can be determined by tracking the target's azimuth over time.|$|E

Due to the large distance between Proxima and Alpha, it was long unknown whether they were gravitationally bound. The true orbital speed is necessarily small, and {{it was necessary to}} measure the speeds of Proxima and Alpha with a great precision. Otherwise it was impossible to ascertain whether Proxima is bound to Alpha or whether it is a completely unrelated star that happens to be undergoing a close approach at a low <b>relative</b> <b>speed.</b> Probability suggested that such low speed approaches would be rare and unlikely, but it could not be ruled out.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the ram sometime before the 8th century BC {{changed the nature of}} naval warfare, which had until then been a matter of boarding and hand-to-hand fighting. With a heavy projection {{at the foot of the}} bow, sheathed with metal, usually bronze, a ship could incapacitate an enemy ship by punching a hole in its planking. The <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> and nimbleness of ships became important, since a slower ship could be outmaneuvered and disabled by a faster one. The earliest designs had only one row of rowers that sat in undecked hulls, rowing against tholes, or oarports, that were placed directly along the railings. The practical upper limit for wooden constructions fast and maneuverable enough for warfare was around 25-30 oars per side. By adding another level of oars, a development that occurred no later than c. 750 BC, the galley could be made shorter with as many rowers, while making them strong enough to be effective ramming weapons.|$|E
