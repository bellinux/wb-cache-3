5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of <b>rest</b> <b>my</b> ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play my own age for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could <b>rest</b> <b>my</b> tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 11 July Morley {{sent to the}} Marquis this demand: [...] "My Lord, — To {{avoid the}} {{effusion}} of Christian blood, I have thought fit to send your Lordship this summons to demand Basing House to be delivered to me {{for the use of}} the King and Parliament. If this be refused, the ensuing inconvenience will rest upon yourself. I desire a speedy answer, and <b>rest.</b> <b>My</b> Lord, your humble servant, Heebeet Moeley".|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{they were}} gone I threw my arms round my comrade's neck, and, <b>resting</b> <b>my</b> head on his shoulder, bemoaned our sad lot.|$|R
60|$|After <b>resting</b> <b>my</b> {{blistered}} {{hands for}} three days, which time was scarcely {{long enough to}} heal them, I could not resist {{the call of the}} sea.|$|R
2500|$|For the 2015 summer tour dates, Paul Manzi {{returned}} to sub for Peter Lincoln who left this online {{message to the}} fans: [...] "There {{have been a few}} rumours going around this weekend, so [...] [...] [...] just to say that I am alive and well! The short explanation for my absence is that I need to <b>rest</b> <b>my</b> voice for a few weeks. We are lucky that our good friend Paul Manzi is able to step in, and Tony knows the role of bass player/singer, so the shows can go ahead, and they will be great! I look forward to being back on stage very soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{and more}} Thérèse {{realised}} {{that she felt}} no attraction to the exalted heights of [...] "great souls". She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Thérèse's retreat in October 1892 pointed out to her a [...] "downward" [...] path. If asked where she lived, she reflected, must not she {{be able to answer}} with Christ, [...] "The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to <b>rest</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine." [...] She continued to seek to discover the means, [...] "to more efficiently strip herself of self." [...] "No doubt, [...] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and {{it is for this reason}} that Jesus tells me to descend." ...|$|E

60|$|One morning, when I <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> team a few moments, {{talking to}} Harry and the {{surveyor}} after hauling a heavy log, Johnston came up chuckling, with {{a strip of}} cedar bark on which a notice was written.|$|R
6000|$|I {{fear that}} this event [...] Marks the {{beginning}} of a train of ills.... Moscow was meant to be <b>my</b> <b>rest,</b> [...] <b>My</b> refuge, and--it vanishes away! ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am always}} quite {{straightforward}} when I am {{dealing with a}} client who means business. I pushed aside the litter of papers in front of me, leaned my elbows upon <b>my</b> desk, <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> chin in my hands, and said briefly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Most decidedly not,' said Albinia. 'Set {{your mind}} at <b>rest,</b> <b>my</b> poor child; whoever {{threatened}} you played you a most base, cruel trick.' ...|$|E

60|$|LOUIS. Not yet, dear. Very nearly, but not yet. I {{should like}} to <b>rest</b> <b>my</b> head on your bosom; only it would tire you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{not just}} in that sense, exactly, if you mean as a detective. But I'm a {{newspaper}} man, {{and this is my}} holiday, and I'm working up a little article about our financiers in exile while I'm <b>resting.</b> <b>My</b> name's Pinney." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was shown}} {{into the room}} I already knew so well, and I sat down in Giulia's chair. I <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> head on the {{cushions}} which had pressed against her beautiful hair, her cheek; and I inhaled the fragrance which they had left behind them.|$|R
60|$|Samuel and I {{went all}} over the house, and shut up as usual. I {{examined}} everything myself, and trusted nothing to my deputy on this occasion. All was safe and fast when I <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> old bones in bed, between midnight {{and one in the}} morning.|$|R

60|$|Tears were in Maud’s eyes, and I {{do believe}} they were for me. I could have wept myself. Where now was our project of remasting the Ghost? He had done his work well. I {{sat down on the}} hatch-combing and <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> chin on my hands in black despair.|$|R
60|$|I <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> chin on my {{knee and}} looked before {{me on the}} ground. I had been talking until then to hold her; but I was now not sorry she should go: an {{impression}} is a thing so delicate to produce and so easy to overthrow! Presently she seemed to make an effort.|$|R

6000|$|... "If so," [...] replied Varney, [...] "she will but {{sleep the}} sounder, {{and the fear}} of that shall not break <b>my</b> <b>rest.</b> Good night, <b>my</b> masters." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{completion}} of the memorial to my mother eased my heart of its bitter self-accusation, and a little later I returned to my accustomed routine, realizing that in my wife now lay my present incentive and my future support. She {{became the center of}} my world. In her <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> hope of happiness. My mother was a memory.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} still more awkward in me, if I were gravely {{to look the}} sheriffs in the face, and to tell them they were not to {{determine}} my cause on my own principles, nor to make the return upon those votes upon which I had <b>rested</b> <b>my</b> election. Such would be my appearance to the court and magistrates.|$|R

60|$|Her {{delicate}} hand <b>rested</b> upon <b>my</b> sleeve, {{her dark}} eyes looked imploringly into mine.|$|R

40|$|The essay {{presents}} Saul Kripke's {{argument for}} mind/body-dualism {{and makes the}} suppositions explicit on which it <b>rests.</b> <b>My</b> claim, inspired by Richard Boyd, is that even if one of Kripke’s central suppositions - the principle of necessity of identities using rigid designators - is shared by the non-traditional identity theorist, {{it is still possible}} for her to rebut Kripke’s dualism...|$|R
