25|$|The goal of guided {{instruction}} in the gradual release of responsibility model is to guide students toward using different skills, strategies and procedures independently. The student will assume more responsibility with less support from the teacher. Lessons are created as to ensure student success. Oftentimes when students are struggling with a concept in the classroom, {{they do not need}} more teacher modelling, what they <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> guidance and support to meet high expectations.|$|E

[...] What they <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> {{for someone to come}} along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And when it comes to Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E
500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, RedOne and Space Cowboy, with RedOne {{producing}} the track. The song was recorded at the Record Plant Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with MTV News, Gaga said that [...] "Monster" [...] describes her fear of sex and relationships and the literal meaning is about a [...] "guy with a big dick". She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's bad for you... If you listen to the lyrics, it's like being in love with the bad boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster... But what I <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> the security and the safety and the womanhood, responsibility of my femininity. And so that's what that song is about.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Gittings and Kameny {{organized}} {{a discussion with}} the American Psychiatric Association entitled [...] "Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue", where a panel of psychiatrists were to discuss homosexuality. When Gittings' partner Kay Tobin Lahusen noticed that all the psychiatrists were heterosexual, she protested. Gittings remembered, [...] "My partner, Kay, said, 'This isn't right—here you have two psychiatrists pitted against two gays, and what you <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> someone who is both.' The panel moderator, Dr. Kent Robinson, agreed to add a gay psychiatrist if we could find one. In 1972 who would come forward? ... Kay and I wrote letters and made phone calls around the country." [...] A gay psychiatrist in Philadelphia finally agreed {{to appear on the}} panel in heavy disguise, and with a voice distorting microphone, calling himself [...] "Dr. H. Anonymous". He was [...] John E. Fryer, and he discussed how he was forced to be closeted while practicing psychiatry. Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as [...] "transformative".|$|E

In an interview published by The Oregonian, Nye said, [...] "Lee Kelly is a living legend and the pride of Oregon's artistic community. And his studio is right here in Clackamas County. He's a local treasure." [...] She also wrote in a press release, [...] "It would be a terrible loss to the community to have this sculpture removed, but it's fast becoming a reality". The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying [...] "We’re more than halfway there, but what we <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> a handful of lead donors to step forward and make this important work a permanent part of the City’s collection. And we need them now."
