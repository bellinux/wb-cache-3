5|$|Given the book's {{fluid and}} {{changeable}} approach to plot and characters, a definitive, critically agreed-upon plot synopsis remains elusive (see Critical <b>response</b> <b>and</b> themes: Difficulties of plot summary below).

5|$|In 2003, Blackmon wrote a {{story on}} the use of black convict labor in the coal mines of U.S. Steel. The story {{generated}} a large <b>response,</b> <b>and</b> was later anthologized in Best Business Stories.

50|$|Biocompatibility and {{toxicity}} of a polymeric material is evaluated by examining systemic toxic responses, local tissue <b>responses,</b> carcinogenic <b>and</b> mutagenic <b>responses,</b> <b>and</b> allergic <b>responses</b> to the material's degradation products. Animal studies are conducted {{to test the}} polymer’s effect {{on each of these}} negative <b>responses.</b> Polyanhydrides <b>and</b> their degradation products have not been found to cause significant harmful <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> are considered to be biocompatible.|$|R
40|$|When {{modeling}} <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> {{times in}} tests with latent trait models, {{the assumption of}} conditional independence between <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> times might be too strong in the case that both data are gained from reactions to the same item. In order {{to account for the}} possible dependency of <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> times from the same item, a generalization of the model of van der Linden (2007) is proposed. The basic idea consists in the assumption of a latent continuous response that underlies the observed binary response. This latent response is assumed to be correlated with the corresponding response time. The main advantage of this approach consists {{in the fact that the}} marginal models for <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> times follow well known, standard latent trait models. Model estimation can be accomplished by marginal maximum likelihood estimation. The adequacy of the estimation approach is demonstrated in a small scale simulation study. An empirical data application illustrates the practicability of the approach in practice...|$|R
40|$|Structural <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> sensitivities {{are widely}} used in the finite element model updating, damage {{identification}} and optimization design. Calculation of the <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> sensitivities of a large-scale structure consumes considerable computation storage and is usually time-consuming. This paper proposes an improved dynamic condensation approach to calculate the structural <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> sensitivities. The condensed vibration equation is achieved by a simplified iterative scheme. By selecting the DOFs associated with the concerned element to be master DOFs, the response sensitivity is rapidly calculated from the derivatives of the master stiffness and mass matrices. Since the condensed vibration equation has a much smaller size than the original vibration equation, the proposed method is quite efficient in calculating the structural <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> sensitivities. Finally, applications of the proposed method to an eight-storey frame and a cantilever plate demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in the calculation of structural <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> sensitivities.

40|$|African Americans’ {{experiences}} of racism {{have been found}} to be linked with higher levels of psychological distress. Coping <b>responses</b> to racism <b>and</b> racial identity may serve as moderators to this relationship. The present study uses an implicit measure to assess coping <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> racial identity. The main goal was to determine any correlation between implicit <b>and</b> explicit coping <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> racial identity, and between implicit coping <b>responses</b> to racism <b>and</b> explicit coping <b>responses</b> to general stress. A significant correlation was observed between implicit and explicit measures of coping <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> racial identity, and between implicit coping <b>responses</b> to racism <b>and</b> explicit coping <b>responses</b> to general stress. A significant correlation was also observed between implicit coping <b>responses</b> to racism <b>and</b> psychological distress. Findings indicate that implicit measures used in conjunction with explicit measures may provide a more comprehensive assessment of coping <b>responses</b> to racism <b>and</b> racial identity...|$|R

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and <b>response</b> <b>and</b> body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

An appeal to the king produced no <b>response,</b> <b>and</b> Rhys resorted to arms, first capturing Clifford's castle at Llandovery then seizing Ceredigion. King Henry responded by preparing another invasion, and Rhys submitted without resistance. He was obliged to give hostages, probably including his son Hywel.|$|E
5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing <b>response</b> <b>and</b> {{are the most}} common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E

A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge <b>response</b> <b>and</b> the duration of peak spore discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration.

5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War I {{there were}} no traditions of nationally commemorating mass {{casualties}} in war.
