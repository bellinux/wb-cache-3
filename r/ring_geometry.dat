50|$|The initial {{theoretical}} {{proposal for}} this effect suggested an experiment where charges pass through conducting cylinders along two paths, which shield the particles from external electric {{fields in the}} regions where they travel, but still allow a varying potential to be applied by charging the cylinders. This proved difficult to realize, however. Instead, a different experiment was proposed involving a <b>ring</b> <b>geometry</b> interrupted by tunnel barriers, with a bias voltage V relating the potentials of {{the two halves of}} the ring. This situation results in an Aharonov-Bohm phase shift as above, and was observed experimentally in 1998.|$|E
40|$|Geometric {{phases of}} {{scattering}} {{states in a}} <b>ring</b> <b>geometry</b> are studied based on {{a variant of the}} adiabatic theorem. Three time scales, i. e., the adiabatic period, the system time and the dwell time, associated with adiabatic scattering in a <b>ring</b> <b>geometry</b> plays a crucial role in determining geometric phases, in contrast to only two time scales, i. e., the adiabatic period and the dwell time, in an open system. We derive a formula connecting the gauge invariant geometric phases acquired by time-reversed scattering states and the circulating (pumping) current. A numerical calculation shows that the effect of the geometric phases is observable in a nanoscale electronic device. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of coherent circulation in a macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate of polaritons in a <b>ring</b> <b>geometry.</b> Because they are spinor condensates, half-quanta are allowed in {{where there is a}} phase rotation of Π in connection with a polarization vector rotation of Π around a closed path. This half-quantum behavior is clearly seen in the experimental observations of the polarization rotation around the ring. In our <b>ring</b> <b>geometry,</b> the half-quantum state that we see is one in which the handedness of the spin flips {{from one side of the}} ring to the other side in addition to the rotation of the linear polarization component; such a state is allowed in a <b>ring</b> <b>geometry</b> but will not occur in a simply connected geometry. This state is lower in energy than a half-quantum state with no change of the spin direction and corresponds to a superposition of two different elementary half-quantum states. The direction of circulation of the flow around the ring fluctuates randomly between clockwise and counterclockwise from one shot to the next; this fluctuation corresponds to spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the system. This type of macroscopic polariton ring condensate allows for the possibility of direct control of the circulation to excite higher quantized states and the creation of Josephson junction tunneling barriers...|$|E

50|$|Further, {{the bonding}} has less restrictions, {{concerning}} substrate roughness and planarity than direct bonding. Compared to anodic bonding, no high voltages are required {{that can be}} detrimental to electrostatic MEMS. Additionally, the eutectic bonding procedure promotes a better out-gassing and hermeticity than bonding with organic intermediate layers. Compared to glass frit bonding, the advantage sticks out that the reduction of seal <b>ring</b> <b>geometries,</b> an increase of the hermeticity levels and a shrinking of device size is possible.

30|$|There {{have been}} many models {{proposed}} for the unique properties of non-crystalline SiO 2.

CRN models assume the short range order, SRO, of SiO 2 is comprised of fourfold coordinated Si in tetrahedral environments through corner-connected twofold coordinated O bridging two Si atoms in a bent geometry. The random character of the network has generally been attributed to a wide distribution of Si–O–Si bond angles, 150 ± 30 ° as determined by X-ray diffraction [3], as well as a random distribution of dihedral angles. These combine to give a distribution of <b>ring</b> <b>geometries</b> that defines a compliant and strain free CRN structure [2].|$|R
