5|$|Orizaba made15 transatlantic voyages for the Navy {{carrying}} {{troops to}} and from Europe in World War I with the second-shortest average in-port turnaround time of all Navy transports. The ship {{was turned over to}} the War Department in 1919for use as Army transport USAT Orizaba. After her World War I service ended, Orizaba reverted to the Ward Line, her previous owners. The ship was briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York–Cuba–Mexico service until 1939, when the ship was chartered to United States Lines. While Orizaba was in her Ward Line service, American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from the <b>rear</b> <b>deck</b> of the liner off Florida in April 1932.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} her anti-aircraft armament {{in light of}} its wartime experience. Her no. 3 gun turret was to be moved to the No. 4 position, its magazine converted for extra fuel storage, and a new twin 37mm Mle 1933 mount would replace {{it on top of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>deck</b> house. Two more Mle 1933 mounts were to fitted {{on each side of the}} rear deckhouse and a fourth mount was to replace the 13.2Hotchkiss machine guns forward of the bridge. One 13.2mm Browning machine gun was to planned to be mounted on each side of the forward twin 37mm guns. This plan was later amended to add a degaussing cable, replacement of the SS-6 sonar by a French copy of the British ASDIC and six of the new mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940 anti-aircraft guns, plus two more 13.2mm Brownings mounted on the forward corners of the center deck house.|$|E
5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the <b>rear</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although Hapag-Lloyd {{originally}} {{considered a}} traditional two-funnel {{design for the}} fourth Europa, they finally opted for a modern, balanced design.

25|$|The {{public spaces}} were also altered radically in the 1970—71 refit, with three {{swimming}} pools {{added to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>decks,</b> and the accommodations brought up to the high standards expected by the North American cruise passengers.

A carryover 1977 Hornet AMX decal was available for the <b>rear</b> <b>deck</b> and hood, in either gold with orange or black with gold.

25|$|In {{a bid to}} stem declining sales, a 2-seat economy {{version of}} the Minicar was {{introduced}} in October 1964, the Bond 250 G Tourer. This basically used the saloon car body, but with a larger <b>rear</b> <b>deck</b> incorporating an opening boot lid, a folding hood, new fibreglass bonnet, plain door panels, no chrome side trim and non-opening quarter lights. In standard form it came with the 35A engine, but the side trim and 4T engine were available as an option.|$|E
25|$|Although the Ilmatar {{was built}} as a two-class ship, she had only one dining room that was used by both classes. Other {{facilities}} included a first-class smoking room, located one deck higher from the dining room. As built she had six passenger-accessible decks. The 1973 lengthening saw the addition of several new cabins, a children's playroom and a new waste processing plant. More cabins were added during a 1974 refit at the Valmet shipyard in Vuosaari. In the 1979 conversion into a cruise ship more luxurious cabins were added and a swimming pool was constructed on the <b>rear</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E

25|$|Through {{the course}} of that winter, Curtiss was able to develop a float (pontoon) design that would enable him to take off and land on water. On January 26, 1911, he flew the first {{seaplane}} from the water in the United States. Demonstrations of this advanced design were of great interest to the Navy, but more significant, as far as the Navy was concerned, was Eugene Ely successfully landing his Curtiss pusher (the same aircraft used to take off from the Birmingham) on a makeshift platform mounted on the <b>rear</b> <b>deck</b> of the battleship USS Pennsylvania. This was the first arrester-cable landing on a ship and the precursor of modern-day carrier operations. On January 28, 1911, Ellyson took off in a Curtiss “grass cutter” to become the first Naval aviator.|$|E
25|$|For the 2011 MY, the XRS and XLE {{grades were}} {{discontinued}} for the US market (XRS is still available in Canada). The revised Corolla features new {{front and rear}} exterior styling and interior design changes, including a redesigned front grille, front and rear bumpers, new wheel designs, rear chrome garnish, rear combination lamps and trunk lid. The interior adds a metallic trim (LE and S grades), new fabrics and a sport tilt/telescopic steering wheel (S grade). Corolla also features two new colors, Nautical Blue Metallic and Sandy Beach Metallic. New standard features for the LE grade include cruise control, Remote Keyless Entry, two additional audio speakers, and variable intermittent windshield wipers with a mist cycle. The S grade adds standard cruise control, Remote Keyless Entry, 16-inch alloy wheels and a color-keyed <b>rear</b> <b>deck</b> spoiler.|$|E
25|$|A {{rear spoiler}} usually comes {{standard}} in most sports vehicles and resembles {{the shape of}} a raised wing {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The main purpose of a rear spoiler in a vehicle's design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A rear spoiler design that stands off the <b>rear</b> <b>deck</b> lid will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the coefficient of drag. Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of reduced lift are not required.|$|E
5000|$|The Mustang {{created the}} [...] "pony car" [...] class of American muscle cars, {{affordable}} sporty coupes with long hoods and short <b>rear</b> <b>decks</b> and {{gave rise to}} competitors such as the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, AMC Javelin, Chrysler's revamped Plymouth Barracuda, and the second generation Dodge Challenger. The Mustang is also credited for inspiring the designs of coupés such as the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri, which were imported to the United States.|$|R
