5|$|Although some {{radio waves}} are emitted {{directly}} by astronomical objects, {{a product of}} thermal emission, most of the <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> that is observed {{is the result of}} synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Decimetric <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> (with {{wavelengths}} {{measured in}} centimeters) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959. The origin of this signal {{was from a}} torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator. This signal is caused by cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The International Telecommunication Union uses {{an internationally}} agreed system for {{classifying}} radio frequency signals.

It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> {{associated}} with a flare/CME event on the sun. For this solar event there were type II <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> observed in both the metric and decametric to kilometric wavelength regimes. By comparing {{the dynamics of the}} CME with that implied by the frequencies and frequency-drift rates of the type II <b>radio</b> <b>emissions,</b> it is concluded that only the decametric/kilometric type II <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> are associated with the CME. We provide the first direct one-to-one comparison between a CME and the associated type II <b>radio</b> <b>emissions.</b> The dynamics implied by the metric type II <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> suggest a distinct coronal shock, associated with the flare, which only produces <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> in the low corona...|$|R

40|$|We review, in a non-mathematical way, {{the current}} state of the theory of natural <b>radio</b> <b>{{emissions}}</b> in the heliosphere. These emissions can be divided into four categories: solar <b>radio</b> <b>emissions,</b> planetary <b>radio</b> <b>emissions,</b> interplanetary <b>radio</b> <b>emissions,</b> and termination shock <b>radio</b> <b>emissions.</b> The present review excludes solar and proper planetary radiation in plasma and radio waves (for a review of the latter see, e. g., Kurth and Gurnett, 1991), which by themselves each constitute a wide field, and concentrates on the remaining two phenomena. Radiation in interplanetary space is mainly caused by electron streams either escaping from the solar corona, reflected from planetary bow shocks or originating in traveling interplanetary shock waves and solar wind holes. The main radiation mechanisms are wave-wave interactions in the high-frequency Langmuir mode in both the weakly and strongly turbulent regimes. The contribution of ions is twofold: first in generating sufficient inhomogeneity for electron scattering and in providing low frequency density modulations which may mediate the emission process. Similar menchanisms hold for the termination shock emissions, but here critical ionization of the interstellar medium becomes important. Generally, the importance of ions in <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> is not clarified yet. The electron cyclotron maser is probably not working in the interplanetary or interstellar space because of the weak magnetic fields encountered there. (orig.)

5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} Jupiter's magnetic field came in 1955, with the discovery of the decametric <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> or DAM.

The flux density of the giant pulses emitted by PSR B1937+21 are the brightest <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> ever observed. These properties of PSR B1937+21, and its unexpected discovery, are credited with helping revitalize research on pulsars.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, a {{prominent}} radio source was identified overlapping {{the location of}} M87, and this was labeled Virgo-A. This source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet emerging from {{the core of the}} galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E

The core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog. In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. This was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter {{is responsible}} for intense episodes of <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and {{the energy is transmitted}} out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.|$|E

5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E
25|$|The {{detection}} {{of only a}} limited number of Wolf–Rayet stars at radio wavelengths provides a lower limit on the distance of 2kpc; while a few Wolf–Rayet stars are detected, these are believed to be colliding-wind binaries with correspondingly enhanced <b>radio</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Jovian high-latitude <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> {{produced}} by Jupiter's magnetosphere extend {{from a few}} kilohertz to 40 MHz. Part of the decametric (DAM) emissions are driven by the Galilean moon Io (Io-DAM). As UV aurorae have been detected at the footprint of Europa and Ganymede, we expect that these moons drive Jovian <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> as well. To check this assumption, we used the ExPRES simulation code (Exoplanetary and Planetary <b>Radio</b> <b>Emissions</b> Simulator) to predict dynamic spectrum (time-frequency spectograms) of the <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> controlled by the four Galilean moons. Then we compared the simulations to the Voyager/PRA and Cassini/RPWS radio observations of Jupiter (1979, and between 2000 and 2003, respectively). We present the first clear evidence {{for the existence of}} decametric emissions controlled by Europa and Ganymede. Their statistical analysis allows us to describe the average properties of the Europa-DAM and Ganymede-DAM emissions such as their spectrum, temporal variability, and occurrence as a function of moon phase and subobserver's longitude...|$|R
40|$|Two {{examples}} of type 2 <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> {{associated with the}} propagation of earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through the interplanetary medium are illustrated and compared. The two type 2 radio events were observed by WIND/WAVES in January and May of 1997 and exhibit very different radio characteristics. The analyses presented here use the novel approach of presenting the radio data {{as a function of}} the inverse of the frequency and time, which facilitates remote radio tracking of the CME through the interplanetary medium. It is demonstrated unequivocally that for the May 1997 event, the <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> were generated at the fundamental, and harmonic of the plasma frequency in the ambient plasma upstream of the CME-driven shock. For the January 1997 event, evidence is presented that some of the <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> were generated while the CME-driven shock passed through a corotating interaction region (CIR). This is the first time that type 2 <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> were shown to originate in a specific interplanetary structure...|$|R

The observed structure in <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> is determined by the interaction between twin jets and the external medium, modified by the effects of relativistic beaming.

Recently, much work has been done on the effects of these objects on the intergalactic medium, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the aurora}} and {{associated}} currents produce a strong <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> around 150kHz known as auroral kilometric radiation AKR, discovered in 1972.

25|$|In {{the case}} of Mars there have been {{terrestrial}} observations of <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> spectra that {{have been associated with}} Schumann resonances.

There is the possibility that future lander missions could carry in situ instrumentation to perform the necessary measurements. Theoretical studies are primarily directed to parameterizing the problem for future planetary explorers.|$|E

This radiation is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum, almost uniformly, from X-rays to the far-infrared with a peak in the ultraviolet-optical bands, with some quasars also being strong sources of <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> and of gamma-rays.|$|E
