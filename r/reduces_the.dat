5|$|A {{course of}} antiretrovirals {{administered}} within 48 to 72hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions {{is referred to}} as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

50|$|Several {{proposed}} {{measures have been}} introduced to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> discharge of the Jeddo Tunnel.

Diverting runoff from the hills around the coal basins near the Jeddo Tunnel is another method of <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> tunnel's discharge, and this could <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> discharge by 10%.

5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E
5|$|A non-competitive {{inhibitor}} binds {{to a site}} {{other than}} where the substrate binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence Km remains the same.

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds.

5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements.
