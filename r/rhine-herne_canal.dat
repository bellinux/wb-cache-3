50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{a branch}} canal of the Dortmund-Ems Canal was built in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the castle between Heinrichenburg and Herne. Later the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>canal</b> was built to replacing the original, this lies north of the castle.|$|E
50|$|The section between Osterfeld {{junction}} (old) and Osterfeld Nord was not {{restored to}} operation {{and it was}} formally closed on 16 March 1967.

50|$|This {{section was}} not fully {{dismantled}} until 1892. In 1906, the branch canal of the Dortmund-Ems Canal {{was built on}} the route.

5000|$|The port's history {{begins in}} the first decade of the 20th century with the {{building}} of the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal.</b> On 14 July 1905 the company Kanalhafen Wanne-Gelsenkirchen-Land is born, with the aim of making a coal port for the surrounding mines on the canal.

5000|$|... 80,000 B.C. - The {{region of}} the present-day Ruhr was already settled during the Neanderthal period, around 80,000 years ago. During the {{building}} of the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> in 1911, stone tools and traces of encampment with bones from wooly rhinoceros, bison and mammoth were found in Herne. Humanoids also settled elsewhere in the Emscher valley. Similar finds in the 1960s were made in Bottrop.|$|E
50|$|Between 1906 and 1914 the {{catchment}} area changed completely as in {{parallel to the}} technical transformation of the river system with 7.000 hectares drained land the shipping waterway <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> was constructed over a stretch of 46 km to connect the coal and steel district via the Rhine to the North Sea. This waterway was located partly in the former Emscher course and is often only separated by a dyke from the Emscher.|$|E

50|$|As {{one of the}} few Ruhr area cities, Bochum is not {{directly}} connected with the German waterway net; the closest link is in the more northern located Herne at the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal.</b> In the south the border of Bochum is marked by the Ruhr. Up to {{the first half of the}} 19th century it was one of the most-travelled rivers in Europe and was mainly used for coal departure. Despite of tour ships, the navigation time ended long ago.|$|E
50|$|In {{later years}} {{the line was}} {{steadily}} improved and branches were built. In 1864 the BME took over {{the management of the}} lines of the Aachen-Dusseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company (formally the Königliche Direction der Aachen-Düsseldorf-Ruhrorter Eisenbahn). On 8 January 1866, it took over the company, including the Ruhrort-Homberg train ferry. It opened a line on 4 December 1867 to Ruhrort from Styrum via Meiderich (Sud), partly parallel with the older line of the CME from Oberhausen crossing the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> on a bridge constructed with gauntlet track.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War bridges {{over the}} <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal,</b> the Emscher river in Oberhausen, the Wesel-Datteln Canal and the Lippe in Wesel {{that had been}} {{destroyed}} during the war were restored with temporary repairs. As early as 15 November 1945 the tracks between Oberhausen and Arnhem were restored. Operations within the Netherlands were quickly restored. The destroyed Wesel Railway Bridge over the Rhine was not rebuilt, ending operations on the lines to Boxtel and Venlo. The largely destroyed station buildings on the line were rebuilt between 1952 and 1956.|$|E
50|$|A {{colliery}} railway connected from Gelsenkirchen-Wattenscheid {{station to}} the east to the Carolinenglück colliery nearby. Along with the neighbouring collieries of Hannover, Holland and Rheinelbe, the Carolinenglück colliery had a rail connection to Gelsenkirchen CME (now Gelsenkirchen Central Station) in the 1850s. It was connected in 1867 to the Rhenish Railway Company’s new Osterath-Dortmund Süd railway. Parts of {{the line at the}} Carolinenglück mine were used for the route of an iron ore railway built from the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> to the Bochumer Verein steel works in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The Gasometer {{was built}} by Gutehoffnungshütte, {{by the side of}} the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal.</b> Construction started 27 February 1927 and cost 1.74 million Reichsmark. A {{framework}} of 24 steel girders was built on a concrete base, and a skin of 5mm thick sheet metal was riveted to the framework. Inside, a 1,207,000 kg pressure disc was mounted which could freely move up and down, floating on top of the gas underneath and keeping it at a constant pressure. 15 May 1929 the Gasometer was first put into operation, with a maximum capacity of 347,000m³, a height of 117.5m and diameter of 67.6m.|$|E
5000|$|Bottrop (...) {{is a city}} in west central Germany, on the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal,</b> in North Rhine-Westphalia. Located in the Ruhr {{industrial}} area, Bottrop adjoins Essen, Oberhausen, Gladbeck and Dorsten. The {{city had}} been a coal-mining and rail center and contains factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s, was chartered as a city in 1921, and bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. In 1975 it unified with the neighbour communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left it in 1976, leading to Kirchhellen becoming a district of Bottrop as Bottrop-Kirchhellen.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> (Rhein-Herne-Kanal) is a 45.6 km {{transportation}} canal in the Ruhr area of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, {{with five}} canal locks. The canal was built {{over a period}} of eight years (5 April 1906 - 14 July 1914) and connects the harbour in Duisburg on the Rhine (...) with the Dortmund-Ems Canal near Henrichenburg (...) , following the valley of the Emscher. It was widened in the 1980s. The Rhein-Herne canal ship was designed specifically for this canal; normally of about 1300-1350 ton capacity, it has a maximum draft of 2.50 m, a length of approximately 80 m, and maximum beam of 9.50 m.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the line had up to four parallel tracks used exclusively for freight. With the decline of rail freight traffic after World War II on the line much of this track was subsequently abandoned. Some of it was brought back into operation as part of the S-Bahn or with the construction of the new long-distance tracks between Witten and Dortmund.In recent years only series 515 battery railcars ran on the section between Duisburg-Meiderich Sud and Mülheim (Ruhr)-Styrum, but these services stopped on 1 April 1995 and the line was closed on 1 May 1996. The southern platform of Duisburg-Meiderich Sud station, the embankment to the east and the bridge over the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> were immediately removed.|$|E
5000|$|The oldest archaeological find, the Vogelheimer Klinge, {{dates back}} to 280,000 - 250,000 BC. It is a blade found in the borough of [...] in the {{northern}} part of the city during the construction of the <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> in 1926. Other artifacts from the Stone Age have also been found, although these are not overly numerous. Land utilization was very high - especially due to mining activities during the Industrial Age - and any more major finds, especially from the Mesolithic era, are not expected. Finds from 3,000 BC and onwards are far more common, the most important one being a Megalithic tomb found in 1937. Simply called Steinkiste (Chest of Stone), it is referred to as [...] "Essen's earliest preserved example of architecture".|$|E
50|$|Castrop-Rauxel {{has access}} to three major highways, the Emscherschnellweg A 42,the Sauerlandlinie A 45 and the A 2.There are 3 railway {{stations}} within the city. The central station (Castrop-Rauxel Hauptbahnhof) on the Cologne-Minden Railway {{is located in the}} suburb of Rauxel. Connecting Castrop-Rauxel to the western Ruhr cities like Duisburg, Oberhausen, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Herne and in the east to Dortmund and Hamm. The unmanned stations of Castrop-Rauxel South (Castrop-Rauxel Süd) and Castrop-Rauxel Merklinde on the Duisburg-Ruhrort-Dortmund railway have hourly services with trains to Dortmund, Herne and Dorsten. Located in the city centre is the central bus station Muensterplatz. From here passengers can travel to almost all suburbs and to neighboring cities like Herne, Dortmund and Bochum. The <b>Rhine-Herne</b> <b>Canal</b> runs right through Castrop-Rauxel; Castrop-Rauxel also has a small Yacht club on this body of water.|$|E
