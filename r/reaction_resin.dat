Benzaldehyde, furfuryl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde were selected first from a great variety of potential substitution products. Furane resin cements with good resistance against acids and bases were obtained, when using cinnamaldehyde as reactive thinner. Properties comparable with those of the furfural containing furane resin systems were obtained with a mixture of furfuryl alcohol and trioxan.

The constitutive equations of the damage model are derived by coupling the viscoelastic material behavior of the polymer with an isotropic damage measure. The damage parameters are characterized by strain-controlled cyclic loading. Using the Newton-Raphson iteration method the deduced damage model is implemented numerically stable in a finite element program. For analyzing the damage localization the damage field for an appropriate demonstrator geometry is simulated. The simulated damage field is experimentally confirmed using grey scale correlation. The viscoelastic damage model is capable to predict the life time of the filled composite under cyclic load.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{preparation of}} spinifex resin {{for use as}} an adhesive by Indigenous Australians involves the application of limited heat {{as a source of}} energy for processing though overheating may cause permanent degradation of the material. This paper investigates the physico-thermal properties of spinifex resin and its traditional manufactured composite materials to manipulate morphologies and properties during handling and performance. The pure resin was found to display a low glass transition temperature (T-g), and the T-g was found to increase when it was heat-treated due to the thermally induced <b>reaction</b> of <b>resin</b> functional groups. The glass transition temperature further increased when soil minerals were incorporated within the resin matrix according to the conventional theory of hindrance of molecular motion of the polymer chains. The pure resin (metabolic compounds) contained some inorganic elements (Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ca, etc.) because of the micro-nutrients taken up by spinifex plants during their life span. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the pure resin displayed the lowest thermal stability. However, the thermal stability improved for resin samples that had been extracted by solvent and subsequently heat treated. This enhanced thermal stability was most likely due to the thermally induced <b>reaction</b> of <b>resin</b> functional groups to form a crosslinked network structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{on behalf of the}} Momentive Specialty Chemicals Pty Ltd, Mt Maunganui. The aim of the {{investigation was}} to develop a method to analyse the formation of melamine formaldehyde resins via an in situ real time NMR experiment leading to quantitative NMR intensities of the resin up to the stages of its Industrial Resin Endpoint (IRE). In order to run an in situ reaction for the melamine formaldehyde resin system and monitor it in real time, both qualitative and quantitative NMR acquisition methods were required. The qualitative method was power gated and used to obtain results in situ and in real time. However to render it quantitative, it was necessary to develop a quantitative method which was initially executed to obtain a conversion factor for relating the qualitative results obtained in the in situ experiment to quantitative results performed by doing inverse gated NMR spectra on a final form of the resin. The development of this technique required the determination of the longitudinal relaxation times (T 1) of the species within the melamine reaction as these were required to derive the necessary repetition rates employed in the NMR acquisition methods. In general, this project involved the development of the above mentioned NMR analytical protocols with tailoring to run this type of experiment in a 5 mm NMR tube using a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer whereby previous research on urea and phenol formaldehyde resins and employing identical NMR methodologies had relied on analyses conducted in a 10 mm NMR tube on a 300 MHz NMR instrument. As a result, reaction profiles of the melamine <b>resin</b> <b>reaction</b> were obtained during a real time experiment. The reaction profiles of the addition stage of the melamine <b>resin</b> <b>reaction</b> showed that the increase in the methylol melamine species occurs very fast and is justified by the exponential decay of the methylene glycol species corresponding to the formaldehyde solution. The condensation stages of the <b>resin</b> <b>reaction</b> were also observed until the IRE.
