This technology {{as an alternative}} for throughhole technology {{made it easier to}} place components {{on both sides of the}} board by soldering, decreased package sizes, simplified assembly and reduced costs. Furthermore, higher mechanical robustness was obtained. In this paper, a numerical-experimental study is performed to investigate the robustness of two surface mounted devices (SMDs) under EN 60068 - 2 - 21 : 1999 Test Ue 1 <b>Robustness</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terminations</b> and Integral Mounting Devices: Substrate Bending Test as described in [1]. The relevant failure modes, body cracks between the pads and delamination of the leadframe/plastic interface is identified by experiments. Numerical analysis is carried out to explain the occurring failure and toexplain differences between the two SMDs underinvestigation. First, straight-forward stress analysis gives insight in the stress distribution of the plastic body. As this analysis cannot explain the occurring delamination cohesive zone modeling is used to investigate the delamination sensitivity of the leadframe/EMC interfaces. These results give insight in the failure mechanism but do not explain the differences between the two SMDs. Therefore, a third numerical analysis with combined bulk and interface fracture is performed. This analysis is capable to explain the failure mechanism and the differences between the two SMD packages. This work shows that for this specific example more advanced numerical analysis is needed to explain the actual failure behavior of semiconductor packages...|$|E
30|$|Although Web {{services}} {{are increasingly being}} used in complex business-critical systems, assessing the <b>robustness</b> <b>of</b> services implementations (and comparing the <b>robustness</b> <b>of</b> alternative solutions) is still a difficult task. This paper proposes a practical approach to test the <b>robustness</b> <b>of</b> Web services code. Our approach {{is based on a}} set <b>of</b> <b>robustness</b> tests (including malicious inputs) that allows discovering programming and design problems. Robustness is characterized according to the following failure modes: correct (behavior is robust), crash (abnormal <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the execution), and error (an unexpected error code is returned by the server). These failure modes are complemented with a detailed classification of the observed service behavior that may help understanding the source of the failures (i.e., defects).|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> {{employment}} relationship. It aims {{not only to}} analyse current Czech legislation including existing case law, but also to outline possible proposals of amendments (de lege ferenda considerations). It consists of eight chapters. The first chapter is concerned with general issues of labour law - its concept and function, its role in legal system, its relation to civil law and directory or mandatory nature of labour law rules. The second chapter provides a basic analysis of further ways <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment relationship, which are further legal acts leading to <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment (i. e. agreement on <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment, instant <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment during the probationary period), <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment {{on the basis of}} an official decision and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment by legal events. The third chapter to the sixth chapter deals with current Czech legislation regulating notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment and with further related issues - prohibition <b>of</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> during protective period and exemptions from this prohibition (chapter 4), invalidity <b>of</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> (chapter 5) and employer's obligations consequent upon <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment (chapter 6).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area <b>of</b> this <b>termination.</b> The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the notice <b>of</b> <b>termination,</b> with an emphasis on legal act, because notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law of regulation <b>of</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>termination.</b> The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation <b>of</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>termination.</b> This chapter, {{with the help of the}} case law, deals with formal and content page <b>of</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>termination,</b> her delivery, notice <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> by employees and employers, prohibiting the possibility of [...] ...|$|R

Second aim of this thesis is to offer proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. These proposals should reflect the protective nature of labour law as well as endeavour to adjust labour law to modern needs of flexibility. The thesis consists of eight chapters.

40|$|This study investigates how the ex-ante threat <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> affects firm {{performance}} in innovation measured by number of patents and citations. Empirical {{results show that}} the threat <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> is negatively associated with both measures of firm innovation. This relation however is sensitive to industry structure. The negative effect of the threat <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> on innovation is statistically significant only for high-tech firms. For low-tech firms there is no statistically significant relation between the threat <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> and firm innovation. One plausible explanation is that high-tech firms are inherently risky and have higher rates of project failure. Adding the risk of higher threat <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> makes the manager more risk averse and forces her to avoid investing in value increasing innovations. Managers in low-tech firms don’t face such pressures.

40|$|Time Petri nets (TPNs) are a {{classical}} extension of Petri nets with timing constraints attached to transitions, for which most verification problems are undecidable. We consider TPNs under a strong semantics with multiple enablings of transitions. We {{focus on a}} structural subclass of unbounded TPNs, where the underlying untimed net is free choice, and show that it enjoys nice properties in the timed setting under a multi-server semantics. In particular, we show that the questions of firability (whether a chosen transition can fire), and termination (whether the net has a non-terminating run) are decidable for this class. Next, we consider the problem <b>of</b> <b>robustness</b> under guard enlargement and guard shrinking, i. e., whether a given property is preserved even if the system is implemented on an architecture with imprecise time measurement.

Thus, all the extensive amountofwork on termination for TRSs can be automatically used in the logic programming setting.
