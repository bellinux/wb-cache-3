The load simulation of the plastic well cover with different <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rib</b> structure parameters is conducted with Abaqus software, and the relationship between the structure parameters of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rib</b> and the mechanical properties of the plastic well cover are analyzed. The simulation result shows the stiffness and mechanical properties of the plastic well cover are improved by increasing the height (h) or width (b) of the rib; if h is smaller than 80 mm, the effect of increasing h is extraordinary for improving the stiffness and mechanical properties of the plastic well cover, while the effect of increasing b is not obvious; as h increases, the effect of increasing h is declining, but the effect of increasing b is strengthening relatively; if h is bigger than 160 mm, the effect of increasing h is very small, while the effect of increasing b is higher than the effect of increasing h; the maximum stress of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>rib</b> is higher than that of the panel, and their deference reduces as the mechanical properties of the plastic cover is improved...|$|E

For increasing the calculation accuracy and analysis accuracy of complex structure, the finite element meshing problems is proposed on the finite element analysis of large complicated structures. The effects caused by element type, mesh density and intergradations on calculating precision are studied and discussed. A research argues that with length-width ratio of 1 ~ 2 and length-thickness ration of 1. 5 ~ 4. 5 of two-dimensional rectangular element, the quality of meshing method of two-dimensional element is above normal.

In this paper, {{according}} {{to the structure of}} warships, the equivalence method of the protective structure with <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> is presented abided by the principal of equivalence in rigidity. The minimized model and the equivalence model of the protective structure with <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> penetrated by projectiles are investigated in experiment and numerical simulations, and the results show that the equivalence method of the protective structure is reasonable. The <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> are extensively used in protective structures, especially in ship structures. The <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> are characterized in extensive distribution range and little weight of unit length, and have the main effect that the rigidity requirement of the structure is satisfied so that the structure has enough rigidity stability. However, the big and the small <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> in actual structures originally have small size of the cross sectional area (CSA). According to a usual model research method, after an original structure is proportionally reduced {{according to}} the minimized proportion of one to four [1], the size of the CSA of the big and the small <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> becomes smaller, and the shape of the cross sectional area is shown in Figure 1. Under such circumstances, an experimental research on the dynamic response of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> under the impact load has the characteristics of great difficulty and bad feasibility, and in addition, the reliability of reflecting target characteristic by a proportionally reduced model is very low [2]. In order to study the action of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> more objectively, the T-shaped cross section of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> is converted to a rectangular cross section {{according to the}} principle of rigidity equivalence, and then, the action can be researched actually.

40|$|Reliability of {{the design}} of slag {{carriages}} is of great importance, as these belong to transportation system of iron and steel works, operating with enhanced danger due to the necessity to carry molten materials. That {{is why it is}} required to eliminate the slightest possibility of any failures of emergency situations at operation of slag carriages. Presence of defects in the hopper’s wall undermines its reliability and diminishes its service life. Hopper’s wall undergo at operation tremendous mechanical and thermal loads. Heating over the temperature range 500 - 600 C º leads to appearance of residual deformations, it deteriorating exploitation conditions of a slag carrier. Overheating of separate sections of the casing can drastically deteriorate strength characteristics of the material, specified for the hopper’s design. This leads to alternations of its original geometry. The existing methods of improvement of its strength are insufficient due to economic and technological reasons. For this reason a technical solution was proposed and tested, in which additional <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> to be installed above the deformation area on the side surface of the hopper were presumed. The indicted area is characterized by the smallest heating temperature its exploitation temperature possesses higher strength characteristics than other sections. This feature was used for strengthening of a less strong adjoining deformation area, undergoing high heating temperature. <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> are made by foundry methods do not always ensure the desired effect as they present the source of inner defects and formation of cracks. This is explained by formation of heat centres and T-shaped elements of casting, that are last crystallized and have no dense structure. That is why it was proposed to install welded <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> for improved design of a slag carriers. The ribs are to be manufactured of steel rolled stock. This variant of installation of additional <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> guarantees absence of internal casting defects within the area of ribs fixation and their high strength and reliabilit...|$|R

In the present investigation, a one-piece composite hood with <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> was optimally designed and manufactured by resin transfer molding {{in order to reduce}} manufacturing cost. In order to obtain the optimal design, stiffness analyses for deflections due to self-weight, oil canning, and torsion test conditions were carried out by applying the ABAQUWStandard program. Based on these analyses, the thickness dimension of the composite hood required to maintain a stiffness comparable to a conventional steel hood was determined. For optimization studies of the weight reduction of the currently proposed one-piece composite hood with <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs,</b> IDESIGN program was employed. Based on a recursive quadratic programming technique, the thickness dimensions of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>ribs</b> were optimized. The deflection ratios between fiber {{glass reinforced}} composite and conventional steel hoods were minimized in the optimization studies.

40|$|Reduction of fuel consumption, {{satisfaction}} of current regulation {{and in particular}} the legislation regarding GHG emission and customer safety requirements are the main concerns of today for automotive industries. The effective means to address these issues are mainly based on the possibility of reducing the vehicle mass. In this perspective it is very promising to substitute the traditional steel by lightweight composite material. However, as the mechanical and failure behavior of composite materials are completely different from those characteristic for the traditional metallic material, substitution has to be made by a complete re-design. Beside to take advantage from the specific characteristic of the composite materials, re-design must take in great consideration both production technology and joining feasibility. Die forming manufacturing technology has been considered for the production technique due to its capability to produce open composite shells with the desired shape and to obtain structurally integrated crash box and bumper beam as a single component.
