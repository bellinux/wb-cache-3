50|$|Four {{different}} {{tape punch}} units {{are available for}} use with the Model 28 ASR. These are the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing <b>reperforator</b> (LRPE) and typing <b>reperforator</b> (LPR). Similarly, there are four different tape reader options. These are the fixed head single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD) and pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD). There is also an option that installs a second tape punch, usually a typing <b>reperforator</b> (LPR) under the dome just behind the tape reader. The second tape punch is driven by its own motor.|$|E
50|$|The Model 28 Tape Punches, {{also known}} as a tape perforators, are receiving-only five-level devices that is {{actuated}} by incoming line signals and perforates standard 11/16 inch paper tape. These tape punches are self-contained and motor-driven, operating at speeds up to 100 words-per-minute. The Model 28 family of tape punches includes the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing <b>reperforator</b> (LRPE) and typing <b>reperforator</b> (LPR).|$|E
50|$|An early {{successful}} teleprinter {{was invented}} by Frederick G. Creed. In Glasgow he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a <b>reperforator</b> (receiving perforator) and a printer. The <b>reperforator</b> punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was {{the origin of the}} Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.|$|E
5000|$|The Teletype Model 28 is {{a product}} line of page printers, typing and non-typing tape {{perforator}} and tape <b>reperforators,</b> fixed-head single contact and pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributors, and receiving selector equipment. Regarded as the most rugged machines that the Teletype Corporation built, this line of teleprinters used an exchangeable type box for printing, and a sequential selector [...] "Stunt Box" [...] to mechanically initiate non-printing functions within the typing unit of the page printer, electrically control functions within the page printer and electrically control external equipment. The Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 28 as a commercial product in 1953, after this product had originally been designed for the US Military.|$|R

50|$|Working in the company’s {{office in}} Iquique, Chile, he became tired of using {{hand-operated}} Morse keys and Wheatstone tape punches, {{and came up}} with the idea of a typewriter-style machine that would allow the operator to punch Morse code signals onto paper tape simply by pressing the appropriate character key. Creed quit his job and moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he began work in an old shed. Using an old typewriter bought from the Sauchiehall Street market, he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a <b>reperforator</b> (receiving perforator) and a printer. The <b>reperforator</b> punched incoming Morse signals onto paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{technology}} of punched paper tape storage, the systems of the design were called reperforators. A <b>reperforator</b> performed functions similar to an email message transfer agent (email server), used much later in the Internet, but it used electro-mechanical technology, which preceded the use of semiconductor circuitry and computers.|$|E
5000|$|Kleinschmidt machines, {{with the}} {{military}} as their primary customer, used standard military designations for their machines. The teleprinter was identified with designations such as a TT-4/FG, while communication [...] "sets" [...] to which a teleprinter might be a part generally used the standard Army/Navy designation system such as AN/FGC-25. This includes Kleinschmidt teleprinter TT-117/FG and tape <b>reperforator</b> TT-179/FG.|$|E
50|$|The Model 28 Tape Punch Set is a multi-magnet <b>reperforator,</b> {{also known}} as the LARP, and capable of {{producing}} 5, 6, 7 or 8 level paper tape at speeds up to 20 characters per minute from a parallel wire input. The Model 28 Tape Punch Set uses a standard 115 VAC 60 Hz synchronous motor is 9.75 inches high, 15.5 inches wide and 10 inches deep and weighs 24 pounds.|$|E
50|$|In 1924 Creed & Company, {{founded by}} Frederick G. Creed, entered the {{teleprinter}} field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed’s first combined start-stop machine, {{was introduced in}} 1927 for the Post office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape {{at a rate of}} 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a <b>reperforator</b> (receiving perforator) and a printer. The <b>reperforator</b> punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland Telex service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, Baudot's {{code was}} {{modified}} by Donald Murray (1865-1945), prompted by his {{development of a}} typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At {{the receiving end of}} the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a <b>reperforator</b> could be used to make a perforated copy of the message. As there was no longer a connection between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most frequently used characters.|$|E
50|$|A <b>reperforator</b> {{switching}} center received messages via serial communication lines from teleprinters, {{such as the}} Teletype Model 28 ASR, or from other {{switching center}}s on receiving consoles, each consisting of a paper tape punch feeding tape into a paper tape reader via a storage bin. The reader decoded the message header, and sent the header characters to the director. The director, much like a telephone switch, connected the receiving console to a sending console in the same switching center by a cross-office connection. The message was transmitted from the receiving console to the sending console, character by character, punching a second paper tape at the sending console. Cross-office connections, and their readers and punches, were slightly faster than external connections, to limit congestion {{to the edges of}} the network. Each sending console also consisted of a paper tape punch and reader. Output from each sending console was transmitted via outgoing lines to other switching centers or to destination teleprinters. Each message typically contained one telegram.|$|E

The Murray code also introduced what became known as [...] "format effectors" [...] or [...] "control characters" [...] - the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} on the tape punch was a device called a Chadless Printing <b>Reperforator.</b> This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on {{it at the same}} time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no chad would be produced; the [...] "hole" [...] was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, of course, there was no [...] "chad box" [...] to empty from time to time. A disadvantage to this mechanism was that chadless tape, once punched, did not roll up well, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape, so it could not be rolled up tightly. Another disadvantage, as seen over time, was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape by optical means employed by later high-speed readers. However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with chadless tape, because it sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.|$|E
