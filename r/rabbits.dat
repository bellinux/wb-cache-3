5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} <b>rabbits</b> {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the <b>rabbits</b> and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the <b>rabbits</b> are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view <b>rabbits</b> as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of the Great Depression until the {{formation}} of the New Zealand Rabbit Board in 1954, <b>rabbits</b> became a major pest in the area, and rabbiters were employed to keep the creatures under control.

5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic <b>rabbits.</b> Some published sources say that guinea pigs and <b>rabbits</b> complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, <b>rabbits</b> have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. <b>Rabbits</b> may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E

5|$|However, mammals are {{the most}} popular pets in the Western world, with the most kept species being dogs, cats, and <b>rabbits.</b> For example, in America in 2012 there were some 78 million dogs, 86 million cats, and 3.5 million <b>rabbits.</b> There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their {{existence}} as individuals with rights of their own.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 <b>rabbits</b> were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino <b>rabbits</b> are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because <b>rabbits</b> have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of <b>rabbits</b> used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on <b>rabbits</b> for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. <b>Rabbits</b> are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the medieval}} or post-medieval period, {{the remains of}} the hillfort were used as a rabbit warren which was used to breed <b>rabbits,</b> {{providing}} valuable meat and fur. Many warrens were surrounded by banks or walls to prevent the <b>rabbits</b> from escaping; escaped <b>rabbits</b> caused damage to nearby farmland and meant a loss in profit. The warren at Dolebury is completely enclosed by the substantial ramparts of the Iron Age hill fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed <b>rabbits.</b> The presence of pillow mounds and vermin traps demonstrate man's management of the site for husbandry. Ridge and furrow agriculture has also been identified, from aerial photographs, within the fort. Some of these structures, along with earlier Iron Age features, have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for lead, ochre or calamine. The site was described by John Leland in the 16th century. A three-storey building, believed to be the warrener's house and possibly a watch tower, surrounded by a garden, was in ruins by 1830.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} importance of <b>rabbit</b> as an animal model in pharmacological studies like investigating placental transfer of therapeutic IgGs, {{little is known}} about the molecular interaction of the <b>rabbit</b> neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) with <b>rabbit</b> and human IgG molecules. We analyzed the interactions of the <b>rabbit</b> and human FcRn with <b>rabbit</b> and human IgG isotypes using surface plasmon resonance assay. Similar to FcRn of other species, <b>rabbit</b> FcRn functions in pH-dependent manner, as it binds IgGs at pH 6. 0, but no binding occurs at pH 7. 4. We also showed that <b>rabbit</b> FcRn binds <b>rabbit</b> IgG and human IgG 1 with nearly identical affinity, whereas it has stronger interactions with the other human IgG isotypes. The similar affinity of <b>rabbit</b> IgG and human IgG 1 for <b>rabbit</b> FcRn was confirmed by in vitro FcRn-mediated recycling assay.
