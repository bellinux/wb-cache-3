50|$|Some Pichia representatives can {{be found}} in raw milk and cheese, such as P. anomala (formerly named Hansenula anomala). P. anomala has been shown to combat the {{undesirable}} mold Aspergillus flavus, which contaminates food sources such as tree nuts and corn, and produces aflatoxins. Researchers of the Agricultural Research Service found that when pistachio trees were treated with P. anomala, the growth of A. flavus was inhibited up to 97%. In addition to inhibiting A. flavus, the yeast may also help protect other agricultural crops from unwanted molds that affect the crop’s taste, texture, yield, and safety. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100127.htm In smeared-surface <b>ripened</b> <b>cheese,</b> the most important species is P. membranifaciens that also occurs on cream cheese. The formation of a so-called pellicle is typical. Another member of the genus, P. pastoris, is widely used in molecular biology and biotechnology as an expression system.

50|$|Kalari (Dogri: कलाड़ी or کلاڑی) is a {{traditional}} <b>ripened</b> <b>cheese</b> product indigenous to Rajouri, Poonch and Udhampur of Jammu province of Jammu and Kashmir state of India. It is a very dense cheese that is usually sautéd in its own fat and salted while serving. Kalaris are usually made from cow's or buffalo's milk, though kalaris made from goat's milk are also available, and have a whitish color. Traditionally Kalaris are made from raw (uncooked) full fat milk that is separated using soured milk. The solidified part is packed in doonas (small bowls made of leaves) and sun dried. The excess liquid drips down from the semi-porous doonas and rest of the moisture is lost by sun drying. As the ambient temperature is low {{and the sun is}} strong in the mountains, the Kalari becomes dry from outside yet retains moisture from inside. Some times fungus grows on this and gives it a unique flavor. The taste of kalari prepared in the three regions of the state is different from each other. The Gujjar Bakarwal herders are known to make this cheese.|$|E

Very few {{differences were found}} between two batches of cheese analysed during 150 d of ripening. Fully <b>ripened</b> <b>cheese</b> contained a total of log 7. 7 cfu g- 1 mesophilic bacteria, log 4. 6 cfu g- 1 presumptive enterococci and log 4. 0 cfu g- 1 presumptive staphylococci.

Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. plantarum, L. casei and L. reuteri were identified during ripening; the thermophilic strains were probably derived from the natural starter used, the others were probably components of the adventitious microflora. Urea-PAGE electrophoresis of the water-insoluble fraction and the Reverse Phase-HPLC of the ethanol-soluble sub-fractions were good indices of cheese-ripening time.
