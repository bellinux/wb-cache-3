40|$|The article {{deals with}} a {{development}} of electrochemical method <b>of</b> <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> oils in order of its application for the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> products, which forms at storage, transporting and usage of cooling-lubricant oils. The authors of this work have considered the process of anodic oxidation of carbonic acids and {{made an effort to}} ground the sequence of its proceeding. In particular, using the polarization curves obtained, it was shown, that process of electrochemical anodic oxidation is controlled by the stage of diffusion of initial materials to the electrode. Also the diffusive mechanism is confirmed by direct dependence of maximum diffusive current of electro-oxidation of carbonic acids as a function of concentration of solutions. The authors of the article explored dependence of the maximum current as a function of molecular mass of acid and have shown, that with the growth of molecular mass the maximum current decreases, the phenomena is explained by reduction in the same sequence the diffusion coefficient. The process <b>of</b> electrochemical <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> hydrocarbon mediums at oxidation is determined by the transition of organic acids backwards into hydrocarbons and takes place quickly {{with a high degree of}} transformation - 60 - 70 %. Conclusions done by O. B. Ilchak and professor V. M.

40|$|UnrestrictedPetroleum is an {{essential}} natural resource used {{as the source of}} energy and raw material for almost all industries. It is also a non-renewable resource and not easily accessible in most cases. Today, as the global petroleum reserves are becoming increasingly scarce due to the rapid industrialization, the price of petroleum and products used petroleum as base materials will inevitably escalate and negatively impact on our economy. Moreover, the environmental impacts associated with petroleum exploration have increasingly become critical issues of global concern. In order to conserve petroleum resource and reduce petroleum drilling, the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> petroleum-based materials for beneficial reuse and the utilization of renewable resources as base materials to substitute petroleum are two necessary actions toward a sustainable earth.; Lubricants, either mineral-based or synthetic made, are the products derived from petroleum and developed through tribological research. Lubricants are essential elements for modern industries to perform not only for lubrication of moving parts in machines, engines, and vehicles; but also for many other functions, such as cooling, noise and vibration reduction, cleaning, corrosion protection, and power transfer.; However, lubricants require change after long service because the various impurities generated from the operation may degrade the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> and significantly contaminate lubricants. Each year over two billion gallons <b>of</b> used <b>lubricants</b> are generated around the world and expected to generate more due to worldwide increased demand in lubricants.; Many studies have confirmed that used petroleum-based lubricants collected from oil-change are slow in degradation and highly toxic to human health, fauna, and flora. Because the disposal <b>of</b> used <b>lubricants</b> is becoming a global concern, it is important to study the potential impacts <b>of</b> used <b>lubricants</b> on human health, animals, plants, and the environment in order to raise public awareness for proper handling in order to prevent them being released to the environment.; On the other hand, used lubricant also contains a significant amount of heating value. Hydrocarbon compounds in used lubricants can be regenerated into either lubricant base materials or an energy source. The <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> used <b>lubricants</b> has enormous benefits, including minimizing hazards, reducing waste, protecting the environment, conserving natural resources, and creating an energy source as the energy shortage is becoming a global problem.; The mission of this research is to (1) help the world to reduce used lubricants by regenerating them into an economically competitive energy resource through a sustainable technology and to (2) evaluate and promote the utilization of renewable source, such as plant oils, as green alternatives in lubricant applications. Both are essential to creating a sustainable earth as the ultimate goal of this research.; The binary solvent process, the binary system matrix, and the Cold-Stage Energy Conversion (CSEC) system are the newly developed technologies and products during this four-year research endeavor. The engineering approach and the supporting concepts are presented along with the development of the process and products in this dissertation.; The potential of the binary solvent process in used lubricants purification and hydrocarbon compounds recovery is discussed and reviewed. It has been demonstrated to be a promising technology capable of removing up to 93 % of impurities while recovering up to 99 % of hydrocarbon compounds from various types <b>of</b> used <b>lubricants</b> under atmospheric pressure and at a relatively low temperature. Moreover, environmental sustainability and economic feasibility are two significant designs in this process. All reagents used for this process can be recycled and reused indefinitely.; The binary system matrix is an analytical method designed to enhance the efficiency of the binary solvent process. CSEC system is built based on the concept of binary solvent process and capable <b>of</b> regenerating used <b>lubricants</b> in a continuous-flow fashion at relatively low temperature operated under atmospheric pressure. All these advantages lead to cost saving on less maintenance and easy to handle.; The benefits of new generation <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> made from the renewable resources is reviewed and discussed. This dissertation focus on the research of using plant oils as lubricant feedstock. The compositions of different plant oil are unique, many factors, such as climate, soil, and season, have played major contributing roles in the difference. Balancing the resources and the industrial use offers a major challenge in sustainable resource management. The adaptive management is becoming the key to achieving this balance. The use of animal fats or grease as lubricant base materials is no longer practical due to undesirable properties of most animal fats and the concern of society regarding animal welfare issues.; As the concern about the environment compatibility <b>of</b> petroleum-based <b>lubricant</b> is on the rise, lubricants made from plant oils are easily biodegradable; renewable and genetically changeable; less hazardous to human health, fauna, and flora; more stable with temperature change; and safer to use.; In the end, this dissertation presents the recommendations for the future improvements in CSEC system as well as the plans towards the future development <b>of</b> biodegradable <b>lubricants</b> derived from sources that do not compete with food sources, such as ocean phytoplankton or biomass waste...|$|R

However, it was found from past researches that, at the predefined mileage or timeframe, most lubricant is still acceptably usable and efficient. Approach: This research aimed to calculate useful life <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> {{in order to reach}} its maximum usefulness. The method of study began by collecting data that indicates deterioration <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> by increasing mileage which includes total base number, viscosity, iron and flash point.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} maintenance <b>of</b> industrial <b>lubricants</b> for chemical plant investigated appropriate maintenance through condition monitoring <b>of</b> the <b>lubricants,</b> in particular autoxidation of base oil as the major degradation process. Changes in chemical and physical properties caused by the autoxidation of hydrocarbons were considered in terms of reaction sequence. The roles of antioxidants for maintaining the quality <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> were also considered. The reaction mechanism suggested the importance <b>of</b> antioxidants in <b>lubricants</b> during service. Therefore, a new method to diagnose consumption of antioxidant was required. Organic peroxides are reactive species generated during the autoxidation of hydrocarbons at the initial stage and can be quantitatively analyzed by iodometric titration. The peroxide value (POV) is proposed as a new parameter to monitor conditions <b>of</b> <b>lubricants.</b> The POV trace was examined by a model oxidation test <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> in the laboratory.
