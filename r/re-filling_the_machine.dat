5000|$|Further {{waves of}} [...] "Counter-Reformation art" [...] {{occurred}} when areas formerly Protestant were again brought under Catholic rule. The churches were normally empty of images, and such periods could represent a boom time for artists. The best known {{example is the}} new Spanish Netherlands (essentially modern Belgium), which had been the centre of Protestantism in the Netherlands but became (initially) exclusively Catholic after the Spanish drove the Protestants to the north, where they established the United Provinces. Rubens {{was one of a}} number of Flemish Baroque painters who received many commissions, and produced several of his best known works <b>re-filling</b> <b>the</b> empty churches. [...] Several cities in France in the French wars of religion and in Germany, Bohemia and elsewhere in the Thirty Years War saw similar bursts of restocking.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of each cycle, air must be pulled into the combustion zone. At the end of each cycle, the tailpipe must be reloaded with air from the surrounding atmosphere. Both of these basic actions are accomplished by a significant drop in pressure that occurs naturally after the deflagration expansion, a phenomenon known as the Kadenacy effect (named after the scientist who first fully described it). This temporary low pressure opens the metal valve and draws in the intake air (or air/fuel mixture). It also causes a reversal of flow in the tailpipe that draws fresh air forward to <b>re-fill</b> <b>the</b> pipe. When the next deflagration occurs, the rapid pressure rise slams the valve shut very quickly, ensuring that almost no explosion mass exits in the forward direction so the expansion of the combustion gases will all be used to accelerate the replenished mass of air in the long tailpipe rearward.|$|R
50|$|During this phase, too, {{there is}} a {{difference}} in action between the very different masses in the intake and tailpipe. The intake air mass is again fairly low, but it now almost totally consists of outside air; therefore, fresh air is available almost immediately to begin <b>re-filling</b> <b>the</b> combustion zone from the front. The tailpipe air mass is also pulled, eventually reversing direction as well. The tailpipe will never be completely purged of hot combustion gases, but at reversal it will be easily able to pull in fresh air from all sides around the tailpipe opening, so its contained mass will be gradually increasing until the next deflagration event. As air flows rapidly into the combustion zone, the rarefaction wave is reflected rearward by the front of the engine body, and as it moves rearward the air density in the combustion zone naturally rises until the pressure of the air/fuel mixture reaches a value where deflagration can again commence.|$|R

Several aerodynamic systems {{have been developed for}} use on bicycles but few have been designed to be truly aerodynamic or easy to use. This project focused on the design and development of a frame mounted hydration system for cycling and triathlon that offered improvements in usability and aerodynamic performance over the current market solutions. A wind tunnel test validated a viable location on to place the fluid reservoir. Product specifications were derived from consumer needs and concepts were generated to fulfill those needs. Several iterations of CAD models of the entire product were made.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that energy metabolism is disturbed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and animal models. Treatment with triheptanoin, the triglyceride of heptanoate, is a promising approach to provide alternative fuel to improve oxidative phosphorylation and aid ATP generation.

50|$|It takes decades for {{sea turtles}} to reach sexual maturity. Mature turtles may migrate {{thousands}} of miles to reach breeding sites. After mating at sea, adult female sea turtles return to land to lay their eggs. Different species of sea turtles exhibit various levels of philopatry. In the extreme case, females return to the beach where they hatched. This can take place every {{two to four years}} in maturity.The mature nesting female hauls herself onto the beach, nearly always at night, and finds suitable sand in which to create a nest. Using her hind flippers, she digs a circular hole 40 to 50 cm deep. After the hole is dug, the female then starts filling the nest with her clutch of soft-shelled eggs. Depending on the species, a typical clutch may contain 50-350 eggs. After laying, she <b>re-fills</b> <b>the</b> nest with sand, re-sculpting and smoothing the surface, and then camouflaging the nest with vegetation until it is relatively undetectable visually. The whole process takes thirty to sixty minutes. She then returns to the ocean, leaving the eggs untended.|$|R
5000|$|The Entracque Power Plant, {{also known}} as The Upper Gesso Plant, is a pumped-storage {{hydroelectric}} power station located in Valle Gesso just south of Entracque, Italy. The power station contains pump-generators for two co-located but hydraulically separated power schemes; the Chiotas-Piastra Plant and Rovina-Piastra Plant. Both plants use separate upper reservoirs but use Lago della Piastra as their common lower reservoir. To produce power, water is released from the upper reservoirs to the power station located at the lower reservoir. <b>The</b> pump-generators <b>re-fill</b> <b>the</b> reservoirs and the process repeats as needed. The Chiotas' upper reservoir, Lago del Chiotas, is located much higher in the valley and larger than Rovina's Lago della Rovina which affords it the ability to produce more electricity. The installed capacity of Chiotas is [...] with a hydraulic head (water drop in elevation) of 1048 m while Rovina has an installed capacity of [...] and a head of 598 m.

40|$|Phytoplankton assemblages in two Sicilian water {{bodies were}} {{compared}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that colonization events and the successful establishment of a new species in an aquatic ecosystem may depend on the number of water bodies in a given area and on their relative distance. The two ecosystems are both natural, shallow lakes and they are protected sites hosting a rich avifauna. Lake Biviere di Gela is located in an area with a high density of ponds, whereas Lake Pergusa is an isolated waterbody without other aquatic ecosystems in its surroundings. Both lakes had almost disappeared about 10 years ago because of the overexploitation of their main inflows. They were therefore re-filled using water from other catchments and their phytoplankton has been sampled since their <b>re-filling.</b> <b>The</b> results show that Lake Pergusa has maintained a species-poor phytoplankton assemblage since its refilling, whereas Lake Biviere di Gela has been showing progressively richer phytoplankton assemblages during time. The composition of samples collected in nearby located temporary ponds suggests that phytoplankton in this area belongs to a species-rich metacommunity which favored its re-establishment in the lake. Aquatic ecosystems conservation plans cannot thus neglect the role of small waters located in the catchments...|$|R

The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance: [...] "... take a lamp full of linseed oil and fill the lamp with the oil and light the lamp. Then place it, lit, under a thoroughly clean pan and make sure that the flame from the lamp is two or three fingers {{from the bottom of the}} pan. The smoke that comes off the flame will hit the bottom of the pan and gather, becoming thick.

40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to cause well Dixie Federal 45 - 14 to flow by {{reducing}} the wellbore pressure opposing possible producing formation. Such pressure reduction was accomplished by using a Magcobar air compressor to lift the water column out of the wellbore. Three series of efforts using this method were performed. The conclusions from these last attempts to flow Dixie Federal 45 - 14 were: (1) the massive water entry at 5820 - 5870 feet was shut off; (2) the compressor, with some help from the mud pumps, was able to virtually clear the wellbore of water above the point of air injection; (3) despite evacuating water from the wellbore to as deep as 7500 feet, the Dixie Federal 45 - 14 had insufficient permeability to commence flowing on its own as of 7 - 8 - 79. The possible benefits of temperature equilibration or other time adjustments within the prospective interval below 8000 feet may include eventual capacity to flow. This potential will be evaluated with future flow attempts; and (4) there is some small liquid entry somewhere between 6290 and 9022 feet which caused the air compressor to go through very long (3 - 4 hour) cycles of unloading and slowly <b>re-filling</b> <b>the</b> wellbore...|$|R
