40|$|To {{close the}} gap between {{knowledge}} level and symbol level, we present MODEL-K, a language that allows both, to specify KADS conceptual models and to extend them to operational systems.

40|$|Our {{motivation}} {{is to develop}} an automated technique for the segmentation of subcortical human brain structures from MR images. To this purpose, models of shapeand- appearance are constructed and fit to new image data. The statistical models are trained from 317 manually labelled T 1 -weighted MR images. Shape is modelled using a surface-based point distribution model (PDM) such that the shape space is constrained to the linear combination of the mean shape and eigenvectors of the vertex coordinates. In addition, to model intensity at the structural boundary, intensities are sampled along the surface normal from the underlying image. We propose a novel Bayesian appearance model whereby the relationship between shape and intensity are modelled via the conditional distribution of intensity given shape. Our fully probabilistic approach {{eliminates the need for}} arbitrary weightings between shape and intensity as well as for tuning parameters that specify the relative contribution between the use of shape constraints and intensity information. Leave-one-out crossvalidation is used to validate the model and fitting for 17 structures. The PDM for shape requires surface parameterizations of the volumetric, manual labels such that vertices <b>retain</b> a one-to-one <b>correspondence</b> across the training subjects. Surface parameterizations with correspondence are generated through the use of deformable models under constraints that embed the correspondence criterion within the deformation process. A novel force that favours equal-area triangles throughout the mesh is introduced. The force adds stability to the mesh such that minimal smoothing or within-surface motion is required. The use of the PDM for segmentation across a series of subjects results in a set surfaces that <b>retain</b> point <b>correspondence.</b> The correspondence facilitates landmarkbased shape analysis. Amongst other metrics, vertex-wise multivariate statistics and discriminant analysis are used to investigate local and global size and shape differences between groups. The model is fit, and shape analysis is applied to two clinical datasets. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Volumetric {{registration}} of brains {{is required for}} inter-subject studies of functional and anatomical data. Intensity-driven registration typically results in some degree of misalignment of cortical and gy-ral folds. Increased statistical power in group studies may be achieved through improved alignment of cortical areas by using sulcal landmarks. In this paper we describe a new volumetric registration method in which cortical surfaces and sulcal landmarks are accurately aligned. We first compute a one-to-one map between the two cortical surfaces constrained {{by a set of}} user identified sulcal curves. We then extrapolate this map-ping from the cortical surface to the entire brain volume using a harmonic mapping procedure. Finally, this volumetric mapping is refined using an intensity driven linear elastic registration. The resulting maps <b>retain</b> the one-to-one <b>correspondence</b> between cortical surfaces while also aligning volumetric features via the intensity-driven registration. We evaluate per-formance of this method in comparison to other volumetric registration methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Communication theorists {{often make}} a {{distinction}} between two different ways in which a sign or a symbol can evoke meaning. In digital representation, the symbol's domain of reference is conceptually carved up into discrete units represented by purely arbitrary symbols. In analogical representation, the symbol <b>retains</b> a continuous <b>correspondence</b> with one or more dimensions of its referent. Recent scholarship has tended to emphasize the digital side, but this paper draws attention to aspects of analogical representation, arguing that the mental process through which viewers derive meaning from pictures is often based on implicit analogical thinking. Analogical thinking seems {{to play a major role}} in the evocation of meaning through e!jstract qualities and the control of the viewer's emotional engagement through point of view. The most obvious locus of analogical significance in film and television may be in editing. Analogical implications are central to a wide array of visual devices, and it is possible that in learning to make sense of visual communication, we also acquire an enhanced facility in analogical thinking.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the past}} several centuries, {{chemistry}} has permeated virtually every facet of human lifestyle, enriching fields as diverse as medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, warfare, and electronics, among numerous others. Unfortunately, application-specific, incompatible chemical information formats and representation strategies have emerged {{as a result of}} such diverse adoption of chemistry. Although a number of efforts have been dedicated to unifying the computational representation of chemical information, disparities between the various chemical databases still persist and {{stand in the way of}} cross-domain, interdisciplinary investigations. Through a common syntax and formal semantics, Semantic Web technology offers the ability to accurately represent, integrate, reason about and query across diverse chemical information. Results Here we specify and implement the Chemical Entity Semantic Specification (CHESS) for the representation of polyatomic chemical entities, their substructures, bonds, atoms, and reactions using Semantic Web technologies. CHESS provides means to capture aspects of their corresponding chemical descriptors, connectivity, functional composition, and geometric structure while specifying mechanisms for data provenance. We demonstrate that using our readily extensible specification, it is possible to efficiently integrate multiple disparate chemical data sources, while <b>retaining</b> appropriate <b>correspondence</b> of chemical descriptors, with very little additional effort. We demonstrate the impact of some of our representational decisions on the performance of chemically-aware knowledgebase searching and rudimentary reaction candidate selection. Finally, we provide access to the tools necessary to carry out chemical entity encoding in CHESS, along with a sample knowledgebase. Conclusions By harnessing the power of Semantic Web technologies with CHESS, it is possible to provide a means of facile cross-domain chemical knowledge integration with full preservation of data correspondence and provenance. Our representation builds on existing cheminformatics technologies and, by the virtue of RDF specification, remains flexible and amenable to application- and domain-specific annotations without compromising chemical data integration. We conclude that the adoption of a consistent and semantically-enabled chemical specification is imperative for surviving the coming chemical data deluge and supporting systems science research. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{acute and}} {{permanent}} effects of noise exposure on the endocochlear potential (EP) and cochlear lateral wall were evaluated in BALB/cJ (BALB) inbred mice, and compared with CBA/J (CBA) and C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice. Two-hour exposure to broadband noise (4 – 45  kHz) at 110  dB SPL {{leads to a}} ~ 50  mV reduction in the EP in BALB and CBA, but not B 6. EP reduction in BALB and CBA is reliably associated with characteristic acute cellular pathology in stria vascularis and spiral ligament. By 8  weeks after exposure, the EP in CBA mice has returned to normal. In BALBs, however, the EP remains depressed by an average ~ 10  mV, so that permanent EP reduction contributes to permanent threshold shifts in these mice. We recently showed that the CBA noise phenotype in part reflects {{the influence of a}} large effect quantitative trait locus on Chr. 18, termed Nirep (Ohlemiller et al., Hear Res 260 : 47 – 53, 2010 b). While CBA “EP susceptibility” alleles are dominant to those in B 6, examination of (B 6 [*]×[*]BALB) F 1 hybrid mice and (F 1 [*]×[*]BALB) N 2 backcross mice revealed that noise-related EP reduction and associated cell pathology in BALBs are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and are dependent on multiple genes. Moreover, while N 2 mice formed from B 6 and CBA <b>retain</b> strong <b>correspondence</b> between acute EP reduction, ligament pathology, and strial pathology, N 2 s formed from B 6 and BALB include subsets that dissociate pathology of ligament and stria. We conclude that the genes and cascades that govern the very similar EP susceptibility phenotypes in BALB and CBA mice need not be the same. BALBs appear to carry alleles that promote more pronounced long term effects of noise on the lateral wall. Separate loci in BALBs may preferentially impact stria versus ligament...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Guaranteeing bounded {{resource}} {{consumption of}} mobile code is one important facet {{of improving the}} security of distributed, decentralised systems. To achieve an independent verification of resource properties we employ a proof-carrying-code approach: the mobile code is sent together with a certificate that can be checked by the consumer before executing the code. In our case, the certificate makes a statement about the resource consumption, in particular its memory consumption, and has {{the form of a}} condensed formal proof. In this document we outline the proof-carrying code infrastructure that is being developed in the MRG project. We discuss the foundational work of developing a program logic that is powerful enough to express intensional properties of resource consumption on a JVM-like machine, yet simple enough to enable the application of automated theorem proving tools. This logic has been encoded in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, and it has been proven sound and complete. The infrastructure is built on the Grail intermediate language, an abstraction over a subset of the JVM bytecode language to facilitate formalisation while <b>retaining</b> a close <b>correspondence</b> to JVM’s cost model. For Grail an operational semantics is defined, {{and on top of that}} a VDM-style program logic is built that additionally tracks resource consumption such as execution time. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the thesis is to analyse through the case study of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) how did the {{environmental}} NGOs respond to the state level cooperation in the Arctic in the 1990 s. Time frame of the thesis ranges from 1989 to 1998; from the preparations for the first state-level meeting on the Arctic environmental cooperation until {{the establishment of the}} Arctic Council and accreditation of WWF as permanent observer. The thesis analyses how WWF saw the Arctic cooperation, how the Arctic states reacted to WWF’s aspirations to be included, and how WWF pursued a role in the cooperation. Moreover, the purpose of this thesis is, through examining the case of WWF in the Arctic state-level cooperation, to contribute to the research of NGOs acting and pursuing participation in the state-level cooperation forums. The source material of the thesis can be divided into three categories: archive materials; journals; and declarations, documents and strategies of the Arctic cooperation forums. The main archive materials are from the Archives of the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, <b>retaining</b> memorandums, reports, <b>correspondence</b> between officials, diplomats and representatives of NGOs, minutes, and documents. The main publication that {{has been used as a}} source is the WWF Arctic Program’s publication Arctic Bulletin. In addition, declarations, strategies and various documents from WWF and Arctic cooperation forums have been used to supplement the archive materials and Arctic Bulletin. Through the source materials different views and strategies of WWF have been examined alongside with the views of Arctic states on WWF’s role in the cooperation. The analytical frame has been constructed against non-governmental organizations acting in the state-level cooperation. The analytical frame is also closely connected to the use of soft-law arrangements in international cooperation as one of their justifications is the inclusion of non-state actors, including NGOs. Through combining methodological features of a case study with the analytical frame of the thesis, the aim has been to present a single-case study on NGO participation in the Arctic cooperation, focusing on a crucial case of WWF. In addition, the case study approach has been supplemented with source criticism, and some characteristics of the social network analysis have been employed in order to indicate the interconnectedness of the actors in the Arctic. The outcomes of this thesis reflect the situation of NGOs in the international cooperation. While the states are willing to acknowledge the NGOs as part of civil society and their role as bridges between the governance and civil society their official inclusion is often a different thing. As the states were in the place to decide who was included to the Arctic cooperation forums, WWF had to make strategic decisions in order to better its situation and secure its inclusion to the official forums. WWF tied alliances with other actors, namely the indigenous peoples’ organizations, but it also had to be cautious in its statements. The central conclusion of the thesis is that the situation of NGOs is still complicated especially in a region such as the Arctic, which is becoming one of the hot points of world politics. One the one hand WWF was expected to fulfill its role as a NGO and on the other it had to be moderate enough in its statements in order to secure its status in the cooperation forums. As the case study of WWF in the Arctic cooperation indicates, the states are open to include non-state actors to the cooperation forums, as long as they are not too hostile towards their respective interests...|$|R
40|$|Donald J. P. Ziraldo, C. M., BSc., LLD {{was born}} in St. Catharines, Ontario on October 13, 1948 to Fredrick and Irma (Schiratti) Ziraldo. He {{graduated}} Denis Morris High School in St. Catharines in 1967, and received his B. Sc. in Agriculture at the University of Guelph in 1971. In 1974, Ziraldo was running Ziraldo Nurseries when he met Austrian born schoolteacher, chemist and winemaker Karl J. Kaiser. They {{realized that there was}} a gap in the premium varietal wine market and decided to plant a premium traditional European variety of grape vine species, the Vitis vinifera. This was an innovation in the Niagara region because the current wine producers were not using premium European grapes at the time. Ziraldo and Kaiser founded and then formally incorporated Inniskillin Wines Inc. in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario on July 31, 1975. Ziraldo successfully lobbied General George Kitching, CEO of the LCBO, for a winery license. In 1975, Kitching granted him a winery license, the first in Ontario since Prohibition ended. From the beginning, there was a division of labour where Kaiser focused on the winemaking and Ziraldo focused on the marketing and promotion of the wines. Ziraldo also became president of the company. Ziraldo and Kaiser worked on improving their winemaking techniques and promoting their products and company. Ziraldo has been called ‘one of the founding fathers of the Canadian wine industry’, and it is widely acknowledged that both men played a large role in the success and growth of the Canadian wine industry. Together they pioneered the estate winery movement in Canada. A major turning point Inniskillin came in 1984 when Karl Kaiser successfully harvested the first Icewine crop from frozen grapes on the vine and bottled Eiswein Vidal (Icewine). In 1990, Inniskillin received worldwide recognition for this Icewine when their 1989 Vidal Icewine won the most prestigious award in the wine world, the Grand Prix d’Honneur, given at Vinexpo in France. This victory has been called ‘the award heard round the world’ and it launched Inniskillin into the international wine arena. At the same time, this helped lift the profile of Canadian wines in general. Inniskillin not only became Canada’s leading producer of Icewine, but it also became known for producing ‘one of the world’s great wines’. After the 1990 award, Ziraldo began a major public relations campaign to promote Inniskillin and build Icewine into a worldwide brand. He travelled broadly every year to promote the brand and products and networked extensively with politicians, celebrities, chefs, sommeliers, etc. To ensure worldwide and long-term success, Ziraldo introduced Icewine to Asia and the United States which were new markets. He developed a new Icewine glass with George Riedel. Tony Aspler has called Ziraldo ‘Canada’s Wine Ambassador’. Ziraldo was President of Inniskillin Wines Inc. (Niagara) from 1975 to 2006. In 1992, Inniskillin merged with Cartier Wines, and in 1993 Cartier Inniskillin Vintners Inc. merged with T. G. Bright & Co. Limited, forming the new company Vincor International Inc. Inniskillin wines was now a subsidiary of Vincor. Ziraldo became a Director at Vincor International Inc. from 1993 to 2004. From 1989 to the mid 1990 s, Ziraldo also became President of Inniskillin Napa, in Napa Valley, California. Inniskillin purchased Napa Valley vineyards and produced wines under the Terra label. In 1994, Ziraldo set up a subsidiary estate winery of Inniskillin in Oliver, British Columbia which was called Inniskillin Okanagan Vineyards Inc. He became President of the winery. This started as a partnership between Inniskillin and the local Inkameep Indian Band in the Okanagan. In 2006, Ziraldo left Inniskillin and since that time he has been involved in other Icewine related ventures such as running Ziraldo Estate Winery and producing Ziraldo Riesling Icewine 2007. He also is in partnership with the Niagara based Equifera Estate Winery to produce Equifera Icewine. His most recent projects include planting Picolit grapes in his parent’s hometown, in a project called Picolit Di Fagagna and becoming Managing Director of the Senhora Do Convento Port Winery in Portugal. Donald Ziraldo was instrumental {{in the creation of the}} Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) in Ontario and was its founding Chair from 1988 - 1995. The VQA was established as a regulatory and appellation system which secured the quality and origin of Canadian wines made under this system. The VQA designation and bottle label gave the consumer confidence that the wines they were purchasing were 100 % local products. The VQA system was set up first in Ontario and then in British Columbia. The fonds contains materials relating primarily to Donald Ziraldo from 1968 to 2012 (non inclusive). The bulk of the materials include: correspondence, presentations, reports, award information, operation, meeting minutes, advertising and promotional records. Most of the materials were received in folders, while others were loose in boxes. All materials in the folders were kept together to echo the creator’s original order. If the original folders were titled, these original titles were used as much as possible. If the titles were changed substantially, then this was noted in the appropriate Sub Series sections. There may be some folders with repetitive titles because of the original creator titles. All spelling in this document were taken from the records, even if another spelling was suspected. Thus, there may be variations on the spelling.
