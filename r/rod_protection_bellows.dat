50|$|Despite the {{presence}} of a ventilated rib atop the barrel and its outward similarity to the Colt Python, the King Cobra design is based upon that of an earlier Colt model, the venerable Trooper MK V, improved {{with the addition of a}} heavier-duty barrel, full barrel length cylinder ejection <b>rod</b> <b>protection</b> shroud, and the aforementioned thicker solid rib on top of the barrel. The King Cobra was introduced in 1986, discontinued in 1992, and returned to Colt's product line in 1994. Dropped a second time in 1998, it has not been produced since.|$|R

40|$|A novel early {{streamer}} emission (ESE) lightning {{air terminal}} {{system is designed}} and fabricated. By comparing the intercepted artificial lightning striking numbers of the new ESE lightning protection device and the conventional lightning <b>rod</b> (CLR) lightning <b>protection</b> device in laboratory, the effectiveness of intercepting the artificial lightning strokes by the new ESE lightning protection device is superior to that by the conventional lightning <b>rod</b> lightning <b>protection</b> device. A modified Tesla Coil (TC) discharging by powering AC voltage up to 650 kV with the controlled triggering function generator is used to produce simulated lightning strokes. The top tips of both devices in the same horizontal plane are placed at the same distance to the modified TC during all the test processes. Exchanging their positions makes no obvious difference between the recorded results. The test data validate {{the effectiveness of the}} new ESE lightning protection device under the laboratory environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{interaction}} of rocket-triggered lightning with an airport runway lighting {{system has been}} studied. The lighting system included a buried counterpoise with attached vertical ground <b>rods</b> for <b>protection</b> of the series lighting cable from lightning. Experimental data for voltages and currents at various locations in the runway lighting system due to direct lightning strikes are presented along with the causative lightning current. The data include the first measurements of the responses of an underground bare conductor (counterpoise) to direct lightning strikes. These measurements can serve as ground truth for the testing {{of the validity of}} various counterpoise models.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{atmospheric}} electric field distribution is determined {{in the vicinity}} of the Franklin’s lightning <b>protection</b> <b>rod</b> top which is modeled by half-spherical ending. Special emphasis is given to determination of critical atmospheric electric field that leads to break-down at the top of the rod. For the values of external atmospheric electric field that overcome critical value at the rod top, the corona occurs, so linear analysis is not valid any more. In this paper the first Laplace equation for potential is solved, for Franklin lightning <b>protection</b> <b>rod</b> approximated with one half of the prolate rotational ellipsoid in homogeneous earth atmospheric electric field, and the equation itself is solved in the coordinate system of prolate rotational ellipsoid. For that case, electric field along z-axis is determined and especially at the top of the rod. As numerical methods, method of subsections and finite element method are used and the comparison of these two methods is given...|$|R

The design accounted for steam collapse in the core when the fuel element temperature falls below 265°C, coolant vaporization in fuel channels in cold reactor state, and sticking of some emergency <b>protection</b> <b>rods.</b> However, the slow insertion speed of the control rods, together with their design causing localized positive reactivity as the displacer moves through {{the lower part of the}} core, created a number of possible situations where initiation of the EPS could itself cause or aggravate a reactor runaway.|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{determination of}} lightning protection zone {{is an important}} issue in the analysis and design of an appropri-ate lightning protection system. This paper presents a fast and accurate protection zone determination methodology for metallic lightning rod. The methodology is based on Quasi Monte Carlo Integration technique applied to Method of Moments (MoM) solution of Integral Equations. As an example, solution of the integral equation for unknown charge distribution on lightning rod is obtained. The electric field in the region surrounding the rod is then computed and the protection zone plotted accordingly. The effect of the thickness of the <b>rod</b> on the <b>protection</b> zone is also studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{cylindrical}} rod {{composed of}} a uniform mixture of single-wall carbon nanotubes and alumina powders dissolved in paraffin was {{inserted in the center}} of a radio frequency cavity. The com-plex dielectric constant of carbon tubes at various frequencies was measured by a resistance-inductance-capacitance (RLC) meter and a microwave network analyzer. The cylindrical <b>rod</b> benefits the <b>protection</b> of the sample from adsorbing moisture and preventing the rod from filling with air, thus making accuracy experiment values. The real part and the imaginary part of the dielectric con-stants of single-wall carbon nanotubes are, respectively, increase and decrease in magnitudes as frequency increases satisfactorily in complying with the portray from the free electron Drude model...|$|R

The lightning electromagnetic field {{of a nearby}} lightning discharge {{in the case of}} lightning protection using four vertical lightning <b>protection</b> <b>rods</b> was determined in the frequency domain. Unknown current distributions were determined by numerical solving of a system of integral equations of two potentials using the Point Matching Method and polynomial approximation of the current distributions. The influence of the real ground, treated as homogeneous loss half-space of known electrical parameters, expressed through a Sommerfeld integral kernel, was modeled using a new Two-image approximation which gives good results in both near and far fields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The bellows formed of TiNi {{shape memory}} alloy is {{proposed}} as {{a new type of}} seismic <b>protection</b> device. The <b>bellows</b> structure is known to have lower rigidity along the longitudinal direction through effect of its shape. On the other hand, TiNi is known {{to be one of the}} most typical {{shape memory alloy}}s, which have high damping characteristics for dynamics engaged in its twin formation under martensite state and have the ability to recover completely from the large strain (even such as 8 %) after unloaded and or heated. This paper describes a processing method of a single-stage bellows of TiNi shape memory alloy using rubber bulge method. Thin-walled TiNi tubes subjected to cold working were prepared. Several annealing conditions for the process were examined and the appropriate one was discussed. Then the rubber bulge method of displacement control was introduced. Finally, the procedure of the process including heat treatment was clarified...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxic {{preconditioning}} protects photoreceptors against light-induced degeneration preserving retinal morphology and function. Although hypoxia inducible transcription factors 1 and 2 (HIF 1, HIF 2) are {{the main}} regulators of the hypoxic response, photoreceptor protection {{does not depend on}} HIF 1 in rods. Here we used rod-specific Hif 2 a single and Hif 1 a;Hif 2 a double knockout mice to investigate the potential involvement of HIF 2 in <b>rods</b> for <b>protection</b> after hypoxic preconditioning. To identify potential HIF 2 target genes in rods we determined the retinal transcriptome of hypoxic control and rod-specific Hif 2 a knockouts by RNA sequencing. We show that rods do not need HIF 2 for hypoxia-induced increased survival after light exposure. The transcriptomic analysis revealed a number of genes that are potentially regulated by HIF 2 in rods; among those were Htra 1, Timp 3 and Hmox 1, candidates that are interesting due to their connection to human degenerative diseases of the retina. We conclude that neither HIF 1 nor HIF 2 are required in photoreceptors for protection by hypoxic preconditioning. We hypothesize that HIF transcription factors may be needed in other cells to produce protective factors acting in a paracrine fashion on photoreceptor cells. Alternatively, hypoxic preconditioning induces a rod-intrinsic response that is independent of HIF transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Lightning rod {{is widely}} used in {{lightning}} protection systems. It is of practical interest to analyze the protective performance of a lightning rod taking into consideration some stochastic behaviors of the lightning process. The effec-tiveness of a single lightning rod is investigated in this paper using a fractal growth approach based on dielectric breakdwon model (DBM). The effective interception area, the strike distribution on <b>rod</b> and the <b>protection</b> zone of single lightning rods of various heights are calculated. Comparing our results {{with those of the}} rolling sphere method, it is shown that, the fractal approach is able to make reasonable evaluation of the lightning protective performance. New features such as the inherent vulnerability of the rod to lateral strikes and the division of the protection zone into three regions are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) {{begins with}} the death of rod photoreceptors and is slowly {{followed}} by a gradual loss of cones and a rearrangement of the remaining retinal neurons. Clusterin is a chaperone protein that protects cells and is involved in various pathophysiological stresses, including retinal degeneration. Using a well-established transgenic rat model of RP (rhodopsin S 334 ter), we investigated the effects of clusterin on rod photoreceptor survival. To investigate the role of clusterin in S 334 ter-line 3 retinas, Voronoi analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the geometry of rod distribution. Additionally, immunoblot analysis, Bax activation, STAT 3 and Akt phosphorylation were used to evaluate the pathway involved in <b>rod</b> cell <b>protection.</b> In this study, clusterin (10 μg/ml) intravitreal treatment produced robust preservation of rod photoreceptors in S 334 ter-line 3 retina. The mean number of rods in 1 mm 2 was significantly greater in clusterin injected RP retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P 45, P 60, & P 75) than in age-matched saline injected RP retinas (P< 0. 01). Clusterin activated Akt, STAT 3 and significantly reduced Bax activity; in addition to inducing phosphorylated STAT 3 in Müller cells, which suggests it may indirectly acts on photoreceptors. Thus, clusterin treatment may interferes with mechanisms leading to rod death by suppressing cell death through activation of Akt and STAT 3, followed by Bax suppression. Novel insights into the pathway of how clusterin promotes the rod cell survival suggest this treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy to slow progression of vision loss in human RP...|$|R
40|$|Programmed {{molecular}} recognition {{is being developed}} for the bionanofabrication of mixed organic/inorganic supramolecular assemblies for applications in electronics, photonics, and medicine. For example, DNA-based nanotechnology seeks to exploit the easily programmed complementary base-pairing of DNA to direct assembly of complex, designed nanostructures. Optimal solution conditions for bionanofabrication, mimicking those of biological systems, may involve high concentrations of biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, etc.) and significant concentrations of various ions (Mg 2 +, Na +, Cl -, etc.). Given a desire to assemble diverse inorganic components (metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanostructures, etc.), it will be increasingly difficult to find solution conditions simultaneously compatible with all components. Frequently, the use of chemical surfactants is undesirable, leaving a need {{for the development of}} alternative strategies. Herein, we discuss the use of artificial, diblock polypeptides in the role of solution compatibilizing agents for molecular assembly. We describe the use of two distinct diblock polypeptides with affinity for DNA in the stabilization of DNA origami and DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles (spheres and <b>rods)</b> in solution, <b>protection</b> of DNA from enzymatic degradation, as well as two 3 D tetrahedral DNA origamis. We present initial data showing that the diblock polypeptides promote the formation in the solution of desired organic/inorganic assemblies. </p...|$|R
40|$|One simple {{phenomenon}} of electricity {{was known to}} the ancients: that when a piece of amber was rubbed, it acquired the property of attracting small pieces of paper and other light particles. Records show that Thales of Miletus (circa sixth century B. C.) knew of this property of amber; the Greek word for amber is elektron, hence the name electricity. There was practically no further development of this subject until about the seventeenth century. Otto von Guericke (1602 - 1686) of Magdeburg built a large sulphur sphere, which, when rotated about an axis and rubbed with his hand, gave off electric sparks. In the eighteenth century {{it was found that}} there were two kinds of electricity, one similar to the kind acquired by amber when rubbed with wool, and the other similar to that acquired by glass when rubbed with silk, called resinous and vitreous electricity, respectively. They are now known as negative and positive electricity, names first introduced by Benjamin Franklin (1706 - 1790). Franklin made many important contributions to the subject, experimentally and philosophically. He showed the electrical character of lightning and designed lightning <b>rods</b> for the <b>protection</b> of buildings. The subject of electricity was put on a firm mathematical foundation {{as a result of the}} experiments of Coulomb (1785) on the law of force between electrically charged bodies...|$|R
