The whole history of Roma reflects the constant quest to find a "good place for life. " For achieving this goal two possible ways are used consequently or simultaneously. In attempt to secure their well-beings some Roma communities change their place of life and disperse on huge territories throughout the world. Others are creating own organizations and structures in order to negotiate their social position and to conclude social contract defining their place in society with the countries where they live, or in supra- or multinational context. The new realities of United Europe give a new chance to re-negotiate the place of Roma in post-national context. The failure of contemporary European policies towards Roma pose a question if it is possible at all to achieve a Post-national social contract in regard of Roma and if yes, what will be the price for it.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the author}} raises the {{following}} question: What {{is the nature}} of the efforts of Romani elites at political participation in the Czech Republic and what is their potential? He presupposes that those currents of the Roma ethno-emancipation movement that are not defined sharply against the surrounding society are in a better position. He summarizes the basic facts from the history of the Roma in the Czech Republic with an overlap into the Central European context. He monitors the factors relevant to the examination of political acts of the Roma and subsequently characterizes their own understanding of ethnicity, showing that kinship and sub-ethnic groups are more important for the collective identification of most of the Roma. The theoretical part deals with selected authors who participated in the discussions on multiculturalism, both on the general, international, and on the national level, with special focus on Roma issues. In the final chapter the author tries to apply all the described knowledge to the three most significant projects of the Roma, through which the Romani elites engage in public affairs in the Czech Republic. They are the Union of Gypsies- Roma from the break of 1960 s and 1970 s, the <b>Roma</b> <b>Civic</b> Initiative, a party active in the 90 s, and a civic association called [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Roma {{living in}} the Czech Republic spent WWII. in the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, in "Sudety", {{occupied}} by the Germany, in south Slovakia, occupied by the Hungary and in the Slovak Republic. From the first three regions the Roma were gradually deported to internment and concentration camps, in the Slovakia they had to face various suppressions like mass displacement from the villages, forced labour and finally they had {{to hide in the}} forests to protect themselves from Gestapo and Hlinka's guard. In the year 1998 the Czech Roma had the first opportunity to ask for the financial allowance for the suffered distress and torture. Swiss banks deposited 273 million CHF into a special fund, 88 % out of this sum should have been divided to Jews and 12 % to victims without Jewish origin. The fund did not accept any individual requests but cooperated with local organizations. In the Czech Republic it was first and foremost the League for the assistance to Roma war victims, which was founded by the <b>Roma</b> <b>civic</b> initiative in this purpose. The League set a list of about 3000 applicants, who met the requirement of the date of birth before 31 st December 1944, who spent the war-time in the Czechoslovakia and who were able to prove they are socially needy.

The article offers a revision of the widespread belief that Romani movement was born only during the second half of 20 th century. Based on the research of historical sources we will show that it has much older roots. The departing point of the research presented in this article is the circumstance that Roma are not a hermetic social and cultural system. They exist in two dimensions, both as separate ethnic communities and {{as a part of}} the macro-society in which they live within the respective nation-states. Together with members of the macro-society they experienced breakdowns of old Empires and the establishment of national states. Under the conditions of historical turbulences in the period between two World Wars, Roma developed aspirations for civil emancipation, started to be civically engaged and politically institutionalized. On the basis of archival and media sources the article introduces the first manifestation of <b>civic</b> activities of <b>Roma</b> in an attempt to pursue their ethnic and community rights and their visions about their place in society and the future of their nation.

This article presents the history of the politics of multilingualism (or lack thereof) in regard to Roma (formerly known as “Gypsies”). In the 1920 s and 1930 s in the newly established Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, against a backdrop of proclaimed principles of full equality of all peoples living in the new state, commenced a rapid creation of schools for Roma children with instruction in Romani mother-tongue along with special training of Roma teachers. The results achieved were impressive in regard to the general literacy of Roma communities, but nevertheless in 1938 the “Gypsy schools” have been closed and Roma children were enrolled into mainstream schools lacking any elements of multilingualism. After World War II individual countries of Eastern Europe implemented various forms of special education for Roma children, neither of which however with elements of multilingualism. Only after the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe, in the conditions of transition and the subsequent Euro-integration, various singular countries in the region have developed individual elements of multilingualism and educational policies targeting Roma children (e. g. introducing under various forms a Romani language instruction). Sporadically there even appeared proposals for teaching instruction conducted entirely in Roma mother-tongue, which were debated and rejected (including by Roma themselves).

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the research project “RomaInterbellum. <b>Roma</b> <b>Civic</b> Emancipation between the Two World Wars” that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 694656). In 1867 in the Bulgarian newspaper “Macedonia”, printed in Istanbul, was published a reader's letter, signed with the pseudonym “one Egyptian”. At that time, on the Balkans the name "Egyptians" (Γυφτοι, Egyuptsi, Gyupti, etc. in the various Balkan languages) designated a community whose official name in Ottoman-Turkish was Kıptı or Çingene, and whose descendants today self-determine as Roma or Balkan Egyptians. This letter can be understood in the context of ongoing processes of national emancipation of the Balkan peoples, especially {{in the context of the}} struggles of the Bulgarian church community for exiting the Orthodox Christian Patriarchate, which was dominated by the Greek clergy. “One Egyptian” in his letter protests against the stereotypes about the “Egyptians”, which are reflected in the practice of the Orthodox Church, and advocates for the creation of “own” church, “own” language, “own” clergy and in perspective the creation of “own” education and “own society” (i. e. own country). In the proposed presentation will be analyzed the content of this Letter in general social and political context of the time and will be explained its main visionary ideas about the future of the communities that still live in the Balkans and identify themselves respectively as Roma or Balkan Egyptians. Along with this will be revealed the identity of the writer of the letter and his biography. The communities which are heirs of  “one Egyptian” living today in his native town of Prilep (now in the Republic of Macedonia) and their historical consciousness will be presented as well.
