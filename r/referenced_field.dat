40|$|A {{supervised}} classification {{was applied to}} a Landsat TM 5 image. This image was acquired 9 : 40 am, on the 27 th July 2011 (5. 14 am low tide at Brisbane Bar). The image classification was applied on areas of clear waters up to three metres depth and for exposed regions of Moreton Bay. Field validation data was collected at 4797 survey sites by UQ. GPS <b>referenced</b> <b>field</b> data were used as training areas for the image classification process. For this training the substrate DN signatures were extracted from the Landsat 5 TM image for field survey locations of known substrate cover, enabling a characteristic "spectral reflectance signature" to be defined for each target. The Landsat TM image, containing only those pixels in water < 3. 0 m deep, was then subject to minimum distance to means algorithm to group pixels with similar DN signatures (assumed to correspond to the different substrata). This process enabled each pixel to be assigned a label of either seagrass cover (0, 1 - 25 %, 25 - 50 %, 50 - 75 % and 75 - 100 %). The resulting raster data was then converted into a vector polygon file. Species information was added based on the field data and expert knowledge. Both polygon files were joined by overlaying features of remote sensing files with the EHMP field data to produce an output theme that contains the attributes and full extent of both themes. If polygons of remote sensing were within polygons of field data the assumption was made that the remote sensing polygon was showing more detail and the underlying field polygon was deleted...|$|E

40|$|A general mapping-closure {{approach}} for modeling scalar mixing in homogeneous turbulence is developed. This approach {{is different from}} the previous methods in that the <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> also evolves according to the same equations as the physical scalar field. The use of a time-evolving Gaussian <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> results in a model that is similar to the mapping closure model of Pope (1991), which is based on the methodology of Chen et al. (1989). Both models yield identical relationships between the scalar variance and higher-order moments, which are in good agreement with heat conduction simulation data and can be consistent with any type of epsilon(phi) evolution. The present methodology can be extended to any <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> whose behavior is known. The possibility of a beta-pdf <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> is explored.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether the negative effect of complexity on artificial grammar learning could be compensated by adding semantics. Participants {{were exposed to}} exemplars from a simple or a complex finite state grammar presented {{with or without a}} semantic <b>reference</b> <b>field.</b> As expected, performance on a grammaticality judgment test was higher for the simple grammar than for the complex grammar. For the simple grammar, the results also showed that participants presented with a <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> and instructed to decode the meaning of each exemplar (decoding condition) did better than participants who memorized the exemplars without semantic referents (memorize condition). Contrary to expectations, however, {{there was no significant difference}} between the decoding condition and the memorize condition for the complex grammar. These findings indicated that the negative effect of complexity remained, despite the addition of semantics. To clarify how the presence of a <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> influenced the learning process, its effects on the acquisition of two types of knowledge (first- and second-order dependencies) and on participants’ awareness of their knowledge were examined. The results tentatively suggested that the <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> enhanced the learning of second-order dependencies. In addition, participants in the decoding condition realized when they had knowledge relevant to making a grammaticality judgment, whereas participants in the memorize condition demonstrated some knowledge of which they were unaware. These results are in line with the view that the <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> enhanced structure learning by making certain dependencies more salient.

40|$|The galactic cosmic ray (GCR) {{simulator}} at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) {{is intended}} to deliver the broad spectrum of particles and energies encountered in deep space to biological targets in a controlled laboratory setting. In this work, certain aspects of simulating the GCR environment in the laboratory are discussed. <b>Reference</b> <b>field</b> specification and beam selection strategies at NSRL are the main focus, but the analysis presented herein may be modified for other facilities. First, comparisons are made between direct simulation of the external, free space GCR field and simulation of the induced tissue field behind shielding. It is found that upper energy constraints at NSRL limit the ability to simulate the external, free space field directly (i. e. shielding placed in the beam line {{in front of a}} biological target and exposed to a free space spectrum). Second, variation in the induced tissue field associated with shielding configuration and solar activity is addressed. It is found that the observed variation is likely within the uncertainty associated with representing any GCR <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> with discrete ion beams in the laboratory, given current facility constraints. A single <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> for deep space missions is subsequently identified. Third, an approach for selecting beams at NSRL to simulate the designated <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> is presented. Drawbacks of the proposed methodology are discussed and weighed against alternative simulation strategies.

40|$|We {{reconsider the}} topological {{interpretation}} of magnetic helicity for magnetic fields in open domains, and relate {{this to the}} relative helicity. Specifically, our domains stretch between two parallel planes, and each of these ends may be magnetically open. It is demonstrated that, while the magnetic helicity is gauge-dependent, its value in any gauge may be physically interpreted as the average winding number among all pairs of field lines with respect to some orthonormal frame field. In fact, the choice of gauge {{is equivalent to the}} choice of <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> in the relative helicity, meaning that the magnetic helicity is no less physically meaningful. We prove that a particular gauge always measures the winding with respect to a fixed frame, and propose that this is normally the best choice. For periodic fields, this choice is equivalent to measuring relative helicity with respect to a potential <b>reference</b> <b>field.</b> But for aperiodic fields, we show that the potential field can be twisted. We prove by construction that there always exists a possible untwisted <b>reference</b> <b>field.</b> Comment: 31 pages, 8 figures, accepted in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a two-flavor Nambu & Jona-Lasinio model in Hartree approximation involving scalar-isoscalar and pseudoscalar-isovector quark-quark interactions. Average meson fields {{are defined by}} minimizing the effective Euklidean action. The fermionic part of the action, which contains the full Dirac sea, is regularized within Schwinger’s proper-time scheme. The meson fields are restricted to the chiral circle and to hedgehog configurations. The only parameter of the model is the constituent quark mass M which simultaneously controls the regularization. We evaluate meson and quark fields self-consistently in dependence on the constituent quark mass. It is shown that the self-consistent fields do practically {{not depend on the}} constituent quark mass. This allows us to define a properly parameterized <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> which for physically relevant constituent masses {{can be used as a}} good approximation to the exactly calculated one. The <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> is chosen to have correct behaviour for small and large radii.

Also, a synthesis method for conformal arrays based on Huygens' equivalence principle has been developed.

40|$|A novel {{radiation}} detector {{based on an}} artificial single crystal diamond was used to characterize in detail the energy distribution of neutron <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and their contamination with charged particles. The monoenergetic <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> at PTB in the neutron energy range from 1. 5 MeV up to 19 MeV are generated by proton and deuteron beams impinging on solid and gas targets of tritium and deuterium. The energy of the incoming particles and the variation of the angle under which the measurement is performed produce monoenergetic <b>reference</b> <b>fields</b> with different mean energies and line shapes. In this paper we present high resolution neutron spectrometry measurements of different monoenergetic <b>reference</b> <b>fields.</b> The results are compared with calculated spectra {{taking into account the}} actual target parameters. Line structures in the order of 80 keV for a neutron energy of 9 MeV were resolved. The shift of the mean energy and the increasing of the width of the neutron peak with increasing pressure in the gas target in the order of 30 keV were measured. Another result is the determination of the contamination of the neutron field at 14 MeV with high energy charged particles (protons) from side reactions inside the T-target. The experiments have shown that this detector is an easy to operate compact neutron spectrometer with extremely good energy resolution and that detailed structures in the line shapes of monoenergetic neutron fields can be resolved without using time of flight techniques.

40|$|Together {{with the}} {{magnetic}} energy, the magnetic helicity {{is an important}} quantity {{used to describe the}} nature of a magnetic field configuration. In the following, we propose a new technique to evaluate various components of the total magnetic helicity in the corona for an equilibrium reconstructed magnetic field. The most meaningful value of helicity is the total relative magnetic helicity which describes the linkage of the field lines even if the volume of interest is not bounded by a magnetic surface. In addition if the magnetic field can be decomposed into the sum of a closed <b>field</b> and a <b>reference</b> <b>field</b> (following, Berger 1999 in Magnetic Helicity in Space and Laboratory Plasmas, ed. M. R. Brown, R. C. Canfield, & A. A.

We analyse the meaning of the self and mutual helicities: the self and mutual helicities correspond to the twist and writhe of confined flux bundles, and the crossing of field lines in the magnetic configuration respectively. The main result is that the magnetic configuration of AR 8210 is dominated by the mutual helicity and not by the self helicity (twist and writhe).
