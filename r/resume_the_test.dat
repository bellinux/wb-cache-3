2500|$|By {{late summer}} of 1967, the {{modification}} work {{to both the}} D-21 (now designated D-21B) and the B-52Hs were complete. The test program could now <b>resume.</b> <b>The</b> <b>test</b> missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. The first D-21B to be flown was Article 501, the prototype. The first attempt was made on 28 September 1967, and ended in complete failure. As the B-52 was flying toward the launch point, the D-21B fell off the pylon. The B-52H gave a sharp lurch as the drone fell free. The booster fired and was [...] "quite a sight from the ground". The failure was traced to a stripped nut on the forward right attachment point on the pylon. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. However, {{the fact is that}} the resumptions of D-21 tests took place against a changing reconnaissance background. The A-12 had finally been allowed to deploy, and the SR-71 was soon to replace it. At the same time, new developments in reconnaissance satellite technology were nearing operation. Up to this point, the limited number of satellites available restricted coverage to the Soviet Union. A new generation of reconnaissance satellites could soon cover targets anywhere in the world. The satellites' resolution would be comparable to that of aircraft, but without the slightest political risk. Time was running out for the Tagboard.|$|E
40|$|Periodic on-chip scan-based {{tests have}} {{to be applied to}} a many-core {{processor}} SoC to improve its dependability. An infrastructural IP module has been designed and incorporated into the SoC to function as an ATE. This paper introduces the reuse of a Network-on-Chip as a test access mechanism. Since <b>the</b> scan-based <b>test</b> is performed on-chip via the NoC at application run-time, it needs to share the NoC bandwidth with other applications. Instead of reserving sufficient NoC bandwidth for <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> authors propose a novel way to carry out scan-based tests by dynamically pausing and <b>resuming</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> data flow to accommodate the fluctuating communication bandwidth available on <b>the</b> NoC. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> stimuli application and test response collection processes are decoupled to meet the global timing constraint. The many-core processor, IIP and the NoC have been implemented in synthesizable VHDL.

Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before <b>resuming</b> <b>the</b> factory's <b>testing</b> in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> as <b>the</b> first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAgile {{development}} {{processes and}} component-based software architectures are two software engineering approaches {{that contribute to}} enable the rapid building and evolution of applications. Nevertheless, few approaches have proposed a framework to combine agile and component-based development, allowing an application to be <b>tested</b> throughout <b>the</b> entire development cycle. To address this problematic, we have built CALICO, a model-based framework that allows applications to be safely developed in an iterative and incremental manner. The CALICO approach relies on the synchronization of a model view, which specifies the application properties, and a runtime view, which contains the application in its execution context. <b>Tests</b> on <b>the</b> application specifications that require values only known at runtime, are automatically integrated by CALICO into the running application, and the captured needed values are reified at execution time to <b>resume</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> and inform <b>the</b> architect of potential problems. Any modification at the model level that does not introduce new errors is automatically propagated to the running system, allowing the safe evolution of the application. In this paper, we illustrate the CALICO development process with a concrete example and provide information on the current implementation of our framework...|$|R

40|$|A rat {{develops}} {{an aversion}} to the flavor of a solution which is paired with illness. Although it is well established that the rat will avoid consuming this flavor, the actual conditioned response (CR) that it elicits has not been systematically investigated. The following series of experiments present a technique for measuring this CR. The rats were first trained to discriminate between an aversive flavored solution (CS+) which was paired with lithium and a safe flavored solution (CSc) which was presented alone. The CR was then measured by {{the ability of the}} immediate aftereffect of the CS+ flavor to suppress consumption of a differently flavored solution (<b>the</b> <b>test</b> solution). While <b>the</b> rats consumed <b>the</b> <b>test</b> solution, they were intraorally infused with 2 ml of either the CS+ or esc flavored solution; <b>the</b> time to <b>resume</b> drinking and <b>the</b> subsequent rate of licking of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> solution were recorded. [...] All experiments demonstrated that the rats infused with the CS+ flavored solution were more hesitant to <b>resume</b> drinking <b>the</b> <b>test</b> solution than were the rats infused with the esc flavored solution. This CR was evident whether <b>the</b> <b>test</b> solution was unflavored water, a novel flavored solution or a conditioned aversive flavored solution; however, the duration of the CR varied by the nature of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> solution, ranging between 45 and 235 seconds. Finally, the strength of the suppressive CR was influenced by variations of the sickness intensity and the flavor intensity during conditioning. [...] It is unlikely that the CR measured in these experiments is the sole motivator of a flavor aversion, because extinction of the suppressive CR did not even weaken the rats subsequent avoidance of the CS+ flavored solution. The suppressive CR elicited by a lithium-conditioned flavor parallels the suppressive CR elicited by a shock-conditioned external cue...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{dependable}} computing {{systems are}} widely required in mission critical and human-life critical applications. While the advance in CMOS technology enables smaller and faster circuits, the dependability of modern ICs has worsened {{as a result}} of the shrinking dimensions of MOS transistors and the increasing complexity of semiconductor devices. For those very complex SoC with many processor cores, dependability enhancement approaches are especially important. In this thesis we first examine the important attributes of a dependable MPSoC. We then explore the possible approaches to enhance these attributes. The cost of the chosen dependability approach in terms of performance and resource (silicon area/energy) overhead are evaluated. The proposed dependability approach is implemented in silicon and its effectiveness is assessed using experiments and actual measurement results. In the scope of this thesis, the dependability of an MPSoC is defined as its ability to deliver expected services under given conditions. Three important dependability attributes being reliability, availability and maintainability are identified. Reliability denotes the probability that the MPSoC will fail after a certain period of time. For an MPSoC, maintainability refers to the isolation/bypass of faulty components and reconfiguration of the fault-free spare parts to maintain its functionality. Availability denotes the readiness of the MPSoC to provide correct service. The reliability of an MPSoC can be improved by using processor cores as spare. Theoretically, system reliability greatly increases as more cores are used as spares. At the same time, the area overhead for reliability enhancement also increases. Maintainability can be realized by incorporating fault detection and self-repair features into an MPSoC. By dynamically detecting faults and reconfiguring the system to circumvent them, the system can be regarded as functionally correct. with a possible drop in performance. The time spent for fault detection and system repair is combined as system down time. Faster fault detection and repair operations will decrease system down time and enable a highly available MPSoC. The dependability approach proposed in this thesis involves test aiming stuck at faults performed at the processor core level at application run-time. Once detected, faulty resources can be isolated by the so-called resource management software and core-level system repair can be performed by means of resource reconfiguration. In order to validate the feasibility of our dependability approach, a homogeneous MPSoC platform with multiple Xentium processing cores was adopted as the vehicle of our experiment. A stand-alone infrastructural IP block, namely the Dependability Manager (DM), has been designed and integrated into the MPSoC platform. The DM can generate <b>the</b> <b>test</b> vectors for <b>the</b> Xentium cores, broadcast them via a Network-on-Chip and then collect <b>the</b> <b>test</b> responses from <b>the</b> core sunder <b>test.</b> Since <b>the</b> cores under <b>test</b> have identical architecture, a faulty core can be detected by majority-voting <b>the</b> <b>test</b> responses. Dedicated test wrappers and NoC (reused as a TAM) were included into the platform MPSoC as well. A modified scan-based test scheme was used for a back-pressure style test data flow control by pausing and <b>resuming</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> data in <b>the</b> NoC. The MPSoC platform was fabricated as a Reconfigurable Fabric Device using UMC 90 nm CMOS technology. The dependability overhead in terms of silicon area is about 1 %. Experimental results show that <b>the</b> dependability <b>test</b> can be carried out at application run-time without interrupting the function of other applications. The inclusion of the DM into the RFD makes it a maintainable MPSoC with very short stuck-at and memory fault detection time (21 ms) and reasonable MDT (hundreds of milliseconds). In conclusion, our proposed dependability approach and dependability test methods have proven to be feasible and efficient. The successful integration of the DM into the RF D and its correct operation indicate that our dependability approach can be applied to other homogeneous MPSoC platforms for dependability improvement...|$|R
