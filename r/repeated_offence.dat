5000|$|Talking {{about the}} {{incident}} in December 2010, Klein's father said — [...] "It is sad to see him continually punished for what was, in truth, one single word muttered inaudibly over 18 months ago. It was reported inaccurately then and continues to be. The way he was disciplined, you would {{think it was a}} constant, <b>repeated</b> <b>offence.</b> What pains me most is the way that, more than a year later, Brydan's indiscretion is still being dragged up again and again. He didn't actually know what {{the meaning of the word}} 'kaffir' was. He actually heard the South African players say it. He thought it was a swear word, so when he said it, he obviously had no idea what he was saying. He was only 18 years old and the other person didn't even hear it and it didn't really affect the match. I was there, sitting close to where Brydan was as humanly as possible apart from being on the court, and you couldn't hear anything. If you had been there you wouldn't have heard anything either so it's not like he was ranting or raving at his opponent, calling him names and being racist, because he's anything but. One day he will be able to tell the truth but right now he is stuck from telling the truth." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} punishments at VS are the informing of parents, {{confiscation}} and/or receiving scolding for minor <b>offences.</b> For <b>repeated</b> major <b>offences</b> such as playing truant, gambling, vandalism, fighting, smoking, theft, bullying, cheating, possession of pornographic material, or being disrespectful to staff, students are usually suspended, if not expelled for <b>repeated</b> <b>offences.</b> There is general {{support for this}} given the high standards {{of the school and}} low tolerance towards blatant misbehaviour. For a <b>repeat</b> of minor <b>offences</b> such as inappropriate hairstyles and being late consecutively, the student's conduct grade recorded in the report card may be reduced, for example from [...] "Very Good" [...] to [...] "Good" [...] or [...] "Fair".|$|R

50|$|Consumption {{of alcohol}} (one glass) is punished by 80 lashes, but <b>repeated</b> <b>offences</b> {{may lead to}} death penalty {{although}} rarely exercised. In 2012, two men were sentenced to death after a third offense in Khorasan.

Most drinking cases are settled through tazir punishments (e.g. imprisonment and/or fines) rather than whipping.|$|R

50|$|The {{harm done}} to the emotional, mental and social {{development}} of incarcerated youth, combined with the separation from family and community and the congregation of offenders makes previous incarceration the leading indicator for a <b>repeat</b> <b>offence</b> among young offenders. It is a greater predictor even than weapon possession, gang membership and bad relationships with parents. What these studies tell us is that, far from increasing the public safety and curbing youth crime, detaining and incarcerating young offenders is actually leading to more criminality among youth, and more serious crimes.|$|R
50|$|While Nigalizde {{originally}} denied {{owning the}} devices, the smart phone was logged {{into one of}} his social networking account and his current position was displayed on a program. He was expelled from the tournament. The rules of FIDE strictly prohibit players from using electronic devices capable of communication or analysis during a game, with bans of up to 3 years for a first offence and up to 15 years for a <b>repeat</b> <b>offence.</b> He was subsequently banned for 3 years (until September 2018) and his grandmaster title was revoked.

50|$|Skye's Law is an {{informal}} {{name for the}} Crimes Amendment (Police Pursuits) Act 2010 of New South Wales, Australia. It is named after the 19-month old toddler Skye Sassine, who was killed on 31 December 2009 when her family's car {{was hit by a}} driver suspected of armed robbery who was trying to evade police. The driver in that case was convicted of her manslaughter, but Skye's Law makes police pursuit a specific offence in itself, with prison terms of up to three years, or up to five years for <b>repeat</b> <b>offences.</b> The offence is committed if the driver is aware of the pursuit, fails to stop and then drives recklessly or dangerously. The law {{takes the form of a}} new section 51B inserted into the Crimes Act 1900 by the 2010 Act.|$|R

25|$|The PRC's revised Criminal Law of 1997 {{retains its}} {{abolitionist}} focus {{in that it}} is primarily concerned with criminalising third-party involvement in prostitution. For the first time the death penalty may be used, but only in exceptional cases of organising prostitution activities, involving additional circumstances such as <b>repeated</b> <b>offences,</b> rape, causing serious bodily injury, etc. The activities of first-party participants continue to be regulated in practice according to administrative law, with the exceptions of anyone who sells or buys prostitutional sex in the full knowledge that they are infected with an STD; and anyone who has prostitutional sex with a child under 14 years of age. Since 2003, male homosexual prostitution has also been prosecuted under the law.|$|R
50|$|Relevant {{offences}} {{under the}} Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 are Defilement {{of a child}} aged under 17 years and Defilement of a child aged under 15 years. Sentences are longer for the latter <b>offence,</b> for <b>repeat</b> <b>offences</b> and where the offender is an authority-figure such as a close relative or teacher. Mistake as to the child's age is a valid defence if the mistake is honest and reasonable. Girls under 18 cannot be convicted for heterosexual vaginal sex. Offenders are placed on the sex offender registry unless less than 24 months older than the victim. Sex between spouses is not criminalised, although spouses under 18 are rare since the Family Law Act, 1995.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{international}} conventions that affect youth justice, most significantly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1990 (UNCROC), which New Zealand ratified in 1993.

The latest UN recommendations in response to this has expressed concern about the low age of criminal responsibility, and that NZ has lowered it from 14 to 12 for grave and <b>repeated</b> <b>offences.</b> There is also concern that CYPTFA only extends youth justice protections to 17 years, where UNCROC has defined a [...] "child" [...] up unto 18 years. Once young people turn 17, they are dealt with in adult courts, although age can be taken as a mitigating factor.|$|R

50|$|The Soviet Decree of 27 June 1936 {{prohibited}} {{the performance of}} abortions except {{in the case of}} a danger to life, a serious threat to health, or the existence of a serious disease that could be inherited from the parents. The abortion had to be performed in a hospital or maternity home. Physicians who performed unsafe abortions outside a hospital or without the presence of one of these indications were subject to one to two years' imprisonment. If the abortion was performed under unsanitary conditions or by a person with no special medical education, the penalty was no less than three years' imprisonment. A person who induced a woman to have an abortion was subject to two years' imprisonment. A pregnant woman who underwent an abortion was subject to a reprimand and the payment of a fine of up to 300 rubles {{in the case of a}} <b>repeat</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Act, 2014 (Act No. 16 of 2014) {{amended the}} NDPS Act to relax {{restrictions}} placed by the Act on Essential Narcotic Drugs (Morphine, Fentanyl and Methadone), making them more accessible for use in pain relief and palliative care. The Amendment also contained measures to improve treatment and care for people dependent on drugs, opened up the processing of opium and concentrated poppy straw to the private sector, and strengthened provisions related to the forfeiture of property of persons arraigned on charges of drug trafficking. The Amendment also removed the NDPS Act's imposition of a mandatory death sentence {{in case of a}} repeat conviction for trafficking large quantities of drugs, giving courts the discretion to use the alternative sentence of 30 years imprisonment for <b>repeat</b> <b>offences.</b> However, the Amendment increased the punishment for [...] "small quantity" [...] offences from a maximum of 6 months to 1 year imprisonment.|$|R
