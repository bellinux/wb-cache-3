40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} the ecotoxicity of dishwasher detergents. Indeed, despite the high consumption of such products, available information regarding their environmental impact is still limited. Thus, twenty {{five of the}} most representative products available on the French market were selected, covering the different dishwasher detergent categories : 'multibenefit' tablets, 'classical' products (tablets and powder) and 'gel' (both 'classical'products and 'gel'need the use of rinse aid). Our approach was taken into account the ecotoxicity of solutions simulating a wash cycle in a dishwasher in typical use conditions, as recommended by the manufacturer. The ecotoxicity of these 'washing solutions'was determined by performing a battery of aquatic bioassays from two trophic levels (algae and micro-invertebrates) covering both acute and chronic endpoints. In addition, {{the assessment of the}} ecotoxicity of two hand-dishwashing detergents, ten <b>rinse</b> <b>aids</b> (alone) and four dishwashing detergents (without addition of rinse aid in the 'washing solution') was performed. Both approach and selected battery of bioassays were relevant and allowed the classification of the different dishwasher detergents. Mostly, it was shown that there production of C. dubia was the most sensitive endpoint compared with the inhibition of the mobility of D. magna and the growth of the algae P. subcapitata. The 'washing solutions'prepared with hand dishwashing detergents were found to be more toxic than those prepared with dishwasher detergents, except for the gel products. Regarding the automatic dishwasher products, it was shown that the ecotoxicity of 'washing solutions'from the 'gel'products was higher than the ecotoxicity recorded for 'classical'products and 'multibenefit' tablets. This study also revealed that the ecotoxicity of 'classical'tablets was, most of the time, higher than the ecotoxicity of 'multibenefit' tablets. Additional studies confirmed that the ecotoxicity recorded for 'classical'products was mostly due to the addition of rinse aid in the 'washing solution'. These results suggested that the ecotoxicity recorded for ecolabelled products should be weighted regarding to the intrinsic ecotoxicity of the <b>rinse</b> <b>aids</b> which are currently not covered by 'European Ecolabel'...|$|E

50|$|Dishwashing {{detergents}} for dishwashers {{are manufactured}} and marketed variously as cartridges, gel, liquids, pacs, powder, and tablets. Any dishwashing liquid may contain bleach, enzymes, or <b>rinsing</b> <b>aids.</b> Some dishwashing detergents may be homemade, using ingredients such as borax, essential oil, eucalyptus oil and grated bar soap, among others.|$|R
50|$|A mix {{of water}} and {{dishwasher}} detergent is pumped {{to one or more}} rotating spray arms, which blast the dishes with the cleaning mixture. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water is pumped in and a rinse cycle begins. After the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained, the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a <b>rinse</b> <b>aid</b> is used to eliminate water spots for streak-free dishes and glassware resulting from hard water or other reasons.|$|R
50|$|The heat {{inside the}} {{dishwasher}} dries the contents {{after the final}} hot rinse; the final rinse adds {{a small amount of}} <b>rinse</b> <b>aid</b> to the hot water, as this improves drying significantly. Plastic and non-stick items may not dry properly compared to china and glass, which hold the heat better. Some dishwashers incorporate a fan to improve drying. Older dishwashers with a visible heating element (at the bottom of the wash cabinet, below the bottom basket) may use the heating element to improve drying; however, this uses more energy.|$|R

40|$|Fluorescent {{penetrant}} inspection (FPI) {{is widely used}} in the aviation industry and other industries for surface‐breaking crack detection. As with all inspection methods, adherence to the process parameters {{is critical to the}} successful detection of defects. There is variety of lubricants and surface coatings used in the aviation industry which must be removed prior to FPI. Before the FPI process begins, components are cleaned using a variety of cleaning methods which are selected based on the alloy and the soil types which must be removed. It is also important that the cleaning process not adversely affect the FPI process. From the first three phases of this project it has been found that a hot water <b>rinse</b> can <b>aid</b> in the detection process when using this nondestructive method...|$|R
30|$|A {{quantity}} of nifedipine CRS crystals (11.0 mg) was weighed and dissolved in 1 mL of {{glacial acetic acid}} in a 20 -mL beaker. This was warmed gently to ensure complete dissolution. Two millilitres of concentrated HCl was added followed by 400 mg of Zn dust. The whole content was allowed to stand for 5 min. The solution was then filtered through a cotton wool plug into a 10 -mL volumetric flask and made up to volume by adding fresh glacial acetic acid <b>rinsing</b> the filter <b>aid</b> in the process. This gave a 1 mg/mL of reduced nifedipine (RN) solution. A stock solution of 100 μg/mL was thereafter made from this and kept in a wrapped sample vial.|$|R
40|$|Study aim: {{to assess}} the role of pH {{measurement}} {{and the need for}} neutralising agents (Diphoterine®) in the initial management of chemical burns in an academic hospital Method: prospective, interventional study Results: The conjunctival pH of 18 eyes was checked and 5 eyes with an abnormal pH required irrigation with Diphoterine®. The pH using urine dipstick was equivalent to universal indicator paper. Most of the patients were young males who had been involved in domestic or occupational accidents. The majority of patients presented with mild (Grade 1) burns and had a delayed presentation to hospital Conclusion: Neutralising agents are a first <b>aid</b> <b>rinsing</b> solution and most effective immediately after injury. The use of urine dipsticks to measure the conjunctival pH of patients with chemical burns can assist in identifying patients who require irrigation and was equivalent to universal indicator paper. Of the eyes irrigated, Diphoterine® was effective in neutralising the conjunctival pH 80...|$|R
30|$|The assay {{of active}} {{ingredients}} for the brands was determined {{based on the}} new and official methods. For the assay of the six brands of nifedipine tablets, six different analyte stock solutions (A to F) of the same concentration were prepared. Based on uniformity of weight test, 105 mg of Frapine® (Medrel Pharmaceutical Ltd., Mumbai, India), 113 mg of Nifedin Dexcel® (Dexcel Ltd., Hamilton, New Zealand), 47 mg of Nifegem® (Gemini Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Commack, NY, USA), 46 mg of Nifecard® (Salutas Pharma GmbH, Barleben, Germany), 45 mg of Medipine® (Cipla Ltd., Mumbai, India) and 75 mg of Nife-D® (Lincoln Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Ahmedabad, India) powdered tablets each corresponding to 11 mg of nifedipine were weighed and dispersed in 1.0 mL of glacial acetic acid in a 20 -mL beaker. This was warmed gently to aid dissolution of the active ingredient. Two millilitres of concentrated HCl was added followed by 400 mg of Zn dust. The whole content was allowed to stand for 5 min.
