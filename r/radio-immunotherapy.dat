40|$|BACKGROUND: In January 2004, EMEA {{approved}} 90 Y-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan, Zevalin, in Europe for {{the treatment}} of adult patients with rituximab-relapsed or -refractory CD 20 + follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The number of European nuclear medicine departments using Zevalin is continuously increasing, since the therapy is often considered successful. The Therapy, Oncology and Dosimetry Committees have worked together in order to define some EANM guidelines on the use of Zevalin, paying particular attention to the problems related to nuclear medicine. PURPOSE: The purpose of this guideline is to assist the nuclear medicine physician in treating and managing patients who may be candidates for <b>radio-immunotherapy.</b> The guideline also stresses the need for close collaboration with the physician(s) treating the patient for the underlying disease...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe ARRONAX (Accélérateur pour la Recherche en Radiochimie et Oncologie à Nantes Atlantique) {{cyclotron}} in Saint Herblain - France is {{a facility}} delivering alpha particles at 68 MeV (1). One of its purposes {{is to become}} a platform for radiobiological studies. The radiobiological studies evolvearound two axes: the low energy range (< 10 MeV) in order to optimize <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> (RIT) treatments, and the high energy range (30 - 68 MeV) in order to puzzle out the fundamental mechanisms generated by cells in response to ionizing radiations. The ARRONAX platform for radiobiology is currently preparing to use a time lapse fluorescence confocal microscope suitable for the irradiation of cell wells.

The use of radioimmunotherapy may deliver a significant {{dose of radiation}} to the kidneys. We therefore studied the incidence and clinical picture of bone marrow trans-plantation (BMT) nephropathy in our patients receiving <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> before allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

40|$|The goal {{of cancer}} {{immunotherapy}} is to harness a patient's {{immune system to}} target and destroy malignant cells. Several approaches can be taken including check-point blockade with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA- 4) and the programmed cell-death protein- 1 (PD 1 /PDL- 1) axis to abrogate the engagement of T cells with inhibitory receptors. Ànother strategy is the adoptive transfer of ex vzvo-expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with high-dose interleukin- 2, or of T cells that have been gene-engineered with a receptor that targets them specifïcally to the tumor. These therapies have led to remarkable clinical responses, including complété remission, but not for ail tumor-types, and not for ail patients. Previous studies have documented a corrélation between ovarian cancer (OC) patient survival {{and the degree to}} which their tumors are infiltrated with T cells, thus marking OC as a promising target for immunotherapy. Early interventions against OC included high-doses of whole abdominal radiotherapy (WART) to directly kill the tumor cells, but due to high patient toxicity and low efficacy, WART has been largely abandoned. Recently, however, a few groups have shown that low dose irradiation (LDI) has profound effects on tumor immunity, including enhanced T cell infiltration, and has the potential to synergize with cancer immunotherapy. Here we have explored the effects of low-dose WART against ID 8, an initially slow growing but aggressive murine tumor model that closely resembles human OC. By immunohistoehemistry and Nanostring analysis we observed immune infiltration (CD 8 + T cells, antigen presenting cells, T regulatoiy cells etc.) and immune gene régulation, respectively, in LDI treated versus control tumors. Based on the upregulation of druggable immune targets we then rationally developed a combinatorial treatment comprising LDI for TME re-programming, cyclophosphamide to deplete regulatorv T cells, check-point blockade mAbs against both PD- 1 and CLTA- 4, and agonist mAb targeting CD 40 to promote antigen presenting cell activity. The combination, which was given once per week for 3 weeks, significantly enhanced survival, and deconvolution of the treatment revealed that ail reagents were required for full benefit. Moreover, if LDI was not included, or only applied at the first treatment cycle, ail survival benefit was lost. In vivo depletion assays demonstrated a rôle for both CD 8 f T cells and NK cells to protection by <b>radio-immunotherapy,</b> and an in vivo blocking assay revealed a critical rôle for transmembrane protein NKG 2 D, which is found on both cell-types. Finally, the <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> also provided survival benefit against advanced intraperitoneal CT 26 colon tumors, with an important drop in survival without LDI. We believe that this work provides critical insight into TME re-programming by LDI, and the application of <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> to patients. A clinical study combining LDI, cyclophosphamide and check-point blockade against both PD 1 and CTLA- 4, for the treatment of advanced metastatic solid tumors will be conducted...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe abscopal effect, {{which is}} the {{spontaneous}} regression of tumors or metastases outside the radiation field, occurs rarely in cancer patients. Interestingly, radiotherapy (RT) triggers an immunogenic cell death (ICD) that is able to generate tumor-specific cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells that are efficient in killing cancer cells. The key question is: why is this “abscopal effect” so uncommon in cancer patients treated with RT? Most probably, the main reason {{may be related to}} the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of well-established tumors that constantly antagonizes the anti-tumor immune responses triggered by RT. In this case, additional or combinatorial immunotherapy is needed to attenuate these immunosuppressive networks and, therefore, substantially increases the efficacy of RT. Here, we describe a potentially promising synergistic <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> “in situ tumor vaccination” protocol by antagonizing the tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment with a combinatorial approach using local RT and IL- 12 -based TH 1 response augmentation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{isolated}} 11 antibodies specific for canine CD 138 (cCD 138) {{to validate}} the interest of CD 138 antigen targeting in dogs with spontaneous mammary carcinoma. The affinity of the monoclonal antibodies in the nanomolar range is suitable for immunohistochemistry and nuclear medicine applications. Four distinct epitopes were recognized on cCD 138 by this panel of antibodies. CD 138 expression in canine healthy tissues is comparable to that reported in humans. CD 138 is frequently expressed in canine mammary carcinomas corresponding to the human triple negative breast cancer subtype, with cytoplasmic and membranous expression. In canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, CD 138 expression {{is associated with the}} 'non-germinal center' phenotype corresponding to the most aggressive subtype in humans.

40|$|Follicular {{lymphoma}} is an indolent lymphoma {{that has}} occurred more frequently over the last decades. In this article we present {{an overview of the}} diagnosis and initial work-up, prognostic scoring system and choice of therapy. For limited stage disease radiotherapy is the treatment of choice, and may have a curative potential. For advanced stages treatment should be initiated upon certain criteria, and is essentially based on immunochemotherapy, rituximab plus chemotherapy. The choice of chemotherapy depends on age, frailty, and specific toxicities of chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy with rituximab after induction has become standard practice. Since virtually all patients relapse eventually, an overview of the treatment in the relapsed setting is given. The treatment is then again based on immunochemotherapy {{but there is also a}} place for <b>radio-immunotherapy,</b> or immunotherapy alone.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study waw to assess {{efficacy}} and safety of <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> with Zevalin (R) (RIT-Z) in heavily pre-treated, rituximab-refractory patients. Patients and Methods: We studied 12 patients with indolent lymphoma and 7 with aggressive lymphoma. The median number of prior rituximab-containing treatments was 2; overall, 3 therapies had been previously given. Ten patients received RIT-Z as salvage therapy, 9 at high risk of relapse received RIT-Z as consolidation. Staging and follow-up were obtained by positron-emission tomography. Outcomes assessed were failure-free survival (FFS) and time to next treatment (TTNT). Results: Overall FFS and TTNT were 5 and 11 months, respectively; median follow-up 13 months. Major findings were i) no long-term remissions observed in 7 patients who had not responded to their most recent therapy and ii) lack of association between any pre-therapy variables analysed and outcomes. Different subgroups showed no difference in terms of toxicity. Conclusion: We encourage the use of RIT-Z as a consolidation for pre-treated patients with both indolent and aggressive lymphoma...|$|E
40|$|Due to poor {{understanding}} of the role of nuclear medicine in several disease treatments, the aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the main therapeutic applications of nuclear medicine as well as their characteristics and radiopharmaceuticals usage through scientific literature review. The main therapeutic applications of nuclear medicine are <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> with iodine- 131, yttrium- 90, lutetium- 177 and copper- 67, the radiosynovectomy with yttrium- 90, rhenium- 186 and gold- 198 and pain palliation of osseous metastases with samarium- 153, strontium- 89 and phosphorus- 32. The radioiodine therapy with iodine- 131 stands out among therapies because it allows a highly selective treatment of thyroid associated with hyperthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancer with favorable dosimetry to healthy tissues and with great advantage to allow the ablation of disseminated lesions due to metastases, success not achieved by traditional radiotherapy. Thus, the therapeutic nuclear medicine is an alternative tool, and often essential for definitive treatment of various diseases considered incurable once.

30|$|Distinctive {{properties}} of melanin suggest wide environmental and medical applications. Fungal melanin has gained more interest for their potential in many fields of biomedicine, dermocosmetics, nanotechnology, and materials science. Radiation {{was used in}} medical treatment like <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> or therapy by external beam that can effect on bone marrow and this was considered as a harmful side effect for using radiation; many experiments estimate that melanin was successfully used to protect bone marrow from such side effect (Schweitzer et al. 2010). In cosmetic industry, melanin gained great interests due to its ability to protect skin against the serious effects of UV radiation (Solano 2014). Some microorganisms can exhibit a common strategy in response to UV radiation including the synthesis and accumulation of UV light absorbing secondary metabolites that act as sunscreens (Garcia-Pichel and Castenholz 1991; Garcia-Pichel and Castenholz 1993); melanin {{was known as the}} best secondary metabolites that act as sunscreens Kollias et al. 1991). Microbial melanin pigment, especially from marine species, is an attractive option for researchers and industries because it is safer, easily degradable, and eco-friendly and does not cause harmful effects (Pombeiro-Sponchiado et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Copper- 67 {{is one of}} the {{important}} therapeutic radionuclides. It is a ß- emitter with half-live of 61. 9 h. In addition it emits main 91, 93 and 185 keV ¿ peaks and is therefore also suitable for SPECT imaging. Recently it was shown that 67 Cu has superior therapeutic effects over 64 Cu, 125 I and 131 I and is a radionuclide of preference for targeted <b>radio-immunotherapy.</b> The main limitation factor however is still the lack in the Copper- 67 supply. We report a novel method of production of 67 Cu by deuteron irradiation of enriched 70 Zn target, where the 70 Zn(d,an) 67 Cu reaction takes place. The calculated maximum of the excitation function is reached at about 20 MeV and overall usable deuteron energy region lies between 10 and 30 MeV. The thick target yield at deuteron energy of 20 MeV is estimated to 2. 6 MBq/µAh (70 µCi/µAh) and a saturation yield to 235 MBq/µA (6. 35 mCi/µA) at EOB. Typical irradiation (12 h, 25 µA) should produce some 740 MBq (20 mCi) of 67 Cu. High specific activity 67 Cu can be therefore produced in relevant quantities by this method. JRC. DG.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Today the {{indication}} for allogeneic stem cell transplantation for a high-risk leukaemia in first remission is well defined by most centres. In patients with primary refractory leukaemia the indication is controversially discussed. Similarly patients with relapse and advanced disease have a poor prognosis with chemotherapy, {{but also with}} transplantation. Finally more elderly patients with comorbidities seek help from transplantation, {{most of them in}} advanced and otherwise refractory disease. The results are reviewed. Recent findings The role of alloimmunity in the control of leukaemia has been defined and pretransplant conditioning treatment could be reduced to less intensive protocols. Graft-versus-leukaemia reactions have been demonstrated with the transfusion of donor lymphocytes. Using nonmyeloablative regimens allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be offered to elderly patients, the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The use of antibodies and <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> has improved the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Cord blood transplants have shown improved results with double transplants. The superiority of maternal donors indicates a role of the donor`s immune repertoire. Summary Taking advantage of alloimmune reactions and reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation has become successful even in elderly and fragile patients. The combination of molecular monitoring, targeted therapy and transplantation as a form of immunotherapy may improve the results of leukaemia treatment further...|$|E
40|$|When radio-iodine {{was first}} used in the {{treatment}} of metastasized thyroid carcinoma in 1943, its success in terms of tumour response, quality of life improvement and survival was considered a 'miracle', as in those days metastatic cancer was generally fatal. Inspired by this, many efforts have been made to apply radioisotope therapy to other tumours. Radionuclide therapy uses radioactive isotopes labelled with specific targeting agents that aim to deliver the irradiation of the isotope to the tumour, while sparing normal tissues. Its unique modality allows to systemically target radiosensitive tumours throughout the body. Another important principle is its so-called 'cross-fire' action, whereby, owing to the larger reach of the radiation in relation to the cell diameter, a tumour cell receives lethal hits also from isotopes in the neighbourhood that are not directly associated with this cell. The treatment is therefore less hampered by inhomogeneous distribution and metabolism than for example chemo- or immunotherapy. The European Association of Nuclear Medicine has issued guidelines on so-called 'established' therapies (www. eanm. org), i. e. hyperthyroidism, thyroid carcinoma, refractory synovitis, bone metastases, mIBG therapy, (32) p therapy and Lipiodol therapy. Newer therapies include radio-peptide therapy, <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> of lymphoma and microsphere therapy for liver cancer. The aim of a recently held workshop at the ECCO 13 conference 2005 and this review is to inform the oncology community about these new developing therapies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|For imaging in {{head and}} neck cancer, tumour-to-tissue {{contrast}} of muscle, salivary glands, thyroid and, to some extent, bone is important, {{in addition to the}} tumour-to-blood ratio. Some normal mouse tissues containing squamous and transitional epithelium, such as tongue and skin, express murine CD 44 v 6. However, we demonstrate in this study that AbD 15179 does not cross-react with the murine CD 44 v 6. Thus, studies with fragments cross-reactive with murine CD 44 v 6 would be needed to study the effect of CD 44 v 6 expression in normal tissues in a mouse model. Consequently, assuming that only non-CD 44 v 6 -mediated uptake was measured, our data indicate that there was no unspecific accumulation of 125 I-Fab or 111 In-Fab in any normal tissue. The transferability of the results to targeting HNSCC in humans is still somewhat limited, at least for organs with known CD 44 v 6 expression as the epithelia of the oral cavity [17, 18]. However, previous clinical studies of CD 44 v 6 -binding antibodies have been performed for several CD 44 v 6 -tageting antibody conjugates for both <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> and radio-immunodiagnostics [23, 26, 45, 46], demonstrating no selective accumulation at non-tumour sites, except in faeces and urine [25], and only minimal accumulation of activity in mouth, lung, spleen, kidney, bone marrow and scrotal area [27]. Since we have previously shown that AbD 15179 at least partly binds to the same epitope as these antibodies [28], this is promising for the future clinical applicability of our fragment.|$|E

In the current investigation, the efficacy of <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> (RIT) with i. p. administration of an anti-colorectal cancer IgG 1, 131 I-A 7, was compared to that with i. v. administration in BALB/c female mice bearing peritoneal nodules of LS 180 human colon cancer cells, at the same toxicity level. Distribution of either i. p. or i. v. administered 131 I-A 7 and i. p. administered irrelevant 131 I-HPMS- 1 was assessed. Based {{on the results of}} toxicity determination at increments of 2 MBq and estimated dosimetry, an i. p. dose of 11 MBq and an i. v. dose of 9 MBq were chosen for treatment. Mice were monitored for long-term survival: untreated mice (n= 11), mice undergoing i. p. RIT with 131 I-A 7 (n= 11), mice undergoing i. v. RIT with 131 I-A 7 (n= 11) and mice undergoing non-specific i. p. RIT with 131 I-HPMS- 1 (n= 5). Intraperitoneal injection of 131 I-A 7 produced faster and greater tumor accumulation than i. v. injection: 34. 2 ± 16. 5 % of the injected dose per g (% ID/ g) and 11. 1 ± 3. 6 % ID/g at 2 h, respectively (P< 0. 0001). Consequently, cumulative radioactivity in tumors was 1. 73 -fold higher with i. p. injection. 131 I-HPMS- 1 did not show specific accumulation. Non-specific RIT with 131 I-HPMS- 1 (mean survival, 26. 0 ± 2. 5 days) did not affect the survival as compared to no treatment (26. 7 ± 1. 9 days). Intravenous RIT with 131 I-A 7 prolonged the survival of mice to 32. 8 ± 1. 8 days (P< 0. 01). Intraperitoneal RIT with 131 I-A 7 improved the survival more significantly and attained cure in 2 of 11 mice (P< 0. 05 vs. i. v. RIT). In conclusion, i. p.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{evaluation}} of biomarkers for radio-immunodiagnostics and <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> and on radiosensitization strategies after HSP 90 inhibition, as a step towards more personalized cancer medicine. There {{is a need to}} develop new tracers that target cancer-specific biomarkers to improve diagnostic imaging, as well as to combine treatment strategies to potentiate synergistic effects. Special focus has been on the cell surface molecule CD 44 and its oncogenic variants, which were found to exhibit unique expression patterns in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The variant CD 44 v 6 seems to be a promising target, because it is overexpressed in this cancer type and is associated with radioresistance. Two new radioconjugates that target CD 44 v 6, namely, the Fab fragment AbD 15179 and the bivalent fragment AbD 19384, were investigated with regard to specificity, biodistribution and imaging performance. Both conjugates were able to efficiently target CD 44 v 6 -positive tumors in vitro and in vivo. PET imaging of CD 44 v 6 with 124 I-AbD 19384 revealed many advantages compared with the clinical standard 18 F-FDG. Furthermore, the efficacy of the novel HSP 90 inhibitor AT 13387 and its potential use in combination with radiation treatment were evaluated. AT 13387 proved to be a potent new cancer drug with favorable pharmacokinetics. Synergistic combination effects at clinically relevant drug and radiation doses are promising for both radiation dose reduction and minimization of side effects, or for an improved therapeutic response. The AT 13387 investigation indicated that CD 44 v 6 is not dependent on the molecular chaperone HSP 90, and therefore, radio-immunotargeting of CD 44 v 6 in combination with the HSP 90 inhibitor AT 13387 might potentiate treatment outcomes. However, EGFR expression levels did correlate with HSP 90 inhibition, and therefore, molecular imaging of EGFR-positive tumors may be used to assess the treatment response to HSP 90 inhibitors. In conclusion, these results demonstrate how tumor targeting with radiolabeled vectors and chemotherapeutic compounds can provide more specific and sensitive diagnostic tools and treatment options, which can lead to customized treatment decisions and a functional diagnosis that provides more precise and safer drug prescribing, as well as a more effective treatment for each patient...|$|E
40|$|The human {{transferrin}} receptor (CD 71) is a ubiquitously expressed internalising glycoprotein {{involved in}} iron homeostasis. Expression of the transferrin receptor {{is found to}} be greatly upregulated in tumour cells and, as such, it offers a useful target in the development of immunotherapeutic agents for tumour therapies. This laboratory has developed a Histagged anti-CD 71 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, expressed in Pichia postoris, {{to be used in the}} investigation oftargeted radio-immunoconjugates against cancer. The production of an anti-CD 71 -scFv was confirmed using N-terminal sequencing, and the scFv was purified via a double His-tag using affinity chromatography to produce yields of 13. 3 mgfl of anti-C 071 -scFv. Specific binding of the scFv to the human transferrin receptor was evaluated by flow cytometry using C 071 + HL- 60 leukaemia cells and CHO cells that are CD 7 r. The anti-CD 71 -scFv was demonstrated to bind specifically to the CD 71 TfR receptor with comparable binding to the monoclonal anti-C 071 antibody using flow cytometry. No binding of either antibody to the COJ 1 - CHO cell line was observed. Saporin, a ribosome inactivating protein, was used to· demonstrate the internalising ability ofthe anti-C 071 -scFv. Saporin is highly cytotoxic but only if it can reach the cytosol of the target cell. The antiCD 71 - scFv was able to deliver a non-internalising monoclonal antibody-saporin conjugate intracellularly. This resulted in significant toxicity to CD 71 + MCF- 7 cells and confirmed that the anti-CD 71 -scFv could internalise. The anti-CD 71 -scFv was successfully conjugated to the y and Auger emitting isotope, 1 : 2. 51. 12 S 1 was selected because the v-rays allow simple monitoring of the binding of the anti-CD 71 -scFvNal 2 S 1 whilst the Auger electrons provide a potential cytotoxic effect if the radionuclide can get close to the nucleus. The anti-C 071 - scFv_Nal 25, was shown to retain specific binding ability to its target CD 71 receptor, however Clonogenic and Comet assay systems did not show signs of DNA damage and cell cytotoxicity as a result of targeted <b>radio-immunotherapy</b> with the scFv-Naus, conjugate. The anti-CD 71 -scFv was shown to provide a useful delivery mechanism that is cheap to produce and purify and able to specifically bind and internalise into CD 71 + tumour cell s. The isotope 12 S 1 was unable to demonstrate a cytotoxic effect on targeted cells, most likely due to the formation of monoiodotyrosine residues caused by the degradation of the anti-CD 71 -scFv intracellularly rapidly diffusing from the lysosome. Further investigation using alternative isotopes and the addition of nuclear localisation and endosomal escape sequences is warranted. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
