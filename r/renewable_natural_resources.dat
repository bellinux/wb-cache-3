40|$|We {{study the}} {{sustainability}} of long-run growth in a two-sector economy where a <b>renewable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> is exploited under private property rights. We obtain short- and long-run growth trajectories in closed form, examine transitional dynamics, and characterize convergence properties. We find conditions for sustainable long-run growth, which depend on the harvesting rate, and show that the speed of convergence decreases during transition. We identify a stronger version of Hartwick s rule and analyze parameter dependences for endogenous variables.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-sector {{model for a}} <b>renewable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> based economy. Pareto efficient results show the optimal harvesting rate that allows for sustained long-run optimal growth, which is upper-bounded by the biological rate of reproduction. Regulation prevents from resource over-exploitation and exhaustion which arise under open access. The Ramsey policy allowing the competitive economy to reach the first-best solution, leads the government to tax harvesting activity from firms and distribute the receipts among households. In the short-run the tax is variable. In the long-run, the lower the intrinsic rate of reproduction the higher the constant unit tax on the <b>resource</b> use. <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources,</b> Efficiency, Open Access, Ramsey Regulation, Growth. ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, the Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (IBAMA, Brazilian Institute of Environment and <b>Renewable</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources)</b> {{established}} the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of Spix's Macaw, called CPRAA, and its Ararinha Azul project (Little Blue Macaw project) {{in order to}} conserve the species.

2500|$|The 1988 {{constitution}} incorporates environmental precepts {{that are}} advanced {{compared with those}} of most other countries. At that time, the Chamber of Deputies (Câmara dos Deputados) established its permanent Commission for Defense of the Consumer, the Environment, and Minorities. In 1989 the creation of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and <b>Renewable</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Resources</b> (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis--Ibama) joined together the federal environment secretariat and the federal agencies specializing in forestry, rubber, and fisheries. In 1990 the administration of Fernando Collor de Mello (president, 1990–92) appointed the well-known environmentalist José Lutzemberger as secretary of the environment and took firm positions on the environment and on Indian lands. In 1992 Brazil played a key role at the Earth Summit, not only as its host but also as negotiator on sustainable development agreements, including the conventions on climate and biodiversity. The Ministry of Environment was created in late 1992, after President Collor had left office. In August 1993, it became the Ministry of Environment and the Legal Amazon and took a more pragmatic approach than had the combative Lutzemberger. However, because of turnover in its leadership, a poorly defined mandate, and lack of funds, its role and impact were limited. In 1995 its mandate and name were expanded to include water resources—the Ministry of Environment, Hydraulic Resources, and the Legal Amazon—it began a process of restructuring to meet its mandate of [...] "shared management of the sustainable use of natural resources." [...] In 1997 the Commission on Policies for Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 began to function {{under the aegis of the}} Civil Household. One of its main tasks was to prepare Agenda 21 (a plan for the twenty-first century) for Brazil and to stimulate preparation of state and local agendas.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies oligopolistic firms’ {{exploitation}} of a <b>renewable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> in a differential game.

One salient feature of the model is that consumers are concerned with the stock of the <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> in that consumers’ demand for harvest of the <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> depends upon the level of the stock of the <b>natural</b> <b>resource.</b> We also examine the effects of taxation on equilibrium.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a new {{theoretical}} model that explains the forest transition not at a local, but at a worldwide level, in a trade liberalisation scenario. Our model has economic geography foundations: transport costs affect the distribution of firms between countries. We also introduce a <b>renewable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> used as an input by manufacturing firms. The results reproduce forest transition behaviour but at a global scale: a decrease in transport costs has {{a negative effect on}} the worldwide stock of the <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> in the short-term, but in the long-term this initial effect is reversed as a consequence of industrial reorganisation between countries because of the change in transport costs. ...|$|R

Formulating the model as a two-stage sequential game, the harvesting of a <b>renewable</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> takes place at the first stage. The observed harvesting surplus is then used for buying private goods and contributing to public goods at the second stage. In this setting, the model shows that the harvesters share an individual objective of maximizing total harvesting surplus. ...|$|R

The economic scarcity of sawlogs is confirmed. Within a given production technology, the potential for substitution among capital, labor and sawlog inputs is greatly restricted but not impossible. Technological change has been strongly labor-saving but has had a negligible effect on wood requirements. Consequently, the real price of lumber has risen, stimulating development of substitute wood products. Continued decline of the industry is anticipated.
