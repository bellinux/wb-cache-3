50|$|The high-resolution, {{digital cinema}} grade video {{projector}} alternately projects right-eye frames and left-eye frames, switching between them 144 times per second. The projector {{is either a}} Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing device or Sony's reflective LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon).

The audience wears circularly polarized glasses that have oppositely polarized lenses that ensures each eye sees only its designated frame. In RealD Cinema, each frame is projected three times to reduce flicker, a system called triple flash.

30|$|The EMI {{shielding}} {{effectiveness of a}} material is defined as SE (dB) = 10 log (Pt/Pi) [5], where Pt and Pi are the transmitted and incident electromagnetic powers, respectively.

In homogeneous materials, absorption and <b>reflection</b> <b>losses</b> dominate the SE. The absorption-related losses in conventional metals are determined by the relationship between the metal thickness and the skin depth, which decreases with the frequency [6]. The reflection occurs due to the impedance discontinuity at metal-air interface. The <b>reflection</b> <b>losses</b> decrease at higher frequencies since material impedance increases. The absorption mechanism predominates when the coating thickness is comparable with the skin depth or at sufficiently high frequencies when the conductivity decreases [6]. Thus, conventional metallic coating being much thinner than EM skin depth should, strictly speaking, be transparent to microwave radiation.|$|R
