25|$|As {{recounted in}} Barney Ross: The Life of a Jewish Fighter, by Ross biographer Douglas Century, {{in the wake}} of the tragedy, Dov became vindictive towards {{everything}} and turned his back on the orthodox religion of his father. He began <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> local toughs (including another wayward Jewish ghetto kid, the future Jack Ruby), developing into a street brawler, thief and money runner; he was even employed by Al Capone. Dov's goal was to earn enough money to buy a home so that he could reunite his family. He saw boxing as that vehicle and began training with his friend Ruby.|$|E

The {{only thing that}} I think [...] get freaked out about {{when they have to}} do something like kiss a guy in a movie—when to their knowledge they’re straight—is that they’re afraid they’re going to be turned on. And if you’re not afraid that you’re going to be turned on—meaning that you know what you like—then really it’s not that hard.|$|E

They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did.

Chung, {{who worked as a}} level designer for Pandemic Studios, has contributed to the development of titles such as Full Spectrum Warrior and [...] Four incarnations of Gravity Bone were produced during its one-year development. Chung commented during an interview with FidGit that [...] "Gravity Bone started out very different from what it was and ended up getting scrapped ... {{so on and so forth}} until this version came out." [...] The first version of Gravity Bone featured more typical first-person shooter elements than the released version, and was based on a series of Quake 2 maps entitled Citizen Abel.

500|$|During {{the scene}} {{when a car}} is about to fall off a cliff, Robin the Boy Wonder appears and {{attempts}} to save the people. However, upon arrival, he is criticized as {{he will not be}} able to save them: this is a reference to the portrayal of Robin from the 1960s Batman series. Throughout the episode, other references are made to fictitious super heroes. In total, three references were made to Star Trek, all of which involve Star Trek actor George Takei's character, Mr. Sulu. When Peter has a flashback about passing his college test he is <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> the song [...] "I'm Free" [...] by Kenny Loggins playing in the background.

When interviewed in August 2009 for RT, he distanced himself from the present-day National Front, which he claimed is [...] "...a group of skinheads <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> no political direction, other than that we suspect which their masters give them." [...] On The Politics Show on 9 March 2003, he appeared to accept ethnic minorities who were already legally living in the country, and, on 6 March 2008, he was again interviewed on Newsnight; when told of a poll that demonstrated that most working-class Britons were more concerned about drugs and alcohol than immigration, he linked the UK's drug problem with Islam, specifically Pakistani immigrants. His inclusion on the programme was criticised by contributor and radio presenter Jon Gaunt, who branded the decision as [...] "pathetic".

Remarkably, until 1908, he cared nothing for music, when as a ten year old he was intrigued by what he heard at his friend Maxie Rosenzweig's violin recital. The sound, and the way his friend played, captured him. His parents had bought a piano for lessons for his older brother Ira, but to his parents' surprise, and Ira's relief, it was George who spent more time playing it.|$|E

[...] Presley's girlfriend June Juanico complained the singer was always talking about his friend Adams and James Dean. She also was upset that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Presley's own mother even commented about Adams, [...] "He sure is a pushy little fellow".|$|E
