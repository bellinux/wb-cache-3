50|$|Because {{the festival}} is near, White <b>Snake</b> pushes <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> to leave the village knowing that a special wine {{consumed}} only on this day will make <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> reveal her true form (due to her inexperience). <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> sulks, rebelling to leave because of her envy towards White Snake and Hsui Xien. The night of the festival, White Snake drags an obviously-scared Hsui Xien to drink the special wine together. Hsui Xien instead secretly dumps the wine into their pond where <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> consumes it; White Snake {{was not able to}} prevent Hsui Xien from seeing <b>Green</b> <b>Snake's</b> true form and he dies from shock. They are interrupted by the Taoist and his two apprentices again, which White Snake disposed of hasily. She decides to go to Kwun Lun Mountain to obtain the Lin-Chi Herb, but because it is guarded by a Holy Crane, <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> decides to help out of guilt. Fat-hoi notices their presences and immediately follows them. After obtaining the Lin-Chi Herb, White <b>Snake</b> leaves <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> to fight against Fat-hoi but was quickly defeated. To let her go, the monk decided to challenge his own mentality by letting <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> distract him in any way while he meditates.

To get a response out of White Snake, she seduces Hsui Xien and the two gets into a fight in which White Snake triumphed. She reveals to <b>Green</b> <b>Snake</b> that she is pregnant and cannot be with her anymore.|$|R

50|$|Opheodrys aestivus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>rough</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake,</b> is a nonvenomous North American colubrid.

Up to 75 eggs have been found in one such nest. The nest site varies: under boards, under bark in rotting stumps, in deep mulch, or under a rock. Hatchlings from spring breeding typically emerge in August or September, and each is about 18 - 20 cm in total length.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rough</b> <b>green</b> <b>snake</b> is {{widespread}} {{and is not}} of conservation concern, in general.

It {{is also one of the}} most exploited pet snakes in North America. O. aestivus are collected by the hundreds each year and wholesale for around eight dollars in U.S. currency making it a very accessible species to pet shops and later to the pet owner.|$|E
