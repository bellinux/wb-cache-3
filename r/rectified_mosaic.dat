The proposed documentation is carried on the entrance façade of a 19 th century house located in the urban conservation site of Alaçatı, [...] zmir, Turkey. The Demiral House has conservation priority among the other listed houses because of its vacant state and damages. Analytic recording of the façades of the historical houses in Alaçatı can be made fast with the rectification option of close range monoscopic softwares. A calibrated digital camera and a total station are the other tools used in this process. The colored thematic maps prepared are accurate enough for 1 / 50 scale analysis and they possess the qualitative information on the photographs. After it is checked that the threedimensional measurements defining the general geometry overlap with the 1 / 50 scaled <b>rectified</b> image <b>mosaic,</b> the details concerning the deteriorations are decided to be drawn to the scaled elevation drawing from this mosaic. This study has proposed a contemporary documentation technique so that architect-conservators can easily adapt in their conservation projects. When compared to the frequently applied documentation techniques like hatching on scaled twodimensional elevation drawings, it takes shorter time to prepare the proposed mapping method on <b>rectified</b> image <b>mosaic.</b> The architect-restorer has also the chance to examine many constructional details on the scaled <b>rectified</b> image <b>mosaic.</b> The end results are more realistic.

Necatibey Boulevard which is situated in the urban retail core of İzmir, is selected as the case study of this thesis for testing the proposed methodology. Comparison with conventional ways of documenting historical street facades is also provided. The selected streetscape and its surrounding consist of commercial buildings dating 1920 s, and then 1950 s onwards. Especially the ones constructed in 1920 s are valuable with their architectural characteristics; however, some alterations and conversions are identified on the facades because of the unconscious usage and the change of the lifestyles. Documenting the street facades of this mentioned urban site is a prerequisite for taking preservation decisions. Within the objective of the thesis, <b>rectified</b> image <b>mosaic</b> showing the present conditions of the Necatibey Boulevard and thematic representations prior to conservation decisions are produced. The produced methodology can be easily applied for documentation of historic facade series prior to conservation decisions of street rehabilitation projects. The comparison of the <b>rectified</b> image <b>mosaic</b> with 2 D elevation have pointed out that the former is a realistic way for the representation of architectural details, colors and textures. The changes of the street in time are also better perceived. Moreover, the production of the digital image mosaics of the historic street facades can also be useful for production of urban databases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Frequently large SAR mosaics are not {{precisely}} geo-referenced because topographic distortions are not removed during the mosaicking process {{due to the}} lack of digital elevation models (DEMs). The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has recently provided high-resolution DEM data with nearly global coverage, and makes it possible to <b>rectify</b> SAR <b>mosaics.</b> Though techniques are available for rectifying individual scenes of SAR imagery using DEM data, these methods encounter difficulties when <b>rectifying</b> SAR <b>mosaics</b> because sharp geometric discontinuities occur in SAR mosaics at scene boundaries. This paper introduces an automated method of removing topographic distortions from SAR mosaics and producing ortho-rectified mosaics, without accessing original SAR images. The procedures include SAR image simulation from DEMs, two-staged image matching between SAR mosaics and the simulated image, automated tie-point derivation and screening, piecewise image rectification for localized adjustment, and production of ortho-rectified mosaics. The method is used to ortho-rectifying both high-water and low-water GRFM (Global Rain Forest Mapping project) SAR mosaics covering the entire Amazon basin. Validation results show that 1 -pixel (i. e., 92 m) positioning accuracy (root mean square error) was achieved in both cases, compared to 14 to 16 pixel errors (i. e., 1, 288 to 1, 472 m) of the original mosaics.

40|$|The {{historic}} Walled City of Baku, Icherisheher, {{has been}} described {{as one of the best}} examples of a town that preserves the historical stratigraphy of more than a thousand years, reflecting a great number of influences. Through its history, the structures of Baku may have been rebuilt several times. In the realization of the project very different problem list are been faced, that have required the use and the implementation of separate instrumentations for different results: topographical survey, photographic survey, digital photoplanes and three-dimensional model of the historical center. Through GPS instrumentation and total station, a network of station points materialised on the ground and suitably monographic forms the basis for updating basic cartography and ensures topographic and geographic coordination of all the surveyed areas’ components. The survey was used both for general documentation and to execute digital photoplanes, digitally <b>rectified</b> <b>mosaics</b> obtained with purpose-built software with the aid of topographic points. The contemporary management of all the information has allowed to realize a three-dimensional model of the historic center of Baku for geometric and planning analysis or for virtual navigations. The request to produce a model in formed VRML she has addressed the choice of the methodic ones to employ in the modeling. First analysis has concerned the urbanistic structure of the city and the distinction of single areas individualized as single objects and with different degree of detail. Parallelly to the activities of modeling, they have been prepared the necessary images to be applied to the faces of the model. An objective was that to make the enjoyable product to the collectivity through virtual navigations and to increase the accessibility and the understanding of the contents. To scientific purpose the same model, with greater quality of images and further accuracy, he can be used for projects of intervention, finalized to the documentation and the historical knowledge of the city of Baku...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an {{exciting}} new remote sensing tool capable of acquiring high resolution spatial data. Remote sensing with UAVs {{has the potential}} to provide imagery at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The small footprint of UAV imagery, however, makes it necessary to develop automated techniques to geometrically <b>rectify</b> and <b>mosaic</b> the imagery such that larger areas can be monitored. In this paper, we present a technique for geometric correction and mosaicking of UAV photography using feature matching and Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric techniques. Images are processed to create three dimensional point clouds, initially in an arbitrary model space. The point clouds are transformed into a real-world coordinate system using either a direct georeferencing technique that uses estimated camera positions or via a Ground Control Point (GCP) technique that uses automatically identified GCPs within the point cloud. The point cloud is then used to generate a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) required for rectification of the images. Subsequent georeferenced images are then joined together to form a mosaic of the study area. The absolute spatial accuracy of the direct technique was found to be 65 – 120 cm whilst the GCP technique achieves an accuracy of approximately 10 – 15 cm...|$|R
40|$|Circular Polarisation Ratio (CPR) mosaics from Mini-SAR on Chandrayaan- 1 and Mini-RF on LRO {{are used}} to study craters near to the lunar north pole. The look {{direction}} of the detectors strongly affects {{the appearance of the}} crater CPR maps. <b>Rectifying</b> the <b>mosaics</b> to account for parallax also significantly changes the CPR maps of the crater interiors. It is shown that the CPRs of crater interiors in unrectified maps are biased to larger values than crater exteriors, because of a combination of the effects of parallax and incidence angle. Using the LOLA Digital Elevation Map (DEM), the variation of CPR with angle of incidence has been studied. For fresh craters, CPR ∼ 0. 7 ∼ 0. 7 with only a weak dependence on angle of incidence or position interior or just exterior to the crater, consistent with dihedral scattering from blocky surface roughness. For anomalous craters, the CPR interior to the crater increases with both incidence angle and distance from the crater centre. Central crater CPRs are similar to those in the crater exteriors. CPR does not appear to correlate with temperature within craters. Furthermore, the anomalous polar craters have diameter-to-depth ratios that are lower than those of typical polar craters. These results strongly suggest that the high CPR values in anomalous polar craters are not providing evidence of significant volumes of water ice. Rather, anomalous craters are of intermediate age, and maintain sufficiently steep sides that sufficient regolith does not cover all rough surfaces...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: SAR mosaics {{are often}} not {{precisely}} geo-referenced because topographic distortions were not removed during the mosaicking process {{due to the lack}} of adequate digital elevation models (DEMs). The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has recently provided high-resolution DEM data with nearly global coverage, and makes it possible to geo-rectify SAR mosaics. Though techniques are available for rectifying individual scenes of SAR imagery using DEM data, these methods encounter difficulties when <b>rectifying</b> SAR <b>mosaics</b> because abrupt geometric discontinuities occur in SAR mosaics at scene boundaries. This paper introduces an automated direct method to directly removing geometric and topographic distortions and discontinuities from SAR mosaics and producing ortho-rectified mosaics, without accessing original SAR images. The proposed method was applied to geo-rectifying the Amazon basin GRFM (Global Rain Forest Mapping project) SAR mosaic produced from thousands of JERS- 1 SAR images. Validation results show that 1 -pixel (i. e., 92 m) positioning accuracy (root mean square error) was achieved in both the high Andes Mountains and the flat Atlantic estuaries, compared to the 16 -pixel error (i. e., 1, 380 m) of the original mosaics. The proposed procedures were implemented at a high level of automation with little human intervention. The large data volume represented by the Amazon basin mosaic is manageable on a PC computer. With the release of high-resolution SRTM DEM data, the proposed method is readily applicable to SAR mosaics located between 56 oS to 60 oN. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} techniques {{which we}} will use to determine regional control point networks, DTMs (Digital Terrain Models) and <b>rectified</b> color image <b>mosaics</b> from large collections of spacecraft stereo images in particular Clementine data. First, overlapping images suitable for stereo analysis are identified, and tiepoints in overlapping images are selected manually. Next, latitudes, longitudes and heights of these tiepoints are determined {{in combination with the}} camera pointing data of all images and the spacecraft trajectory in a "bundle block adjustment". Thus, the resulting planetary coordinates are used as control points subsequent analysis. Next, stereo disparity data between image pairs are determined using the "Gruen-Otto-Chau stereo matching algorithm". These data are converted to planetary coordinates based on the spacecraft trajectory and altitude data determined during the bundle adjustment and are interpolated to form the DTM grid. Finally, all images are rectified {{on the basis of the}} elevation model, reprojected onto a map, and combined to mosaics. The procedure allows us to archive precise registrations of the color filter images. Furthermore, precise surface slopes and illumination angles can be computed from the DTM to perform a physically more meaningful spectrophotometric analysis of the terrain. The performance of the bundle block adjustment and of the matching software will be demonstrated. Examples will be given of DTMs near Mare Orientale and the polar regions of the Moon.
