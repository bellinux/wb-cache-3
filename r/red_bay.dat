5|$|Forests cover 65% of the state, {{primarily}} with deciduous, broad leaf {{trees in the}} western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of Virginia. Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge. However, since the early 1990s, Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests. In the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include <b>red</b> <b>bay,</b> wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found. The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in eastern and central Virginia.|$|E

During the peak of the trade nearly 1,000 men could be found working in and around <b>Red</b> <b>Bay,</b> while as many as eleven ships resorted to this harbor in 1575, alone. Three vigías were built on Saddle Island, one on the western side of the island near or on the present site of a lighthouse, the second on the eastern side {{at the top of a}} hill over 30m (100ft) in elevation, and the third on its eastern shore. There was also one placed on a 10m (33ft) high hill on the smaller Twin Island to the east.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, {{the wreck}} of a ship was found in <b>Red</b> <b>Bay.</b> She is {{believed}} to be the Spanish Basque galleon San Juan, a three-masted, 27.1m (90ft) long, 250–300-ton vessel that was lost in 1565. San Juan, carrying a cargo of nearly 1,000 barrels of whale oil, was wrecked by an autumn storm. She grounded stern first on the northern side of Saddle Island, struck the bottom several times and split her keel open before sinking 30 yards from shore. Her captain, Joanes de Portu, and crew were able to save the sails, rigging, some provisions, and about half the whale oil. The crew took to the boats and hailed another ship for a ride back to Spain. The following year de Portu salvaged more of the wreck before she finally sank out of sight. Three more wrecks have been found in <b>Red</b> <b>Bay,</b> the last in 2004. The charred hull fragments of the second ship, found in 1983, strongly suggest the ship sank because of a fire.|$|E

25|$|Ships from <b>Red</b> <b>Bay</b> alone sent 6,000–9,000 {{barrels of}} oil to Europe every year during the peak of exploitation, while a further 8,000 or 9,000 barrels was {{produced}} in St. Modeste, Chateau Bay, and other harbors. Each ship averaged 1,000 barrels a season, a cargo that rivaled the Spanish galleons bringing back treasure from the Caribbean for sheer monetary value. So, on average, a minimum of 15,000 {{barrels of oil}} would have been produced each year, which would have involved a catch of at least 300 whales, or twenty per ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{lives of}} Paleo-Eskimos {{of the far}} north were largely {{unaffected}} {{by the arrival of}} visiting Norsemen except for mutual trade. Labrador Inuit have had the longest continuous contact with Europeans. After the disappearance of the Norse colonies in Greenland, the Inuit had no contact with Europeans for at least a century. By the mid-16th century, Basque whalers and fishermen were already working the Labrador coast and had established whaling stations on land, such as the one that has been excavated at <b>Red</b> <b>Bay.</b> The Inuit appear not to have interfered with their operations, but they raided the stations in winter for tools and items made of worked iron, which they adapted to their own needs.|$|E

500|$|Human inhabitation in Newfoundland and Labrador can {{be traced}} back over 9,000 years {{to the people of the}} Maritime Archaic Tradition.

The oldest known European contact was made over a thousand years ago when the Vikings briefly settled in L'Anse aux Meadows. Five hundred years later, European explorers [...] (John Cabot, Gaspar Corte-Real, Jacques Cartier and others), fishermen from England, Portugal, France and Spain and Basque whalers (the remains of several whaling stations have been found at <b>Red</b> <b>Bay,</b> Newfoundland and Labrador) began exploration and exploitation of the area.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{documents}} {{dealing with}} whaling in Terranova concern the years 1548 to 1588, {{with the largest}} quantity dealing with the harbor of <b>Red</b> <b>Bay</b> or [...] "Less Buttes" [...] – both names {{in reference to the}} red granite cliffs of the region. The references include acts of piracy in the 1550s, the loss of a ship in 1565, a disastrous wintering in 1576–77, and, on Christmas Eve 1584, a will written for a dying Basque, Joanes de Echaniz; the first known Canadian will. The last overwintering in <b>Red</b> <b>Bay</b> was made in 1603. During their onshore stays, the whalers developed relations with American natives that led to the establishment of a purpose-specific language with both American native and Basque elements.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{species of}} whale were hunted in {{southern}} Labrador, the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale. The former were {{taken during the}} [...] "early" [...] season in the summer, while the latter was caught from the fall to early winter (October–January). DNA analysis of the old bones after a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century, in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence found that the right whale was by then less than 1% of the whales taken. During the peak of Terranova whaling (1560s–1580s) the Spanish Basques used well-armed galleons of up to 600–700 tons, while the French Basques usually fitted out smaller vessels. A 450-ton Basque ship carrying 100 or more men required about 300 hogsheads of cider and wine and 300–400 quintals of ship's biscuit, {{as well as other}} dry provisions. In Labrador the men subsisted mainly on locally caught cod and salmon, as well as the occasional caribou or wild duck. This diet was supplemented with dried peas, beans, chickpeas, olive oil, mustard seed, and bacon. Before leaving for Terranova sometime in the months of May or June, a priest went aboard the ships to bless them and say a special mass for the success of the expeditions. Sailing across the stormy North Atlantic must have been a very unpleasant experience for the crew of up to 130 men and boys, as they slept on the hard decks or filthy, vermin-invested straw palliasses. Halfway there the smell of refuse in the bilge would have been unbearable. After a voyage of two months the ships would anchor in one of the twelve harbors on the southern shore of Labrador and eastern Quebec. Archaeological evidence has been found for ten of these harbors – Middle Bay and Blanc-Sablon in Quebec, and Schooner Cove, West St. Modeste, East St. Modeste, Carrol Cove, <b>Red</b> <b>Bay,</b> Chateau Bay, Pleasure Harbour, and Cape Charles in southern Labrador. Once the ice had disappeared the ships entered the harbors where the coopers went ashore and erected their dwellings and workshops, while most of the crew lived aboard ship. The boys were also sent ashore to chop wood and prepare meals.|$|E
