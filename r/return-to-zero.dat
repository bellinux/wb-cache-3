50|$|Although <b>return-to-zero</b> (RZ) {{contains}} a provision for synchronization, {{it still has}} a DC component resulting in “baseline wander” during long strings of 0 or 1 bits, just like the line code non-return-to-zero.|$|E
50|$|Consider a 1/2 {{convolutional}} coder, which generates 2 bits (00, 01, 10 or 11) {{for every}} input bit (1 or 0). These <b>Return-to-Zero</b> signals are {{translated into a}} Non-Return-to-Zero form shown alongside.|$|E
50|$|For Bi-polar <b>Return-to-Zero</b> (Bi-polar RZ), {{a binary}} one is encoded as +V volts, a binary zero is encoded as -V volts, and 0 Volt {{is used to}} provide padding and {{separated}} between bits.|$|E
50|$|The Mamyshev {{regenerator}} {{can handle}} <b>return-to-zero</b> signals with ultrahigh data bit rates. Indeed, {{thanks to the}} quasi-instantaneous response of the nonlinear Kerr effect, this regenerator does not suffer from the finite recover time of some saturable absorbers.|$|E
50|$|The signal format Alternate-Phase <b>Return-to-Zero</b> (APRZ) can {{be viewed}} as a {{generalisation}} of CSRZ in which the phase alternation can take up any value ΔΦ (and not necessarily only π) and the duty cycle is also a free parameter.|$|E
50|$|PCM can {{be either}} <b>return-to-zero</b> (RZ) or non-return-to-zero (NRZ). For a NRZ system to be {{synchronized}} using in-band information, there must not be long sequences of identical symbols, such as ones or zeroes. For binary PCM systems, the density of 1-symbols is called ones-density.|$|E
50|$|However, long {{sequences}} of zeroes remain an issue. Long {{sequences of}} zero bits result in no transitions {{and a loss}} of synchronization. Where frequent transitions are a requirement, a self-clocking encoding such as <b>return-to-zero</b> or some other more complicated line code may be more appropriate, though they introduce significant overhead.|$|E
50|$|Or {{the signals}} {{may require a}} reset before other {{operations}} are performed. For example, the sender resets the request wires once the acknowledgement is received, and the receiver resets the acknowledgement afterwards. This is the four-phase protocol, four-phase handshake, or <b>Return-to-Zero</b> encoding. Despite being apparently more complicated, the circuit-level implementations are usually faster and simpler.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunication, bipolar {{encoding}} {{is a type}} of <b>return-to-zero</b> (RZ) line code, {{where two}} nonzero values are used, so that the three values are +, −, and zero. Such a signal is called a duobinary signal. Standard bipolar encodings are designed to be DC-balanced, spending equal amounts of time in the + and − states.|$|E
50|$|<b>Return-to-zero,</b> {{inverted}} (RZI) is {{a method}} of mapping for transmission. The two-level RZI signal has a pulse (shorter than a clock cycle) if the binary signal is 0, and no pulse if the binary signal is 1. It is used (with a pulse 3/16 of a bit long) by the IrDA serial infrared (SIR) physical layer specification. Required bandwidth {{for this kind of}} modulation is: BW = R(data rate).|$|E
50|$|On a {{two-wire}} {{system a}} transition on wire 0 signals a '0' bit, and a transition on wire 1 signals a '1' bit. A token is transmitted as {{a sequence of}} exactly 10 transitions, the first eight signal the eight data bits (MSB first) then one bit to signal {{whether this is a}} control token, and then finally a <b>return-to-zero</b> bit that returns the wires to zero (after nine transitions one wire will be high).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Return-to-zero</b> (RZ or RTZ) {{describes}} a line code used in telecommunications signals {{in which the}} signal drops (returns) to zero between each pulse. This takes place even if a number of consecutive 0s or 1s occur in the signal. The signal is self-clocking. This means that a separate clock {{does not need to}} be sent alongside the signal, but suffers from using twice the bandwidth to achieve the same data-rate as compared to non-return-to-zero format.|$|E
5000|$|The Modified Monitoring State Code mapping 4 bits into 3 ternary symbols (MMS43), {{which is}} also {{referred}} to as 4B3T (four binary, three ternary) is a line system used in Europe and elsewhere in the world. 4B3T is a [...] "block code" [...] that uses <b>Return-to-Zero</b> states on the line. 4B3T converts each group of 4 data bits into 3 [...] "ternary" [...] line signal states (3 symbols). Echo cancellation techniques allow full-duplex operation on the line.|$|E
50|$|Its {{drawbacks}} {{are that}} it is not self-clocking and it has a significant DC component, which can be halved by using <b>return-to-zero,</b> where the signal returns to zero {{in the middle of the}} bit period. With a 50% duty cycle each rectangular pulse is only at a positive voltage for half of the bit period. This is ideal if one symbol is sent much more often than the other and power considerations are necessary, and also makes the signal self-clocking.|$|E
5000|$|The KeyMod {{specifications}} {{call out}} a [...] "recoil lug" [...] on the accessories which {{is intended to}} interface with the larger through hole portion and resist slippage of accessories during counter-recoil. The combination of the angled interface of the nut to the KeyMod slot and the recoil lug to the through hole make for a very strong attachment point which will not slip under harsh recoil or counter recoil. It also provides for an excellent <b>return-to-zero</b> when removed and re-installed.|$|E
50|$|Many {{commercial}} aircraft use the ARINC 429 standard developed in 1977 for safety-critical applications. ARINC 429 utilizes a unidirectional bus {{with a single}} transmitter and up to twenty receivers. A data word consists of 32 bits communicated over a twisted pair cable using the bipolar <b>return-to-zero</b> modulation. There are two speeds of transmission: high speed operates at 100 kbit/s and low speed operates at 12.5 kbit/s. ARINC 429 operates {{in such a way}} that its single transmitter communicates in a point-to-point connection, thus requiring a significant amount of wiring which amounts to added weight.|$|E
50|$|Carrier-Suppressed <b>Return-to-Zero</b> (CSRZ) is {{an optical}} signal format. In CSRZ the field {{intensity}} drops to zero between consecutive bits (RZ), {{and the field}} phase alternates by π between neighbouring bits, so that if the phase of the signal is e.g. 0 in even bits (bit number 2n), the phase in odd bit slots (bit number 2n+1) will be π, the phase alternation amplitude. In its standard form CSRZ is generated by a single Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), driven by two sinusoidal waves at half the bit rate BR, and in phase opposition. This gives rise to characteristically broad pulses (duty cycle 67%).|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) {{line code}} is a binary code in {{which ones are}} {{represented}} by one significant condition, usually a positive voltage, while zeros are represented by some other significant condition, usually a negative voltage, with no other neutral or rest condition. The pulses in NRZ have more energy than a <b>return-to-zero</b> (RZ) code, which also has an additional rest state beside the conditions for ones and zeros. NRZ is not inherently a self-clocking signal, so some additional synchronization technique must be used for avoiding bit slips; examples of such techniques are a run-length-limited constraint and a parallel synchronization signal.|$|E
50|$|Asynchronous {{communication}} is typically performed on channels. Communication is used both to synchronize {{operations of the}} concurrent system {{as well as to}} pass data. A simple channel typically consists of two wires: a request and an acknowledge. In a '4-phase handshaking protocol' (or <b>return-to-zero),</b> the request is asserted by the sender component, and the receiver responds by asserting the acknowledge; then both signals are de-asserted in turn. In a '2-phase handshaking protocol' (or transition-signalling), the requester simply toggles the value on the request wire (once), and the receiver responds by toggling the value on the acknowledge wire. Channels can also be extended to communicate data.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{limitation}} of data rate caused by long rise and fall time of light emitting diodes, m-ary <b>return-to-zero</b> optical pulse amplitude modulation is proposed in this paper for improving the bandwidth efficiency of indoor visible light communication. M-ary <b>return-to-zero</b> optical pulse amplitude modulation transmits information through a subtle change of illumination intensity and supports both flicker mitigation and dimming control functions.

Theoretical analysis shows that, m-ary <b>return-to-zero</b> optical pulse amplitude modulation can be used to achieve higher bandwidth efficiency without sacrificing the symbol error rate and bit error rate performance of an indoor visible light communication system. When the ratio of a_slot-a_BS is 0. 1, then m-ary <b>return-to-zero</b> optical pulse amplitude modulation can provide 1. 47 times bandwidth efficiency than that of on-off keying, 3. 5 times than that of digital pulse interval modulation and 5. 9 times than that of pulse position modulation.

It indicates that <b>return-to-zero</b> pulses are distorted in a similar pattern, therefore bit error rate is better than non-return-to-zero format.
