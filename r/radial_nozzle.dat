The present paper {{is based on}} an investigation of the aeroacoustics and aerodynamics of the high-speed Coanda flow that is formed when a supersonic jet issues from a <b>radial</b> <b>nozzle</b> and adheres to a tulip-shaped body of revolution. Schlieren and other flow visualization techniques together with theoretical methods are used to reveal the various features of this complex flow field. The acoustic characteristics were obtained from measurements with an array of microphones in an anechoic chamber.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} improve the {{trickling}} filter performance by enhancing both the oxygen transfer rate and wetting percent of the media surface this was achieved using <b>radial</b> jet <b>nozzle</b> configuration instead of the conventional circular nozzle. The distributor-offset distance from the bed was taken into consideration as a geometric variable parameter. Two pilot-scale trickling filters were constructed on field to evaluate the effect of <b>radial</b> jet <b>nozzle</b> and offset distance on the trickling filter performance. Results indicated that the distribution system has major effects on the trickling filter performance, and that <b>radial</b> jet <b>nozzle</b> increased BOD removal ratio by approximately 10 % higher than the conventional nozzle for fixed distributor and by approximately 7 % for rotating distributor, <b>radial</b> jet <b>nozzle</b> also enhanced DO % on the filter effluent for fixed distributor but not for the rotating one.

40|$|Wall static {{pressure}} measurements and performance parameters are presented for axisymmetric supersonic nozzles with relatively steep convergent sections and comparatively small radius-of-curvature throats. The nozzle walls were essentially adiabatic. These results are {{compared with those}} obtained in other nozzles tested previously to appraise the influence of contraction shape on performance. Both the flow coefficient and the thrust were less than the corresponding values for one-dimensional, isentropic, plane flow for both the axial and <b>radial</b> inflow <b>nozzles</b> considered, but the specific impulse, the most important performance parameter, {{was found to be}} relatively unchanged. The thrust decrement for the axial inflow nozzles was established primarily by the shape of the contraction section, and could be estimated reasonably well from a conical sink flow consideration.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{nonlinear}} {{finite element analysis}} of pressurized circular toroidal tank with <b>radial</b> flush cylindrical <b>nozzle</b> used for gas fuel tank of personal car. The analysis determines the position of <b>radial</b> cylindrical <b>nozzle</b> that gives the highest limit pressure. Toroidal tank having volume of 45 liters and radius ratio of 3 were used in this analysis. Cylindrical nozzle of 12. 5 mm diameter and 10 mm height was attached in radial direction of toroidal cross section. The position of nozzle was checked for five points: extrados, 450 from extrados, crown, 450 from crown, and intrados. The maximum applied internal pressure was 1. 5 times pressure to yield. Limits pressure were obtained via nonlinear finite element analysis using the well-known Newton-Raphson algorithm with large deformation. It {{was found that the}} best design for nozzle position, indicated by the highest limit pressure, is located at the extrados. For any circumstances, nozzle can be located between extrados and crown, but should not be located between crown and intrados. This result conforms to the membrane theory that the highest stress in toroidal shell under internal pressure occurs at intrados and nozzle shall not be located next to that location...|$|R

These application rates are typical for this type of operation in New Zealand’s planted forests (Rolando et al., 2013). Tartrazine, a colourimetric tracer used to measure spray deposition (Pergher, 2001; Richardson et al., 1989), was added to the herbicide solution at the rate of 0.0042  kg L− 1. The herbicide solution was applied by a Robinson R 44 Raven II helicopter using a 12 -m-long spray boom fitted with 0.047 - 24 tube ACCU-FLO™ <b>radial</b> <b>nozzles</b> (Bishop Equipment Mfg. Inc., PA, USA) that delivered 1400 – 1500 -μm (volume mean diameter) droplets. The swath width was 9  m using a half-overlap spray pattern. The flight direction was predominantly at right angles to the stream for most of the sprayed area. On occasion, flight lines were parallel to the stream, with a release height above ground of 12 – 21  m (40 – 70  ft). Under the Bay of Plenty Regional Air Plan, discharge of agrichemical chemicals from an aircraft must not result in any harmful concentration of agrichemicals into water (Bay of Plenty Regional Council, 2003). In this catchment, a no-spray boundary of approximately 30  m was maintained around the stream margins (Fig.  1). In total, 42  kg of terbuthylazine and 10.5  kg of hexazinone were applied to the land upstream of water-monitoring point 1 (W 1), Fig.  1.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{two studies}} {{of the effects of}} flow control devices on the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a high speed Coanda flow that is formed when a supersonic jet issues from a <b>radial</b> <b>nozzle</b> and adheres to a tulip-shaped body of revolution. Shadowgraphy and other flow-visualization techniques are used to reveal the various features of the complex flow fields. The acoustic characteristics are obtained from far- and near-field measurements with an array of microphones in an anechoic chamber. First the effects of incorporating a step between the annular exit slot and the Coanda surface are investigated. The step is incorporated to ensure that the breakaway pressure is raised to a level well above the maximum operating pressure. It substantially increases the complexity of the flow field and acoustic characteristics. In particular, it promotes the generation of two groups of discrete tones. A theoretical model based on a self-generated feedback loop is proposed to explain how these tones are generated. The second study investigates the effects of replacing the annular exit slot with a saw-toothed one with the ain of eliminating the discrete tones and thereby substantially reducing the level of noise generated.

40|$|In {{designing}} the pressure vessel equipment, the nozzle connection requires a careful study of many regions. One {{of the critical}} aspects in designing pressure vessels is the nozzle connections in the ellipsoidal head of two intersecting shells. Two {{of the most important}} design guide (codes and standards) for {{designing the}} pressure vessel are ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) pressure vessel code and WRC (Welding Research Council) bulletins. Both ASME and WRC standards do not directly address procedures or provide acceptance criteria for the effect of external forces and moments imposed by a piping system to the nozzle, and do not deal with ellipsoidal heads. Therefore, a parametric study was carried out in this research. The aim is to understand the behavior of the nozzle connections in radial and non-radial orientation to ellipsoidal head vessel subjected to the internal pressure and various external loading using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method. All the results analysis for both radial and non-radial nozzle are presented as graphs of non-dimensional parameters against stress concentration factor (SCF) for each load case applied. For validation, an analytical investigation using thin shell theory was utilized for the <b>radial</b> <b>nozzle</b> due to applied internal pressure loading.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of solid rocket motor (SRM) need to predict the internal gas-dynamic phenomena that happen during the SRM operative life. The operative life of a SRM can be divided in a sequence of different phases: the first phase is the ignition transient during which the solid propellant is ignited; the second phase is the quasi-steady phase during which the SRM reaches the design operative conditions; finally there is the combustion-tail during which the combustion of solid propellant extinguishes. The phenomena happening during ignition transient are often more critical than those occurring in the subsequent phases; within {{a fraction of a}} second hot igniter gases flow in the combustion chamber reaching supersonic conditions; pressure jumps of tenths of atmospheres and temperature peaks of thousands of Kelvin degrees can occur. The ignition transient unsteady behaviour can cause net thrust and pressure transients, over-pressure peaks, hang-fires or misfires, propellant grain stresses, dynamic loads on the launch vehicle (and on its payload) and on the ground segment etc [...] . All the above phenomena can compromise the performances of the SRM and often the successful of the launch. The study of the SRM ignition transient is the research background of this Ph. D. dissertation. It is common and well confirmed practice in industry to analyze ignition transient using zero-dimensional, volume-filling or one-dimensional physical models, and only recently two-dimensional approaches can be found. Presently the increasing of the computational capabilities allows to a fully three-dimensional study. The reasons to develop a three-dimensional model are numerous: first of all the combustion chamber of a common SRM has often a three-dimensional geometry; second the igniter nozzles has a three-dimensional configuration with both axial and <b>radial</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Therefore the gas-dynamic phenomena generated by the igniter jets have strong three-dimensional behaviour that is impossible to study by means of a non fully three-dimensional model. The aim of this research is to present and provide suitable three-dimensional model and numerical tools able to describe the SRM ignition transient with particular interest to study the gasdynamical aspects of SRM ignition transient...|$|R

40|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} pressure {{is a crucial}} variable for turbocharged Diesel engines, affecting the torque production and the emissions through variations in the EGR mass flow and in the residual mass fraction in the cylinder. This variable is therefore considered very relevant for closed-loop EGR and turbocharger control. However, in production applications, {{the cost of the}} pressure sensor and the particularly harsh environment where this must work are practical barriers to its actual implementation. Therefore, the need for a rapid, reliable and robust estimation of this variable from low-cost production sensors is strong, above all, in the contest of advanced engine powertrains. This work describes the development of an estimator for the {{exhaust manifold}} pressure in a turbocharged Diesel engine with two-stage turbocharger. The approach proposed relies on a feed-forward scheme based on the inversion of a two-stage turbocharger model, which includes the <b>radial</b> turbines, <b>nozzles</b> and valves.

The present study is an attempt to enhance distribution system efficiency, so the trickling filter performance by using <b>Radial</b> Jet <b>Nozzle</b> (RJN) configuration instead of conventional circular nozzle.

40|$|Tests {{results at}} the NASA Langley Research Center, {{involving}} a Mach 3. 5 pilot quiet tunnel, {{have shown that}} laminar-layered nozzle walls improve boundary layer stability and reduce stream disturbance levels caused by eddy Mach wave radiation. This type of wall design is required to obtain transition Reynolds numbers on tests models as high as those previously observed in supersonic flight vehicles. The Mach 3. 5 pilot nozzle wall boundary layers were tested for Tollmein-Schlichting and Goertler linear amplification, and, {{in an analysis of}} Goertler vortices in two axisymmetric Mach 5 nozzles, transition values were found to vary. These values were applied to several nozzles with similar throat heights but different expansion rates. Among the nozzles included in the study, a flat-wall <b>radial</b> flow <b>nozzle</b> and a proposed rod-wall nozzle were tested.

As preliminary design correlations and standards usually taken into consideration arise from fixed nominal geometry radial turbines studies, they need to be updated with regard to nozzle off-design opening configurations. This paper provides some theoretical basics in order to help designers considering variable geometry problems. Some complementary elements about the dimensionless methods are given by taking into account the nozzle opening effect. Then useful considerations are brought regarding the preliminary design of variable geometry radial turbines with multi-points specifications...|$|R

In the mist lubrication mode, cooling air was supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the out of mesh location of the gear sets. The mist air was also supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the <b>radial</b> position mist <b>nozzle</b> at a constant rate of 0. 0632 mol/s (3 SCFM) per nozzle. The lubricant contained in the mist air varied between 32 - 44 cc/hour. In the recirculating jet spray mode, the flow rate was varied between 1893 - 2650 cc/hour. Visual inspection revealed the jet spray mode produced a superior surface finish on the gear teeth but a thermal energy survey showed a 15 - 20 % increase in heat generated.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{development of}} four computer models of resistojet nozzle performance is reported. Five main energy loss processes are accounted for; these are (i) frozen chemical rate processes, (ii) finite rate vibrational relaxation, (iii) incomplete expansion, (iv) viscous flow and (v) <b>radial</b> flow. The <b>nozzle</b> flow {{is assumed to}} be composed of an inviscid core and a viscous boundary layer, where the boundary layer is represented by the patching together of similar solutions of the laminar boundary layer equations. General similar boundary layer equations have been developed which include the radial dependences accounting for transverse curvature. Four simplified classes of similar equations are identified, and extensive solutions have been obtained for the Falkner-Skan equation and a modified Falkner-Skan equation which includes the effects of transverse curvature, over the range of pressure gradient parameter, g, from 0. to 10. Vibrational relaxation is modelled by using an approximate sudden freezing criterion. Performance predictions are presented for H 2, CH 4, CO 2 and NH 3 for plenum temperatures extending from 300 to 3000 °K and plenum pressures from 200 to 10 kNm- 2.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the hybrid rocket {{propulsion}} {{has been known for}} a long time. In the case of HRE one propellant is liquid while another is solid. Therefore HRE can potentially have the advantages of solid and liquid rocket engines simultaneously. The attribution for reaching these advantages lies in the injection unit. The injection system is the main and practically the only system of control of a HRE. Therefore the injection unit defines the thrust and performance of HRE. The current status of HRE technology in Europe is sounding rockets and sub-scale ground tests. In order to pass on technology with real application, the European Commission supports the Operational Research Project on Hybrid Engines in Europe ORPHEE within the 7 th Framework Program (FP 7). The project aims to develop HRE technology, where the first applications of the technology could be booster engine and upper stage engine. The aim of this work is to contribute to the ORPHEE project by collecting and presenting {{the current state of the}} art. It is clear that the HRE specifies has specific requirements with regard to the injection system different from those for current liquid rocket engines and demand a unique injection system. Thus the dawn of this work is to review the existing LRPE injection systems and determination of kinetics of the liquid phase in the combustion chamber of HRE. The kinetics of the liquid phase in the hybrid engine, the different types of jet and liquid sheet break-up are examined. Furthermore a correlation between the different atomization processes over a wide range of dimensionless numbers is made. One of the main distinctive features of hybrid engines is the possibility of thrust variation. The different types of injection, which are used in rocketry, have been considered in this study. In case of hybrid engines shower head, self impinging, swirl injectors, and their combinations can be utilized. The atomization characteristics are defined by Reynolds and Weber numbers, which are dependent on pressure drop, injector design and properties of liquid propellant. The range of Reynolds and Weber numbers, in which the injector operates, defines the break-up regime of the jet (in showerhead injectors) or of the sheet (in impinging jet and swirl injectors) and defines the maximum size of the droplets injected into combustion chamber with the solid propellant. However, in order to choose the injector that gives the best droplets distribution, it is necessary to know the grain configuration. In a hybrid engine it is very important to achieve uniform distribution of liquid propellant over the whole surface of solid propellant. From this study, the swirl injector offers more than others because its characteristics are stable and can be varied over a broad range of parameters. Varying the parameters of swirl injection (tangential and <b>radial</b> velocity, <b>nozzle</b> angle) it is possible to get the desired distribution of liquid phase in a short combustion chamber. In the case of a long solid grain a uniform distribution can be achieved using a combination of swirl and impinging jet injectors. However, the choice of one type of injection gives a clear connection between the parameters of injectors and the desired combustion characteristics...|$|R
