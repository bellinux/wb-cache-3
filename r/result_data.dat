25|$|It is {{difficult}} to obtain reliable estimates concerning {{the number of children}} trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice. It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a <b>result,</b> <b>data</b> can seem both inadequate and outdated. This process of gathering data is only {{complicated by the fact that}} very few countries publish national estimates of child trafficking. As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.|$|E

50|$|New {{ideas for}} {{manufacturing}} processes (for new goods/commodities or improved manufacturing) are often based on, or {{can at least}} benefit from, previous developments and recipes already in use. The same is true when developing new devices, for example, a MEMS sensor or actuator. A PDES offers {{an easy way to}} access these previous developments in a structured manner. Information can be retrieved faster, and previous results can be taken into account more efficiently. A PDES typically offers means to display and search for <b>result</b> <b>data</b> from different viewpoints, and to categorise the data according different aspects. These functionalities are applied to all <b>result</b> <b>data,</b> such as materials, process steps, machines, experiments, documents and pictures. The PDES also provides a way to relate entities belonging to the same or similar context and to explore the resulting information.|$|E
