50|$|The 1915 batch (Classified 52 and 502) had direct motion, without rocker arms, driving {{inclined}} piston valves, and Robinson superheater. The only external {{difference was}} that the shaft and <b>reversing</b> <b>rod</b> were a little higher {{which resulted in the}} rear of the left hand side sandbox rod being inclined upwards from the centre sandbox back to the firebox.|$|E
50|$|In this {{mechanism}} the <b>reversing</b> <b>rod</b> {{is controlled by}} a screw and nut, worked by a wheel in the cab. The nut either operates on the <b>reversing</b> <b>rod</b> directly or through a lever, as above. The screw and nut may be cut with a double thread and a coarse pitch to move the mechanism as quickly as possible. The wheel is fitted with a locking lever to prevent creep {{and there is an}} indicator to show the percentage of cutoff in use. This method of altering the cutoff offers finer control than the sector lever, but it has the disadvantage of slow operation. It is most suitable for long-distance passenger engines where frequent changes of cutoff are not required and where fine adjustments offer the most benefit. On locomotives fitted with Westinghouse air brake equipment and Stephenson valve gear, it was common to use the screw housing as an air cylinder, with the nut extended to form a piston. Compressed air from the brake reservoirs was applied {{to one side of the}} piston to reduce the effort required to lift the heavy expansion link, with gravity assisting in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The <b>reversing</b> <b>rod</b> (with its lifting arm), needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: Hängeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the lifting arm to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the lifting arm.|$|E

Bacteriol. 91 : 125 – 128. 1966. —Spheroplasts of Escherichia coli B- 054 {{were formed}} by penicillin, and {{the properties of}} <b>rod</b> cells <b>reversed</b> from the spheroplasts were examined. It {{was found that the}} rod cells were not capable of forming colonies when placed in a minimal medium immediately after the reversion, the postaddition of the nutrient to this medium being without effect. In this respect, the so-called residual cells which did not convert to spheroplasts by penicillin treatment behaved just as the <b>reversed</b> <b>rod</b> cells. These two types of cells, the <b>reversed</b> and residual <b>rod</b> cells, however, could grow up to form colonies when they were cultivated in a complex medium immediately after the reversion. The nutrient requirement and penicillin sensitivity of the progeny of these cells were found to be quite {{similar to those of the}} original untreated cells. Accordingly, it was concluded that the nutritional defect induced by penicillin treatment was not a hereditary change...|$|R

50|$|The {{two sets}} of valve gear were of {{identical}} Walschaerts design. Each set of valve gear was controlled by two overhead camshafts coupled and balanced with an inside <b>rod.</b> <b>Reversing</b> was achieved with a screw and wheel. With a fully open regulator, live steam was supplied to the low-pressure cylinders by an automatic throttle.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} common form of reverser. It {{consists}} of a long lever mounted, parallel to the direction of travel, on the driver’s side of the cab. It has a handle and sprung trigger at the top and is pivoted at the bottom so as to pass between two notched sector plates. The <b>reversing</b> <b>rod,</b> which connects to the valve gear, is attached to this lever, either above or below the pivot, in such a position as to give good leverage. A square pin is arranged so as to engage with the notches in the plates and hold the lever in the desired position when the trigger is released.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{increases}} in glucocorticoids (GCs) during a perceived stressful event are functionally important for many biological processes that include energy homeostasis. Perpetual hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HP. A) axis activity continually elevates GC secretion and may induce many metabolic complications, such as peripheral insulin resistance, ectopic fat accumulation, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia that can increase risks of developing {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM). The progression into T 2 DM remains complex and many controversies hav 1 e yet to be resolved. In particular, the effect of GCs on pancreatic islet function remains relatively understudied. Therefore, {{we set out to}} develop a novel rodent model ofT 2 DM in young male Sprague-Dawley rats. First, we demonstrated that 2 weeks of elevated GCs and HFD induced rapid-onset diabetes (ROD), which included the following symptoms: body weight loss, hepatic steatosis, increased glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and ectopic fat accumulation. Next, we further examined the effects of ROD on pancreatic islet function and found that ROD animals had increased β-and α-cell mass, but impaired β-cell glucose responsiveness, resulting in hyperglycemia. Regular exercise restores alterations in HPA activity and helps to protect against GC-induced hyperglycemia. This led us to investigate if regular exercise in our ROD model would help to protect against T 2 DM development. We found that volitional exercise was sufficient to attenuate symptoms of ROD, however not all symptoms were successfully restored, i. e. normalized glucose control and peripheral insulin resistance. We next investigated if pharmacologic agents would be able to fully <b>reverse</b> <b>ROD.</b> We demonstrated that non-selective GC receptor (GRII) antagonist fully normalized our ROD phenotype, whereas selective GRII antagonists only partially attenuated some of the ROD symptoms. Collectively, these studies take an integrative approach to T 2 DM development induced by GCs and HFD. We developed a model that mimics symptoms ofT 2 DM and concluded that GCs and HFD synergistically, not independently act to induce severe insulin resistance that burdens islet adaptive capacity. Regular exercise and pharmacological interventions were sufficient to attenuate ROD development and these therapies may be useful techniques to individuals suffering from HPA axis hyperactivity and dyslipidemia...|$|R
30|$|Added mass impulse {{and drag}} impulse are {{considerably}} {{larger than those}} by buoyancy and surface tension impulses. Among the two impulses, while drag impulse is larger than added mass impulse for short rod lengths, magnitudes of the two impulses <b>reversed</b> for long <b>rod</b> lengths. However, buoyancy impulse and surface tension impulse gradually increased according to the increase of the rod length. The maximum momentary forces did not significantly decrease according to the increase of a rod; the duration time of the force, on the other hand, increased considerably. The increased duration time of the force is a key factor to increase the impulse for the larger rod. A high impulse contributes to increased jumping height of a jumping object.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} change of the {{relative}} magnitudes of force and impulse components generated by the rotational motion of a hydrophobic carbon rod moving into water from the water surface, by varying the rod length. Whereas added mass force and drag force were dominant regardless of the rod length, buoyancy force and surface tension force were relatively small. For relatively short rod lengths (2, 4, 6  cm), drag forces were larger than added mass forces {{in the beginning of}} the rotational motion; the magnitudes of the two forces, however, reversed during the rotation. It was found that the reversals of magnitudes of the two forces occurred when the velocity at the end of the rod was 0.5  m/s. On the other hand, for a long rod length of 8  cm, added mass force was higher than drag force throughout the rod motion. The change of impulse by varying the rod length showed a similar tendency to that of force. Added mass impulse and drag impulse were also considerably larger than buoyancy impulse and surface tension impulse. Furthermore, drag impulse was larger than added mass impulse for short rod lengths, and the magnitudes of the two impulses <b>reversed</b> for long <b>rod</b> lengths. Compared to the shorter rod, the larger rod has a relatively low momentary force, but its force has much larger duration time, resulting in an increase of impulse.|$|R
40|$|Mir M 7 is a {{spontaneous}} morphologically conditional mutant of Klebsiella pneumoniae which grows as round cells (cocci) at pH 7 and as normal rods at pH 5. 8. We studied {{the rates of}} peptidoglycan synthesis of cocci and rods growing at pH values of 7 and 5. 8, respectively. It was found that exponentially growing cocci produced a reduced amount of peptidoglycan per cell, compared with rods. Moreover, a shift of cocci to the permissive pH (5. 8) caused {{an increase in the}} rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, whereas the <b>reverse</b> shift of <b>rods</b> to pH 7 determined a twofold reduction in the rate of [3 H]diaminopimelic acid incorporation. During synchronous growth at pH 7, the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis after cell division decreased with time and rose before and during the first division. The susceptibilities of rods and cocci to β-lactam antibiotics were also studied. It was found that cocci were more sensitive both to penicillin G and to cephalexin than were rods, but they showed a high level of resistance to mecillinam. The peculiar behavior of this mutant was interpreted as supporting the existence in bacterial rods of two different sites for peptidoglycan synthesis: one responsible for lateral wall elongation and one responsible for septum formation. In Mir M 7, shape damage is described as dependent on the specific inhibition, at the nonpermissive pH, of the site for lateral wall extension...|$|R
