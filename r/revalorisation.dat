50|$|The Catalan {{literary}} tradition is extensive, {{starting in the}} early Middle Ages. A Romantic revivalist movement of the 19th century, Renaixença, classified Catalan literature in periods. The centuries long chapter known as Decadència that followed {{the golden age of}} Valencian literature, was perceived as extremely poor and lacking literary works of quality. Further attempts to explain why this happened (see History of Catalonia) have motivated new critical studies of the period, and nowadays a <b>revalorisation</b> of this early modern age is taking place. Catalan literature reemerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to experience troubled times {{from the start of the}} Spanish Civil War on. Many intellectuals were forced into exile and Catalan culture was repressed. However, this repression began to temper after the end of World War II. Many measures were introduced soon to protect and promote the Catalan language, such as the creation of official contests to award the best literary works in Catalan.|$|E

40|$|Manorial {{estate in}} Konarzewo {{has a long}} and rich history. It is a very {{valuable}} object, from the architectural, landscape and historical point of view. Konarzewo was a residence of well-known ancient noble families: Konarzewski, Radomicki, Działyński, Dzieduszycki and Czartoryski. After 1945 the manorial estate was nationalised, and until 1992 was administrated by the local State Agricultural Farm (PGR). Wrong decisions made by PGR administration and negligence of historical values caused devastation of the palace, park and manor farm. In spite of it the palace and park still exist. In 2013 the palace and park were returned to the Czartoryski’s family successors. Now the estate needs <b>revalorisation.</b> In 2011 / 12 both a park inventory, historical studies and project of <b>revalorisation</b> were made...|$|E

40|$|Property-led urban {{redevelopment}} in contemporary Chinese cities {{often results in}} the demolition of many historical buildings and neighbourhoods, invoking criticisms from conservationists. In the case of Beijing, the municipal government produced a series of documents in the early 2000 s to implement detailed plans to conserve 25 designated historic areas in the Old City of Beijing. This paper aims to examine the recent socio-economic and spatial changes that took place within government-designated conservation areas, and scrutinise {{the role of the}} local state and real estate capital that brought about these changes. Based on recent field visits and semi-structured interviews with local residents and business premises in a case study area, this paper puts forward two main arguments. First, Beijing’s urban conservation policies enabled the intervention of the local state to facilitate <b>revalorisation</b> of dilapidated historic quarters and to release dilapidated courtyard houses on the real estate market. The <b>revalorisation</b> was possible with the participation of a particular type of real estate capital that had interests in the aesthetic value that historic quarters and traditional courtyard houses provided. Second, the paper also argues that economic benefits generated by urban conservation, if any, were shared disproportionately among local residents, and that local residents’ lack of opportunities to ‘voice out’ further consolidated the property-led characteristic of urban conservation, which failed to pay attention to social lives...|$|E
40|$|Realising {{tourism in}} the context of {{responsibility}} is a problem of historical-social and economic time-space continuum; the problem of possibility of temporal unification of these parts. The study aims to emphasize that the essence of problem can only be understood in the depth of a general problematic of tourism, as a question of temporalisation of historical-social space, which, however, leads to a grand question of today: does the human activity which creates temporalised spaces have its own gravitational direction? Ad deliberandum. The study proposes the viewpoint that the context of responsibility requires overcoming the dimension of interpretation where the subject is understood as an ultimate human-singularity and a perfect match of responsibility with a dominant and current form of temporalisation of time suggests a paradigm of participating consciousness, the consciousness of unity, which, in Berdyaev's words, is never logical, but existential. The study, {{on the basis of a}} meticulous studying of a new narrative of tourism, primarily due to volume restrictions does not go beyond presenting the key attributes of this ever-expanding understanding of tourism - with a demonstration of a concrete practice - but all this with an emphasis that qualification of the actors' activities is possible only along the lines of a previous consideration of comprehension of structure of space and time - along the <b>revalorisation</b> of a motivational horison (Anzenbacher, A 1987, 264. p.) and also the very term of responsibility and freedom. Responsibility can only then become an orientation of tourist activities, if the primary focus is set on re-comprehension (<b>revalorisation)</b> of civilisational legacies in a timeless perspective...|$|E
40|$|The {{palace and}} garden complex in Otwock Wielki is {{situated}} in the Masovian voivodeship, southeast of Warsaw. The palace complex with the main garden establishment on the island on the Rokola Lake {{is an example of}} a classic late baroque garden from the turn of the 17 th cen­tury. The main goal of the study was to analyse the spatial composition and scenic connections of the palace and garden complex and to identify the accumulations from later transformations. The achievement of those goals might be used for determination of the bases of protection and cre­ation of the cultural landscape of this region and for <b>revalorisation</b> of the palace and garden complex in Otwock Wielki. As results from the field investigations and cartographic analyses of archival materials, the estate has retained numerous elements of a regular garden within the garden on the island. Apart from that, the accumulations of later transformations and the effects of <b>revalorisation</b> made after 1945 are still noticeable. Simple dimensional relationships are noticeable in the composition. They are based on the module making the width of the main frontal façade of the palace, whereas major nodes of the composition could be found in the avant-corps of the palace front, in the fountain in the garden salon and at the junctions of main roads. The modifications of the module segments marking the lengths and widths of the composition elements changed at the 1  :  2 ratio. The main spatial elements were laid out according to the golden ratio proportions.

40|$|Abstract: Throughout Europe great {{efforts are}} made at present {{the moment in}} the {{specific}} area of river restorations. Large and numerous river restoration projects are currently carried out for example in Switzer-land where the Federal Law on hydraulic engineering (1991) explicitly calls for measures in regard to flood security in combination with an ecological <b>revalorisation</b> of the river space. This study presents the main results of two case studies on participation and decision-making aspects in regard to river restoration projects at the Swiss rivers Thur and Flaz. Standardised surveys, direct observation of the decision making procedure and qualitative interviews with the local public, representatives of stakeholder {{groups as well as}} decision makers were carried out. The results of these two case studies identify important social factors that need to be taken into consideration when designing and implementing integrated and participatory decisional procedures for water systems planning.

This book charts the deployment of that concept {{by some of the}} most influential philosophers and literary theorists of the modern period, including Heidegger, Adorno, Blanchot, Derrida, Agamben, Vattimo, and Badiou. Focusing in particular on the ways in which each of these deployments involves both a countering redetermination of nihilism and a privileging of a certain concept of the literary for what is taken to be its power of resistance to it, this book proposes neither a critique nor a <b>revalorisation</b> of nihilism; rather, it explores through an historical, conceptual, and philological anaysis the various ways in which nihilism, as what Nietzsche terms the ‘uncanniest of all guests’, returns to haunt the thought of those who would counter it...|$|E

Analysis of ubiquitous secondary metabolites in RSP samples (two breeds, harvested in 2012 / 2014 respectively from North East of Scotland) and their ethanol/water (95 : 5) Soxhlet extracts were carried out. Soxhlet extraction of the RSP (petroleum ether followed by 95 % ethanol) gave a solid extract. LC-MS/MS data of the extracts revealed several secondary metabolites, with Sinapic acid being the most abundant.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study Negritude as literary movement expressed through the words of Aimé Césaire in his poetry Cahier d’un retours au pays natal. The relation between the poetry and historical events {{as well as the}} relation between the poetry and the author are examined. The analysis is conducted from the book chosen extracts that are examined in relation to identified characteristics of the negritude movement and the poetic expression. The analysis shows that the poetry of Aimé Césaire expresses fundamental values and attributes found within the negritude movement. The language used in the poetry is aggressive and to some extent contradictory. The "I" and "me" have {{a central role in the}} poetry when expressing negritude values and attributes.

The rebuilding of the Palace took place in several phases, an examination of which reveals changes in relations between the Senate and the state architects, as well as how these changes were reflected {{in the nature of the}} work itself.

40|$|Much gender theorising, I shall argue, is in {{an impasse}} from which {{critical}} realism indicates a way out. In the heyday of second wave feminism, structural inequalities such as women’s under-representation in political and economic leadership, their lower pay, sexual objectification, and widespread violence by men against women, were seen as in need of explanation, the better to transform them. ‘Radical ’ or ‘revolutionary ’ feminists saw these inequalities as symptoms of the enduring differences between women and men, while liberal, Marxist and socialist feminists understood them as resulting from a motivated refusal to acknowledge the similarities. All saw womanhood {{as a basis for}} grounded solidarity – at least while the oppression of women persisted. To end it, different sources of power had to be mobilised. For radical feminism, the power of women, united across all differences to refuse co-operation with the patriarchy, could bring about a cultural <b>revalorisation</b> of the subordinate terms in the repeated dualisms of Western thought: man, woman; culture, nature; human, animal; reason, emotion.

Two pilot-scale ADs treating food waste were monitored for 225 days, with the test unit being periodically injected with CO 2 using a bubble column.

40|$|The period {{since the}} 1960 s has been characterised by growing {{societal}} concern with urban heritage protection {{and the development}} of legislative, fiscal and urban planning instruments that seek to ensure the protection and enhancement of historic buildings and environments. International organisations such as UNESCO and European level documents such as the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) have stressed the cultural and economic value of the ‘wise management of natural and cultural heritage’. Since the 1970 s many cities have sought to redefine and regenerate themselves through a <b>revalorisation</b> of their past and the protection and enhancement of their historic urban landscapes. Urban heritage has thus often come {{to be seen as a}} component of the territorial capital of places, and often had a symbiotic relationship with the objective of urban regeneration.

The influence of each of these processing parameters on the cracking gas and liquid yield patterns were studied and presented.

40|$|The {{geography}} of financial exclusion has mainly focused on exclusion from retail banking. Alternatively, {{and following the}} work of David Harvey, this paper presents a {{geography of}} access to and exclusion from home mortgage finance. The case of Milan shows that capital switching to the built environment is partly a sign of economic crisis and partly {{a sign of the}} intrinsic opportunities that the built environment provides. A major factor in both is the deregulation of the mortgage market that has enabled the loosening of historically stringent lending criteria, leading to a tremendous growth of the mortgage market, while leaving the co-evolution of family and home ownership intact. In addition, capital switches within sectors of the economy and between places. In Milan, once "unattractive" but currently gentrified nineteenth-century districts underwent cycles of devalorisation and <b>revalorisation.</b> Even though access to mortgages has increased throughout Milan, geographical disparities in mortgage lending persist: at present, yellowlining (differential access, based on less favourable terms) is common in parts of the Milanese periphery. The creation of boundaries makes the realisation of class-monopoly rent possible; while the subsequent redrawing of these boundaries creates new submarkets in which surplus value can be extracted. Based on the Milan case, one cannot explain the timing and geography of formation and reformation of submarkets in other cities, but it helps us to see how Harvey's abstract ideas of class-monopoly rent, submarket creation, and capital switching take place in the real world.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was the characterisation of Vicia faba (broadbean) protein isolates and related fractions in order to determine whether this grain legume could be used for production of high quality protein products and other fractions rich in functional components. Alkaline extraction of the defatted seed flour, followed by precipitation at the isoelectric pH, yielded a 92 % protein isolate with a high oil absorption capacity. The contents of the favism-inducing glycosides, vicine and convicine, in the isolate were reduced by more than 99 % as compared to the original flour, although the amino acid composition was {{similar to that of the}} flour. Some of the by-products of protein isolate production may also be of interest from a nutritional and functional point of view. Thus, the oil resulting from hexane extraction of the flour is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, and polyphenols (resulting from extraction of the defatted flour with acetone) showed a high ABTS radical-scavenging activity. In addition, the solid residue (resulting from protein solubilisation) was high in fibre and showed good water absorption. These results show good nutritional and functional properties in V. faba protein isolates and related fractions, which may favour the <b>revalorisation</b> of this traditional bean crop. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Copyright © Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, NY, USA, LLC ISSN: 1465 - 0045 print / 1557 - 3028 online DOI: 10. 1080 / 14650040601031123 International audienceIn Latin America, post–Cold War {{ideas about}} defence and {{security}} broke down geopolitical logics that had been historically accepted by Latin American armed forces. These ideas also provoked a partial downfall of one component of their traditional strategic representations: This geopolitical determinism explained post-colonial conflicts as being due to historical influences and to disputes about power and territory. Paradoxically, national frontiers are emerging and are threatened by destabilisation. The new conception of the border and its <b>revalorisation</b> at the strategic level must be related {{not only to the}} character of post–Cold War threats but also to the new security vision prevailing in the international system. This vision cannot be separated from US strategic representations, which emphasise the “global” character of risks and security mechanisms. Thus, it appears that the transnational dimension of the strategic representations promoted by the United States does not correspond to the traditional concept of national territory. This concept, which is the basis of the reshuffling of military architecture in Latin America after the Cold War, is rooted in a representation of the region that has been present since the 1940 s but was systematised under the Democratic Clinton Administration in the 1990 s and further developed under the presidency of Republican George W. Bush in the early twenty-first century...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeit dem späten 18. Jahrhundert leidet die Philosophie an einer "Identitätskrise" und andere Disziplinen bedrohen sie au ihrem eigenen Gebiet. Besonders die Literatur beschäftgt sich seitdem zunehmend mit Fragen, die traditionell zum Tätigkeitsbereich der Philosophie gehörten. Dabei scheint es einen Zusammenhang zu geben zwxischen der Krise der Metaphysik und einer erkenntnistheoretischen Aufwertung der Kunst und besonders der Literatur. So zeigt ein Blick auf Werke wie die von Friedrich Schlegel oder Sören Kierkegaard, dass deren literarischer Stil in philosophischen Erwägungen gründet. Zugleich wird aber auch erkennbar, dass es sich nicht um eine Rivalität zwischen Philosophie und Literatur handeln muss, sondern dass die Literatur als Komplement der Philosophie einspringen kann, um die Grenzen des Sagbaren neu zu ziehen. Since {{the late}} 18 th century {{philosophy}} {{suffers from a}} “crisis of identity” and other disciplines menace philosophy on her own “territory”. Literature, in particular, deals increasingly with genuinely philosophical questions. There {{seems to be a}} close interconnection between the crisis of metaphysics and the epistemological <b>revalorisation</b> of the Arts and namely, of literature. Literature, one might think, is defying philosophy’s competency on issues of knowledge and of meaning. If a closer look reveals that indeed new literary styles of writings such as Friedrich Schlegel’s or Søren Kierkegaard’s find their roots in the crisis of philosophy, it uncovers {{at the same time that}} this does not necessarily mean that one has to speak of a “rivalry” between philosophy and literature. Rather one could ask if philosophy, confronted with the problem of the “ineffable”, wouldn’t have to evolve into literature to remain philosophy...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the informal learning of global citizenship {{in the course}} of social struggle within grassroots movements, through an ethnographic case study of the Save the Narmada Movement (NBA). The movment, comprising village communities in India, campaigned with the support of international non-governmental organisations to prevent the construction of a World Bank (WB) financed dam. The study arises in response to a perceived marginalisation of grassroots resistances, especially in developing contexts, within empirical accounts of global civil society (GCS), which is conceptualised as a space where 'global citizens' seek to resist and transform the exigencies of economic globalisation. Interrogating the validity of this exclusion, a Gramscian framework is adopted to examine whether, and in what ways grassroots actors are global citizens, engaged in the transformative politics of GCS. Analysis of data emerging from NBA suggests that contestation with political structures at the national (Indian government) and global (WB) level is an important source of learning that leads to the construction of a movement's global citizenship. Through a Gramscian dialectical process of strategic action and reflection, the movement developed a critical awareness of the class character of these institutions, leading NBA to connect its local struggle against the dam to wider struggle against `destructive development and globalisation. This process encouraged a <b>revalorisation</b> of grassroots participants' subjective relationships to the nation-state, leading amongst some, to the rejection of national citizenship in favour of global affiliations. Articulation of global citizenship was based on a counter-hegemonic identification with struggles of the oppressed across the world, rather than a depoliticised 'moral universalism'. However, learning to extend global citizenship to challenging oppression embedded within movement communities is constrained in a context where unity against external oppressors is paramount. By examining the learning processes that led NBA to articulate and perform global citizenship in empowering ways, the thesis points to how grassroots movements are constructing GCS, and therefore contests their current marginalisation within GCS perspectives...|$|E
40|$|Because of new {{possibilities}} of media consumption {{in a digital}} age, the re-theorisation of online audiences is essential. However, research focusing on the reception of cultural content on the Internet has been mainly focused on “fans” (Costello & Moore, 2007) with the risk of making these intensive users pass for the average consumer (Hermes, 1993; 2009). In {{the case of the}} consumption of TV series online, selection processes (finding a TV series you like, in the language that you want, in a particular format, etc.) make it possible to theorise this audience as participative and interactive, even if their practices are not always as spectacular as the most celebrated forms of interactivity (content discussion and production on social media and forums). This research focuses on students living in Brussels consuming fictional TV on the Internet, using illegal services to do so. Through a methodology combining online observation, an online survey (n= 600 +), structured media diaries (n= 20) and in-depth interviews (n= 20), this presentation aims to discuss the possibilities of reconceptualising audiences as well as the very definitions of interactivity and culture. Preliminary results of this study show a demanding audience {{not only in terms of}} which TV series they are willing to consume but also in terms of the language and subtitles of the content consumed and the flexibility to chose the time of consumption. Furthermore, we see small signs of participation and activity on social media. According to the data, we argue that the consumption of TV series on the Internet using illegal services can be regarded as an act of audience activity and interactivity leading to a <b>revalorisation</b> of television cultural products.

40|$|In this paper, I {{claim that}} modern {{technology}} possesses certain general ‘onto-formative’ characteristics that indicate that our contemporary technological condition now defies orthodox theoretical forms of comprehension. In {{the light of}} this claim, I will propose that any adequate conceptual understanding of modern technics requires a decisive shift of disciplinary register: specifically, towards theology and {{to the formation of}} new philosophical paradigms founded upon metaphysically-inspired interpretations of the ‘total significance’ of modern technics. Such theological conceptions, I will argue, emerge from a startling recognition of modern technics’ incipient association with the infinite, the transcendent as well as with its capacity to “bring new worlds into existence”. I attempt this, in the first instance, by drawing upon the work of two major thinkers who I believe paved the way towards just such a theological conception: Martin Heidegger and Ernst Jünger. In a non-standard interpretation of their respective philosophies of technology, I will go on to claim that these two thinkers should be viewed as attempting to find a way towards a “radically conservative” <b>revalorisation</b> of ancient theological truths that they believed could provide 20 th century modernity with the philosophical groundwork for a new techno-political order that they posited in contrast to a dying Platonic Christian civilisation. For both of these thinkers a theological understanding of modern technics created the possibility of a new spiritual condition/zeitgeist where the very idea of modern technology is rearticulated as the focal point of a post-Platonic-Christian social imaginary that they believed to be revolutionary in its necessarily destructive relationship to extant historical worlds and their corresponding traditions. By these lights, I suggest, that modern social imaginary can only be con conceived within a new theological synthesis that transcends the Platonic/Christian dichotomy of techne and theoria - of the worker and the philosopher/ priest - in a way that allows for the poetic root of both to be revealed in its primal, world-constituting, form. I will conclude with a brief comparison between these ‘pagan’ conceptions of technology and contemporary Christian theological conceptions which have been acutely aware of the highly ambiguous position of modern technics within Christian metaphysical schemes and the need to reform these in the light the manifestly destructive potential of modern forms of technological innovation...|$|E
