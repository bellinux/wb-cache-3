In field studies wheat and rye were sown for crop rotation and were incorporated to the soil in different densities at harvest time. Wheat or rye plants were incorporated to the soil in the following forms, in order to have different densities of straws: a. straw after normal harvest; b. straw of the half plant; c. straw of all plant without spike. After that plots treated with different straw applications were divided into the subplots and sown with sunflower, maize and tomato. The effect of straw treatments on weeds and crops were observed by the comparison with non treated plots.

60|$|Friday, October 1st.--I {{have been}} looking at our four swine,--not of the last lot, but those in process of fattening. They lie among the clean <b>rye</b> <b>straw</b> in the sty, {{nestling}} close together; for they seem to be beasts sensitive to the cold, and this is a clear, bright, crystal morning, with a cool northwest-wind. So there lie these four black swine, as deep among the straw as they can burrow, the very symbols of slothful ease and sensuous comfort. They seem to be actually oppressed and overburdened with comfort. They are quick to notice any one's approach, and utter a low grunt thereupon,--not drawing a breath for that particular purpose, but grunting with their ordinary breath,--at the same time turning an observant, though dull and sluggish eye upon the visitor. They seem to be involved and buried in their own corporeal substance, and to look dimly forth at the outer world. They breathe not easily, and yet not with difficulty nor discomfort; for the very unreadiness and oppression with which their breath cones appears to make them sensible of the deep sensual satisfaction which they feel. Swill, the remnant of their last meal, remains in the trough, denoting that their food is more abundant than even a hog can demand. Anon they fall asleep, drawing short and heavy breaths, which heave their huge sides up and down; but at the slightest noise they sluggishly unclose their eyes, and give another gentle grunt. They also grunt among themselves, without any external cause; but merely to express their swinish sympathy. I suppose it is the knowledge that these four grunters are doomed to die within two or three weeks that gives them a sort of awfulness in my conception. It makes me contrast their present gross substance of fleshly life with the nothingness speedily to come. Meantime the four newly bought pigs are running about the cow-yard, lean, active, shrewd, investigating everything, as their nature is. When I throw an apple among them, they scramble with one another for the prize, and the successful one scampers away to eat it at leisure. They thrust their snouts into the mud, and pick a grain of corn out of the rubbish. Nothing within their sphere do they leave unexamined, grunting all the time with infinite variety of expression. Their language is the most copious of that of any quadruped, and, indeed, there is something deeply and indefinably interesting in the swinish race. They appear the more a mystery the longer one gazes at them. It seems as if there were an important meaning to them, if one could but find it out. One interesting trait in them is their perfect independence of character. They care not for man, and will not adapt themselves to his notions, as other beasts do; but are true to themselves, and act out their hoggish nature.|$|E

He wound paper around a pencil to make a thin tube, slid out the pencil from one end, and applied glue between the strips. He later refined it by building a machine that would coat the outside of the paper with wax to hold it together, so the glue wouldn't dissolve in bourbon.|$|R

40|$|Glyphosate, a broad spectrum, non-selective herbicide, is the world´s most {{important}} and widely used herbicide. The globally increasing adoption of no-till or reduced tillage systems is becoming a driving force for enhanced glyphosate use. In such systems, glyphosate is applied pre-sowing for weed control and glyphosate may remain in root and shoot residues. To evaluate potential risks associated with glyphosate residues, a pot experiment was conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions with two contrasting soils: weakly buffered acidic Arenosol and highly buffered Luvisol. Glyphosate was supplied as glyphosate enriched <b>rye</b> grass <b>straw</b> (1. 2 g DM kg- 1 soil) prior to sowing sunflower as a non-target plant. Several physiological parameters, such as intracellular shikimate accumulation as a metabolic indicator for glyphosate toxicity, biomass production and micronutrient status were analyzed. Detrimental effects on sunflower plants linked to glyphosate toxicity were observed only in the Arenosol {{but not in the}} Luvisol. This is most probably related to the difference in soil properties. The detoxification capacity of the fine-textured Luvisol, with a high clay content, was high enough for an adequate immobilization and inactivation of glyphosate. On the sandy Arenosol, the level of glyphosate supply exceeded the detoxification capacity. In addition to the difference in detoxification capacity, differences in nutrient bio-availability might also have aggravated the observed inhibition of nutrient acquisition. Thus, the findings suggest the importance of weed residues in transferring glyphosate from target to non-target plants, particularly in no-till or reduced tillage systems, with the consequence of detrimental effects on following crop plants...|$|R

Analysis of moisture of raw materials and their calorific value were carried out according to binding norms. Moisture of compacted raw materials was within 10. 1 - 13. 3 %, where-as the calorific value was from 16. 1 to 17. 9 MJ. kg- 1. Pellets were produced in a pelleting machine with an immobile flat matrix and driven compressing rolls, whereas briquettes were produced in a screw briquetting machine with a heated compressing chamber.

Two molecular marker methods have often been used to characterize and trace PyOM: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and benzenepolycarboxylic acid (BPCA) analysis. Since both methods target pyrogenic polycyclic com- pounds, we investigated the linkages between the two approaches using chars that were produced under controlled conditions. <b>Rye</b> and maize <b>straws</b> and their analogues charred at 300, 400 and 500 °C, respec- tively, were thus analyzed with both methods. Moreover, we also measured BPCAs directly on the lipid extracts, on which PAHs were analyzed, and on the respective extraction residues, too. Both methods revealed important features of the chars, in particular the increasing degree of aromatic condensation with increasing highest heating temperature (HTT). The overlap between the two methods was identified in the lipid fraction, where the proportion of benzenetricarboxylic acids (B 3 CAs) correlated with PAH abundance.

The German spring rye cultivar Ovid was fertilized with 80 kg N ha- 1. Seeding rates were 300, 500 and 700 viable seeds m- 2. Chlormequat chloride (CCC) was sprayed at the two-node stage of the main shoot {{and its effects on}} lodging and yield formation were studied. Various traits were assessed that characterised tiller and main shoot growth and productivity, growth duration and plant stand structure. Spring rye responded differently over years and among CCC treatments. CCC increased grain yield by about 200 kg ha - 1 compared with the control. Spring <b>rye</b> has long <b>straw</b> (130 - 140 cm) and tended to lodge under heavy rainfall. Thus,grain yield was maximum (ca. 5200 kg ha - 1 in 1997) when rainfall was minimum. Partly because high seeding rates enhanced lodging,no seeding rate effects on grain yield were recorded. At 300 seeds m- 2, yield formation of both main shoot and tillers was enhanced to compensate for the reduced number of main shoots m- 2. Ripening was not delayed at low seeding rates.
