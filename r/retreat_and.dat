5|$|A {{little before}} 16:00, Ney noted an {{apparent}} exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook {{the movement of}} casualties to the rear for {{the beginnings of a}} <b>retreat,</b> <b>and</b> sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, {{having taken}} {{the measure of}} the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning <b>retreat,</b> <b>and</b> then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E
5|$|Ecgfrith's {{attack on}} Fortriu was made against the counsel of his advisors, {{including}} Cuthbert, {{who had recently}} been made Bishop of Lindisfarne. The Picts under leadership of Bridei, feigned <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> drew Ecgfrith's Northumbrian force into an ambush on Saturday 20 May 685 at a lake in mountains near Duin Nechtain. The Northumbrian army was defeated and Ecgfrith slain.|$|E
5|$|John Kinnamos {{wrote of}} a second {{campaign}} by Stephen against the Byzantine Empire. The Hungarian troops, supported by Czech reinforcements {{under the command of}} Duke Vaclav of Olomouc, took Braničevo by storm and destroyed its fortress. Emperor John II Komnenos was forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> sue for peace. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that the resulting peace treaty was signed in October 1129.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Wulfhere of Mercia, {{a brother}} of Peada, emerged from safe <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> was proclaimed king. He was not Christian, but was soon {{converted}} and subsequently married Eormenhilda, daughter of Eorcenberht of Kent and Seaxburh.

5|$|Robert Jenkinson, the Earl of Liverpool, took {{possession}} of Walmer Castle {{following the death}} of Pitt in 1806. Liverpool was a favourite of King George's, and his appointment as Lord Warden was again intended to provide a valuable income and a country retreat. As Prime Minister, Liverpool used Walmer as a personal <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> as a location for private political discussions with selected guests.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle between}} Archer's Xindi-fleet and the Reptilian-Insectoid fleet soon breaks {{out around the}} superweapon. With the support of Lieutenant Malcolm Reed, a small squad of MACOs, led by Major Hayes, {{transports}} on board to extract Sato. With the space battle ongoing, the transporter system is damaged so that only two personnel can beam out at one time. Hayes sends one of his men and Sato out first, {{and then the rest}} of the team. Hayes, now alone, is forced to <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> just as he is beaming out, a Reptilian soldier fires through his chest. Back on board Enterprise, he collapses on the transporter platform, and soon dies of heart-failure in Sickbay.|$|E

5|$|Albany died in 1420, and Doune, the dukedom of Albany, and the Regency all {{passed to}} his son Murdoch (1362–1425). The ransom for James I was finally paid to the English, and the King {{returned}} in 1424, taking immediate steps {{to gain control of}} his kingdom. Albany and two of his sons were imprisoned for treason, and then executed in May 1425. Doune Castle became a royal possession, under an appointed Captain, or Keeper, and served as a <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> hunting lodge for the Scottish monarchs. It was also used as a dower house by Mary of Guelders (c.1434–1463), Margaret of Denmark (1456–1486), and Margaret Tudor (1489–1541), the widowed consorts of James II, James III and James IV respectively.|$|E
5|$|Also on the 13th, Beresford {{moved the}} British 2nd Division, Major General John Hamilton's Portuguese {{division}} and three artillery batteries from Badajoz to Valverde—an ideal position {{to observe the}} three routes open for Soult's approach. Wellington's orders left Beresford full discretion to fight Soult or to <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> he was personally inclined to the latter course of action. However, when Beresford met with Blake and Castaños, the two most senior Spanish generals, at Valverde on 14 May, he {{allowed himself to be}} persuaded that the numerical superiority the Allied army had over Soult justified risking a battle. The Allied leaders consequently agreed to concentrate at Albuera, which was the location chosen by Wellington as best suited for an attempt to resist any French advance to relieve Badajoz.|$|E
5|$|Artillery and {{long-range}} {{machine gun}} fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews {{were ordered to}} evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships in their current, useless locations. As men scrambled {{down the side of}} the cruisers into Coastal Motor Boats which would relay them to the Offshore Squadron, destroyers moved closer to Ostend to cover the <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> the monitors continued their heavy fire. Godsal was the last to leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E

5|$|At 1200, Mott {{was brought}} to the {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the <b>retreat,</b> <b>and</b> some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. Many of the men of L Company, {{as well as some of}} the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.|$|E
5|$|By 1919, the White armies were in <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> by {{the start}} of 1920 were {{defeated}} on all three fronts. Although Sovnarkom were victorious, the territorial extant of the Russian state had been reduced, for many non-Russian ethnic groups had used the disarray to push for national independence. In some cases—such as the north-eastern European nations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland—the Soviets recognised their independence and concluded peace treaties. In other cases, the Red Army suppressed secessionist movements; by 1921 they had defeated the Ukrainian national movements and occupied the Caucasus, although fighting in Central Asia lasted until the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick was {{historically}} {{the ancient}} parish of St Nicholas {{in the county}} of Middlesex, with an agrarian and fishing economy beside the river centred on Church Street. Having good communications with London from an early time, Chiswick became a popular country <b>retreat,</b> <b>and</b> {{as part of the}} suburban growth of London in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the population significantly expanded. It became the Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick in 1932 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965, when it was merged into the London Borough of Hounslow. Sublocalities include Bedford Park, Grove Park, the Glebe Estate, Strand-on-the-Green and those with named tube stations, Turnham Green and Gunnersbury, within its three full-sized wards of the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Having {{restored}} his surviving {{forces to}} order, and {{aware of the}} confusion in Bryennios's forces, Alexios decided to counter-attack. The plan he laid out made far greater use of the particular skills of his Turkish horse-archers. He divided his force into three commands, of which two were left behind in ambush. The other, formed from the Immortals and the Chomatenoi under Alexios's own command, was not arrayed in one continuous line, but broken up in small groups, intermingled with other groups of Turkish horse-archers. This command would advance on the rebels, attack them, then feign <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> draw them into the ambush.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the <b>retreat</b> <b>and</b> if possible join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E
