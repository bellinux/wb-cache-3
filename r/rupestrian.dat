50|$|As {{documented}} in the book Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works, edited by Bonnie Clearwater, before her death, Mendieta {{was working on a}} series of photo-etchings of cave sculptures she had created at Escaleras de Jaruco, Jaruco State Park in Havana, Cuba. Her sculptures were entitled <b>Rupestrian</b> Sculptures (1981) - the title refers to living among rocks - and the book of photographic etchings that Mendieta was creating to preserve these sculptures {{is a testament to the}} intertextuality of Mendieta's work. Clearwater explains how the photographs of Mendieta's sculptures were often as important as the piece they were documenting because the nature of Mendieta's work was so impermanent. Mendieta spent as much time and thought on the creation of the photographs as she did on the sculptures themselves.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Rupestrian</b> Cerrado (Cerrado Rupestre) {{corresponds}} to a shrub-like vegetation of the Brazilian tropical savanna biome, occurs mainly over hilly topography and rocky quartzite and sandstone outcrops, presents high biodiversity and several endemic species, and acts as barrier for agricultural expansion. In the State of Goias, large occurrences {{of this type of}} vegetation are found in the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park (PNCV Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Veadeiros). <b>Rupestrian</b> Cerrado mapping using remotely sensed data is difficult because of the spectral confusion with other phytophysiognomies, especially with Dry Forest in dry season images and with Cerrado strictu sensu in wet season images. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop a new approach to discriminate <b>Rupestrian</b> Cerrado based on multitemporal Landsat satellite images. We found 24, 451 hectares of <b>Rupestrian</b> Cerrado, which {{corresponds to}} 37 % of total area of the park. The global accuracy of the mapping was 83, 19 %. Pages: 1757 - 176...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an automatic approach in archaeological photogrammetry for the documentation and recovery of <b>rupestrian</b> paintings.

Digital image processing techniques, specially multispectral and multiband classifications, were used to recognise and extract non-destructively the primitive paintings and shapes, i. e. arrows, hunters and animals. Images of <b>rupestrian</b> paintings are presented, before and after human restoration. Additionally, thematic plots of work art obtained semi-automatically and independently before the cave restoration are shown in order to check the profitability of the methodology; statistical accuracies are also presented. Furthermore, some guidelines for future documentation and recovering of <b>rupestrian</b> paintings are pointed out. ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Pseudovivipary is an asexual {{reproductive}} strategy. Leiothrix spiralis and L. vivipara (Eriocaulaceae) are pseudoviviparous and {{occur in}} <b>rupestrian</b> grasslands, a habitat {{that has a}} predominance of sandy and shallow soil, with low water retention.

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{a brief history of}} the {{different}} studies on the <b>rupestrian</b> habitat in Southern Italy spread during the late nineteenth century, and, in particular, in Puglia, retracing some main stages that coincide with some fundamental changes in historiographical trends. The interest of scholars, initially focused only on the pictorial evidence, has gradually extended on the themes of architecture of the churches in the caves, <b>rupestrian</b> habitat and, ultimately, to the landscape in which these settlements are inserted...|$|E
40|$|The high {{diversity}} in <b>rupestrian</b> field vegetation has {{been attributed to}} the mosaic of environments formed by several soil classes, rugged relief and microclimatic variation. Although advances in the knowledge of some biological areas in <b>rupestrian</b> fields have been made, {{little is known about the}} relevance of soil microorganisms and their relationships with the vegetation. Symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is one of the most studied interactions between microorganisms and plants, because they are ubiquitous and contribute to the sustainability of ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and diversity of AMF species and to evaluate their relationship with soil physicochemical attributes and plant {{diversity in}} different habitats of the <b>rupestrian</b> fields from the Cadeia do Espinhaço, Serra do Cipó, Brazil. These <b>rupestrian</b> fields were delimited into five distinct habitats: rock outcrop, quartz gravel fields, sandy bogs, peat bogs and the Cerrado. Forty-nine AMF species were identified as belonging to nine families and twelve genera. Among them, Acaulospora colossica and Pacispora dominikii were found for the first time in Brazil. The results of this study suggest that the diversity of AMF is related to the heterogeneity of habitats and that the soil texture (coarse sand, gravel and silt) is better related to the structure of these fungi communities than to the soil chemical attributes. Plant species richness was related to AMF richness only in the quartz gravel field, rocky outcrop, and sandy bog habitats. Considering these habitats constitute one of the most menaced ecosystems on the planet, our survey provides information to improve knowledge about <b>rupestrian</b> field biodiversity, thus supporting policy actions for its conservation and preservation. 201...|$|E
40|$|Our {{goal was}} to {{identify}} herbivory patterns from two insect guilds associated with Cnidoscolus quercifolius in a tropical deciduous forest in northeastern Brazil. We sampled four different habitats: (1) forest edge, (2) mesic (near to the perennial water source), (3) forest interior and (4) <b>rupestrian</b> fields. Habitat edge had lower leaf damage than <b>rupestrian,</b> mesic and forest interior habitats. Nevertheless, abundance of galls at the edge habitat was higher than at mesic, forest interior and/or <b>rupestrian</b> habitats. There {{was no difference in}} gall mortality by natural enemies among the four habitats sampled, demonstrating the absence of any influence of top-down controls related to abundance of galls. Trophic relationships were not related to the patterns of distribution among habitats of two insect herbivorous guilds associated with C. quercifolius. Our results demonstrated that environmental heterogeneity of dry forests can significantly alter important ecological interactions and experimental studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms responsible for differences in herbivory among habitats...|$|E
40|$|Architectural {{heritage}} preservation bases on a deep, layered and interdisciplinary {{knowledge of the}} sites, especially when {{they are on the}} edge between natural and artificial, like <b>rupestrian</b> architecture often is. Survey and representation of rock-cut architecture are between the most problematic issues for a number of problems concerning the geometrical complexity of the interior and exterior enveloping surfaces. Laser-scanner is an appropriate tool concerning the registration of geometric and spatial properties of those artificial caves in continuity with the external topography, but automatic representations are often unable to convey their hidden geometric and spatial relationships. In the context of a work methodology customized on the <b>rupestrian</b> habitat of Cappadocia, the authors developed an original envisioning model in which an associate use of contour lines and chromatic codes transforms traditional orthogonal projections after the numeric model into drawings able to offer a synthesis and transmit the complex forms and relationships of <b>rupestrian</b> settlements...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>rupestrian</b> fields {{have two}} {{well-defined}} seasons throughout the year, with rainfall rates {{that reflect the}} rainy and dry seasons. This distinction in water availability affects the morphology, physiology and chemistry of plants, among other characteristics. Thus, it is aimed at evaluating the leaf water status, vegetative phenology and photosynthetic behavior of Campomanesia adamantium from a <b>rupestrian</b> field during the dry and rainy season. The {{study was conducted in}} Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais, Brazil. From November 2011 to November 2012 it was examined vegetative phenophases and development of six individuals. Water potential, stomatal conductance, quantum yield and concentration of pigments were evaluated from four leaves of 3 rd node per individual (n = 4 - 5) in the dry and rainy seasons. C. adamantium is an evergreen type and presents mature leaves and sprouting throughout the year. This species showed strategies that reduce water loss during the dry season in <b>rupestrian</b> field, such as decrease in stomatal conductance throughout the day, also associated with a reduction in leaf water potential. However, low water availability did not affect the photosynthetic performance, which enables the construction of new leaves and renovation of the crown even in dry periods. Finally, little reduction in the values of Fv/Fm throughout the day and increase the values of &# 916;F/Fm' in warmer times, both in the dry season, reiterates the ability of C. adamantium to adjust their physiology to seasonal water deficit of the <b>rupestrian</b> field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Rupestrian</b> {{fields or}} campos rupestres, located in eastern Brazil, are {{a more or}} less {{continuous}} herbaceous stratum with sclerophyllous evergreen small shrubs between rocky outcrops which occurs between 800 m and 2000 m. It is the largest vegetation formation of the Espinhaço Range and the harsher physiognomy of the biome Cerrado. While their soils are shallow, sandy, highly acidic and poor in nutrients, they are very diversified with one of the highest level of endemism in Brazil. Interactions between the substrate, local topography and microclimate create a huge variety of micro-habitats generating a mosaic of communities. Currently, the Cerrado {{is one of the most}} endangered biome of South America and <b>rupestrian</b> fields remain poorly documented. Because of intense anthropic pressures, ecological restoration studies are urgently needed to rehabilitate this ecosystem and services they provide. This study tests the transfer of herbaceous native species from <b>rupestrian</b> fields to restore three kinds of degraded areas (with stony substrate, sandy substrate or ferruginous substrate) using hay collected on two types of <b>rupestrian</b> fields (sandy and stony). We manipulated 2 or 3 levels of 3 treatments in a multifactorial experiment: weeding/plant interactions, nutrient addition/no fertilization, hay from stony site/from sandy sites/no hay. Experimentations were carried out in three replicate sites for each kind of degraded areas (n= 9) and each treatment was replicated 4 times at each site in blocks. Controls were also set up in the field and in greenhouse. Preliminary results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Rupestrian</b> {{complexes}} of the Serra do Espinhaço {{are recognized}} for their {{high degree of}} biodiversity and endemism. However, environmental impacts, particularly from mining, have degraded these environments. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the herbaceous-subshrub communities that occur in quartzitic (QRC) and ferruginous (FRC) <b>rupestrian</b> complexes in different seasons of the year, with regard to floristic similarity and phytosociological structure. Additionally, the study aimed to identify native species with potential use for the restoration of similar degraded areas. Vegetation was sampled from plots located in the municipality of Conceição do Mato Dentro, state of Minas Gerais. Five contiguous strata of 10 × 50 m were demarcated in each environment, in which 12 plots of 2 × 1 m (2 m²) were randomly distributed, for a total of 60 plots (sample units) in each physiognomy. The studied communities exhibited few similarities and lower floristic diversity than other <b>rupestrian</b> complexes. Detrended correspondence analysis distinguished the communities of FRC from those of QRC. The species with the highest value of importance in FRC were Bulbostylis fimbriata and Centrosema brasilianum, while in QRC Echinolaena inflexa had the highest values, thus, making them eligible for restoration programs in similar environments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceImage {{processing}} software, {{such as the}} DStretch plug-in for ImageJ or Photoshop, {{are currently}} used to make faint <b>rupestrian</b> pictographs more legible. During the ongoing study of an Alpine rockshelter, these software proved to be equally useful for the visualization of linear engravings and scratchings. This unexpected function of DStretch, created {{for the study of}} <b>rupestrian</b> paintings, made it possible to clarify and correct the previous recordings of an incised Iron Age warrior and to facilitate the digital tracing of a modern maritime scene. Even if such convincing results are determined by particular local geological conditions in this case, this function could facilitate the study of engravings in other contexts where the lithology of smooth rock surfaces produces a sharp contrast with incised images...|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{characterize}} the Scarabaeinae fauna from a <b>rupestrian</b> field formation at APA de Cafuringa, DF, Brazil. We made seven samples between 2007 and 2009 using baited pitfall traps. We collected 602 individuals belonging to 27 species and 13 genera, of which 17 were identified at species level. The majority of species caught has wide geographical distribution in Brazil and South America and {{do not seem to}} be specialized in 'campo rupestre' formation. Two species, Canthidium marseuli and Canthon lamproderes have restricted geographical distribution, being present in the central Brazilian highlands. C. marseuli and C. lamproderes are probably restricted to <b>rupestrian</b> fields since they have been registered only for this formation in Brazil, which indicates that these species need attention in relation to the conservation of theirs populations and habitats...|$|E
40|$|The <b>rupestrian</b> {{grassland}} ecosystems provide various {{goods and}} services to society and support {{a significant amount of}} biological diversity. Notably the rich plant diversity has high levels of endemism and a variety of uses among the local communities and general society. Despite the socio-ecological importance of these ecosystems, they are subjected to significant anthropogenic pressures. The goal {{of this study is to}} perform economic valuation of the plant diversity storage service provided by <b>rupestrian</b> grassland ecosystems to provide grounds for the development of conservation policies and encourage sustainable practices in these ecosystems. Given the intense human disturbances and unique flora, the Serra do Cip&# 243; (southern portion of the Espinha&# 231;o Range in southeast Brazil) was selected for the study. We estimate the monetary value related to the plant diversity storage service provided by the study area using the maintenance costs of native plants in the living collections of the botanical garden managed by the Zoobotanical Foundation - Belo Horizonte (located 97 km from Serra do Cip&# 243;). The plant diversity storage value provided by Serra do Cip&# 243; ecosystems is significant, reaching US$ 25. 26 million year&# 8211; 1. This study contributes to the development of perspectives related to the conservation of <b>rupestrian</b> grassland ecosystems as well as others threatened tropical ecosystems with high biodiversit...|$|E
40|$|On {{the main}} {{causes of the}} {{degradation}} of cultural heritages hosted in Apulian <b>rupestrian</b> settlements ABSTRACT: After {{the downfall of the}} ancient Roman Empire in a large part of Mediterranean area and specially in Apulia Region (Southern Italy) widespread <b>rupestrian</b> settlements appear. In Apulia this phenomenon, which started at the begin of VI century, has continued until our days. There are a lot of <b>rupestrian</b> sites all over the Apulia Region that host a large important cultural and historical heritage unique all over the world. This heritage is formed by holy architecture and wall paintings hosted in many <b>rupestrian</b> churches or basilica or simple prayer grottoes. There are thousands of frescoes of different pictorial cycles, painted from the VI to the XV century, which can be considered masterpieces of European medieval art. This important Cultural Heritage is subject to a severe deterioration due to chemical, physical, mechanical and biological causes often interrelated. The degradation processes have been different also in the small space of the same site and/or of the same church. They are conditioned by petrographic, physical and mechanical characters of the calcareous sandstone: rock cementation degree and its structure and fabric. An important role is played by the micro-climate conditions existing in the different type of grottoes. They are responsible of the important de-cohesion phenomena involving the superficial part of the rock of the caves; of the disfiguring effect connected to physicochemical rock degradation processes (rock decalcification, chocking, dissolution and hydrating of the rock) by means of water oozing from the rock. To the degradation effects contribute also the small but detrimental activity of rock joints. Special attention has to be given to frescoes affected by processes of decalcification and gypsification. The movement, towards the surface, of water rich in carbonates and other salts (such as sulphates, nitrates) arouses patinas and plaques more or less thick enclosing carbon particles and biofilms formed by pervasive algue, musk, lichen and fungi colonies that damage the paintings...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} compare the spatial and the height {{distribution}} of three plant species between two <b>rupestrian</b> field communities, one preserved (A) and the other cultivated (B). One 50 × 100 m plot was delimited in each community and the populations of Eremanthus incanus, Lychnophora pinaster and Vellozia caruncularis were assessed for height and spatial distribution (using the Ripleys&# 8217;s L-function). In community A, 4, 098 individuals were counted, mostly L. pinaster, against 220 individuals in community B, prevailing E. incanus. An inverted-J pattern was observed for height distribution in both communities, however, with lower frequencies in B. Regular spatial distribution was found for E. incanus and V. caruncularis in community A, whereas the pattern for L. pinaster depended {{on the scale of}} analysis.
