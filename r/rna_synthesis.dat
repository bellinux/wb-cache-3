Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Arthur Kornberg) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory. However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not <b>RNA</b> <b>synthesis.</b> In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E

40|$|Replication by many positive-strand RNA viruses {{includes}} genomic RNA amplification and subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) transcription. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), both processes {{occur in}} virus-induced, membrane-associated compartments, require BMV replication factors 1 a and 2 a, and use negative-strand RNA 3 as {{a template for}} genomic RNA 3 and sgRNA syntheses. To begin elucidating their relations, we examined the interaction of RNA 3 replication and sgRNA transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing 1 a and 2 a, which support the full RNA 3 replication cycle. Blocking sgRNA transcription stimulated RNA 3 replication by up to 350 %, implying that sgRNA transcription inhibits RNA 3 replication. Such inhibition was independent of the sgRNA-encoded coat protein and operated in cis. We further found that sgRNA transcription inhibited RNA 3 replication at a step or steps after negative-strand <b>RNA</b> 3 <b>synthesis,</b> implying competition with positive-strand <b>RNA</b> 3 <b>synthesis</b> for negative-strand <b>RNA</b> 3 templates, viral replication factors, or common host components. Consistent with this, sgRNA transcription was stimulated by up to 400 % when mutations inhibiting positive-strand <b>RNA</b> 3 <b>synthesis</b> were introduced into the RNA 3 5 ′-untranslated region. Thus, BMV subgenomic and genomic <b>RNA</b> <b>syntheses</b> mutually interfered with each other, apparently by competition for one or more common factors.
