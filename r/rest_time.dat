40|$|International audienceExperiments {{were carried}} out to {{study the effects of}} <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> (also well known as first proofing) on {{properties}} of dough and bread. Three <b>resting</b> <b>times</b> were used in the experiment: 0, 10 and 20 min. The results indicated that <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> significantly (p < 0. 05) affects the properties of dough and bread. Porosity of the dough increased with increase in <b>resting</b> <b>time.</b> Decrease in the number of smaller bubbles and increase in the median pore area of the bubbles present in the dough was observed as the <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> proceeded. Significant decrease (p < 0. 05) in torque value was observed with increase in <b>resting</b> <b>time.</b> Elastic recovery in terms of recoil strain was highest for 0 min resting followed by 10 and 20 min resting.

40|$|In this paper, we have {{extended}} a macroscopic probabilistic {{model of a}} swarm of homogeneous foraging robots to a swarm of heterogeneous foraging robots. Each robot is capable of adjusting its searching <b>time</b> threshold and <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> threshold following the rules described in our previous paper. In order to model the difference between robots, private <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> and searching time thresholds are introduced. The robots resting at home are divided into two subsets according to which states they are transferred from, either state Deposit or state Homing. For each subset of robots, private <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> and searching time thresholds are {{used to calculate the}} effect of social and internal cues. The transition between state Resting and state Searching is then decided by the corresponding private <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> threshold. Corresponding to private <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> thresholds, a public <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> threshold is used to track the contribution of the social cues, internal cues and environmental cues for the whole swarm, which is a global property owned by all robots. Although the public <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> threshold doesn’t affect the behaviours for the individual robots directly, it affects the private <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> threshold and vice versa. Similarly, a public searching time threshold is introduced to track the contribution...|$|R
40|$|Time {{constraints}} {{can limit}} an animal's potential {{to survive in}} a given habitat and the maximum size of its group. Many studies have, therefore, investigated the ecological correlates of time allocated to travelling, foraging and vigilance. However, animals spend more time inactive than active, and understanding the determinants of this <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> may provide new insights into the habitat-specific time-budgeting problems that animals face. We analysed the environmental constraints that determine the minimum amount of daytime an average primate has to spend resting, using data {{from a wide range of}} ecologically different species. However, total <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> consists of two components: enforced <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> (imposed on the animal by ecological constraints) and free <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> (the time available for allocation to ecologically functional activities). We show that the ecologically important enforced <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> is determined by diet and annual temperature as well as by temperature variation. Our tests of the biological significance of this relationship show that enforced <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> distinguishes between locations that are suitable or unsuitable for particular genera. We show that an annual temperature increase of 2 - 4 °C would greatly increase enforced <b>resting</b> <b>time,</b> leading to serious time-budgeting problems for many species. The effect of changes to enforced <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> on the biogeographical distribution of species is especially strong for folivorous primates. This study shows that <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> is an important component of animal behaviour that can help us understand extinction risk and geographical distribution of taxa. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R
25|$|Each {{patrol boat}} has a {{standard}} ship's company of 21 personnel, {{with a maximum}} of 29 (not including use of the austere compartment). Unlike the Fremantle-class patrol boats, the Armidales {{do not have a}} permanently assigned ship's company. Instead, there are 21 crews established for the 14 Armidale-class patrol boats, which are divided up into four divisions: Attack, Assail, Ardent, and Aware. The first three of the Divisions are assigned six crews for four ships, while Aware has three crews for two ships. The ships are continually manned, with two out of three crews actively deployed while the third undergoes leave or training, or prepares to transfer into a ship: a handover can be accomplished in less than six hours. The intention of multi-crewing is to allow the ships to spend more time at sea, without compromising sailors' <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> or training requirements.|$|E

40|$|The grazing {{activities}} of indigenous sheep {{of the greek}} breed »Serres« was investigated in a typical lowland, and in a mountainous pasture in northern Greece during the vegetative period (April–October) of 2008.

2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} occurred on 5 November 1956. The aircraft, a Handley Page HP.81 Hermes 4A (registration: G-ALDJ), operated an international non-scheduled passenger flight from Blackbushe via Malta and Cyprus to Tripoli and back. The first stop at Malta involved a crew change. Due {{to the flight}} arriving at Tripoli's King Idris Airport five hours late, there was a reduced <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> for the crew that {{had taken over the}} aircraft in Malta. However, this was insufficient to prevent a delayed takeoff from Idris Airport. Before the aircraft was due to land at Blackbushe Airport, it was cleared to Blackbushe beacon at [...] for a final approach to runway 08. Two minutes after the flightdeck crew reported passing the beacon at , the procedure turn was completed at [...] The aircraft was cleared to land after it had passed the Outer Marker, following which the aircraft descended below the ILS glide slope. It hit a beech tree [...] short of the runway threshold, swerved to the left and came to a halt in a group of pine trees [...] further on. The accident destroyed the aircraft and killed seven of the 80 occupants (three out of six crew members and four out of 74 passengers). The subsequent accident investigation established the captain's fatigue while operating in difficult conditions, as well as his misjudgement of the aircraft's height based on his vision of the airport lights, as the probable cause.|$|E

40|$|According {{to current}} recommendations, blood samples {{should be taken}} in the morning after 15 minutes' <b>resting</b> <b>time.</b> Some {{components}} exhibit diurnal variation {{and in response to}} pressures to expand opening hours and reduce waiting time, the aims of this study were to investigate the impact of <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> prior to blood sampling and diurnal variation on biochemical components, including albumin, thyrotropin (TSH), total calcium and sodium in plasma. All patients referred to an outpatient clinic for blood sampling were included in the period Nov 2011 until June 2014 (opening hours: 7 am- 3 pm). Each patient's arrival time and time of blood sampling were registered. The impact of <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> and the time of day for all components was analysed using simple linear regression. The "maximum allowable bias" was used as quality indicator for the change in reference interval. Significant diurnal variation was found for albumin (n = 15, 544; p< 2 × 10 - 16), TSH (n = 20, 019; p< 2 × 10 - 16), calcium (n = 13, 588; p = 2. 8 × 10 - 12) and sodium (n = 51, 917; p< 2 × 10 - 16). Further significant influence for <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> was found for albumin (p = 2. 6 × 10 - 4), TSH (p = 0. 004), calcium (p = 8. 9 × 10 - 7) and sodium (p = 8. 7 × 10 - 16). Only TSH and albumin were clinically significantly influenced by diurnal variation. <b>Resting</b> <b>time</b> had no clinically significant effect. We found no need for resting 15 minutes prior to blood sampling. However, diurnal variation was found to have a significant and considerable impact on TSH and, to a minor degree, albumin.
