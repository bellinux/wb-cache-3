40|$|Abstract. The {{non-contact}} {{mechanical seal}} end faces opening friction condition detection and {{the measurement of}} film thickness when the end faces is just-lift-off, which are always key problems for scholars engaged in sealing industry for many years, {{but there is no}} effective solution. Acoustic emission(AE) signal generated in the running process of mechanical seal end faces has a plenty of information about the faces contact state. According to this, the thickness measurement of mechanical seal and opening condition monitoring technology by using particle filter are put forward based on the acoustic emission signal. Acoustic emission sensor is installed in the stationary <b>ring</b> <b>seat,</b> used for the indirect outer detection of the dynamic and stationary rings opening condition. The acoustic emission signals are processed by particle filter technology, and then the signal features are extracted in time domain, frequency domain and wavelet packet energy. A BP neural network model is established, the features of signal characteristic used as input of the model. It is finally realized that the mechanical seal end faces opening condition was recognized and the film thickness was measured. Eddy current sensor is installed inside the stationary ring and used for direct measurement of film thickness and verify the results got from the BP neural network. Through the experiment, this method is practical and effective, and which can be used in the monitoring of mechanical seal end faces working condition in industrial field...|$|E

50|$|Most {{chastity}} cages {{consist of}} a <b>ring</b> <b>seated</b> {{around the base of}} the penis behind the scrotum and a tube or penis cage that holds the penis, with the two parts mating together with a hinge or pin. The penis cage is designed so that the penis inside cannot be stimulated directly with hands and fingers. The tip of the penis cage is perforated to allow urine to pass and the design may incorporate vents to facilitate long-term wear and cleaning. The flaccid penis is inserted into the cage and is held at a downwards angle so as to make an erection uncomfortable or impossible. Some designs have an extra short penis cage into which the penis may be squeezed to restrict it even more than in a regular penis cage. Other designs incorporate a tip covering the glans through which a catheter is fixed, and the tip is then secured by short straps which confine the penis and are fixed to the <b>ring</b> <b>seated</b> behind the scrotum.|$|R

5000|$|A {{service valve}} is a valve used to {{separate}} {{one piece of}} equipment from another in any system where liquids or gases circulate. Two types of service valves are marketed: the Schrader-type valve and the stem-type service valve. Specialized versions are made for specific purposes, such as the Rotolock valve (a stem-type valve also called a Rotalock valve [...] ), which is a special refrigeration valve with a teflon <b>ring</b> <b>seated</b> against a machined surface enclosed by a threaded fitting; this valve allows the technician to remove all refrigerant from the compressor without requiring removal of the system charge.|$|R

40|$|Pelton turbine is {{an engine}} that {{facilitates}} continuous {{power as a}} wheel or a rotor continually turns due to the pressure of fast moving water through the bucket, where a bucket receives water from the surging nozzle. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume, bucket angle attack, nozzle needle <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> and nozzle needle seat tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University.

40|$|A {{control valve}} that can {{throttle}} high-pressure cryogenic fluid embodies several design features that distinguish it over conventional valves designed for similar applications. Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> contracts more than the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|R

40|$|Intake and {{exhaust valves}} {{operating}} in diesel engines for naval propulsion suffer from several problems {{due to the}} combined and synergistic effects of mechanical stresses and a chemically harsh environment. Degradation mechanisms like wear and corrosion act on different sections of the valve, {{with the result that}} each part undergoes a different kind of damage. The present work particularly focuses on degradation phenomena such as low temperature corrosion and erosive wear on the stem; hot corrosion {{on the bottom of the}} head of the valve; wear on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> In order to prevent the valves from degrading, a possible solution is the application of protective coatings that may extend the service life of the components by preserving the mechanical properties of substrate materials, while improving the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the surface. The objective of this study is the development, testing and optimization of a system of corrosion and wear resistant coatings for the stem, bottom and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of the valves. The analysis of the degradation mechanisms occurring on each section of the valves led to the selection of materials that could be suitable for the protection of the substrate. Specifically, two different kinds of ceramic-metallic coatings were selected for the protection of the stem and the bottom of the valves, while a modification of the state-of-the art coating applied on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> was performed...|$|R

50|$|Cylinder walls {{can become}} very worn or damaged from use. If {{the engine is}} not {{equipped}} with replaceable sleeves {{there is a limit}} to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced. In such cases where the use of a sleeve or liner can restore proper clearances to an engine. Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable. A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop. The engine block is mounted on a precision boring machine where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference fit. The sleeves can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a shrink fit. This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily. When the engine block cools down it shrink fits around the sleeve holding it into place. Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine. When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system. Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and honed to match the piston. Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper <b>ring</b> <b>seating</b> at break in.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lapping {{process is}} {{characterized}} by its low speed, low pressure, and low material removal rate. This process is used in achieving finer surfaces and closer fits, correction of minor imperfections, and maintaining close tolerances. During the process of lapping, the mechanisms of surface formation and removal rate are decisively influenced by the movement type of the individual grains within the lapping abrasive. A gate valve is used to start and {{stop the flow of}} fluid. So the wedge and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of a valve are in continuous pressure of fluid flow and due to opening and closing of valve these component get wear and they need lapping during reconditioning. This paper will share the need, requirement and application of lapping during the reconditioning of valve. This paper will explore the current working condition of lapping machine in valve industry. It will elaborate the effect of abrasive particals, working speed, surface roughness and other related parameters. What are the difficulties they are facing during the valve reconditioning related to lapping, will be disscussed. Current set up and the changes required in this model are suggested with the proposed model. Key words: Lapping process, wedge, <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> abrasive particles. I...|$|R
