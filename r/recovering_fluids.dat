40|$|Whole lung lavage (WLL) is the {{standard}} treatment for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). This study aimed to provide data about kinetics of the protein wash out, to identify factors influencing the protein concentration in the <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid,</b> and to assess the efficacy of a modified lavage technique. Samples from 180 WLLs of 42 adult PAP patients were collected. 110 WLL were performed according to the classical technique. In 70 WLL repeated manual ventilation was applied during the procedure. Spectrophotometry {{was used to measure}} the protein concentration in the <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid.</b> The initial protein concentration in the <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> was 460 mg/dL, the final concentration was 26 mg/dL, and the total amount of removed proteins during a lavage was 17. 5 g. A history of dust exposure was associated with a higher residual protein concentration in the <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> (p= 0. 00013). The amount of removed proteins correlated inversely with the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (p= 0. 001) and the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO 2) (p= 0. 004). The modified technique removed a greater amount of proteins than the classical technique and prolonged the time to relapse (p= 0. 011). The exposure to dust seems to influence the kinetics of the protein wash out. Applying manual ventilation during the procedure can enhance the efficacy of WLL...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study uteri from {{recently}} slaughtered mares were flushed in a seriesconnected defined pattern three times in succession. The <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> was analysed for different factors. The main interest {{was to determine the}} density of uterine epithelial cells in the <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> and to quantify the amount of living cells among those with the method of trypan blue staining. Both investigations haven’t been described before. Smear preparates from each flushing procedure were made with different staining methods to analyse them for their quality and various corpuscular structures in the fluid. The study demonstrates that the density of epithelial cells significantly decreased according to the sequence of flushings. In the first and second flush a significantly higher amount of cells was observed in mares during estrus compared to mares in diestrus. The amount of vital epithelial cells within all epithelial cells reached the highest value with the first of the three flushing procedures and decreased in each of the continuous two, however with no significance. The time of exitus didn’t have any significant effect on the amount of vital epithelial cells. The analysis of the smear preparates revealed the fact, that each routine testing for morphological aspects, manually done by an examiner, is always subjectively influenced. Smears from same aliquots, even though equally analysed, led to partly different results among the different staining methods. The reduction of polymorphnuclear neutrophil granulocytes according to the chronology of flushing procedures though was consistently observed with significance among PAP-Quick and Diff-Quick, noticeably, but without significance under May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. In conclusion we can say that the average value of 3, 37 ± 4, 87 vital epithelial cells in the <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> seems to be low, even though references in literature don’t exist. In studies with cuts of cattle uterus the methods generate a many times higher amount of vital cells but require the excision of the uterus or euthanizing of the patient. The current studies aim was to serve as a prestudy for further investigations in the living patient. The results, including density an vital amount of epithelial cells obtained by uterine flushing can therefore be considered as a new guideline...|$|R
50|$|Extreme fluid {{retention}} observed in individuals suffering from kwashiorkor {{is a direct}} result of irregularities in the lymphatic system and an indication of capillary exchange. The lymphatic system serves three major purposes: fluid recovery, immunity, and lipid absorption. Victims of kwashiorkor commonly exhibit reduced ability to <b>recover</b> <b>fluids,</b> immune system failure, and low lipid absorption, all of which result from a state of severe undernourishment. Fluid recovery in the lymphatic system is accomplished by re-absorption of water and proteins which are then returned to the blood.

40|$|Abstract Our {{goal was}} to make {{hydraulic}} fracturing for natural gas a cleaner process. Fracking provides an important energy source for the United States, however it is commonly associated {{with a variety of}} environmental problems. We focused on how <b>recovered</b> fracking <b>fluids</b> are handled and contained after the fracking process is complete. We compared currently used open loop fluid systems to closed loop systems and evaluated their benefits and consequences. We determined that closed loop systems are more beneficial than open loop systems because they cost less and have fewer environmental impacts. Background Fracking is the process of recovering natural gas trapped by shale rock by injecting fluids (water, chemicals, proppant) at high pressure into horizontal wells. After a well is fracked, the <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> must be disposed of. Currently, the majority of fracturing companies use open loop systems. The fluid is put into an evaporation pit with the intent of evaporating as much as possible before it is hauled away for processing. Alternatively, {{some parts of the country}} with scarce amounts of water use closed loop systems. Closed loop systems are essentially fluid holding tanks that hold the water and chemicals until trucked away for processing.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} actual {{exposure}} of pottery workers to silica particles, as {{their risk of}} silicosis is potentially high {{because of the presence}} of inhalable crystalline silica particles in the workplace. METHODS: Nine pottery workers underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. The <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> was analysed for cytological and mineralogical content by analytical transmission electron microscopy. The data were compared with those obtained from a control group composed of seven patients with sarcoidosis and six patients with haemoptysis. RESULTS: Cytological results showed a similar profile in exposed workers and controls, whereas in patients with sarcoidosis a lymphocytic alveolitis was found. Microanalysis of the particulate identified the presence of silicates, CRSs, and metals. Pottery workers had higher numbers of total particles and CRSs, and had a higher silicate/metal ratio. In five workers, the presence of zirconium silicate was also detected. Patients with sarcoidosis had the lowest number of particles, and an inverted silicate/metal ratio.

40|$|In many {{hospitals}} it is customary to measure volumetrically the irrigating fluid balance during transurethral resections {{of the prostate}} (TURP) since absorption of the irrigating fluid may be harmful (Hagstrom, 1955; Taylor et al., 1958). The balance is obtained as {{the difference between the}} input and the amount of irrigating <b>fluid</b> <b>recovered.</b> When less <b>fluid</b> is collected than given, the missing volume is considered to have been absorbed by the body. Ideally, the amount of blood in the irrigating <b>fluid</b> <b>recovered</b> and the output of urine should be subtracted from the balance. There are several methods available to correct for the former source of error, which appears to be the more important. The blood loss is usually calculated by measur-ing the haemoglobin content of the <b>fluid</b> <b>recovered</b> and dividing this figure by the blood haemoglobin concentration (B-Hb) (Desmond, 1973; Jansen, Berseus and Johansson, 1978). However, there is evidence to suggest that certain factors can interfere with this approach, such as variations in determination of blood haemoglobin concen-tration (B-Hb) during TURP. For this reason, it is necessary to take measurements throughout the procedure so as to estimate the actual blood loss. This study was performed to investigate the influence of variations in B-Hb, before and during TURP, on the calculation of blood loss and irrigating fluid balance. The effect of using two different fluids for i. v. supplementation (Ringer's acetate solution or dextran 40) was also examined.

The profile passes from the unstable E flank of the volcano (to the south) to the stable N flank and significant fluctuations in electrical resistivity, self-potential, and soil gas emissions (CO 2, Rn and Th) are found.

40|$|Insect {{adhesion}} {{is mediated}} by thin fluid films secreted into the contact zone. As {{the amount of}} fluid affects adhesive forces, a control of secretion appears probable. Here, we quantify {{for the first time}} the rate of fluid secretion in adhesive pads of cockroaches and stick insects. The volume of footprints deposited during consecutive press-downs decreased exponentially and approached a non-zero steady state, demonstrating the presence of a storage volume. We estimated its size and the influx rate into it from a simple compartmental model. Influx was independent of step frequency. Fluid-depleted pads recovered maximal footprint volumes within 15 min. Pads in stationary contact accumulated fluid along the perimeter of the contact zone. The initial fluid build-up slowed down, suggesting that flow is driven by negative Laplace pressure. Freely climbing stick insects left hardly any traceable footprints, suggesting that they save secretion by minimizing contact area or by <b>recovering</b> <b>fluid</b> during detachment. However, even the highest fluid production rates observed incur only small biosynthesis costs, representing less than 1 per cent of the resting metabolic rate.

METHODS: The difference in cellular profiles of sequential BAL fractions from children was analysed to assess the effect of evaluating bronchial and alveolar fractions separately. Twenty five children (mean age 13. 4 years) were examined by fibreoptic bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia, combined with local application of lignocaine. The investigation was part of the clinical evaluation of an infective pulmonary problem. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the right middle lobe using four 20 ml aliquots of normal saline and the four fractions of <b>recovered</b> <b>fluid</b> were evaluated separately. RESULTS: The total cell count was lowest in the first aspirate (1. 8 x 10 (6)) and increased gradually from fraction 1 to fraction 4.
