50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> or Butterfish(Pholis gunnellus) is an eel-like fish {{found in}} the {{intertidal}} and subtidal zones of the North Atlantic. It {{is one of two}} species of gunnel native to the Atlantic Ocean, the other being the banded gunnel. The <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> is capable of remaining above the waterline at low tide and breathing air.|$|E
50|$|During low tides, the <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> {{may remain}} above the waterline, {{sheltered}} beneath rocks and algae, and can breathe air if necessary. They are frequently encountered on rocky shorelines, and splash around noticeably when uncovered. Within its North American range, the <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> disappears from the intertidal during winter, likely to avoid freezing air temperatures. Spawning occurs during the winter, and demersal egg masses are guarded by the parents. Egg masses sometimes {{occur in the}} intertidal along the European coast. The rock gunnel's diet consists mainly of small crustaceans, including amphipods and isopods, as well as polychaetes and mollusks. The foraging behavior of the <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> is poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> {{is found}} in the coastal waters of North America and Europe. It ranges from Labrador and Greenland to Delaware Bay in the West Atlantic, and from the Kanin Peninsula to the Bay of Biscay in the East Atlantic. Within its range it is found from the {{intertidal}} zone to depths of over 100 m. The <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> uses habitat sheltered by rocks and algae both above and below the waterline, likely to protect it from its natural predators, which include seabirds, fish, and marine mammals.|$|E

5000|$|A lifelong sailor, Sunderland {{said she}} had been {{preparing}} for her journey since age 13. She trained in ocean sailing with experienced sailors and with her father Laurence Sunderland, who said he understood her determination when [...] "It was a particularly rough day and her boat was <b>rocking</b> from <b>gunnel</b> to gunnel. ... I knew she was freezing cold, tired and hungry, and we'd been at it for, you know, 20 hours at that stage. I said, 'So Abby, are you ready to sail around the world now?' To which she replied, 'Where is my boat?'" [...] Her parents were widely criticized for the decision to allow her to undertake this trip, with one critic calling the decision [...] "potentially irresponsible." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> {{is often}} mistaken for an eel {{due to its}} flattened, {{elongated}} body. Fully grown adults can reach 30 cm in length. A long dorsal fin spans the body from just behind the head, supported by soft spiny rays. Its anal fin begins roughly midway along the body. The head is rather small with its lower jaw protruding and mouth turned upwards. Coloration is highly variable, ranging from hues of yellow-green to brown to crimson. A row of 9-13 dark spots, each surrounded by a pale ring, lines the dorsal fin.|$|E
50|$|The {{viviparous}} eelpout has a slim, tapering {{body and}} resembles a small burbot (Lota lota), a wide head and mouth and protuberant lips. It has long, ribbon-like dorsal and anal fins which continue on to unite with the arrowhead-shaped caudal fin. This distinguishes this {{fish from the}} two similar slim-bodied bottom-dwelling fish of the area, the <b>rock</b> <b>gunnel</b> (Pholis gunnellus) and the snake blenny (Ophidion barbatum). The average size of this fish is about 20 to 30 cm. It is a brownish color with irregular dark brown markings and a yellowish belly. The pectoral, anal and caudal fins are tinged with orange which becomes a more intense hue during the breeding season. The bones are green.|$|E
