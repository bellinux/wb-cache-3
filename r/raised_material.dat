40|$|The {{influence}} of various factors {{on the material}} yield of the aminophenol from 2 -chloro- 6 -nitrotoluene has been investigated. The most significant increase resulted from efficient agitation best attained by high speed rotat ion of a disk cathode. Under these conditions current efficiency, already high, increased to virtual ly 100 %. The effect of agitation shows that the slowest {{step in the process}} is diffusion controlled. Cathodes of monel and copper were tried. Amalgamation of the surface <b>raised</b> <b>material</b> yield of aminophenol from 21 to 58 per cent with a stat ionary cathode and 37 to 71 per cent with a rotat ing copper cathode.

Increase in the ratio of nitroeompound to acid electrolyte reduced yieht 3 of aminophcnol because of the formation of tarry prod-nets. Yield of amine, the only other simple chemical product, remained constant show-ing that the tarry products resulted by reaction of intermediate hydroxyl~mine with nitroeompound. Current density was increased from 0. 4 to 4 amp/din 2 using a rotat ing cathode without seriously affecting yield. This contrasts trongly with the effeet of a similar change with a stat ionary electrode which causes yield to drop almost by half. Using preferred conditions (20 per cent acid, rotat ing amalgamated monel eathode, 90 ~ 2. 7 amp/dm ~) the following nitroeompounds were reduced to give aminophenols in the material yields indicated: 4 -ehloro- 2 -nitrotoluene (82), o-nitrotoluene (74), o-ehloronitrobenzene (76), 2, 5 ~diehloronitrobenzene (72), and nitrobenzene (72) ...|$|E
40|$|To {{manufacture}} advanced fibre placement (AFP) structures {{according to}} the results of conceptual design and optimisation, several manufacturing constraints must be considered. As a result, the computationally optimised solution often cannot be perfectly achieved within the manufacturing process. Instead, a producible fibre alignment is realised, which may include local fibre particularities and, hence, locally <b>raised</b> <b>material</b> efforts. To properly account for the real fibre path, the As-built Feedback Method has been developed. It transforms manufacturing data of AFP structures to as-built FE-models by suitably considering the realised fibre orientations as well as special fibre features like tight fibre curves. In the present paper, the Feedback Method is exemplarily applied to an AFP tension strap. By investigating failure analysis results, significant discrepancies have been identified between as-built and as-design. Thus, the application of the Feedback Method is particularly advantageous, if the effect of irregular fibre alignments is important...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this PhD thesis is to provide a det ailed investigation on the elements that limit the conversion efficiency of next-generation crystalline silicon solar cells intended for industrial scale production. This kind of cells will feature, among other advancements, a rear side with dielec tric passivation and local contacts. The full understanding of the electrical properties of this peculiar structure is still far from being fully achieved, and a t the same time, a stable and well-controlled fabrication process has not been impl emented yet. In this thesis it will be demonstrated that, in primis, the local c ontact concept suffers from recombination losses that lie outside a simple one-dimensio nal interpretation, and in secundis, that the current fabrication process ca n result in devices presenting undesirable micro-morphological features that, in tur n, lead to increased electrical losses. The parameters that determine this peculiar behavior, such as the silico n surface potential, the density of interface states and the rear side parasitic s hunt resistance will be discussed and inserted into a consistent model. At th e same time, the influence of the fabrication process on these parameters will be evaluated. At the end, an explanation for these complex electrical and mechanical interactions is given, together with a quantitative analysis of the loss es and suggestions for the improvement of the process, while keeping an eye on simplicity and low cost. In parallel, a particular attention has been devoted to the substrate ma terial quality. Regardless of the type of material employed, mono- or multi-cry stalline, higher complexity devices such as solar cells with rear side local conta cts are expected to demand a <b>raised</b> <b>material</b> quality in order to decidedly outpe rform standard crystalline silicon solar cells, based on a rear side full cont act. The impact of phosphorus gettering and bulk hydrogenation from silicon n itride layers has been reconsidered as well, in view of the constraints demande d by industrial implementation. The characterization of these material enh ancing processes can be unfolded over different levels, the device level being the top one and the structural-compositional level the bottom one. A crucial level is represented by recombination lifetime measurement, given its sensitiv ity to electrically active defects. Consequently, an initial effort was devoted to the development of advanced techniques for recombination lifetime determinat ion,which have been subsequently employed throughout this research w ork.

Our results also suggest that the relative economic position of households is a strong determinant of subjective poverty, and having at least some type of employment reduces the likelihood that households will perceive themselves as poor, even if they remain in objective poverty. Receiving remittances from abroad, on the other hand, does not reduce perceived poverty, even if it <b>raises</b> <b>material</b> consumption.
