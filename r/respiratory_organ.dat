25|$|The {{epidermis}} of {{fish and}} of most amphibians consists entirely of live cells, with only minimal quantities of keratin in {{the cells of the}} superficial layer. It is generally permeable, {{and in the case of}} many amphibians, may actually be a major <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ.</b> The dermis of bony fish typically contains relatively little of the connective tissue found in tetrapods. Instead, in most species, it is largely replaced by solid, protective bony scales. Apart from some particularly large dermal bones that form parts of the skull, these scales are lost in tetrapods, although many reptiles do have scales of a different kind, as do pangolins. Cartilaginous fish have numerous tooth-like denticles embedded in their skin, in place of true scales.|$|E
500|$|Frogs have no tail, {{except as}} larvae, {{and most have}} long hind legs, {{elongated}} ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have short vertebral columns, {{with no more than}} 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx). Like other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins. The ribs are poorly developed, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and [...] a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them. For the skin to serve as a <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ,</b> it must remain moist. This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment, some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream. This {{may be one of the}} causes of the worldwide decline in frog populations.|$|E

50|$|The {{animals are}} yellow colored, spotted grey and white, with darker {{pigmentation}} on the snout, mantle and {{base of the}} penis. Blue eyes are {{at the base of}} long tentacles.

50|$|A ctenidium is a <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ</b> or gill {{which is}} found in many mollusks. This {{structure}} exists in bivalves, cephalopods, and in many aquatic gastropods, i.e. in some freshwater snails and sea snails and also in some sea slugs. Some aquatic gastropods possess one ctenidium, others have a pair of ctenidia (the plural form of the word).|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the unique}} {{features}} of Megalops is the swim bladder, which functions as a respiratory pseudo-organ. These gas structures {{can be used for}} buoyancy, as an accessory <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ,</b> or both. In Megalops, this unpaired air-holding structure arises dorsally from the posterior pharynx. Megalops uses the swim bladder as a <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ</b> and the respiratory surface is coated with blood capillaries with a thin epithelium over the top. This is the basis of the alveolar tissue found in the swim bladder, and is believed {{to be one of the}} primary methods by which Megalops “breathes”. These fish are obligate air breathers, and if they are not allowed to access the surface, they will die. The exchange of gas occurs at the surface through a rolling motion that is commonly associated with Megalops sightings. This “breathing” is believed to be mediated by visual cues, and the frequency of breathing is inversely correlated to the dissolved [...] content of the water in which they live.|$|E

5000|$|A gill (...) is a <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ</b> {{found in}} many aquatic organisms that {{extracts}} dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. Branchia (pl. branchiae) is the zoologists' name for gills.|$|E

50|$|The gills, located {{under the}} operculum, are a <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ</b> for the {{extraction}} of oxygen from water and for the excretion of carbon dioxide.

The labyrinth organ of Anabantoidei and Clariidae is used to allow the fish to extract oxygen from the air. Gill rakers are bony or cartilaginous, finger-like projections off the gill arch which function in filter-feeders to retain filtered prey.|$|E

5000|$|In surface anatomy, a lamella {{is a thin}} plate-like structure, often one amongst many {{lamellae}} {{very close}} to one another, with open space between.

50|$|The gills {{have their}} origins in gill arches 2, 3, and 5; these {{increase}} with 3 more bars, that consist of secondary filaments, which create the <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ.</b> In the secondary lamellae there are connective tissues that provide {{support to the}} epithelium; these make up the water-blood barrier, in particular where the capillaries are immediately below the basal cells. There are numerous secondary filaments along with the main filaments, which are lengthened to extend the oxygen-catching capability. This increase in surface area counteracts the decreased oxygen available, by allowing greater oxygen uptake. In larval stages, the gills are well-developed with {{a great number of}} respiratory lamellae. This adaptation is hypothesized to be an advantage in response to the conditions in an aquatic environment.|$|E
50|$|The trunk {{hosts the}} {{internal}} organs of the organism, divided into seventy {{to a hundred}} annulations of varying spacing, depending on curvature and contraction. The posterior displays a series of hooks, which likely acted as anchors during burrowing. Muscles support the animal and retract the bursa and proboscis. A gut leading from the anus in the bursa to the mouth in the proboscis runs through the trunk's spacious body cavity, and a concentration of gut muscles serve the function of a gizzard. A nerve chord runs down the organism's length. In addition to the other organs, it is possible Ottoia contained urogenital organs in its trunk. There {{is no evidence of}} a <b>respiratory</b> <b>organ,</b> though the bursa may have served this purpose.|$|E
