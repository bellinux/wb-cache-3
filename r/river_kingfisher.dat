50|$|The <b>river</b> <b>kingfishers</b> or Alcedininae, {{are one of}} {{the three}} subfamilies of birds in the <b>kingfisher</b> family. The <b>river</b> <b>kingfishers</b> are {{widespread}} through Africa and east and south Asia as far as Australia, with one species, the common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) also appearing in Europe and northern Asia. This group includes many kingfishers that actually dive for fish. The origin of the subfamily is thought to have been in Asia.|$|R

50|$|Gong Choi-king {{is forced}} {{back into the}} palace with her daughter, Lau Sam-ho and their servant, Yiu Kam-ling. Gong Choi-King comes from a very talented {{background}} of jewellery making, therefore she was assigned the task of making a beautiful, gold hairpiece {{in the shape of}} a phoenix, with a luminous pearl as the eye and the feathers of a <b>river</b> <b>kingfisher</b> as the tail for the Empress Dowager. However, during the Empress' daily walk around the imperial garden, the phoenix headpiece suddenly weeps tears of blood. Taking this as a sign of bad luck, she throws the hairpiece away and demands the jewellery maker to be severely punished. Gong Choi-King suffers harsh beating as her punishment and eventually passes away. Before passing away, she tells Sam-ho to always remember the significance of her name("Speak good words, do good deeds, show good will."). (Sam-ho literally means three goodness) She also tells her to help and work together with Kam-ling as if they are related sisters.|$|E
5000|$|A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study of}} the <b>river</b> <b>kingfishers</b> published in 2007 found that the genera as then defined did not form monophyletic groups. The species were subsequently rearranged into four monophyletic genera. A clade containing four species {{were placed in the}} resurrected genus Corythornis and five species (little kingfisher, azure kingfisher, Bismarck kingfisher, silvery kingfisher and indigo-banded kingfisher) were moved from Alcedo to Ceyx.|$|R
50|$|<b>River</b> <b>kingfishers</b> are monogamous and territorial. The pair excavates a burrow in an {{earth bank}} and lays {{two or more}} white eggs onto the bare surface. Both parents {{incubate}} the eggs and feed the chicks. Egg laying is staggered at one-day intervals so that if food is short only the older larger nestlings get fed. The chicks are naked, blind and helpless when they hatch, and stand on their heels, unlike any adult bird.|$|R
50|$|Not {{longer than}} 5 {{million years ago}} - {{possibly}} as recently as 2.9 million years ago - an Old World giant kingfisher became the ancestor of the belted and ringed kingfishers, and later, another species related to the pied kingfisher became the ancestor of the Chloroceryle green kingfishers after colonizing the Americas. While the evolutionary history of the water kingfishers in regard to their internal relationships is well resolved, it is not entirely clear whether they evolved from <b>river</b> <b>kingfishers</b> or tree kingfishers, and whether they immigrated across the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean (though the former seems more likely).|$|R
5000|$|The kingfishers family Alcedinidae is in {{the order}} Coraciiformes, which also {{includes}} the motmots, bee-eaters, todies, rollers and ground-rollers. The name of the family was introduced (as Alcedia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. It {{is divided into three}} subfamilies, the tree <b>kingfishers</b> (Halcyoninae), the <b>river</b> <b>kingfishers</b> (Alcedininae) and the water kingfishers (Cerylinae). The name Daceloninae is sometimes used for the tree kingfisher subfamily but it was introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1841 while Halcyoninae introduced by Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825 is earlier and has priority. A few taxonomists elevate the three subfamilies to family status. In spite of the word [...] "kingfisher" [...] in their English vernacular names, many of these birds are not specialist fish-eaters; none of the species in Halcyoninae are.|$|R

5000|$|Kingfishers or Alcedinidae are {{a family}} of small to medium-sized, brightly colored birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, with most species found outside the Americas. The family contains 114 species and {{is divided into three}} subfamilies: <b>river</b> <b>kingfishers</b> (Alcedininae), tree kingfishers (Halcyoninae), and water kingfishers (Cerylinae). All kingfishers have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with only small differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey usually caught by swooping down from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, many species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order, they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. Some kingfishers nest in arboreal termite nests. A few species, principally insular forms, are threatened with extinction. In Britain, the word [...] "kingfisher" [...] normally refers to the common kingfisher.|$|R
60|$|A few mornings later, as I prowled {{along the}} shore, I {{came upon a}} little pool quite shut off from the main stream, in which {{a dozen or more}} frightened minnows were darting about, as if in strange quarters. As I stood {{watching}} them and wondering how they got over the dry bar that separated the pool from the <b>river,</b> a <b>kingfisher</b> came sweeping up-stream with a fish in his bill. Seeing me, he whirled silently and disappeared round the point below.|$|R
25|$|Ten {{species that}} are at risk {{as a result of}} the spill have been listed by The National Geographic Traveler. These species are the Irrawady dolphins, Bengal tigers, leopards, great egrets, rhesus macaques, {{northern}} <b>river</b> terrapins, black-capped <b>kingfishers,</b> chitals, saltwater crocodiles, and horseshoe crabs.|$|R
50|$|Animals seen {{along the}} <b>river</b> include herons, <b>kingfishers</b> (note the project name), water voles and mink. In the ponds created in Shard End, many {{invertebrates}} have nested {{as well as}} many amphibians. Skylarks have been seen around the course grassland and they have bred successfully for a number of years.|$|R
500|$|A large {{audience}} gathers {{to watch}} them get up and cook. There is a violent storm. They reach Pushal, [...] "the capital of the Ramgul Kafirs". The headman gives them delicious apricots and tells tales of the old days. They admire the antique rifles of many kinds that the men have, all [...] "in a disgraceful condition". A mullah forbids {{them to go to}} a funeral where a bullock is to be slaughtered, in a holiday atmosphere. Instead, they sit under a walnut tree beside a <b>river,</b> with <b>kingfishers,</b> butterflies, hummingbird hawkmoths, a woodpecker drilling, and have [...] "a rare moment of peace". Newby shakes hands with two lepers. They all have dysentery. Newby spends hours negotiating the price of a complete male Nuristanis costume.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{a further}} [...] {{extension}} built by volunteer labour was opened {{to a new}} halt at Danycoed. Llwyfan Cerrig (in English, Stone Platform) was a former quarrymen's halt and the Gwili Railway has created a nature trail which winds through the old quarry and emerges above the stock sheds. The station building, which originally stood at Felin Fach on the Aberaeron branch and dates from 1911, was dismantled by volunteers and re-erected in the early 1990s. It has been restored and furnished to an authentic 1950s style. From the platform, a path leads to a picnic area {{on the bank of}} the Gwili <b>River</b> where <b>kingfishers</b> and heron can sometimes be glimpsed. A miniature railway runs from this station and refreshments can be bought.|$|R

50|$|The river {{begins at}} Longlac Bay on Long Lake at the {{community}} of Longlac, part of the municipality of Greenstone, Thunder Bay District. It passes under Ontario Highway 11 and the Canadian National Railway (CNR) transcontinental main line (used at this point by Via Rail transcontinental Canadian trains) into geographic Bain Township in Unorganized Thunder Bay District, takes in the left tributaries Kenogamisis River and Burrows River, and reaches the Kenogami Lake Dam. It continues northeast, takes in the left tributary Kawakanika River, reaches Chipman Lake, passes into Cochrane District at geographic Chipman Township, takes in the right tributaries Fernow River and Wabigano River, heads under a CNR line abandoned in 1986 (originally the National Transcontinental Railway transcontinental main line) between the railway points Ogahalla {{to the west and}} Blanche to the east, and reaches the confluence with the left tributary Atikasibi River. The river continues northeast, takes in the Mundino River (left), Flint River (right), Watistiguam River (left) and Nemasa River (left), the last at Loon Island, the right tributary Pagwachuan River, and then, within two kilometres, the right tributaries Nagagami River and Kabinakagami River, the latter at the unincorporated place and community of Mammamattawa, site of the abandoned Hudson's Bay Company English River Post trading post. It turns north, passes the English River 66 First Nations Reserve (part of the Constance Lake First Nation lands), takes in the left tributaries Little Ash River, Ash <b>River</b> and <b>Kingfisher</b> <b>River,</b> the right tributary Wakashi River, the left tributaries Little Drowning River, Drowning River and Little Current River, and reaches its mouth at The Albany Forks on the Albany River, which flows to James Bay.|$|R
25|$|Many {{very large}} birds, such as ratites, {{flamingos}} {{and the largest}} swans, are extremely difficult to band because the cost of making a band which is capable of securely fitting their strong, heavy legs is prohibitive. At the other extreme, the smaller species of <b>river</b> and tree <b>kingfishers,</b> todies and certain lories, have such narrow tarsii that no band can be securely placed around it without imposing danger to blood circulation. With some gamebirds, such as the Indian Peafowl, spurs on the legs interfere with the bands, which thus can cause injury to the birds.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish and birds {{live in and}} around the river. Long finned eels migrate from oceanic {{spawning}} grounds as elvers. As adults they mature in the creeks and streams of the Royal National Park, sometimes to be seen in the river pools. Jollytail are common small fish. Platypus may occasionally be seen in the <b>river,</b> and azure <b>kingfishers</b> nest in the river banks. The land snail Meridolum marshalli is restricted to Royal National Park; its main habitat is wet areas near the river.|$|R
