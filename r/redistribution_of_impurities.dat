40|$|The {{redistribution}} of hydrogen during solid phase epitaxial regrowth (SPER) of preamorphized silicon has been experimentally investigated, modeled, and simulated for different H concentrations and temperatures. H {{was introduced by}} H implantation and/or infiltration from the sample surface during partial thermal anneals in air in the 520 - 620 degrees C temperature range. We characterized the time evolution of the H redistribution by secondary ion mass spectrometry and time resolved reflectivity. The good agreement between all experimental data and the simulations by means of full rate equation numerical calculations allows the quantitative assessment of all the phenomena involved: in-diffusion from annealing atmosphere and the H effect on the SPER rate. We describe the temperature dependence of microscopic segregation of H at the amorphous/crystal (a-c) interface. Only a fraction of H atoms pushed by the a-c interface {{can be incorporated into}} the crystal bulk. We propose an energetic scheme of H redistribution in amorphous Si. The segregation of H at the a-c interface is also considered for (110) and (111) orientated substrates. Our description can also be applied to other material systems in which <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> during a solid-solid phase transition occurs.

30|$|It {{is known}} that Cu can be {{electrochemically}} deposited on n-type semiconductor[12]. Therefore, it was supposed that inversion of conductivity type takes place, and 'hills' of the periodic structures are of n-type. Possibility to invert conductivity type by laser radiation was shown in several p- and n-type semiconductors: p-Si[13 – 15], p-CdTe[16], p-InSb[17, 18], p-InAs[19], p-PbSe[20], p-Ge[21], and n-HgCdTe[22]. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the nature of inversion of conductivity type, for example, impurities' segregation, defects' generation[20], amorphization[23] and oxygen-related donor generation[14]. However, there are many contradictions in the mechanisms. For example, n-type impurities in Si irradiated by laser cannot be oxygen atoms, according to paper[15]. Several authors have tried to explain p-n junction formation in n-type HgCdTe by defects’ generation, based on a model of defect formation related to interstitial mercury diffusion[24]. On the other hand, the authors of those papers did {{not take into account}} the effect of temperature gradient on the diffusion of atoms in solid solution. Moreover, it is theoretically shown that the p-n junction can be formed by <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> in co-doped Si in gradient temperature field[25]. Thus, the mechanism of inversion of conductivity type by laser radiation is not clear until now.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The classic {{treatment}} of diffusion by Einstein and by Chandrasekhar assumed conservative boundary conditions; mobile species were neither created nor destroyed on the sample surface. It is normal {{to assume that}} vacancies and host interstitials are created and annihilated on incoherent interfaces or free surfaces; i. e., these {{are assumed to be}} perfect sources and sinks. Impurities may also be gained or lost at an interface. It seems that no analytic solutions are available for diffusion with annihilating boundary conditions. In this thesis, the author presents massive data obtained by giga event Monte Carlo simulation of the macro-consequence of atomic level assumptions using VIDSIM, a computer simulation program for the simulation of point defect diffusion and interaction in diamond and zinc-blend structure crystals. The author contrasts these results with the error function complement (ERFC) forms obtained with conservative boundary conditions.

APT can simulate most up-to-date process steps in two-dimensions {{and even in}} three-dimensions for the diffusion and ion implantation steps [1]. APT has the unique capability among two dimensional process simulators to determine the impurity distribution in the whole Si-Si 02 system.

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} that can account for both front and back "autodoping " effects during epitaxial growth as well as impurity redistribution during further high-temperature processing. The model incorporates three dopant fluxes, i. e., (i) the flux from the solid into the gas phase {{at the rear of}} the wafer, (ii) the flux from the solid to the front surface of the wafer, and (iii) the flux from the bulk gas phase into the boundary layer near the front surface of the wafer in which transport of dopant occurs by diffusion only. The <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> both within the solid semiconductor and in the gas phase are investigated from a theoretical viewpoint. Numerical solutions are obtained using the Crank-Nicolson method. Implications of dif-ferences between this approach and previous work are discussed. Calculated results are presented to illustrate the variety of problems that may be solved using this mathematical approach. The distribution of impurities in epitaxially grown silicon layers plays a major role in the operation of diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. The impur-ity redistribution that occurs during silicon epitaxial processing and semiconductor device fabrication is de-pendent upon processing times and temperatures, diffu-sivities, evaporation rates, and segregation coefficients of the dopants in the solid and gaseous phases. A model for the redistribution process wou]d enable one to assess the critical steps in the fabrication sequence and predict the effect of process changes on the impurity distribution in the semiconductor. A typical device processing sequence may consist of fifteen discrete high-temperature st ps that affect the impurity redis-tribution. Since the results of the prior step form the initial conditions for the present step, analytical solu-tions to the diffusion or transport equations are not available. Therefore, a sequential numerical technique is the obvious choice to solve this type of processing problem. At present only fragmentary parts of this problem have been solved and no complete model exists...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the {{consumption}} of raw materials and energy {{in the world has}} faced a tremendous increase with a corresponding industrial waste volume increases, which treatment poses serious challenges. From an economical point of view, the waste has values as it contains valuable matters. Disposal of these streams without any further treatment is the environmentally unacceptable. The foreseeable upcoming depletion of metals, pure water and other raw materials forces us to find efficient technologies to recover those, and this thesis aims to investigate novel applications of a promising crystallization technology, Eutectic Freeze Crystallization (EFC) for the energy friendly (up to 90 % lower energy costs compared to evaporation) complete recovery of salt and fresh water from industrial streams. EFC operates around the eutectic temperature and composition of an aqueous solution and recovers the dissolved salts and fresh water from almost all aqueous salt or acid containing process stream, producing extremely pure ice and pure salts. The low operating temperature promotes safe and corrosion-free operation. Applications are possible in food, pharmaceutical, petrochemical and fertilizer industries etc. An introduction and the scope of this thesis are given in Chapter 1. This work focusses on the industrial application of EFC in (bio-) chemical and oil and gas industries. HrICP-MS is used as an analytical tool to assess the purity obtained using EFC. In Chapter 2, EFC was performed for an NiSO 4 containing industrial stream from 1 liter scale batch set-up in the laboratory to an industrial scale continuous pilot plant (200 liter) at the production location of nickel sulfate. The heat transfer rate from the crystallizer could be maintained at 9 kW/m 2 with ice and nickel sulfate production rates of 16 and 4 kg/h respectively. Since the major impurity in the starting solution is sodium, the quaternary point and the two eutectic solubility lines for the Na 2 SO 4 -NiSO 4 -H 2 O ternary system were also experimentally determined to investigate the limitations of EFC. Recrystallization of NiSO 4 ? 7 H 2 O from produced with EFC into the NiSO 4 ? 6 H 2 O is described in Chapter 3, and an effort of trace element analysis was performed by hrICP-MS. Within the range of 40 °C to 90 °C an optimal i. e. most pure product was found at 50 °C. Recrystallization mother liquor was recycled to assess the performance in industrial full continuous operation. It was found that the recrystallization occurs via the solution, allowing a <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities.</b> The results from hrICP-MS were used to calculate partition coefficients and distribution coefficients for impurity uptake in the NiSO 4 crystals. Efforts to develop and perform elemental analysis of traces in the nickel sulfate system using hrICP-MS are presented in Chapter 4. First, contaminations in blanks and standard solution were assessed, and calibration curves were measured. Second, observed memory effects (i. e. the signal is influenced by the signal of the preceding sample or standard) were reduced by extensive flushing. Third, a strong decrease on the sensitivity during one single run consisting of blanks, samples and standard solutions was observed, and it was surprisingly found that this effect could not be eliminated by using internal standards. By correction of the signal decline from standard curves at different stages within one run, and by performing three runs reliable data could be collected. Chapter 5 describes how saline water from Kuwait oil production and valuable products were recovered by EFC in 1 liter batch experiment. Inclusions of mother liquor in the final ice product are below 0. 05 wt%, and in NaCl? 2 H 2 O below 0. 1 wt%. Then EFC was scaled up to batch 10 liter scraped wall crystallizer. A maximum ?T of 3. 5 °C between the cooling liquid and the NaCl? 2 H 2 O/ice slurry could be maintained. The quality of final salt and ice products have a good reproducibility from 1 liter to 10 liter. Recrystallization were performed from NaCl? 2 H 2 O into NaCl as a further purification step, yielding more pure NaCl. Simulated shale gas water was treated with EFC (Chapter 6), and the ice products were deemed sufficiently pure to be reused in fracking fluid. By stepwise cooling down in a batch EFC process, the system of the solution with the eutectic points of BaCl 2, NaCl and SrCl 2 was characterized. At the end of the batch sequence the solution will consist of calcium chloride with minor impurities. The batch process was scaled up in a 200 liter scraped wall crystallizer, and a heat transfer rate of 4 kW/m 2 over the heat exchangers could be maintained without excessive scaling inside the crystallizer. In Chapter 7, an industrial problem of removing Mg from hydrated nickel sulfates using state-of-the-art molecular simulations was investigated. Periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) and cluster DFT calculations are used to study the crystal structures and phase stability of the hexahydrated and heptahydrated Ni and Mg sulfates and their mixed phases. The calculated lattice parameters of MSO 4 (H 2 O) n (M=Ni, Mg; n= 6, 7) crystals are in good agreement with available experimental data. The relative energy differences of the mixed phase for both hexahydrated and heptahydrated Ni/Mg sulfates obtained from both the periodic and cluster DFT calculations are generally less than kT (25. 8 meV, T = 300 K), indicating that a continuous solid solution is formed.

40|$|The {{nanoscale}} {{fracture of}} a semiconductor surface under {{the action of}} nanosecond Nd:YAG laser radiation has been performed. The investigation of the surface topography, optical and mechanical properties {{has shown that the}} mechanism of the surface nanoscale fracture is relaxation of mechanical compressive stress. The experiments were carried out on semiconductor crystals such as: elementary semiconductors Si and Ge; compound semiconductors GaAs and CdTe; solid solutions SiGe and CdZnTe. The nanoscale fractured surface of semiconductor possesses unique physical properties when at least one dimension of the nanoscale fracture is comparable or less than Bohr’ radius of electron, hole or exciton. The “blue shift” of the photoluminescence band maximum of the nanoscale fractured surface of Si crystal by 1. 05 eV was observed. Moreover, the band intensity increased by 106 times. The dependence of laser radiation intensity on Si crystal microhardness is characterized by non-monotonous function, which has two maximums for p-type and one maximum for n-type. Our study has shown that the nanoscale fracture mechanism consists of two stages. The first stage is formation of a mechanically strained top layer on the irradiated surface of semiconductor due to <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> atoms and intrinsic defects (interstitials and vacancies) in temperature gradient field, the so called Thermo gradient effect [1]. At the first stage of the process microhardness of p-type Si crystal increases by 40 % and conversion to n-type conductivity takes place. Therefore, p-n homojunction is formed in elementary and compound semiconductors irradiated by the laser. This fact is explained by the opposite charge of interstitials and vacancies [2]. Whereas, the irradiation of solid solutions by the laser leads to formation of different phases, for example, Ge/Si. In this case, formation of p-n heterojunction takes place. The second stage is plastic deformation of the top layer due to relaxation of mechanical compressive stress. The stress in the top layer arises due to the difference in the lattice constants of the heterostructure layers and selective laser heating...|$|R

It employs diffusion stoplayers (DSLs) to protect Josephson junctions (JJs) from interlayer migration <b>of</b> <b>impurities,</b> improve JJ critical current (Ic) targeting and reproducibility, eliminate aging, and eliminate pattern-dependent effects in Ic and tunneling characteristics of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb junctions in integrated circuits. The latter effects were recently found in Nb-based JJs integrated into multilayered digital circuits. E. g., {{it was found that}} Josephson critical current density (Jc) may depend on the JJ's environment, on the type and size of metal layers making contact to niobium base (BE) and counter electrodes (CE) of the junction, and also change with time. Such Jc variations within a circuit reduce circuit performance and yield, and restrict integration scale. This variability of JJs is explained as caused by hydrogen contamination of Nb layers during wafer processing, which changes the height and structural properties of AlOx tunnel barrier. <b>Redistribution</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen <b>impurities</b> between JJ electrodes and other circuit layers by diffusion along Nb wires and through contacts between layers causes long-term drift of Jc. At least two DSLs are required to completely protect JJs from impurity diffusion effects - right below the junction BE and right above the junction CE. The simplest and the most technologically convenient DSLs we have found are thin (from 3 nm to 10 nm) layers of Al. They were deposited in-situ under the BE layer, thus forming an Al/Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb penta-layer, and under the first wiring layer to junctions' CE, thus forming an Al/Nb wiring bi-layer.

The composi-tional variation of Al, {{as well as}} the distribution <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> and/or defect, was revealed by variations in the cathodoluminescence spectra and images. The Al composition in an Al x Ga 1 – x As layer was highest in the (111) A facet and decreased in the order (100), (411) A, (111) - and (110) facets. On the other hand, the carbon concentration was highest in the (411) A facet and decreased in the order (111) A, (111) -, (100) and (110) facets. It {{should be noted that the}} (111) - facet has a significant effect on the <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> Al. Although our ridge-type triangles are rather large for the quantum structures, these data have elucidated the self-organization mechanism o...|$|R

40|$|Polycrystalline silicon (LPCVD) {{has been}} studied for contact, gate metal, and {{resistor}} application in integrated circuits. In this study the effect of heat-treatment on boron-implanted low pressure chemical vapor deposited poly-crystalline is investigated. In general, grain growth and morphology change take place in both preimplant and post-implant heat-treatment. Namely, the poly-Si films after heat-treatment consist of more equal axed grains than the mosaic dendrite structures in the untreated samples. However, the pre-implant heat-treatment appeared {{to be more effective}} for grain growth because <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> hindrance <b>of</b> grain boundary movement. The sheet resistivity of the pre-implant heat-treated samples is predominantly controlled by ion <b>redistribution,</b> and that <b>of</b> the postimplant annealed samples is controlled by both morphology change and ion <b>redistribution.</b> Both kinds <b>of</b> samples showed much lower resistivity due to heat-treatment reduction of grain boundary trapping centers and significant resistivity reversal anneal due to <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> the implanted ions. Polycrystall ine silicon {{has been studied}} for contact, gate metal, and resistor applications in integrated cir-cuits {{for more than a decade}} (1 - 9). Because of the un-controllable nature of morphology, it is rare to fin...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} is done of the ionization <b>of</b> deep <b>impurity</b> centers by high-intensity terahertz radiation, with photon energies tens of times {{lower than the}} impurity ionization energy. Under these conditions, ionization {{can be described as}} direct tunneling and phonon-assisted tunneling in which carrier emission is accompanied by defect tunneling in configuration space and electron tunneling in the electric field of the radiation. Within a broad range of intensity, frequency, and temperature, the terahertz electric field of the radiation acts like a static field. For very high frequencies and low temperatures an enhancement of tunneling as compared to static fields was observed. The transition between the quasi-static and the high frequency regime is determined by the tunneling time. For the case <b>of</b> deep <b>impurities</b> this is the time <b>of</b> <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> the defect vibrational system which depends strongly on temperature and the impurity structure...|$|R
