5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract solar systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being <b>reduced</b> <b>from</b> small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being <b>reduced</b> <b>from</b> small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E
5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates. The {{ammunition}} for the forward 12-inch guns was <b>reduced</b> <b>from</b> 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130mm ammunition was <b>reduced</b> <b>from</b> 245 to 100 rounds per gun {{in an attempt to}} compensate for her trim. This did not fully cure the problem, but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other changes could be implemented. This did not fully cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E
