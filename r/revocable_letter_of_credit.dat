40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} considerations for exporters in international trade transactions is the aspect of payment. In the context of financial risk management, <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> enable the exporter to substitute the <b>credit</b> risk <b>of</b> the buyer with that of his bank. The <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> is a conditional payment guarantee, relying on one hundred per cent documentary accuracy to trigger the payment. Less than one hundred per cent compliance means {{the loss of the}} payment guarantee. Non-compliance is a significant problem as, according to the International Chamber of Commerce, worldwide documentary discrepancy rates against <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> transactions have been estimated to be between sixty to seventy per cent. The mechanics <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> transactions comprise a complex web of interactions between banks, traders and their service providers, providing a fertile ground for discrepancies and existing literature acknowledges this world-wide problem. In the UK, in 2000, losses were estimated to be AUD 305 million (£ 113) through non-compliant documents being presented under <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> – this amount did not include lost opportunities and cash flow problems. In the same year, a separate USA study <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> transactions confirmed the high discrepancy rate, but also claimed that as long as buyers want the goods discrepancies did not translate into financial losses. The findings were refuted by others. It is the potential loss of revenue caused by the mismanagement of risk that is foremost in this research. It is estimated that the annual value <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> business for manufacturing exports to ASEAN is approximately AUD 3. 5 billion, with losses estimated to be upwards of AUD 920 million.

40|$|The <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{continues}} to play an indispensable role in the financing and securing of international commercial transactions.

40|$|Part I of this Article briefly {{describes}} the basic letter-of-credit transaction. Part II {{describes the}} discrepancies {{that appear in}} those transactions, providing detail from the data I collected. The data generally support the anecdotal information that led me to conduct the study: the documents presented in the 500 transactions I examined conformed to the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> only 27 % of the time. The payment transactions rendered the discrepancies irrelevant because the buyer waived the discrepancies {{in all but one}} case and provided full payment for the shipment in spite of the discrepant presentation. Part III uses the data and the interviews described above to assess the possible reasons for the common use <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> First, I reject the possibility that businesses use <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> out <b>of</b> irrational habit or custom because the ready availability and frequent use of alternative payment transactions strongly suggests that businesses rationally use <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Second, I evaluate the persuasiveness of the classic payment-assurance story and conclude that the payment-assurance story probably still has some plausibility, at least in contexts (such as many exports from the United States) where parties select the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to compensate for the weakness of relational ties between the buyer and the seller. Finally, I consider some alternative reasons that might motivate commercial enterprises to use <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Specifically, I argue that the issuing bank’s ability to verify information about the purchaser and the transaction provides the most compelling reason for widespread use <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis puts forward two {{principal}} arguments. First, it argues that commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{should not be}} treated on an equal footing. They are, and should be, treated as two separate undertakings {{with respect to the}} application of the fraud exception. Secondly, the thesis argues {{that there should be a}} 'wider' fraud exception for standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit; however, the need is to explore how wide that fraud exception should be. To support the arguments of this thesis, the study examines the application of the fraud exception in four major jurisdictions: the US, England, Canada and Australia. Out of these four jurisdictions, two - the US and Canada - have been expressly applying the wider fraud test to standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and the other two have traditionally applied the more stringent fraud test to standby credits. The research will compare and critically examine these four jurisdictions' approaches to their different tests of the fraud rule to standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and argue that the fraud rule for standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> should neither be too narrow ('fraud in documents') nor should it be too wide (fraud in the inducement or unconscionable conduct or bad faith). It is argued that standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are more abstract than commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> credit; therefore, protecting the principle of the autonomy of these independent undertakings is of paramount importance. The study argues that even the wider fraud exception (the 'fraud in the transaction' defence) should be given a narrow meaning: in order to protect the independence <b>of</b> standby <b>credits,</b> it should be confined to cases in which the beneficiary had 'no bona fide belief in the validity of its claim. The thesis clearly shows that the wider 'fraud as no bona fide claim' is an appropriate fraud defence for standby <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> whereas for commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> the fraud exception should be narrowly confined to 'fraud in documents', which is arguably an appropriate test for these undertakings.
