40|$|Many {{ultrasonic}} sensors {{intended for}} non-destructive testing include a plastic or metal element, known as <b>buffer</b> <b>rod,</b> between the ultrasonic transducer {{and the material}} under analysis. <b>Buffer</b> <b>rods</b> are often terminated {{in the form of}} a conical tip for ultrasonic inspection of liquid-like substances. The conical tip is carefully shaped in a 45 ?? angle to favour the in phase reception of all the components of the ultrasonic wave reflected at the buffer tip, obtaining thus a maximum amplitude measurement signal. The effect of the <b>buffer</b> <b>rod</b> cone angle on measurement signals is studied in this work. A straightforward approximate formula for the effect of the error angle on measurement signal amplitude is used. Simulations are performed using a two-dimensional finite differences tool. Measurements are conducted with the same operating conditions and <b>buffer</b> <b>rod</b> materials and dimensions as those defined for both approximate formula evaluation and simulations.
