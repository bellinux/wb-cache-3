The forward SG was supplemented <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar {{was moved to the}} rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar was <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> SG-1 mounted {{at the top of the}} foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height.

5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning for areas between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E

5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>A,</b> E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
