40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of sport disputes being heard by way of arbitration, some have called it a ‘growth industry’. Much has been written on the relative benefits of sport-specific arbitration processes as compared to the litigation process but few contributions have probed more deeply to address the function and design of such a process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine how certain prescribed rules of an arbitration process can serve as instruments of sport policy. Three rules of the arbitration process, each of which goes beyond a basic rule of procedure operation and has important policy implications for the sport organisation and sport in general, are discussed. The three rules relate to the proper scope of review of the adjudicator, the standard of review to be used in defining an error and the scope of authority of the adjudicator in crafting a remedy. Each of the rules can affect not just the outcome of a decision, but also the role decision-makers play within the sport organisation. The underlying premise of this paper is the view that the arbitration process and, more specifically, the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> should be designed to support and to facilitate the desired function of independent sport arbitration. What that function is must be considered in light of the sport organisation’s own governance and policy-making role. Policy-based rules of procedure such as the three discussed here, can either support that role or make incursions into the independent functioning of the sport organisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} {{of international trade}} is specific and evolves rapidly in accordance with its needs. Today arbitration constitutes the usual way to settle disputes of international commerce. However, certain <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> {{do not seem to}} be adapted with this practice. The written form of the arbitration agreement as required by, inter alia, the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration is one of them. First this thesis presents the rules of these two instruments. Then international trade's practice is examined, and especially the incorporation of arbitration clauses by reference and the use of electronic means to conclude such clauses. There is a noteworthy discrepancy between the rules and reality of trade. Having exposed the various difficulties, this thesis examines national laws and case law in order to determine whether they offer satisfactory solutions. Different interesting answers have been brought in Civil Law as well as Common Law countries. Yet they remain local and do not allow for harmonization worldwide. They even often vary one from another and are sometimes contradictory. A more satisfactory solution could be found on the international level, and more specifically by the UNCITRAL. Indeed the Commission entrusted the Working Group II the mission of proposing a solution. A proposal of compromise has been drafted, namely, a revised article of the Model Law and an interpretative instrument of the New York Convention.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about solely the Saudi {{arbitration}} regulation (1983) and its implementation rules of 1985. It examines several fundamental questions: {{are the rules}} of procedure provided by the 1983 Regulations appropriate to the developments {{that have occurred in}} the area of international commercial arbitration in the period following their adoption? Or are they considered outdated? Do those rules of procedure provide the flexibility necessary to meet the complexity usually involved in commercial disputes? What do foreign companies think of the 1983 Regulations? Do the 1983 Regulations require any • adjustment? The thesis is intended to provide guidance to legislatures in their regulatory efforts and assist local courts and judges in developing an arbitration culture. This first chapter consists of the general introduction. Chapter two provides general background on the nature of international commercial arbitration from one side and concept in Sharia from the other side. Chapter three demonstrates the status of arbitration in Saudi Arabia from the establishment of the Kingdom up to the issue of the Arbitration Regulation. Chapters four, five and six analyse and compare the UNCITRAL Model Law and some other national arbitration laws with the position in KSA {{in the light of the}} Arbitration Regulation of 1983 and its Implementation of 1985. Chapter four focuses on arbitration agreements, addressing the validity of the arbitration agreement. Chapter five deals exclusively with all issues related to the arbitrator: numbers, method of appointments and qualifications. This chapter moves on to discuss dismissing and challenging the arbitrator. Fees and expenses are also considered. Chapter six is devoted to arbitral awards: deliberation, use of vote, time limits, awards in writing, language, place, date, reasons and signature of the award, registration of the arbitral award and its notification to the parties to the dispute. Correction and interpretation of the award are also discussed. Essential aspects of challenge are examined: reason, method, time limit and the procedure of challenge. Finally, recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award are discussed, concentrating on the role of the international conventions and the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> concerning the recognition and enforcement.

The number of international commercial deals that are made every day is countless.

However, where there are problems, methods to resolve the disagreements will invariably appear. One of the main and mostly preferred methods is arbitration.

40|$|In this Article, Professor Guzman {{resolves}} {{the tension}} that exists between mandatory legal rules and the widespread use <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> In recent years, U. S. courts have expanded the range <b>of</b> enforceable <b>arbitration</b> agreements to include agreements that cover areas of law previously thought to be within the exclusive domain of courts. Among the disputes that are now deemed arbitrable are those that implicate mandatory rules such as securities and antitrust laws. Under current law, the willingness of courts to enforce arbitration agreements and to uphold the resulting arbitral awards with minimal judicial review {{makes it possible for}} the parties to a transaction to avoid mandatory <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> law. Until now, it has generally been believed that the legal system must either restrict the use <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> or permit arbitration and accept that doing so turns all mandatory rules into default rules. This Article proposes a mechanism that permits the continued use <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> without abandoning the mandatory nature <b>of</b> legal <b>rules.</b> The recommended approach, called 2 ̆ 2 arbitrator liability, 2 ̆ 2 allows the losing party in an arbitration to sue the arbitrator on the ground that a mandatory rule was ignored. Under existing legal rules, arbitrators have an incentive to ignore mandatory <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> law in favor of the contractual terms agreed to by the parties. Arbitrator liability gives arbitrators an incentive to apply mandatory <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> law. Giving proper incentives to arbitrators will ensure that mandatory rules are enforced, thereby eliminating the incentive for the parties to draft arbitration agreements intended to avoid those <b>rules.</b> The benefits <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> can be retained without sacrificing the ability of lawmakers to adopt mandatory rules...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the judiciary and arbitration must be based upon integration and cooperation and not upon competition and tension. From this point, the competent court must play the vital role of supporting and assisting the arbitration process during its various stages. To the extent that this relation is successful and harmonized, arbitration will be effective in resolving disputes within the shortest time and at the least expense. Judicial involvement in arbitral proceedings occurs during several stages of arbitration. This involvement starts with the competent court‟s decision to abstain from considering a case involving a dispute over an agreement that includes an arbitration clause. Court instead intervenes to enforce the arbitration agreement, supervising {{the selection of the}} arbitral tribunal and assisting in that process whenever the need arises. Thereafter, the court monitors the course of the arbitral proceedings by considering claims for the arbitrators' challenge and dismissal and, if such claims are successful, filling the resulting vacancy. Court Intervention extends to include an important and critical stage of the arbitral proceedings, which is the stage of pleading before the competent court. Whereas the competent court enjoys the power to enforce judicial decisions, the arbitral tribunal does not have such power. In this context, judicial assistance is indispensable to the arbitral tribunal, for example, in resolving a preliminary point, issuing a subpoena to a witness who refuses to appear before the tribunal, consolidating arbitral proceedings, ordering an uncooperative party to provide documents related to the dispute, rendering interim and conservatory measures, and extending the time limit for rendering the arbitration award. In considering the significance of the court's assistance of and support for arbitration at the procedural stage, the importance and contribution of this study is in its exploration of the pivots and patterns of the expected judicial review and assistance based upon both the provisions and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> and judicial precedents. Interviews conducted with senior judges, arbitrators and chiefs of international arbitration centres provide a rich tributary that enhances this study and supports it with vast and vital experience and with fresh information that cannot be found in any previous scientific research of this topic. In short, this study focuses upon the conception of the judicial involvement in supporting arbitral proceedings inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and upon evaluating this involvement in comparison with the involvement of the judiciary {{in the rest of the}} GCC states and international applications in this regard. Moreover, the study offers proposals and recommendations to the Saudi legislator in particular and to the Gulf legislator in general, and draws a model framework for the {{relationship between}} the judiciary and arbitration during the proceedings stage.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on nine sets of {{arbitration}} rules which include the rules of American Arbitration Association/The International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“AAA”) effective as of 1 June 2009, the rules of German Institution of Arbitration (“DIS”) in force from 1 July 1998, the rules of The Arbitration Institute of the Finland Chamber of Commerce (“FCC”) that came into force on 1 June 2013, the rules of Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) effective as of 1 November 2013, the rules of International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) in force since 1 January 2012, the rules of The London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) effective 1 January 1998, the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arbitration</b> Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (“SCC”) applicable as of 1 January 2010, the rules of The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) that took effect on 1 April 2013 and the rules of Swiss Chambers' Arbitration Institution that came into force on 1 June 2012 (“the Swiss rules”) of which six include a duty of confidentiality upon parties. The DIS, FCC, HKIAC, LCIA, SIAC and Swiss rules contain a duty of confidentiality upon parties. The basic idea of the thesis is to assess confidentiality {{from the point of}} view of institutional rules so national law is only employed as a back-up set of rules and as an interpretative aid. One research question is “How confidentiality based on institutional rules can be protected efficiently?”. The main idea is to evaluate the duties of confidentiality as obligations and to assess what they include. It is assessed what the duties of confidentiality include in terms of contents, temporal aspects and exceptions. Contents of the duties vary and the greatest difference relates to confidentiality of existence of the arbitration. Not protecting confidentiality of existence of the arbitration creates the first gap in confidentiality. Exceptions in the FCC and SIAC rules are of a developing nature, which makes them vague. In general, exceptions cannot be listed exhaustively in the rules. The exceptions create gaps in the duty of confidentiality because confidentiality cannot be absolute. However, because of the gaps a party may disclose based on inappropriate reasons. On the other hand, the exceptions take the need for publicity into account and thus the rules of FCC and SIAC are the most developed from that point of view. Another research question is “Why is confidentiality necessary?” to which the thesis answers by way of commenting interest in confidentiality and publicity from parties’ standpoint. The thesis also includes an assessment why duties of confidentiality have been enacted and why in a certain way. That evaluation is conducted from institute’s point of view. Further, it is presented how parties can affect efficient protection of confidentiality by way of assessing their own and opponent’s interests concerning confidentiality and publicity already when concluding the arbitration agreement. Although confidentiality is necessary, it may be breached or it can be tried to be breached. The thesis studies interim measures, remedies and sanctions {{from the point of view}} of protection of confidentiality...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Globally the {{resolution}} of disputes is known for expensive costs and lengthy periods of time before a court reaches a decision. This position becomes even more complex where a person has to resort to a foreign country with a foreign legal system to resolve a dispute. International commercial arbitration provides a practical alternative to resolve disputes {{in the world of}} international trade. lnternational commercial arbitration can shortly be described as a private method of dispute resolution, chosen by the parties themselves as an effective way of putting an end to disputes between them, without recourse to the courts of law. It is especially aimed at resolving disputes in a manner which is fast, effective and less costly. Due to South Africa's recent re- entry to international trade, the field of international commercial arbitration is relatively new from a South African perspective. In the light of South Africa's continuous economical expansions and participation in international trade, the role of international commercial arbitration will become increasingly important. Some of the advantages of international commercial arbitration include that the parties to the dispute can choose the rules and procedures to apply in resolving the dispute. Fundamental to the enforcement of an international commercial arbitration award is the requirement that the arbitrators be independent and impartial. The independency and impartiality of arbitrators within the international context is also linked with the vested international and domestic right to a just and fair trial. Should there not be adhered to the requirements of independency and impartiality, one opens the door to a variety of risks within the international commercial arbitration process. The most important risk is that of the award not being enforced {{in a court of law}} due to a lack of either independency or impartiality. Within the framework of international commercial arbitration, there exist various rules and guidelines with regard to the process and procedures to be followed. The international commercial arbitration instruments include the UNCITRAL <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arbitration</b> of 1996, the UNCITRAL Model Law of 1985, the ICC Rules of 1998 and the LCIA Rules. All of these rules require the independent and/ or impartial composition of the arbitration tribunal especially with regard to the enforcement of the award. In the light of the increasing importance of international commercial arbitration, this study is concerned with the thought of the above mentioned international instruments' failure to provide clear and concise guidelines and measurements with regard to the effective establishment of an arbitral tribunal deemed to be independent and impartial. In this mini- dissertation it is aimed to provide some insight with regard to possible methods on which parties can rely to ensure that arbitrators appointed by them will be deemed to meet the expected requirements of independency and impartiality, despite the vagueness encountered in most of the international arbitration documents.

40|$|Providing an {{extensive}} historical overview <b>of</b> federal <b>arbitration</b> jurisprudence and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), this article {{argues that the}} Supreme Court has misinterpreted FAA provisions and goals, thereby drastically changing the law <b>of</b> labor <b>arbitration</b> {{to the detriment of}} American workers and consumers. Namely, original congressional policy goals (providing speedy, fair and informal alternatives to court adjudication) have been countermanded by the Supreme Court’s interpretation <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> law over the last 50 years. As a result, modern arbitration law sets up an imbalance of power between employers/merchants and workers/consumers who are forced into lengthy and expensive procedures before they can exercise their legal rights to sue. At the time the FAA was passed, arbitration relied on the concept of voluntary consent by both parties, but modern arbitration agreements are often not the result of voluntary consent but of a more powerful contracting party who controls the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arbitration</b> forum, thereby exerting pressure on a weaker party. Arguing against this interpretation, this article posits options available to reverse current arbitration rules, including lower court judicial defiance, legislative overrides, and the possibility of Supreme Court reversal. This article concludes by suggesting a proposal for a narrow legislative fix to the FAA that would include national standards for arbitration agreements and would define “arbitration” to avoid the current practices that conflict with fundamental arbitration attributes and goals...|$|R
40|$|Earthmoving is {{a common}} {{activity}} at mines, construction sites, hazardous waste cleanup locations, and road works. Expensive and sophisticated machines such as front-end-loaders (FEL), backhoe loaders, LHD loaders and front shovels are used for these excavation tasks. Autonomous excavation control for these machines has gained considerable attention in order to remove human operators from hazardous environments, improve productivity and utilization, reduce machine abuse, as well as decrease machine operating costs. However, automatic control of excavation tasks for many sites that require digging in rock cannot be implemented using existing factory-based automation techniques. For example, control of bucket motions by simply partitioning the terrain into a set of volumes where each equals the bucket capacity often does not work. Planning {{in this way is}} possible only when digging in the materials such as loose soils where bucket motion resistance through the media can be predicted. Resistance predictions are impossible and/or infeasible to generate for excavation in the environments which consists mainly of irregular rigid objects such as rock piles with oversized particles, since no means exists to predetermine subsurface bucket/material interactions that are required to preplan the bucket trajectory. As a result, bucket actions must be determined through on-line decision making based on sensory feedback of the current excavation status in the unpredictable, unstructured and dynamic rock excavation environment. This research proposes a control method for autonomous rock excavation. The control architecture is designed following the behavior-based control concept. That is, the rock excavation control problem is solved by decomposition of the complicated task into a variety of simple elements that can be implemented by excavation behaviors. However, this control approach presents a new structure and operational paradigm that is developed based on, but different from the traditional behavior control method. Here, the behaviors are chosen using fuzzy excavation situation assessment with guidance of excavation task planning which embodies excavation heuristics and human strategies. Task plans are formulated using finite state machines which integrate neural networks for decision making. This organizational structure has the capability to include more excavation goals and to adapt to different environments via learning. Excavation behaviors are performed by primitive and machine executable actions or action sequences structured using finite state machines and simple action arbitration rules. The actions of human FEL operators were observed and analyzed to extract basic bucket actions and define <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> for different actions or action sequences under particular excavation environments. Fuzzy logic is applied to implement each excavation action where fuzzy rules represent the human experience and heuristics that are intrinsically linguistic, and bucket excavation motions are evaluated based on insufficient and inaccurate input sensory data. A variety of experiments were performed to test the ability of the proposed control algorithm. The laboratory-based experimental autonomous excavation system consists of a robotic arm, an excavation testbed, a force/torque sensor mounted between the robot arm wrist and the excavation bucket, and a control computer. Various rock piles to simulate realistic excavation environments and conditions were generated in the testbed. With these experiments, the control algorithm has demonstrated the ability to execute real-time automated loading cycles effectively and efficiently in complex excavation environments and under difficult digging conditions, through the use of the flexible excavation behaviors...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of our globalised world {{open the way}} for international trade and transactions between different countries; this may lead to conflicts in laws where transactions and trade {{may be subject to}} different legal systems. One of the biggest issues in international commercial law is disputes over the charging of interest, for example with regard to late payment, interest-based loans, or compensation for damages. Interest disputes are considered to be a complex area of law and even more complex in the international field. At the international level, interest claims may be connected to many areas of commerce and thus governed by various laws, which are different from one country to another; moreover, each country has its own interest rate and such rates are changeable according to the nature of law and economics under some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the concept of interest itself is affected by influences such as religious beliefs and economic, political and cultural trends. Interest can be treated as a substantive or a procedural matter. The settlement of these disputes therefore faces difficulties. Arbitration, as a method for settlement of disputes, is characterised by special features that assist in resolving these issues; but it faces some obstructions, especially in international commercial arbitration. The practices of arbitral tribunals and national courts in this regard are different. The results of different interpretations, approaches, and theories with regard to arbitration, at the pre-arbitration, during arbitration and post-arbitration stages, may also differ widely due to the diversity of financial and legal systems such as Common Law, Civil Law and the Islamic legal system – Sharia Law – across different countries. Each legal system has a different methodology and theories, even within an individual country under one legal system, and a state within a federal system has its own laws, which may have different interpretations in this respect. The New York Convention of 1958 on enforcing foreign arbitral awards was established in favour of arbitral awards and for the purpose of unifying international <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitration.</b> This Convention provides some procedural and substantive rules for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, but also provides some grounds for refusal. These rules have been affected by different interpretations under different jurisdictions and legal systems, which lead to different perspectives on the matter of charging interest and settlement by arbitration. The outcome of applying the NYC under these interpretations often has the opposite of its intended effect: the rejection of foreign arbitral awards. Due to such ambiguities, courts occasionally intervene in arbitration in all its stages. The interventions of national courts occur in three stages: enforcement of the arbitration agreement, enforcement of the contract under the applicable law to the agreement, and enforcement of the foreign arbitral award. The confusion between substantive and procedural laws also creates confusion with respect to public policy, non-arbitrability and enforceability. In addition, there may be a lack of clarity on the scope of arbitration with respect to the parties’ agreement, whether or not the parties have agreed to the interest rates and periods {{and whether or not they}} have agreed to the authority of the arbitrator. These issues affect the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, the law applicable to the disputed contract, the freedom of parties, the authority of the arbitrators and the enforceability of the awarded interest. The thesis studies how arbitral awards containing interest have been interpreted across the three aforementioned legal systems under the NYC 1958 in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, England, France, and the US and the enforceability of such awards...|$|E
40|$|It is now {{a common}} feature of {{international}} investment treaties to provide for investor-State arbitration to be initiated unilaterally by foreign investors. It is a much-anticipated and effective procedure {{for the protection of}} investors. At the same time, it brings advantages to recipient States as well in that they embody assurance for protection and thus encourage investments. However, as investors have been more active in their use of this arbitration procedure, recipient States have become increasingly concerned that an excessive burden has been placed upon them. These concerns include the fear that investor-State arbitration proceedings may improperly prevent the implementation of domestic policies, and that they may be abused by multiple usage of national/international procedures with regard to substantially "identical" facts, even though claimants in each procedure are different entities from a formal point of view. This paper evaluates these concerns {{from the perspective of the}} conditions surrounding the submission of claims to investor-State arbitration. When faced with a unilateral commencement of arbitral procedure, respondent States usually object to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal by alleging that some conditions are lacking, such as (1) the existence of legal disputes, (2) jurisdiction ratione temporae, (3) exhaustion of prior consultation, and (4) jus standi. Despite emphatic calls for consideration of sovereignty on the part of respondent States as a presumed limitation to competence, arbitral tribunals generally adopt literal interpretation of international investment agreements and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitration</b> procedures. Investors' right to sue is explicitly provided by States concerned in the text, whereas deference to sovereignty is not. It is inappropriate to claim from these past judgments that by placing too much emphasis on the need for protection of investments, arbitral tribunals tend to bend their interpretation of treaties in investors' favor. Nevertheless, we can point out at least one problem: they haven't paid much attention to the distinction between two different questions, i. e., their jurisdiction and admissibility of claim. They generally tend to treat issues concerning submission to arbitration solely as those regarding the arbitration agreement and, as such, related to the jurisdiction of tribunals. However, questions such as jus standi are issues pertaining to the appropriateness of submission of claims, which are questions of admissibility that cannot be reduced entirely to the interpretation of a "constructed" agreement between investors and the recipient State. Rather, they are concerned with the circumstances relating to the commencement of an arbitration proceeding, and they are not to be treated as something included in an "agreement" simply because the comprehensive consent of recipient States to investment arbitration is given in advance through treaty provisions. If there are justifiable grounds for concern or feelings of distrust on the part of recipient States involved in the active use of arbitration proceedings, they can be traced to the fact that arbitral tribunals tend to misunderstand pleas from respondent States on grounds of inappropriateness of submission in specific circumstances to mean that a submission of claims exceeds the reach of their consent given in treaties. One of the reasons for this attitude among arbitral tribunals lies in the dogma of party autonomy: operation of arbitral proceedings are to be based on agreement between the parties concerned, so they seek to base and explain their judgment exclusively in terms of "agreement," which is constructed by juncture of an offer on the part of recipient States set out in a treaty and an acceptance on the part of an investor by way of submission of claim. But, in view of past judgments, it is worthwhile to consider providing arbitral tribunals explicitly with competence to handle questions of admissibility as distinct from those of jurisdiction. From this point of view, it is of great significance that the ICSID rules of proceeding for arbitration were revised in 2006 in order for arbitral tribunals to deal with the objection to a claim that is "manifestly without legal merit. " Its future application should be watched closely. ...|$|E
