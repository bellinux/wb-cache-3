5|$|The railway came to Christchurch in 1847 {{although}} the nearest station, Christchurch Road, was at Holmsley and passengers were taken the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> by omnibus. In 1862 a new station {{was built in}} the town close to where it stands today and was served by a branch line from Ringwood.

Christchurch, and in particular Mudeford, had been enjoying a modest tourist trade since King George III had patronised the town in the 1790s but the arrival of the railways made Christchurch accessible to more potential visitors. A power station was built in Christchurch in 1903 to power the public trams. The excess generated was sufficient to light the town and in 1940 it was added to the national grid.|$|E

40|$|This article centres around objectification. It {{offers an}} {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notions {{that are involved}} in this phenomenon, their moral wrongness, as well as the connections that exist between them. Martha Nussbaum has suggested that seven notions are involved in objectification: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity. She espouses the view that <b>the</b> instrumentalisation <b>of</b> human beings (<b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> human beings instrumentally to achieve our purposes) is especially problematic as compared to <b>the</b> other <b>ways</b> in which we can treat human beings as objects (for example, denying their autonomy and subjectivity, or treating them as violable). In this paper, I argue against the view that instrumentalisation should be thought of as more suspicious from a moral point <b>of</b> view than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which people can be treated as objects. Singling out extreme instrumentality for being especially problematic might lead us to underestimate the wrongness involved in <b>the</b> other <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> treating human beings as objects, and can therefore potentially distort our understanding of what, more generally, is wrong with objectifying human beings...|$|R
