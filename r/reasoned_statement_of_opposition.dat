50|$|In England, {{a public}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> was {{included}} in The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards, written in 1395. Sir Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516, debated {{the benefits of the}} death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian Cesare Beccaria Dei Delitti e Delle Pene ("On Crimes and Punishments"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility {{from the point of view}} of social welfare, of torture and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, Grand Duke Leopold II of Habsburg, the future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the first permanent abolition in modern times. On 30 November 1786, after having de facto blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating Cities for Life Day.|$|R
5000|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his second}} year in Leipzig for the Eighth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, [...] "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Matthew, the warning of false prophets from the Sermon on the Mount (...) [...] The cantata text is based on the hymn [...] "", published in 1524 by the Lutheran reformer Justus Jonas as a paraphrase of Psalm 124. The theme of the psalm, the need of help against raging enemies, corresponds to the Gospel. Compared to Bach's other chorale cantatas of the period, the unknown poet kept much of the original text, six of the eight stanzas, expanding two of them by recitative, to connect even closer to the Gospel. He paraphrased only stanzas 3 and 6 to an aria each. In the last aria, in a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> to rationalism—the [...] "weasel words of rationalists, who would bring down the whole Lutheran theological edifice" [...] in the words of John Eliot Gardiner—the poet expands the words of the reformers' hymn, [...] "" [...] (reason cannot grasp it), appealing to reason, described as unstable and frenzied, to be silent.|$|R

Several dozen prayers are incorporated into the Psalm, e.g. [...] "Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of your law." [...] Themes include opposition by man, affliction, delight in the law and the goodness of God, which sometimes run into each other: [...] "I know, O Lord, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me" [...] (v. 75), or [...] "If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction" [...] (v. 92). The Psalmist at times seems to appeal to God's sovereignty, [...] "inclining his heart to the law" [...] in contrast to the Psalmist saying [...] "I incline my heart." [...] Thus, God as sovereign is invoked in v.36 [...] "Incline my heart to your testimonies", while the Psalmist also takes personal responsibility in v. 112, [...] "I incline my heart to perform your statutes forever." [...] It ends with an appeal to God to seek his servant who strayed.|$|R

The results of the referendum revealed that with 68% of the votes, Measure 2 had been approved. After the passing of the amendment, Article I, section 25 of the Alaska Constitution was amended to read as follows:Marriage. To be valid or recognized in this State, a marriage may exist only between one man and one woman.Subsequently, in light of the amendment, the Alaska Superior Court dismissed the Brause lawsuit and rendered the previous rulings moot.|$|R

50|$|Because of Menjou's {{public support}} of McCarthy's hunt for communists, the anti-imperialistic {{propaganda}} of the GDR (German Democratic Republic) used {{to display their}} western opponents typically with a Menjou-style moustache. Also, in the GDR it was rated as a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> political <b>opposition</b> to trim one's moustache that way. This kind of beard became a general symbol for the demimonde, criminal Westler and in Germany it is still called Menjou-Bärtchen (Menjou beardlet). In German film and theatre play dubious gentlemen, opportunists, corrupt politicians, fraudulent persuaders, marriage impostors or other charming criminals are often equipped with such a Menjou-Bärtchen and in real life it is linked by prejudice and self-fulfilling prophecy to occupations like car trader, traveling salesman, insurance agent, pimp, investment consultant or estate agent.|$|R

60|$|An {{interesting}} study {{might be}} made, if {{the limits of}} our subject permitted such a digression, on the new political ideas which a century's experience in England, France, Germany, the American Union, has added to the publicist's stock. Diderot's article on the Legislator is a curious mixture of views which political thinkers have left behind, with views which the most enlightened statesmen have taken up. There is much talk after the fashion of Jean Jacques Rousseau about the admirable legislation of Lycurgus at Sparta, the philosophical government of the great empire of China, and the fine spirit of the institutions of Peru. We perceive that the same influences which made Rousseau's political sentimentalism so popular also brought even strong heads like Diderot {{to believe in the}} unbounded power of a government to mould men at its will, and to impose institutions at discretion. The idea that it is the main function of a government to make its people virtuous, is generally as strong in Diderot as it was in Rousseau, and as it became in Robespierre. He admires the emperors of China, because their edicts are as the exhortation of a father to his children. All edicts, he says, ought to instruct and to exhort as much as they command. Yet two years after the Encyclopædia was finished (1774), when Turgot prefaced his reforming edicts by elaborate and <b>reasoned</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the grounds for them, it was found that his prefaces caused greater provocation than the very laws that they introduced.|$|R
