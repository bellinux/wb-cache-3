40|$|Basic {{structural}} {{properties of}} Russian railways are explored through the complex network scope. We imply ontology where <b>railway</b> <b>stations</b> portray <b>nodes,</b> while links {{are represented by}} trains plying among stations. The information L- network model founded on route is built and its topology is compared with Indian and Pakistan analogues. The network model demonstrates small world properties and its assortative nature. Structural vulnerability is assessed for random attacks, and those on degree and strength targets. Taking into account series of the node centralities, the most important sites are identified as those that could help in clarifying the sensitive points in the network. These sites {{should be in the}} focus of pre-protection and post hazard recovery. Also, a P-model is touched and an S- and H- model idea is proposed for further analysis of transportation networks...|$|R

There is also the Jurong spur line, [...] in length. The area occupied by the railways is at least , and up to [...] when the land around the Tanjong Pagar <b>Railway</b> <b>Station</b> and other <b>nodes</b> are included. Given {{the location of the}} railway lands in land scarce Singapore, there was concern that the lands would be developed. Organisations such as the Nature Society Singapore developed comprehensive plans to maintain the rail lands for nature-related pursuits.

50|$|Panvel {{is a major}} {{station and}} is {{considered}} equivalent to Mumbai's stations for trains which skip Mumbai. The trains run on diesel traction and alternating current (the tracks to Konkan are not electrified south of Panvel), and Panvel is a refueling point for their locomotives. In addition to refueling, Panvel has {{a huge number of}} parcel bookings, and most trains stop for periods varying from 5 minutes to 20 minutes for technical purposes. Panvel also handles crew and locomotive change for long distance passenger / freight trains. Panvel <b>railway</b> <b>station</b> also has siding for suburbs trains located in New Panvel (W) and for locomotives in New Panvel (E). There are two <b>railway</b> <b>stations</b> in the <b>node.</b> First one is located in Sector 17 of New Panvel (E) and second is located in sector 17 of New Panvel (W) named Khandeshwar.|$|R
40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>stations</b> {{function}} as <b>nodes</b> in transport networks and places {{in an urban}} environment. They have accessibility and environmental impacts, which contribute to property value. The literature {{on the effects of}} <b>railway</b> <b>stations</b> on property value is mixed in its finding in respect to the impact magnitude and direction, ranging from a negative to an insignificant or a positive impact. This paper attempts to explain the variation in the findings by meta-analytical procedures. Generally the variations are attributed to the nature of data, particular spatial characteristics, temporal effects and methodology. <b>Railway</b> <b>station</b> proximity is addressed from two spatial considerations: a local station effect measuring the effect for properties with in 1 / 4 mile range and a global station effect measuring the effect of coming 250 m closer to the station. We find that the effect of <b>railway</b> <b>stations</b> on commercial property value mainly takes place at short distances. Commercial properties within 1 / 4 mile rang are 12. 2 % more expensive than residential properties. Where the price gap between the <b>railway</b> <b>station</b> zone and the rest is about 4. 2 % for the average residence, it is about 16. 4 % for the average commercial property. At longer distances the effect on residential property values dominate. We find that for every 250 m a residence is located closer to a station its price is 2. 3 % higher than commercial properties. Commuter <b>railway</b> <b>stations</b> have a consistently higher positive impact on the property value compared to light and heavy railway/Metro stations. The inclusion of other accessibility variables (such as highways) in the models reduces the level of reported <b>railway</b> <b>station</b> impact. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
