25|$|A 2009 {{clinical}} trial at Massachusetts General Hospital used the cancer drug Bevacizumab (commercial name: Avastin) to treat 10 patients with neurofibromatosis type II. The result {{was published in}} The New England Journal of Medicine. Of the ten patients treated with bevacizumab, tumours shrank in 9 of them, with the median best <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 26%. Hearing improved {{in some of the}} patients, but improvements were not strongly correlated with tumour shrinkage. Bevacizumab works by cutting the blood supply to the tumours and thus depriving them of their growth vector. Side effects during the study included alanine aminotransferase, proteinuria, and hypertension (elevated blood pressure) among others. A separate trial, published in The Neuro-oncology Journal, show 40% tumour reduction in the two patients with NF2, along with significant hearing improvement.|$|E
25|$|A non-representative {{survey on}} the sexual {{behaviour}} of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had a <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.|$|E

Unlike Thorndike's puzzle box, this arrangement allowed the subject to make one or two simple, repeatable responses, {{and the rate of}} such responses became Skinner's primary behavioral measure. [...] Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these response rates could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> various reinforcement schedules. A reinforcement schedule may be defined as [...] "any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule". The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.|$|E

High-dose IL- 2 therapy produces overall <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> 15 % to 20 %; however, it is associated with significant toxicities that affect essentially every organ system. Although IL- 2 -related toxicities are usually reversible with therapy discontinuation, alternative IL- 2 regimens have been evaluated. Several phase II studies have demonstrated that administering lower doses of IL- 2 by IV bolus or continuous IV infusion or subcutaneously produces overall <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> similar to those with high-dose IL- 2 therapy; however, randomized clinical trials have not yet been completed. In renal cell carcinoma, combining IL- 2 with interferon alfa (Intron A, Roferon-A) or chemotherapy agents produces similar or increased overall <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> compared with the <b>response</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> IL- 2 alone, with no survival advantage. Combination IL- 2 regimens in metastatic melanoma patients have produced variable results. The most promising regimens have included various IL- 2 -based biochemotherapy regimens in other patients.
