50|$|While the {{avalanche}} <b>recovery</b> <b>circuit</b> is quenching {{the avalanche}} and restoring bias, the SPAD cannot detect photons. Any photons that reach the detector during this brief period are not counted. As {{the number of}} photons increases such that the (statistical) time interval between photons gets within a factor of ten {{or so of the}} avalanche recovery time, missing counts become statistically significant and the count rate begins to depart from a linear relationship with detected light level. At this point the SPAD begins to saturate. If the light level were to increase further, ultimately {{to the point where the}} SPAD immediately avalanches the moment the avalanche <b>recovery</b> <b>circuit</b> restores bias, the count rate reaches a maximum defined purely by the avalanche recovery time (hundred million counts per second or more). This can be harmful to the SPAD as it will be experiencing avalanche current nearly continuously.|$|E

40|$|Clock <b>recovery</b> <b>circuits</b> which {{extract the}} clock signal from random NRZ data are very {{important}} to the multigigabit-per-second integrated receivers. Regarding the factors of flexibility and cost of implementation, phase-locked loops are standard approaches to CRCs. In a PLL, the phase detector is a key component which determines several significant properties of the PLL. The goal of this project is to compare the self-adjusting performance, noise performance, duty-cycle performance, and data-pattern dependence of several phase detectors, which are: Alexander PD [1], Hogge PD[2], and an improved Hogge PD designed in this project. The simulation tool is Matlab, which can verify the functionality of the circuit and provide a feasibility analysis within a reasonable time. We also compare the performance of the PLL with the PLL/DLL, which would enable jitter-free clock recovery. 1.

50|$|The ores {{are treated}} by a sulfatizing roast in a {{fluidized}} bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble oxides and iron into insoluble hematite. The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte. Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step {{to maintain the}} acid balance in the circuit. Iron and aluminum are removed from the leach solution {{by the addition of}} lime, and copper is electrowon on copper cathodes. A part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt <b>recovery</b> <b>circuit</b> and is purified by the removal of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide. This is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the pH until the remaining copper precipitates. This copper is sent back to the copper circuit. As more lime is then added, a copper-cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is added (along with some metallic cobalt as a catalyst) to precipitate nickel sulfide (NiS). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) are then added to precipitate zinc sulfide (ZnS). Lime is then added to saturation to precipitate cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)2). In the final stages, this cobalt hydroxide is redissolved and the metal is refined by electrolysis. The resulting cobalt cathodes are crushed and vacuum degassed to obtain a pure cobalt metal.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{increase}} of stope height due to increasing mechanization in the years 60 to 90, more waste were produced {{for the same amount}} of ore (dilution) resulting in higher amounts of low grade ore reaching the plant. It was necessary to replace the pre-concentration done by manual selection (handpicking) and jigging, with a more efficient method and with greater capacity to deal with the greater volume of ore plus waste that reached the plant. In 1971 a Heavy Medium separation (HMS) was installed which carries out pre-concentration in a very effective way and with minimal losses. Due to improvement in the mine stopping method and greater need for fragmentation for the medium separation, a fines <b>recovery</b> <b>circuit</b> was installed in the 60’s which was improved and expanded in the 80s. Currently, the ore is stopped with a grade of approximately 0.15% WO3 [...] Its concentration is in the first stages totally hydrogravitic. Taking advantage of the dense characteristic of the minerals to be exploited (volframite, cassiterite and chalcopyrite) {{and in the case of}} the Panasqueira of coarse mineralization. After secondary crushing to 20mm the ore undergoes enrichment through dense medium and shaking tables until a pre-concentrate with approximately 6% of W03 is obtained. This pre-concentrate is then concentrated to grades close to those of final concentration in flotation tables, for the simultaneous enrichment of the dense particles and separation of the sulfides, which are then flotated [...] to obtain a final copper concentrate (chalcopyrite). The dense pre-concentrate is then separated in tables and electromagnetic separation in wolfram (wolframite) and tin (cassiterite) concentrates.|$|E

40|$|Clock {{and data}} <b>recovery</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{essential}} components in communication systems. They directly influence the bit-error-rate performance of communication links. It is desirable {{to predict the}} rate of occasional detection errors {{and the loss of}} synchronization due to the non-ideal operation of such circuits. In high-speed data networks, the bit-error-rate specification on the system can be very stringent, i. e., 10. It is not feasible to predict such error rates with straightforward, simulation based, approaches. This work introduces a stochastic model and an efficient, analysis-based, nonMonte -Carlo method for performance evaluation of digital data and clock <b>recovery</b> <b>circuits.</b> The analyzed circuit is modeled as finite state machines with inputs described as functions on a Markov chain state-space. System performance measures, such as probability of bit errors and rate of synchronization loss, can be evaluated through the analysis of a larger resulting Markov system.
