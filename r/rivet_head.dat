40|$|The {{investigation}} of machine-countersunk flush rivets for aircraft described in reference 1 revealed {{the necessity of}} having {{the height of the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> greater than the depth of the countersunk holes if tightly riveted joints were to be obtained. If ordinary roundhead rivets were inserted from {{the opposite side of the}} joint and the countersunk heads formed in the driving of the rivets filled the countersunk holes completely, still tighter joints were obtained. In either case the rivets protruded above the skin surface after driving, and the protruding portion of the <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> had to be removed in order to obtain flush rivets.

Nine rows of rivets on both surfaces, simulating rivet spacing of multispan construction, increased the drag coefficients by a constant amount at velocities between 100 and 120 miles per hour. Accordingly, if rivets spaced the same as those on the test airfoil were used on a Clark Y wing of 300 square feet area and operated at 200 miles per hour, the drag would be increased over that for the smooth wing by 55 pounds and the power required would be increased by 29 horsepower...|$|R

50|$|A rivet gun, {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a type of tool used to drive rivets. The rivet gun is used on the manufactured head side of the rivet and a bucking bar is used on the buck-tail side of the rivet. The energy from the hammer in the rivet gun drives the work and the rivet against the inertia of the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the rivet is deformed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all rivet guns are pneumatically powered. Those rivet guns used to drive rivets in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A rivet gun differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force.|$|E

Colonel Rivet's memoirs remain controversial, but according to his account the official Bureau des Menées Antinationales (Bureau of Anti-national Activities, BMA), officially an organization opposing communist activities and resistance efforts and accepted by the Germans {{under the terms of the}} armistice, was in reality a cover for the pursuit of collaborators with the Germans.

40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> The results demonstrate that the correct formation of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|E
