He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 <b>roentgen.</b> A dose of 1 Gy (~100 <b>roentgen)</b> can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 <b>roentgen</b> (R) per day. At the time, this {{was considered to be}} an amount of radiation that could be tolerated for long periods without any harmful effects on health. Since there was no special clothing or radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm <b>Roentgen</b> {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E

The problem of generating crosslinking in wool fibers by irradiation has thus far been neglected in the literature, but the remarkable change in dye-accessibility and solubility of wool fibers caused by the irradiation with smaller doses ranging from 103 to 10 ° <b>roentgens</b> suggests the production of crosslinking...|$|R

5|$|Roentgenium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is {{a synthetic}} element {{that can be}} created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of 2.1minutes, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may have a longer half-life of about 11minutes. Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (also spelled <b>Roentgen).</b>|$|E
5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early {{investigation}} of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the <b>Roentgen</b> rays, but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E

5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 {{had been exposed to}} more than 0.1 <b>roentgens,</b> but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 <b>roentgens,</b> and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 <b>roentgens.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{radiation}} {{levels in}} the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6 <b>roentgens</b> per second (R/s), equivalent to more than 20,000 <b>roentgens</b> per hour. A lethal dose is around 500 <b>roentgens</b> (~5 Gy) over 5 hours, so in some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses {{in less than a}} minute. However, a dosimeter capable of measuring up to 1000 R/s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building, and another one failed when turned on. All remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s and therefore read [...] "off scale". Thus, the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001 R/s (3.6 R/h), while the true levels were much higher in some areas.|$|R

25|$|Inquiries {{that began}} with the Geissler tube {{continued}} as even better vacuums were produced. The most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by William Crookes.

J. Thomson and X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm <b>Roentgen.</b> But the Crookes tube, as it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated luminescence.|$|E
25|$|Acoustics is by {{no means}} the only subject which finds use for {{weighting}} curves however, and they are widely used in deriving measures of effect for sun exposure, gamma radiation exposure, and many other things. In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'. The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (<b>roentgen</b> equivalent man).|$|E

25|$|The Soulages {{collection}} of Italian and French Renaissance objects was acquired between 1859 and 1865, and includes several cassone. The John Jones Collection of French 18th-century art and furnishings {{was left to}} the museum in 1882, then valued at £250,000. One {{of the most important}} pieces in this collection is a marquetry commode by the ébéniste Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of furniture in the collection include a bureau by Jean-François Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by André Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century ébénistes represented in the Museum collection include Adam Weisweiler, David <b>Roentgen,</b> Gilles Joubert & Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticised at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon {{collection of}} French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.|$|E
500|$|The Metallurgical Laboratory's Health Division set {{standards}} for radiation exposure. Workers were routinely tested at University of Chicago clinics, but {{this could be}} too late. Personal quartz fiber dosimeters were procured, as were film badge dosimeters, which recorded cumulative dosage. Stone's Health Division worked closely with William P. Jesse's Instrumentation Group in the Physics Division to develop detectors, including portable Geiger counters. Herbert M. Parker created a metric for radiation exposure he called the <b>roentgen</b> equivalent man or rem. After the war, this replaced the <b>roentgen</b> as the standard measure of radiation exposure. Work to assess the toxicity of plutonium got under way when the plutonium [...] at the Clinton Engineer Works began producing it in 1943.

500|$|A {{total of}} 18,875 film badge {{dosimeters}} were issued to personnel during the operation. About 6,596 dosimeters {{were given to}} personnel who {{were based on the}} nearby islands or support ships that had no potential for radiation exposure. The rest were issued to all of the individuals thought to be at the greatest risk for radiological contamination along with a percentage of each group who were working in less contaminated areas. Personnel were removed for one or more days from areas and activities of possible exposure if their badges showed more than 0.1 <b>roentgen</b> (R) per day exposure. This is [...] about the same as the annual occupational dose limit in practice at many modern U.S. nuclear facilities.

500|$|A [...] "tentative" [...] {{estimate}} of the doses involved was made in 1948, based on dozens of assumptions, {{some of which are}} now known to be grossly incorrect. In the absence of personal dosimetry badges, the study authors relied on measurements of sodium activation in the victims' blood and urine samples as their primary source of data. This activation would have been caused by neutron radiation, but they converted all doses to equivalent doses of gamma or X-ray radiation. They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 rem (respectively) of gamma rays. Minimum and maximum estimates varied from about 50% to 200% of these values. The authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80keV X-rays and gamma rays, which they believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent. In this model the equivalent X-ray doses were much higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, whereas the gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin's equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930R (<b>roentgen)</b> of X-ray with 114R of gamma, while Daghlian's equivalent dose was estimated to be 480R of X-ray with 110R of gamma.
