5|$|In July 1848, not {{too long}} after James Marshall's famous gold find at Sutter's Mill – which started the California Gold Rush – Major Reading {{discovered}} gold on the Trinity River. The find attracted thousands of miners to the area and created boomtowns such as Douglas City, Francis, Hoboken, Lake City, Lewiston, Junction City and Quimby. Weaverville, located {{at the end of}} the trail Reading had established from the Sacramento Valley to the Trinity, prospered as the main trade center through which gold was exchanged for imported supplies and services. The initial discoveries were placer deposits, carried by the river to settle in gravel bars. The Trinity River gold <b>rush</b> <b>is</b> also noted for the large number of Chinese miners attracted to the area, as many as 2,500 by 1854. Many of the Chinese were from the Pearl River Delta (Guangdong region).|$|E

5|$|Rush married Anne Aby (known as Annie) Fitzpatrick on 18 September 1865, at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. Annie Fitzpatrick, born 1846, was the {{daughter}} of Irish ex-convicts. She bore Rush fourteen children, three of whom died in infancy and two in early adulthood. None of Rush's children became professional sportsmen, though three of his sons competed successfully in various amateur sculling contests and one as a cyclist. His daughter Emily was a well-known amateur singer during her youth. Two Rush sons fought in the Boer War, another went gold-prospecting on the Kalgoorlie gold-fields, and died there. Rush retired around 1913, to a cottage and ten acres of land in Hurstville, New South Wales. He died there on 22 December 1922, after a brief illness. <b>Rush</b> <b>is</b> buried in Sydney's Waverley Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The free-for-all {{and team}} {{versions}} of Shootout mode both follow a traditional deathmatch scenario where players or teams must accumulate the most kills. Many capture the flag variants are also available. Hold Your Own {{is a traditional}} mode where each team has to defend their bag of gold from the enemy team whilst capturing the other. Grab The Bag has both teams attacking one bag placed in {{a section of the}} map. Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>is</b> a free-for-all variant, trying to grab and keep as many bags as possible. The multiplayer portion Red Dead Redemption also features open world gameplay. All players in the server can form or join a group of other players, known as a posse, of up to eight players and take part in activities such as hunting or attacking computer-controlled gang hideouts or another player's posse. In some game modes, players are unable to kill other players.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} planet, the search begins for a {{suitable}} source of lime to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. <b>Rush</b> <b>is</b> vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out for a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{gameplay}} in The Bouncer {{consists of}} the player fighting groups of enemies using hand-to-hand combat techniques. Occasionally, one of the AI controlled bouncers will do a taunt, prompting a button-press to activate a team attack ("Trinity Rush") which damages all enemies on screen. However, the Trinity <b>Rush</b> <b>is</b> ineffective against some bosses. In some instances, the player will also be tasked with activities other than fighting, such as running {{through a series of}} hallways to avoid being caught in a flood, finding a keycard, or fooling enemies into thinking the player is one of them. In general, a gameplay segment ends when the player has either defeated all of the enemies in the area, has defeated a boss enemy, or has achieved a set goal.|$|E
25|$|Each {{party has}} two goals, {{ten or fifteen}} yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line, facing each other at about ten yards’ {{distance}} midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator throws up a ball {{the size of a}} cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The <b>rush</b> <b>is</b> to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals. At a loss and gain of a snotch a recommencement takes place.|$|E
