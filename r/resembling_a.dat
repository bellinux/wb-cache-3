5000|$|The film {{uses the}} {{technique}} of pixilation and shows a man's hands (the hands are PES's) making guacamole out of familiar objects, which become different items whenever they are cut, often depending on (unspoken) puns.

50|$|The {{researchers}} found that {{on the right side}} of the brain, activity patterns stayed the same for every face except for non-face images, when brain patterns began to change dramatically regardless of whether or not the image <b>resembled</b> <b>a</b> face. On the left side of the brain, activity slowly changed as the images began to <b>resemble</b> <b>a</b> face. This led to the Sinha and the researchers determining that the left side of the brain decides how much <b>an</b> image <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> face but does not assign them to any classification, while the right side of the brain is the portion that ultimately determines whether or not <b>an</b> image <b>resembles</b> <b>a</b> face.|$|R

5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure <b>resembling</b> <b>a</b> bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade <b>resembling</b> <b>a</b> Thermos flask).|$|E

5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, <b>resembling</b> <b>a</b> figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Decades later, {{papers are}} still {{published}} purporting to continue Stümpke's research or otherwise paying homage to Steiner's hoax. In a 2004 {{paper in the}} Russian Journal of Marine Biology, authors Kashkina & Bukashkina claim to have discovered two new marine genera: Dendronasus and an as yet unnamed parasitic taxon.
