40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{systematic}} approach for obtaining qualitatively and quantitatively correct mathematical models of some biological phenomena with time-lags. Features of our approach are {{the development of a}} hierarchy of related models and the estimation of parameter values, along with their non-linear biases and standard deviations, for sets of experimental data. We demonstrate our method of solving parameter estimation problems for neutral delay differential equations by analyzing some models of cell growth that incorporate a time-lag in the cell division phase.

40|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> of {{bacterial}} spores to germinate after short exposure to L-alanine increases exponentially {{from the time}} of addition of L-alanine. This absence of a lag facilitates kinetic analysis and allows the dependence of commitment on temperature and pH to be determined. The pH profile of commitment has been compared with that obtained from measurements of absorbance decreases during germination, and the two profiles exhibit differing pK values. It is suggested that because the decrease in A 600 of spore suspensions is a late event in germination, it is an unsuitable parameter for studying germination-triggering reactions. Commitment {{has been shown to be}} temperature-dependent, with an optimum at approx. 37 degrees C and an activation energy (mu) of 1. 08 X 10 (5) J/mol.

40|$|<b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to {{germinate}} and germination of Bacillus subtilis spores with {{mixtures of}} low concentrations of germinants acting on different germinant receptors (GRs) were {{much higher than}} the sums <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and germination with individual germinants alone. This synergism with mixtures of nutrient germinants was not seen with spores lacking GRs responsible for recognizing one or several components of the germinant mixtures and was not eliminated by either a gerD mutation or overexpression of one of the GRs involved in this synergism. This synergism was also not seen between the germinant l-valine, which acts via a GR, and the germinant dodecylamine, which does not act via any GR. These results indicate that spores not only integrate but can also amplify signals from multiple germinants and multiple GRs in determining <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and overall spore germination. This amplification can be explained by a simple mechanism in which a single signal integrator triggers germination above an accumulation threshold. Direct cooperative action between GRs may further add to the synergism seen in germination triggered by multiple GRs. Further experiments and modeling are required to determine the relative contributions of these different mechanisms...|$|R

Identification of {{potential}} shared primary psychoprophylaxis and crime prevention {{is measured by}} analyzing the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> for patients-subjects to forensic examination. Material and method. The statistic trial is a retrospective, document-based study. The statistical lot consists of 770 initial examination reports performed and completed during the whole year 2007, primarily analyzed in order to summarize the data within the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, Bucharest, Romania (INML), {{with one of the}} group variables being “particularities of the psychiatric patient history”, containing the items “forensic onset”, “commitments within the last year prior to the examination ” and “absence <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> within the last year prior to the examination”.

40|$|Recognizable megakaryocytes are {{polyploid}} cells {{generated by}} a clonogenic, diploid progenitor, termed CFU-MKC (colony forming unit, megakaryocyte). In order to quantify polyploidization, ploidy histograms of megakaryocytes determined by microphotometric or flow cytometric measurements of megakaryocyte DNA have generally been used. However these techniques provide no information on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> of CFU-MKC to polyploidy. Using a technique of clonal analysis determining the distributions {{of the number of}} doublings (NbD) undergone by CFU-MKC before committing to polyploidization, the polyploidization probability of CFU-MKC could be derived. This probability was found to be a constant independent from CFU-MKC mitotic history, since NbD distributions are exponential functions characterized by a constant rate of decay per doubling. By studying the effects of growth factors on polyploidization probability, it was also shown that: (1) this parameter is negatively regulated by growth factors contained in poke-weed or WEHI conditioned media, as well as by erythropoietin; (2) commitment to polyploidization does not require prior CFU-MKC division; (3) bipotent erythroid-megakaryocyte progenitors have a lower polyploidization probability than CFU-MKC; (4) determination of polyploidization probability reflects the activity of growth factors with greater accuracy than megakaryocyte colony count.

40|$|Start-up {{subsidies}} for the unemployed {{have long been}} an important active labor market policy strategy in Germany. The current subsidy program underwent a major reform in 2011 that changed its key parameters: support was lowered, eligibility criteria were tightened and entitlement was abandoned by granting caseworkers the right to reject applications. Ex-ante predictions on the post-reform effectiveness of the program are ambiguous, and knowledge {{about the importance of}} institutional details of such a program is very limited, making a new evaluation necessary. In our descriptive analysis, we compare personal and business characteristics of participants before and after the reform and we find significant differences in terms of gender composition, educational attainment and industry-specific experience.

The observed response to the stimulatory signal {{as measured by the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to enter the S phase (i. e., {{the rate at which the}} stimulation becomes lectin independent) increases with lectin concentration even in the inhibitory range. The generation of this positive signal is prevented by treating the cells with colchicine. Cells that have become committed but are also simultaneously blocked from entering the S phase by the high doses of Con A can begin synthesizing DNA if the lectin is released by adding a competitive inhibitor of binding. Experiments done in agarose cultures in which lymphocytes are kept from contact with each other suggest that the reversible inhibitory signal is mediated by structures in the individual cells rather than as a result of agglutination. Continuously dividing cells of the lymphoid line P 388 are also individually and reversibly inhibited by Con A. These findings are considered in terms of the relation of the inhibitory signal to the microtubular components of cell surface modulating assemblies made up of submembranous arrays of microtubules, microfilaments, and associated proteins...|$|E

The new practices will be created in multi-professional development of working practices by utilizing the professional skills of educators with different areas of competence. Therefore, the growth {{and development of the}} children are taken into account as widely as possible (Gananathan, 2011). However, as far as {{the development}} of work is concerned, a day care center is more challenging than an ordinary work environment, because it is difficult to find free and available time to discuss development-related issues. The daily practices of Finnish day care centers include educator-initiated and guided activities, such as reading to children, and materials-based learning. Activities like breakfast or lunch, dressing for outdoor activities, and naps are considered educationally valuable, and educators {{play an important role in}} these activities guiding and helping children. The noise coming from children playing, the liveliness of activities and various interruptions pose great challenges to joint interaction among educators. There are only a few moments during the day when members of the work community can gather to discuss matters without having responsibility for the children. Therefore, meetings are usually held with representatives from various groups, and the information educators receive in them is based on second-hand knowledge received through those representatives (Rodd, 2004).

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} eradication campaigns malaria {{remains a}} major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an estimated 1 - 3 million deaths annually. There is widespread parasite resistance to almost all currently used anti-malarial drugs and a credible vaccine is at least 15 years away. However after a lapse of almost 40 years malaria eradication is back on the global health agenda. This renewed emphasis has highlighted the need for more tools to achieve such an ambitious goal. Understanding the molecular and cellular processes involved in critical phases of the P. falciparum life cycle will lead to the identification of novel targets for intervention. The production of gametocytes, or sexual blood-stages of the malaria parasite is essential for transmission through the mosquito vector. This is a vulnerable stage in parasite development and a key target in the parasite life cycle for the development of strategies to reduce transmission of malaria. Gametocytogenesis has been identified as an absolute priority research area by several funding bodies. In the course of this thesis an innovative research tool for the study of gametocytogenesis was developed. This assay uses the earliest known sexual stage marker Pfs 16, (detected from 30 hours post RBC invasion), tagged with Green fluorescent protein (GFP). This reporter system enables rapid analysis of parasite commitment using flow cytometry and allows for the detection of changes in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> well before the gametocyte is morphologically distinguishable from asexual blood stage parasites. The assay has the potential for use in the study of various aspects of parasite biology and also makes it possible to isolate large numbers of pure gametocytes suitable for use in high throughput screening (HTS) and drug screening. This assay represents a significant step forward in research into gametocytogenesis The original aim which led to the production of the assay was to study G protein signalling pathways involved in commitment to gametocytogenesis. The data produced by this research led to the proposal of a novel model for a putative signalling pathway that leads to gametocytogenesis. In an attempt to find molecules involved in the signalling pathway, data base searching identified two 7 trans-membrane proteins that were potential G Protein coupled receptors. These two molecules, PF 10 _ 0082 and PFL 0765 w were characterised as part of this thesis. Both genes are essential for parasite viability as they proved lethal when deleted. Both proteins were shown to be expressed in all stages of the parasite, with greatest expression in the schizont stage. Both proteins may perform some function in gametogenesis as they are present in late stage gametocytes. The capacity to produce large numbers of pure gametocytes at various stages of development provided an opportunity not previously available to researchers. With several adaptations the assay was suitable for investigating the effects of currently used antimalarial drugs on commitment to gametocytogenesis and direct toxicity to gametocytes. I subsequently used this assay to undertake the first comprehensive in vitro study of the effect of antimalarial drugs on gametocytogenesis. The natural progression of this research was to adapt the assay to a format suitable for HTS in order to identify new compounds with gametocytocidal activity. The assay was transferred to a 96 well format suitable for subsequent transfer to a high density low volume format (eg 384 or 1536 well). This assay employs a luciferase-based (ATP) detection format and is suitable to assess the activity of compounds against different developmental stages of gametocytes. The final transfer step to 384 or 1535 well format was outside the scope of this PhD thesis but the reformatted assay was verified by screening a small targeted library provided by the Medicines for Malaria Venture. The proposed signalling pathway, the assay system which has a number of functional applications and the ability to produce large numbers of gametocytes have all provided significant insight into gametocyte biology. The continued application of these tools to the study of gametocyte biology has the potential to make a significant contribution to research efforts to reduce transmission of malaria...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} optimal government debt maturity {{in which the government}} cannot issue state-contingent bonds and the government cannot commit to fiscal policy. In contrast to an environment with full commitment, there is a tradeoff between the cost of funding and the benefit of hedging. Borrowing long term provides the government with a hedging benefit since the value of outstanding government liabilities declines when shortterm interest rates rise. However, borrowing long term lowers fiscal discipline for future governments unable to commit to policy, which leads to higher future short-term interest <b>rates.</b> Therefore, lack <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> ex post increases the government’s cost of borrowing long term ex ante. A consequence of this tradeoff is that the slope of the yield curve is increasing in the maturity of newly issued debt. Our main theoretical result is that, as in the case <b>of</b> full <b>commitment,</b> the optimal maturity structure of government debt is tilted to the long end, but it is more flat than in case <b>of</b> full <b>commitment.</b> Our quantitative analysis shows that, in contrast to debt positions under full commitment—which involve a short-term asset position and a long-term debt position, both extremely large relative to GDP—debt positions under lack <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are positive at all maturities, much smaller relative to GDP, and have a nearly flat maturity...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} the devaluation of the domestic currency leads to the higher exchange rate pass-through at the zero lower bound since the interest rate channel cannot offset effects of the depreciation in that situation. Time-varying vector autoregression with stochastic volatility is used to identify the development of the pass-through. The hypothesis is tested on the Czech dataset because the Czech Republic is considered as the prototypical small open economy with inflation targeting. The assumption of higher pass-through to consumer prices at the zero lower bound is rejected. Obtained results confirm that the deprecation stimulates output growth slightly more when the interest rate is close to zero. Our estimations imply that the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> the Czech National Bank increased the price level by 0. 116 % and contributed to the output growth by 0. 781 %...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{growth in}} {{sponsorship}} expenditure {{has been marked}} with football being a major recipient, particularly through shirt sponsorship programmes. The relationship between football club and shirt sponsor {{is an important one}} for both parties leading them to routinely profess their commitment to one another. Common notions <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are often associated with long-term relationships, although evidence from the sponsorship literature contradicts this. Many football shirt sponsorship deals are short-term, often accompanied by a low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> contract renewal. In this context, the study therefore sets out to identify determinants <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> in the dyadic relationship between English professional football clubs and their shirt sponsors. A review of printed and electronic media is initially undertaken to confirm the relevance of the study. This forms the basis for a subsequent examination of critical incident interview data which leads {{to the development of a}} questionnaire which was despatched to clubs and sponsors, achieving a response <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 60. 4...|$|R
40|$|The neoclassical growth {{model is}} {{modified}} to include a variable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> time preference. With no commitment ability and log utility, the equilibrium features a constant effective <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> time preference and is observationally equivalent to the standard model. The extended framework yields testable linkages between the extent <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> ability and the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> saving and growth. The model also has welfare implications, including the optimal design of institutions that facilitate household commitments. Steady-state results are obtained for general concave utility functions, and some properties of the transitional dynamics are characterized for isoelastic utility. © 2000 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

By its very nature, {{relationship}} commitment is generated {{in the context of}} a relationship and becomes relational when it is communicated in some way to the other. This study investigated how expressions <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and commitment-related perceptions are interdependently connected among romantic partners. The authors derived and tested a dyadic cyclical model of the everyday expressions <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> with a sample of 189 romantically involved couples. Results revealed that individual’s level <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are associated with her or his own expressions <b>of</b> <b>commitment,</b> those expressions <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are noticed by the partners, and the partner’s level <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> is associated with those perceptions of the other’s expressions <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The research sheds light on the complex ways intimate couples experience and express commitment in their everyday lives...|$|R
40|$|Main conclusion: SCARECROW {{controls}} Arabidopsis root meristem {{size from}} the root endodermis tissue by regulating the DELLA protein RGA {{that in turn}} mediates the regulation ofARR 1 levels at the transition zone. Coherent organ growth requires a fine balance between cell division and cell differentiation. Intriguingly, plants continuously develop organs post-embryonically thanks to the activity of meristems that allow growth and environmental plasticity. In Arabidopsis thaliana, continued root growth is assured when division of the distal stem cell and their daughters is balanced with cell differentiation at the meristematic transition zone (TZ). We have previously shown that at the TZ, the cytokinin-dependent transcription factor ARR 1 controls the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> differentiation <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> meristematic cells and that its activities are coordinated {{with those of the}} distal stem cells by the gene SCARECROW (SCR). In the stem cell organizer (the quiescent center, QC), SCR directly suppresses ARR 1 both sustaining stem cell activities and titrating non-autonomously the ARR 1 transcript levels at the TZ via auxin. Here, we show that SCR also exerts a fine control on ARR 1 levels at the TZ from the endodermis by sustaining gibberellin signals. From the endodermis, SCR controls the RGA REPRESSOR OF ga 1 - 3 (RGA) DELLA protein stability throughout the root meristem, thus controlling ARR 1 transcriptional activation at the TZ. This guarantees robustness and fineness to the control of ARR 1 levels necessary to balance cell division to cell differentiation in sustaining coherent root growth. Therefore, this work advances {{the state of the art}} in the field of root meristem development by integrating the activity of three hormones, auxin, gibberellin, and cytokinin, under the control of different tissue-specific activities of a single root key regulator, SCR. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} a wealth of recent work {{deriving}} optimal monetary policy utilising New Neo-Classical Synthesis (NNCS) models based on nominal inertia. Such models typically abstract from the impact of monetary policy on the government’s finances, by assuming that consumers are infinitely-lived and taxes are lump-sum such that Ricardian Equivalence holds. In this paper, {{in the context of}} a sticky-price NNCS model, we assume that the government must adjust spending and/or distortionary taxation to satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint. We then consider optimal monetary and fiscal policies under discretion and commitment in the face of technology, preference and cost-push shocks. We find that the optimal precommitment policy implies a random walk in the steady-state level of debt, generalising earlier results that involved only a single fiscal instrument. In the case of negative fiscal shocks this implies perma-nently higher taxation and lower output and government spending to support the new steady-state debt stock, but the optimal combination of these variables will ensure a zero <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> inflation under <b>commitment.</b> We also find that th...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{which is a}} review of sociological ideas and studies of drug abusers in social situation, drug {{addiction}} steps (particularly alcohol, heroin and cocaine consumption) are revised and some explanations are made. Also, the role of some sociological ideas in drug addiction is considered in which Anomie Theory reads: "because of such duality, the individuals who are not satisfied with their role are in hurt. " According to this theory, drug users choose seclusion and neglecting usual social aims as well as competitive situations. Association of Differentiation Theory claims that drug use behavior is a learned behavior and the first learning occurs in a friendly small group (i. e. youngsters). Social Control theory believes that one can predict normal and abnormal behaviors through the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> individuals' social <b>commitments.</b> Internal and external controls also determine commitment rate. Micro-cultural theory considers drug use as a compatibility with abnormal micro-culture rules. Symbolic Mutual Action Believes that the etiquettes which society attribute to individuals/behaviors determine their acquired social reactions rather than any inherited acquisition...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{critically}} {{analyzes the}} enforcement {{practice of the}} competition authority as related to the use <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> decisions to conclude an antitrust investigation. In this perspective – and to derive conclusions about the use, suitability and appropriateness of this legal instrument – a quantitative and qualitative analysis is carried out paying specific attention to its most relevant variables: the adoption rate, the comparison with the EU practice, the typology <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> and their consistency with the ‘concerns’ detected in the preliminary investigation phases, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> presentation and acceptance, and finally the efficiency of this process in leading to the formal conclusion of the case {{as compared to the}} ordinary one.
