40|$|The {{introduction}} of safety belts in the passengers’ seats of coaches could have important repercussions increasing their safety under frontal impact and rollover. This type of vehicles has a particularity from cars or trucks: the safety belts are fixed {{directly to the}} seats {{and not to the}} vehicle structures. A lot of work has been made in Europe (and it is being made) to define <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>seats,</b> seats’ anchorages, restraint systems and safety belts’ anchorages to guarantee the correct retention of the passengers in their seats under frontal impacts. In case of rollover, the belted passengers increase the energy that must be absorbed by the superstructure because some of their mass must be considered us rigidly joined to the vehicle. This situation has been taking into account in the current European legislation (Regulation UN-ECE 66, Revision 01). This version of the Regulation has increased the requirements for the superstructure to assure that the behaviour of the superstructure is as good as in the vehicles without belted passengers preserving the survival space. This new revision is going to be mandatory for new types from October 2010 (and for new matriculations from October 2017), but a considerable number of coaches’ manufactures are modifying their structures under this new revision because they take in mind that if the safety belts are yet included in the coaches, the superstructure must be in accordance. This is an important effort of redesign: more resistant structures but without weight increase...|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, many {{manufacturing}} {{industries have}} globalized their operations and the Canadian manufacturing sector has experienced dramatic downsizing. For a manufacturing company to succeed therefore, {{it is necessary}} for them to operate with a global perspective. In the area of fire safety, this requires understanding of, and compliance with, global regulatory requirements. This research develops a systematic approach that can be utilized to analyze and compare the complex fire safety regulatory requirements that are stipulated for a selected topic in various countries. The approach developed is sufficiently general that it can be leveraged to compare and contrast global standards in any field or discipline. The methodology outlines six aspects of the regulatory environment that must be considered in sorting standards and then uses spreadsheets and a mind mapping program to elucidate the many relationships that exist amongst the current standards. In this work, flammability test <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> public transportation <b>seating</b> are studied, with a major emphasis on <b>seating</b> <b>for</b> railway applications. <b>Requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>seating</b> in aviation, automotive (both cars and buses) and military vehicles are included in the discussion for comparative purposes. Fire is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to characterize. The legislated testing protocols reflect this complexity with some geographic jurisdictions mandating as many as six different types of fire testing <b>for</b> rail <b>seating.</b> This work looks in depth at two of the main types of fire testing: flame spread testing and toxic effluent testing. Flame spread testing was chosen because it is widely required, and toxic effluent testing was chosen because of the many complexities and ambiguities present amongst these standards. Eleven flame-spread tests are compared on a semi-quantitative basis, and eight fire effluent toxicity tests are discussed on a qualitative basis. The technique developed was useful to elucidate the relationships, similarities and differences amongst the fire safety <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> transportation <b>seating.</b> There are large differences in requirements among transportation sectors as well as on a geographical basis. Using this technique, it was possible to categorize the flame spread tests into two groups and to compare the relative intensity of the tests within each of these subsets. The fire effluent toxicity tests varied so much in approach that only qualitative comparisons were possible...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the human}} tragedies in {{football}} stadia in Great Britain, several safety legislative requirements {{have been passed}} to ensure spectator safety. Among such requirements is the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>seated</b> accommodation <b>for</b> all spectators. Since the introduction of this requirement, there is however growing concern over the prolonged standing of spectators in seated areas as seated accommodation are not designated for standing and could thus poses risk {{to the safety of}} spectators. This study therefore investigated how spectator standing in seated accommodation affects the safety of spectators, and why spectators stand in seated accommodation by the use of semi-structured interviews. The interview participants included football club safety managers, a safety officer responsible for issuing safety licences at designated grounds and a spectator. The study indicates that the safety risk posed by spectator standing in seated areas include a spectator falling over a seat or guard rail and the obstruction of access for emergency services. The study further indicates that spectator standing is influenced by factors such as the fixture of the game, moments of excitement, spectator comfort, and the atmosphere of the crowd. The findings of the study provide valuable insight to stimulate proactive thinking towards implementing measures in relation to football stadia design and management to ensure safety...|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of low bridges on {{almost all of}} the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. An batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> comfortably <b>seating</b> 39. A 61-80hp six-cylinder engine powered single tyres on both rear axle, with air pressure braking applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A smoking area was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, upholstered in green leather, with generous leg room. Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single-deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{documented in}} this thesis investigates the potential of leno woven fabrics to be developed <b>for</b> outdoor <b>seating</b> use, and to understand the influence that hand-­‐weaving of these fabrics has on the design process for the commercial textile designer.

Themes of, material change over time and fabrics that blend into the landscape are explored {{through a series of}} samples produced on a handloom using a range of manmade and natural fibres. Contemporary weave practitioners, artists, product designers and an analysis of the current uses of leno fabrics has informed and guided the direction of this research. The hand weaving of doup-­‐controlled leno fabrics employing a mix of monofilament and wool yarns has resulted in the creation a range of dynamic, stable and open net-­‐likeructures that could be suspended within a seating frame. It has been demonstrated that this method of fabric production is capable of producing strong yet flexible substrates whose design successfully reflects the beauty in colour and forms found within the landscape. Reflection on the relationship between the handcraft of weaving, and the decision-­‐making process and knowledge of the textile designer has been recorded. The resulting knowledge of the design process and the insight into the mechanics of leno weaving on a table loom, are to be built into a programme of undergraduate workshop and weave theory lectures. This research has grown out of an interest in the slow decay of abandoned textiles in the landscape and forms a starting point for the exploration of how climatic conditions might affect the physical and visual appearance of a fabric used outdoors...|$|R
