40|$|Sodium-Galactose Transporter (SGLT) is a {{secondary}} active symporter which accumulates sugars into cells {{by using the}} electrochemical gradient of Na+ across the membrane. Previous computational studies provided insights into the release process of the two ligands (galactose and sodium ion) into the cytoplasm from the inward-facing conformation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose transporter (vSGLT). Several aspects of the transport mechanism of this symporter remain to be clarified: (i) a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of the exit path of the two ligands is still lacking; (ii) contradictory conclusions have been drawn concerning the gating role of Y 263; (iii) the role of Na+ in modulating the <b>release</b> <b>path</b> of galactose is not clear. In this work, we use bias-exchange metadynamics simulations to characterize the free energy profile of the galactose and Na+ release processes toward the intracellular side.

The dissociation barriers are of the order of 11 - 12 kcal/mol for both the ion and the substrate, in line with kinetic information concerning this type of transporters.

40|$|Radioactive sludge was {{generated}} in the K-East Basin and K-West Basin fuel storage pools at the Hanford Site while irradiated uranium metal fuel elements from the N Reactor were being stored and packaged. The fuel {{has been removed from}} the K Basins, and currently, the sludge resides in the KW Basin in large underwater Engineered Containers. The first phase to the Sludge Treatment Project being led by CH 2 MHILL Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC) is to retrieve and load the sludge into sludge transport and storage containers (STSCs) and transport the sludge to T Plant for interim storage. The STSCs will be stored inside T Plant cells that are equipped with secondary containment and leak-detection systems. The sludge is composed of a variety of particulate materials and water, including a fraction of reactive uranium metal particles that are a source of hydrogen gas. If a situation occurs where the reactive uranium metal particles settle out {{at the bottom of a}} container, previous studies have shown that a vessel-spanning gas layer above the uranium metal particles can develop and can push the overlying layer of sludge upward. The major concern, in addition to the general concern associated with the retention and release of a flammable gas such as hydrogen, is that if a vessel-spanning bubble (VSB) forms in an STSC, it may drive the overlying sludge material to the vents at the top of the container. Then it may be released from the container into the cell’s secondary containment system at T Plant. A previous study demonstrated that sloped walls on vessels, both cylindrical coned-shaped vessels and rectangular vessels with rounded ends, provided an effective approach for disrupting a VSB by creating a <b>release</b> <b>path</b> for gas as a VSB began to rise. Based on the success of sloped-wall vessels, a similar concept is investigated here where a sloped fin is placed inside the vessel to create a <b>release</b> <b>path</b> for gas. A key potential advantage of using a sloped fin compared to a vessel with a sloped wall is that a small fin decreases the volume of a vessel available for sludge storage by a very small fraction compared to a cone-shaped vessel. The purpose of this study is to quantify the capability of sloped fins to disrupt VSBs and to conduct sufficient tests to estimate the performance of fins in full-scale STSCs. Experiments were conducted with a range of fin shapes to determine what slope and width were sufficient to disrupt VSBs. Additional tests were conducted to demonstrate how the fin performance scales with the sludge layer thickness and the sludge strength, density, and vessel diameter based on the gravity yield parameter, which is a dimensionless ratio of the force necessary to yield the sludge to its weight. () Further experiments evaluated the difference between vessels with flat and 2 : 1 elliptical bottoms and a number of different simulants, including the KW container sludge simulant (complete), which was developed to match actual K-Basin sludge. Testing was conducted in 5 -in., 10 -in., and 23 -in. -diameter vessels to quantify how fin performance is impacted by the size of the test vessel. The most significant results for these scale-up tests are the trend in how behavior changes with vessel size and the results from the 23 -in. vessel. The key objective in evaluating fin performance is to determine the conditions that minimize the volume of a VSB when disruption occurs because this reduces the potential for material inside the STSC from being released through vents...|$|E

These experiments provided carefully controlled shock, reshock and release velocimetry data, with initial shock stresses ranging from 10 to 50 GPa (particle velocities from 0. 25 to 1. 05 km/s). Both windowed and free-surface measurements were included in this experiment set to increase the utility of the data set, as were samples ranging in thickness from 1 to 5 mm. Target physical phenomena included the elastic/plastic transition (Hugoniot elastic limit), the Hugoniot, any phase transition phenomena, and the <b>release</b> <b>path</b> (windowed and free-surface). The Hugoniot was found to be nearly linear, with no indications of the Fe - phase transition.

Reshock tests with explosively welded impactors produced clean results; those with glue bonds showed transient releases prior to the arrival of the reshock, reducing their usefulness for deriving strength information. The free-surface samples, which were steps on a single piece of steel, showed lower wavespeeds for thin (1 mm) samples than for thicker (2 or 4 mm) samples. A configuration used for the last three shots allows release information to be determined from these free surface samples.

We suggest that the Hugoniot data give evidence of three distinct phases—both low- and high-pressure solid phases and, possibly, a dense molten phase. EOS parameters for these phases are ρ_ 0 = 2. 494 ± 0. 002 Mg m^(− 3), K_(S 0) = 37 ± 2 GPa, K′ = 6. 27 ± 0. 25, and γ = 1. 0 (V/V_ 0) for the low-pressure solid phase; ρ_ 0 = 3. 834 ± 0. 080 Mg m^(− 3), K_(S 0) = 128 ± 20 GPa, K′ = 3. 7 ± 1. 4, and γ = 1. 5 ± 0. 5 for the solid high-pressure phase; and ρ_ 0 = 3. 71 ± 0. 10 Mg m^(− 3), K_(S 0) = 127 ± 25 GPa, K′ = 2. 1 ± 1. 0, and γ = 1. 5 ± 1. 0 for the dense liquid.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} and quantitative {{examination of the}} thermodynamics and phase change mechanisms (including amorphization) that occur upon shock wave loading and unloading of silica. We apply Debye-Grüneisen theory to calculate both the Hugoniot of quartz and isentropic <b>release</b> <b>paths.</b> Quartz converts to stishovite (or a stishovite-like phase) between 15 and 46 GPa, and persistence of the solid phase above its liquidus (i. e., superheating) is confirmed between 77 and 110 GPa. Calculations compare favorably to measurements of shock and post-shock temperatures. For silica, the method of measuring post-shock temperature is insensitive to predicting whether phase transitions actually occur during release. Measurements of release states in pressure-particle velocity space are compared to computed frozen-phase <b>release</b> <b>paths.</b> This comparison suggests transformation of a stishovite-like phase to lower density phases including quartz, liquid, or dense amorphous glass. Transformations to liquid or glass occur upon release from peak pressure of 26 GPa and above. The isentropic release assumption appears to be approximately valid. A shock pressure-temperature scale relating metamorphism of silica in shock-loaded quartz is proposed. Neither recovery of coesite nor substantial quantities of crystalline stishovite-like phases upon shock loading of quartz is predicted. Trace amounts of crystalline stishovite-like phases from shock loading between 15 and 26 GPa are expected...|$|R
30|$|Next, we {{will discuss}} the sources and sinks of proton flux. Based on {{available}} structural evidence we put forward the following argument: Upon activation of the TM domain, a proton (carrying a positive charge) moves from the periplasmic side of the inner membrane, following the negative-inside electrostatic membrane potential (∆Ψ), to the proton binding site at the D 407 –D 408 pair. As illustrated in the 1.9 Å-resolution crystal structure of AcrB (PDB ID: 4 DX 5), the proton-transfer wire, through which protons move, {{is likely to be}} formed by side chains of polar residues in TM helices as well as by membrane-embedded water molecules (Eicher et al. 2012). For examples, the highly conserved residues P 906, G 930, N 941, R 971, and G 1010 (Fig. S 1) are either directly involved {{in the formation of the}} proton-transfer wires, or facilitate binding of water molecules. Thus, the proton is likely to be transferred from a periplasmic pool to the D 407 –D 408 pair via a mechanism similar to the Newton’s cradle. Moreover, once the protomer passes the E-A transition state, the positive charge of the K 940 side chain returns to the vicinity of the D 470 –D 408 pair, and deprotonation occurs. The released proton will continue its cross-membrane journey, presumably releasing the rest of its PMF energy. As part of the proton <b>release</b> <b>path,</b> conserved R 971 in TM 11 is located on the cytosolic side of the D 407 –D 408 pair. In particular, in the access and binding phases D 407 is connected to R 971 via a cluster of four water molecules, while in the extrusion phase this proton path is blocked by the two side chains of V 411 and L 944 which are conserved as hydrophobic residues in the AcrB-like family (Fig. S 1). Taken together, depending on the protonation status, two distinct constellations of H-bond networks are found inside the TM domain, thus establishing the pathway for proton loading and release.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this INERI project is to develop improved fuel behavior models for gas reactor coated particle fuels and to develop improved coated-particle fuel designs {{that can be used}} reliably at very high burnups and potentially in fast gas-cooled reactors. Thermomechanical, thermophysical, and physiochemical material properties data were compiled by both the US and the French and preliminary assessments conducted. Comparison between U. S. and European data revealed many similarities and a few important differences. In all cases, the data needed for accurate fuel performance modeling of coated particle fuel at high burnup were lacking. The development of the INEEL fuel performance model, PARFUME, continued from earlier efforts. The statistical model being used to simulate the detailed finite element calculations is being upgraded and improved to allow for changes in fuel design attributes (e. g. thickness of layers, dimensions of kernel) as well as changes in important material properties to increase the flexibility of the code. In addition, modeling of other potentially important failure modes such as debonding and asphericity was started. A paper on the status of the model was presented at the HTR- 2002 meeting in Petten, Netherlands in April 2002, and a paper on the statistical method was submitted to the Journal of Nuclear Material in September 2002. Benchmarking of the model against Japanese and an older DRAGON irradiation are planned. Preliminary calculations of the stresses in a coated particle have been calculated by the CEA using the ATLAS finite element model. This model and the material properties and constitutive relationships will be incorporated into a more general software platform termed Pleiades. Pleiades will be able to analyze different fuel forms at different scales (from particle to fuel body) and also handle the statistical variability in coated particle fuel. Diffusion couple experiments to study Ag and Pd transport through SiC were conducted. Analysis and characterization of the samples continues. Two active transport mechanisms are proposed: diffusion in SiC and release through SiC cracks or another, as yet undetermined, path. Silver concentration profiles determined by XPS analysis suggest diffusion within the SiC layer, most likely dominated by grain boundary diffusion. However, diffusion coefficients calculated from mass loss measurements suggest a much faster <b>release</b> <b>path,</b> postulated as small cracks or flaws that provide open paths with little resistance to silver migration.

40|$|This Fission Product Transport (FPT) Phenomena Identification and Ranking Technique (PIRT) report briefly {{reviews the}} {{high-temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) FPT mechanisms and then documents the step-by-step PIRT process for FPT. The panel examined three FPT modes of operation: (1) Normal operation which, {{for the purposes}} of the FPT PIRT, established the fission product circuit loading and distribution for the accident phase. (2) Anticipated transients which were of less importance to the panel because a break in the pressure circuit boundary is generally necessary for the release of fission products. The transients can change the fission product distribution within the circuit, however, because temperature changes, flow perturbations, and mechanical vibrations or shocks can result in fission product movement. (3) Postulated accidents drew the majority of the panel's time because a breach in the pressure boundary is necessary to release fission products to the confinement. The accidents of interest involved a vessel or pipe break, a safety valve opening with or without sticking, or leak of some kind. Two generic scenarios were selected as postulated accidents: (1) the pressurized loss-of-forced circulation (P-LOFC) accident, and (2) the depressurized loss-of-forced circulation (D-LOFC) accidents. FPT is not an accident driver; it is the result of an accident, and the PIRT was broken down into a two-part task. First, normal operation was seen as the initial starting point for the analysis. Fission products will be released by the fuel and distributed throughout the reactor circuit in some fashion. Second, a primary circuit breach can then lead to their release. It is the magnitude of the release into and out of the confinement that is of interest. Depending on the design of a confinement or containment, the impact of a pressure boundary breach can be minimized if a modest, but not excessively large, fission product attenuation factor can be introduced into the <b>release</b> <b>path.</b> This exercise has identified a host of material properties, thermofluid states, and physics models that must be collected, defined, and understood to evaluate this attenuation factor. The assembled PIRT table underwent two iterations with extensive reorganization between meetings. Generally, convergence was obtained on most issues, but different approaches to the specific physics and transport paths shade the answers accordingly. The reader should be cautioned that merely selecting phenomena based on high importance and low knowledge may not capture the true uncertainty of the situation. This is because a transport path is composed of several serial linkages, each with its own uncertainty. The propagation of a chain of modest uncertainties can lead to a very large uncertainty at the end of a long path, resulting in a situation that is of little regulatory guidance...|$|E

Finally, granite samples from the SHIST test site (New Mexico) were tested over the 10 [...] 20 GPa stress region. The granite tests included a transmitted-wave experiment at about 10 GPa. In 12 of the 13 tests, a reverse-ballistic configuration (optimized for Hugoniot and release measurements) was used. The remaining test (conducted on the granite) provided a transmitted waveform from which precursor, Hugoniot and release properties were obtained.

40|$|Particle {{velocity}} profiles upon shock {{compression and}} adiabatic release were measured for polycrystalline calcite (Solenhofen limestone) to 12 – 24 GPa and for porous calcite (Dover chalk, ρ_o = 1. 40 g/cm^ 3, 49 % porosity) to between 5 and 11 GPa. The electromagnetic particle velocity gauge method was used. Upon shock compression of Solenhofen limestone, the Hugoniot elastic limit {{was determined to}} vary from 0. 36 to 0. 45 GPa. Transition shocks at between 2. 5 and 3. 7 GPa, possibly arising from the calcite II-III transition, were observed. For the Solenhofen limestone, the <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> lie relatively close to the Hugoniot. Evidence for the occurrence of the calcite III-II transition upon release was observed, but no rarefaction shocks were detected. Initial release wave speeds suggest retention of shear strength up to at least 20 GPa, with a possible loss of shear strength at higher pressures. The measured equation of state is used to predict the fraction of material devolatilized upon adiabatic release {{as a function of}} shock pressure. The effect of ambient partial pressure of CO_ 2 on the calculations is demonstrated. P_(CO_ 2) should be taken into account in models of atmospheric evolution by means of impact-induced mineral devolatilization. Mass fractions of CO_ 2 released expected {{on the basis of a}} continuum model are much lower than determined experimentally. This discrepancy, and radiative characteristics of shocked calcite, indicate that localization of thermal energy (shear banding) occurs under shock compression even though no solid-solid transitions occur in this pressure range. Release adiabatic data indicate that Dover chalk loses its shear strength when shocked to 10 GPa pressure. At 5 GPa the present data are ambiguous regarding shear strength. For Dover chalk, continuum shock entropy calculations result in a minimum estimate of 90 % devolatilization upon complete release from 10 GPa. For calcite, isentropic <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> from calculated continuum Hugoniot temperatures cross into the CaO (solid) + CO_ 2 (vapor) field at improbably low pressures (for example, 10 GPa for a shock pressure of 25 GPa). However, calculated isentropic <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> originating from PT points corresponding to previous color temperature under shock measurements cross into the melt plus vapor field at pressures greater than 0. 5 GPa, suggesting that devolatilization is initiated at the shear banding sites...|$|R
40|$|Shock wave {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} on San Gabriel anorthosite and San Marcos gabbro to peak stresses between 5 and 11 GPa using a 40 -mm-bore propellant gun. Particle velocity wave profiles were measured directly at several points in each target by means of electromagnetic gauges, and Hugoniot states were calculated by determining shock transit times from the gauge records. The particle velocity profiles yielded sound velocities along the release adiabats which indicate a retention of shear strength upon shock compression for anorthosite, {{with a loss of}} strength upon release to nearly zero stress. Sound velocities of anorthosite shocked to peak stresses between 6 and 10 GPa were measured to be between 5. 1 and 5. 3 km/s upon release to nearly zero stress as compared to ∼ 6. 9 and 5. 4 km/s for the expected longitudinal and bulk wave speeds. Stress density <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> in the anorthosite indicate possible transformation of albite to Jadeite + (quartz or coesite), with the amount of albite transformed ranging from as low as 0. 05 to as much as 0. 19 mass fraction in the 6 – 10 GPa shock stress range. Electrical interference effects precluded the determination of accurate <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> for San Marcos gabbro. Because of the apparent loss of shear strength during unloading from the shocked state, the fluidlike rheology of anorthosite which is indicated implies that calculations of energy partitioning due to impact onto planetary surfaces based on elastic-plastic models will underestimate the amount of internal energy deposited in the impacted surface material...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{compression}} {{results are}} reported for single-crystal forsterite loaded along the orthorhombic a and c axes to pressures from 130 to 165 GPa. Hugoniot {{states for the}} two axes are well described by a single curve offset to densities 0. 15 – 0. 20 g/cm^ 3 lower than earlier data for single-crystal forsterite shocked along the b axis above 100 GPa. Earlier data of Syono et al. [1981 a] show marginal support for similar b-axis behavior in the mixed-phase region from 50 to 92 GPa. Thus shocked forsterite is most compressible in the b direction for the mixed-phase and high-pressure regimes (P > 50 GPa). These data represent the highest pressures for which shock properties have been observed to depend on crystal orientation. Theoretical Hugoniots for mixed-oxide and perovskite-structure high-pressure assemblages of forsterite calculated from recent experimental data are virtually identical and agree with the b-axis data. The a- and c-axis data are also consistent with both high-pressure assemblages because uncertainties in equation of state parameters produce {{a broad range of}} computed Hugoniots. Our calculated “average” Hugoniot is up to 0. 13 g/cm^ 3 less dense than the preferred theoretical Hugoniots, in agreement with earlier measurements on dense polycrystalline forsterite. Interpolation between the single-crystal forsterite Hugoniots and Hugoniots for fayalite and Fo_(45) gives Fo_(88) Hugoniots bracketing Twin Sisters dunite data not previously well fit by systematics. <b>Release</b> <b>paths</b> are steep for the a and b axes but c-axis <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> are much shallower. Hugoniot elastic limits measured for the a and b axes are in good agreement with previous data of Syono et al.; however, the present data for the a axis reveal a triple wave structure: two deformational shock waves as well as the elastic shock, a feature not previously found. The second shock, with amplitude about 9 GPa and a shock temperature of about 350 °K, could perhaps be explained by the forsterite α→β or γ phase transformation...|$|R
