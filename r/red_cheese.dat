40|$|The {{undefined}} microbial floras {{derived from}} the surface of ripe cheese which are used for the ripening of commercial <b>red</b> smear <b>cheeses</b> have a strong impact on the growth of Listeria spp. In some cases, these microbial consortia inhibit Listeria almost completely. From such undefined industrial cheese-ripening floras, linocin M 18 -producing (lin+) (N. Valdés-Stauber and S. Scherer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 3809 - 3814, 1994) and -nonproducing Brevibacterium linens strains were isolated and used as single-strain starter cultures on model <b>red</b> smear <b>cheeses</b> to evaluate their potential inhibitory effects on Listeria strains in situ. On cheeses ripened with lin+ strains, a growth reduction of L. ivanovii and L. monocytogenes of 1 to 2 log units was observed compared to cheeses ripened with lin strains. Linocin M 18 activity was detected in cheeses ripened with lin+ strains but was not found in those ripened with lin strains. We suggest that production of linocin M 18 contributes to the growth reduction of Listeria observed on model <b>red</b> smear <b>cheeses</b> but is unsufficient to explain the almost complete inhibition of Listeria caused by some undefined microbial floras {{derived from the}} surface of ripe cheeses...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{characteristics}} of cheese produced from milk obtained from three Nigeria breeds of cattle (White Fulani, Muturu and Red Borori) were evaluated. The experiment {{was conducted at}} the Animal product laboratory of the College of Agriculture, Kabba, Nigeria. Fresh milk samples were collected from three Nigeria cattle breeds (White Fulani, Muturu and Red Borori) into three different containers. Eight cattle of a single breed were used making a total of 24 samples. The results showed {{that there was no}} significant difference in the pH, cheese and whey yield of the cheeses used for this experiment. White Fulani, Muturu and <b>red</b> Borori <b>cheese</b> had moisture content of 72. 51 %, 70. 03 % and 63. 42 % respectively. There was a significant difference in the moisture content of the cheeses. Cheeses from the three breeds of cattle were stable upon storage for the first 24 hours but further refrigeration slightly decreases the weight of white Fulani and Muturu cheese. The sensory evaluation of the cheeses showed that the three cheeses have good acceptability by consumers but <b>red</b> Borori <b>cheese</b> is mostly preferred for all the properties considered. Hence, milk from these cattle varieties should be produced in commercial quantity in Nigeria adopting the best modern technologies...|$|R

Linocin M 18 was purified by ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation, and gel filtration chromatography. In its native form, it is a proteinaceous aggregate with a high molecular weight. Fractions with Linocin M 18 activity contained particles of 20 to 30 nm in diameter. The bacteriocin consists of a single protein subunit with a molecular mass of 31 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4. 5 N-terminal sequence analysis yielded Met-Asn-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Arg-Glu-Leu-Ala-Pro-Ile-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ala-Ala-Ala-Glu- Ile.

50|$|However, several {{clinical}} trials demonstrated minor results.

40|$|Linocin M 18 is an antilisterial {{bacteriocin}} {{produced by}} the <b>red</b> smear <b>cheese</b> bacterium Brevibacterium linens M 18. Oligonucleotide probes based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence were used to locate its single copy gene, lin, on the chromosomal DNA. The amino acid composition, N-terminal sequence, and molecular mass derived from the nucleotide sequence of an open reading frame of 798 nucleotides coding for 266 amino acids found on a 3 -kb BamHI restriction fragment correspond closely to those obtained from the purified protein (N. Valdés-Stauber and S. Scherer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 3809 - 3814, 1994). No sequence homology to any protein or nucleotide sequences deposited in databases was found. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence and the N-terminal amino acid sequence derived from the protein suggests that B. linens M 18 produces an N-formyl-methionyl-CAC tRNA. A wide taxonomical distribution of the gene within coryneform bacteria has been demonstrated by PCR amplification. The structural gene from linocin M 18 is present at least in three Brevibacterium species, five Arthrobacter species, and five Corynebacterium species...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} Listeria monocytogenes WSLC 1364, {{originating}} from a cheese-borne outbreak, was {{examined in the}} presence {{and in the absence}} of a pediocin AcH-producing Lactobacillus plantarum strain on <b>red</b> smear <b>cheese.</b> Nearly complete inhibition was observed at 102 CFU of L. monocytogenes per ml of salt brine solution, while contamination with Listeria mutants resistant to pediocin resulted in high cell counts of the pathogen on the cheese surface. The inhibition was due to pediocin AcH added together with the L. plantarum culture to the brine solution but not to bacteriocin production in situ on cheese. Pediocin resistance developed in vitro at different but high frequencies in all 12 L. monocytogenes strains investigated, and a resistant mutant remained stable in a microbial surface ripening consortium over a 4 -month production process in the absence of selection pressure. In conclusion, the addition of a L. plantarum culture is a potent measure for combating Listeria in a contaminated production line, but because of the potential development of resistance, it should not be used continuously over a long time in a production line...|$|R

40|$|Many {{bacteria}} {{are known to}} inhibit food pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, by secreting a variety of bactericidal and bacteriostatic substances. In sharp contrast, it is unknown whether yeast has an inhibitory potential {{for the growth of}} pathogenic bacteria in food. A total of 404 yeasts were screened for inhibitory activity against five Listeria monocytogenes strains. Three hundred and four of these yeasts were isolated from smear-ripened cheeses. Most of the yeasts were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Using an agar-membrane screening assay, a fraction of approximately 4 % of the 304 <b>red</b> smear <b>cheese</b> isolates clearly inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, 14 out of these 304 cheese yeasts were cocultivated with L. monocytogenes WSLC 1364 on solid medium to test the antilisterial activity of yeast in direct cell contact with Listeria. All yeasts inhibited L. monocytogenes to a low degree, which is most probably due to competition for nutrients. However, one Candida intermedia strain was able to reduce the listerial cell count by 4 log units. Another four yeasts, assigned to C. intermedia (three strains) and Kluyveromyces marxianus (one strain), repressed growth of L. monocytogenes by 3 log units. Inhibition of L. monocytogenes was clearly pronounced in the cocultivation assay, which simulates the conditions and contamination rates present on smear cheese surfaces. We found no evidence that the unknown inhibitory molecule is able to diffuse through soft agar...|$|R
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to <b>red</b> to accompany <b>cheese</b> as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|R
