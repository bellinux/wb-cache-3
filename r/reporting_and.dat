In 1856 Wilkes bought a sporting newspaper called The Spirit of the Times, which he had previously worked for.

5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision.

The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E

These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.|$|E
