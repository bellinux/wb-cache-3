5000|$|Brooks blends the {{technical}} and the spiritual: when Newcome shows the protagonist the new [...] "harmonic telegraph," [...] Atherton/Amesbury speculates about the possibilities of both radio and telepathy. The {{second half of the}} book is dominated by spiritual matters. The protagonist has a <b>rough</b> <b>adjustment</b> to his strange situation, and obsesses over his lost Theresa. Helen Newcome grows distressed at her limited ability to help her fiancé, and leaves for a trip abroad. Atherton/Amesbury boards with a widow and her children. The daughter of the house, Irene, was used as an experimental subject in hypnotism by her late physician father; she is a spontaneous medium and clairvoyant. Irene leads the protagonist on an aerial journey to the now-lush Sahara, where he is re-united with Helen. Through psychic visions, the two come to understand that Helen is the lost Theresa reincarnated. They are happily married in the end.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{intuitive}} and efficient method for editing {{the appearance of}} complex spatially-varying datasets, such as images and measured materials. In our framework, users specify <b>rough</b> <b>adjustments</b> that are refined interactively by enforcing the policy that similar edits are applied to spatially-close regions of similar appearance. Rather than proposing a specific user interface, our method allows artists to quickly and imprecisely specify the initial edits with any method or workflow they feel most comfortable with. An energy optimization formulation is used to propagate the initial <b>rough</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the final refined ones by enforcing the editing policy over all pairs of points in the dataset. We show that this formulation is equivalent to solving a large linear system defined by a dense matrix. We derive an approximate algorithm to compute such a solution interactively {{by taking advantage of}} the inherent structure of the matrix. We demonstrate our approach by editing images, HDR radiance maps, and measured materials. Finally, we show that our framework generalizes prior methods while providing significant improvements in generality, robustness and efficiency...|$|R

Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make <b>rough</b> steering <b>adjustments.</b>|$|R
50|$|The general {{appearance}} of the Type 3 is identical {{with that of the}} Type 97 90 mm Infantry Mortar which was accepted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1937, (year 2597 on the Japanese calendar). The tube of the Type 3 has the same length as that of the Type 97, but on the former there are two collars machined on the forward portion of the barrel for securing the bipod clamp. The bipod of the Type 3 is constructed of light-weight tubing, and there is no cross-leveling device. <b>Rough</b> cross-leveling <b>adjustment</b> could be made, however, by breaking the bipod support and moving the leg on the low side inward.|$|R
50|$|In the 2004 season, he had {{to adjust}} to coach Joe Gibbs' style of running, which {{consists}} of mostly power running. Despite taking his first Redskins carry 64 yards for a TD in the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, it was a somewhat <b>rough</b> <b>adjustment</b> for Portis because Denver's running style consisted of stretch runs and runs to the outside. The adjustment was made rougher by an offensive line that was depleted mainly due to injuries. He finished 2004 with 1,315 yards for a 3.8 yard rushing average. He had an especially tough time finding the end zone, finishing with eight total touchdowns (5 rushing, 2 receiving, and one passing). However, Portis bounced back in the 2005 season. Although Gibbs still ran a power style of football, he implemented more outside running plays into the Redskins rushing attack to better suit Portis' style of running. Portis had a much better season, proving that he can run inside {{as well as to}} the outside and was a better pass-blocker. Although he did not get into the end zone until the fifth game of the season, he finished strong and had 12 total touchdowns (11 rushing and one passing). On a 14-yard run against the Philadelphia Eagles on January 1, 2006, he broke the Redskins' franchise record for the most rushing yards in a season with 1,516 yards and tied the most 100+ yard games in a season (5). He ended the game with 112 rushing yards. By rushing for 1,516 yards, he became only the third runner in league history to reach 1,500 yards in three of his first four seasons.|$|E
40|$|The {{networked}} {{control system}} (NCS) is currently receiving in-creasing attention from researchers. Researches on this subject, how-ever, have not considered the co-design of network {{quality of service}} (QoS) and control quality of performance (QoP). This paper proposes a novel NCS design framework based on scheduling and control co-design to compensate for random network-induced delays. In the framework, a scheduling algorithm used to find the optimal sampling regions of control loops performs <b>rough</b> <b>adjustment</b> and guarantees the network QoS, while a novel adaptive fuzzy PID controller is designed to perform accurate adjustment to guarantee the control QoP. Practical application results obtained with a multi-loop NCS show that the framework can ensure satisfactory performance due to its robustness against network uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Ålö AB {{produce and}} develop {{front end loaders}} for {{tractors}} in the agriculture industry. The main office for Ålö Sweden is located in Umeå and the production is placed in Brännland, Umeå. Year 2010 the company launched {{a new kind of}} loader system called Loader Control System, LCS. One new product was a joystick which is controlled by the thumb. The attachment for the joystick is based on a stiff and bendable rod, called gooseneck. The flexible Gooseneck is delivered in three different lengths: 150 mm, 300 mm, and 350 mm.  Based on statistics the rigidity in the joystick attachment can wear out after the machine has been operated for a while. Especially for the two longer gooseneck models. It is caused by drivers adjustments, vibrations from the machine, and the uneven road surface.   By diagnosing the gooseneck, and a market survey, the goal is to find new solutions for the joystick attachment. It is important that concepts fullfill the same flexible characteristics as the gooseneck. This because the joystick is supposed to fit in to different tractor models with different interiors. The task is to investigate the need of a new concept for the joystick attachment, therefore there will be no prototypes.   The result from the diagnose and the survey showed that the existing gooseneck is still the preferred solution. Documented complaints and statistics about how many parts that had been distributed and selled as spare parts since the launch, showed that {{there was no need for}} a new concept. By using the shortest gooseneck model when the interior of the tractor allows it, future fatigue damages could be reduced. With the two longer models there will be a longer lever which makes the force application bigger on the attachment. An other solution is to combine the gooseneck with a ball joint, which sometimes has been used. The ball joint comes abilities to make <b>rough</b> <b>adjustments</b> for the attachment, and opportunites to remove the joystick bracket when other tools are being used. These options let the gooseneck remain in its position and therefore avoid unnecessary adjustments...|$|R
40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} help {{regain the}} auditory sense {{in cases where}} the cochlea is not able to transform the sound signals into electric stimulation for the auditory cortex. By their very nature, cochlear implants require a calibration process, which is often based on the electrically evoked stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT), since it very well correlates with a person’s most comfortable loudness level[PZS + 09]. During the ESRT-based calibration process, the implant stimulates the cochlea with increasing currents until the stapedius muscle contraction can be observed visually. The calibration process described above yields a first, <b>rough</b> implant <b>adjustment,</b> which requires an additional, extensive calibration procedure {{a few weeks after the}} implantation. The goal of this project is the development of an autonomous calibration scheme that is constantly monitoring and occasionally re-calibrating the implant. To this end, the systemutilizestheelectromyographic(EMG) signalsthatitdirectlyderivesatthestapedius muscle by means of specific electrodes. The system basically correlates the external (objective) loudness and the observable stapedius muscle activity, and correlates them with the expected, pre-defined stapedius activity.

Some spindles are fixed speed (60000 rpm), others are adjustable (30000-50000 rpm), and still others are very high speed (175000 rpm). The machines have a standard X-Y table with the notable exception of knee travel. All axes are indexed to [...]0001" [...] via a vernier scale on the handwheels, with higher accuracy available {{with the use of}} measuring bars. The machine head has two vertical travels, one <b>rough</b> head <b>adjustment</b> and the other a precise spindle adjustment. The spindle to which the detachable air spindle mounts also rotates at a variable speed and can typically outfeed [...]100" [...] while running, again with an accuracy of [...]0001" [...] on the handwheel or greater, for very precise hole, peg and surface grinding. A well-kept jig grinder will reliably position work to a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with handwheels alone. These features are all critical in positioning a hole and peg system a precise distance from a reference surface or edge.|$|R
40|$|This study proposes an {{optimized}} {{frequency adjustment}} method {{that uses a}} micro-cantilever beam-based piezoelectric vibration generator based {{on a combination of}} added mass and capacitance. The most important concept of the proposed method is that the frequency adjustment process is divided into two steps: the first is a <b>rough</b> <b>adjustment</b> step that changes the size of the mass added at the end of cantilever to adjust the frequency in a large-scale and discontinuous manner; the second step is a continuous but short-range frequency adjustment via the adjustable added capacitance. Experimental results show that when the initial natural frequency of a micro piezoelectric vibration generator is 69. 8 Hz, then this natural frequency can be adjusted to any value in the range from 54. 2 Hz to 42. 1 Hz using the combination of the added mass and the capacitance. This method simply and effectively matches a piezoelectric vibration generator’s natural frequency to the vibration source frequency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A novel {{adaptive}} dual network design {{consisting of}} a <b>rough</b> <b>adjustment</b> network (RAN) and a fine adjustment network (FAN) is proposed to eliminate the unknown time-variant uncertainties of servo system. To accomplish this objective, a RAN is proposed based on the combination of sliding mode control, function approximation, and error compensation technique. Then, an FAN is proposed to compensate the tracking error. In our current design, the FAN includes a critic network based on a neural network model and a prediction network based on an online curve fitting scheme. Theoretical analysis followed by detailed design strategies are presented in this work. Simulation results and comparative study of this method with those of existing approaches demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed adaptive dual network design for position tracking. Key words Adaptive control, critic network, sliding mode control (SMC), neural network A long-lasting focus on the electromechanical system is how to design a simple and effective controller for such nonlinear systems. This problem is deeply rooted in the nonlinearity and time variance of the systems due to the limitations of modern modeling theory. Therefore, most of these problems are too complicated to be solved by the traditional linear control methods. Furthermore, in addi...|$|E

One end is generally locked {{down at the end of}} the rod, while the other has both <b>rough</b> and fine <b>adjustments,</b> though some are opposite in construction. The locked tip holder {{consists of a}} needle, for the center of the radius, and the other holds either a lead clutch, or an inking nib. There are older variants which use a wooden beam. Another similar type is a Machinist or Engineers beam compass, which uses scribing points only, similar to ones used by woodworkers, except that its fine adjustment is generally more refined. These beam compasses can be extended by adding press-in rods, or by using a lockable rod connector.|$|R

Overview of our {{fiducial}} marker framework: Each marker is a checkerboard with color cells that provides accurate three-dimensional pose estimation {{and tens of}} thousands of distinct markers. Abstract—In this paper we present a planar {{fiducial marker}} system to be used with color cameras. Our system provides precise and robust full 3 D pose estimation of the markers with superior accuracy when compared with many fiducial systems, while color information is used to provide more than 65, 000 distinct markers. In contrast with most color-based fiducial frameworks, ours requires no prior classification training nor color calibration other than a <b>rough</b> white balance <b>adjustment</b> and can perform reliably under illumination changes. Finally, we also provide means of detecting when poor illumination conditions will compromise marker identification, thus avoiding to evaluate a false marker identification. We present several experiments that show significant improvement in accuracy of estimation of both position and orientation when compared with traditional techniques.

40|$|This {{work offers}} an {{analysis}} of the wire feedability-related properties of Al- 5 Mg solid wire electrodes bearing Zr. Effects of Zr content on microstructures and mechanical properties of the Al- 5 Mg alloys were studied. Experimental results have demonstrated that α-Al dendrites of the as-cast Al- 5 Mg alloy are refined, and the tensile strength, microhardness and roughness of the 1. 2 mm wire electrode are improved with an appropriate addition of Zr. In addition, the tensile strength and elongation of the welded joints welded using Al- 5 Mg wire electrodes bearing Zr reach the maximum value when 0. 12 % Zr is added into the wire alloy. However, when excess Zr is added, α-Al phases of the wire alloy and welded joint are coarsened, and the mechanical properties are deteriorated. Moreover, the structure and principle of a novel apparatus, which can enhance the feedability of the wire electrode, are introduced and the apparatus can achieve the <b>rough</b> and fine <b>adjustments</b> of cast and helix of the wire electrode...|$|R
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made <b>rough</b> steering <b>adjustments,</b> and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|R
40|$|Cluster-size tests (CSTs) {{based on}} random field theory (RFT) are {{commonly}} adopted to identify {{significant differences in}} brain images. However, the use of RFT in CSTs rests on the assumption of uniform smoothness (stationarity). When images are non-stationary, CSTs based on RFT will likely lead to increased false positives in smooth regions and reduced power in <b>rough</b> regions. An <b>adjustment</b> to the cluster size according to the local smoothness at each voxel has been proposed for the standard test based on RFT to address non-stationarity, however, this technique requires images with a large degree of spatial smoothing, large degrees of freedom and high intensity thresholding. Recently, we proposed a voxelation-corrected 3 D CST based on Gaussian random field theory that does not place constraints {{on the degree of}} spatial smoothness. However, this approach is only applicable to stationary images, requiring further modification to enable use for non-stationary images. In this study, we present modifications of this method to develop a voxelation-corrected non-stationary 3 D CST based on RFT. Both simulated and real data were used to compare the voxelation-corrected non-stationary CST to the standard cluster-size adjusted non-stationary CST based on RFT and the voxelation-corrected stationary CST. We found that voxelation-corrected stationary CST is liberal for non-stationary images and the voxelation-corrected non-stationary CST performs better than cluster-size adjusted non-stationary CST based on RFT under low smoothness, low intensity threshold and low degrees of freedom...|$|R
