40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of foreign trade in China on the urban-rural income gap from certain angles including trade scale, trade structure and trade mode at the national and provincial levels. The empirical results indicate that, {{from the perspective of}} trade scale, the export and import in the eastern and national <b>regions</b> <b>have</b> an expansion effect on the urban-rural income gap, and, in the central <b>regions,</b> they <b>have</b> a reduction effect. Furthermore, export in the western <b>regions</b> <b>has</b> a reduction effect while import in these <b>regions</b> did not <b>have</b> a significant effect. From the perspective of trade structure, the trade of high-tech products and labour-intensive products in the national and eastern <b>regions</b> <b>has</b> an expansion effect, and the trade of the above-mentioned products in the central <b>regions</b> <b>has</b> a reduction effect. The trade of labour-intensive products in the western <b>regions</b> <b>has</b> a reduction effect, and that of high-tech products an expansion effect. From the perspective of trade mode, processing trade and general trade in the national and eastern <b>regions</b> <b>have</b> an expansion effect, while in the central <b>regions</b> they <b>have</b> a reduction effect. General trade in the western regions would expand the urban-rural income gap, and processing trade does not have a significant effect. Consequently, when the South African Government is working out trade multiplicative and corresponding policy, they should consider the development of foreign trade and should pay attention to the labour market structure...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the <b>region</b> <b>has</b> little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The <b>region</b> <b>has</b> a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E

30|$|For example, the capital–labor {{ratio of}} the {{manufacturing}} industry in China’s central and western <b>regions</b> <b>has</b> undergone a rapid upward trend after 2000, with a growth rate higher than that in coastal regions. After climbing rapidly in 2003 and 2004, the absolute level of capital intensity in the central and western <b>regions</b> <b>has</b> been higher than that in the coastal regions. In 2007, the capital–labor ratio of manufacturing was 20.1  % in the central provinces and 25.9  % in the western provinces, both {{higher than in the}} eastern regions. In other words, while the central and western regions do not enjoy comparative advantages in capital-intensive industries, manufacturing in those <b>regions</b> <b>has</b> become more capital intensive, and the heavy and chemical industries in those <b>regions</b> <b>have</b> grown considerably.|$|R

5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This <b>region</b> <b>has</b> a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E
