25|$|With the {{reverser}} in mid {{gear position}} since {{there should be}} no superimposed <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> motion, the expansion link die slot should be an arc of a circle centred on the pivot in mid gear and of radius equal to the length of the radius rod. This condition precludes adjustment of the valve gear by altering the length of the radius rod.|$|E
25|$|The {{eccentric}} crank (UK: <b>return</b> <b>crank)</b> (1) is rigidly {{attached to the}} con-rod pin connected to the main drive wheel. Note {{that this is the}} only suitable attachment point on any of the drive wheels that is not fouled by the passage of the coupling rod or the connecting rod. The {{eccentric crank}} is of a length such that the pin attachment to the eccentric rod (2) is 90 degrees out of phase with the lead motion.|$|E
50|$|American {{locomotives}} universally employed inside Stephenson {{valve gear}} placed between the frames until around 1900 when it quickly {{gave way to}} outside Walschaerts motion. In Europe, Stephenson gear could be placed either outside the driving wheels and driven by either eccentrics or <b>return</b> <b>cranks</b> or else between the frames driven from the axle through eccentrics, as was mostly the case in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|The rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear {{consists}} of two admission valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, operated by a camshaft arranged in a box fixed to each cylinder between the valve chambers. The cam boxes are self-contained and detachable, and replacement cam boxes can be fitted at running sheds within a few hours. The camshafts are driven from the <b>return</b> <b>cranks</b> on the driving wheels through worm wheels and universal propeller shafts, arranged so that the camshafts and the coupled wheels revolve at the same speed.|$|R
50|$|No. 4767, {{built at}} Crewe and {{delivered}} in December 1947, had outside Stephenson valve gear: instead of eccentrics, double <b>return</b> <b>cranks</b> {{were used to}} drive the eccentric rods, and a launch-type expansion link was used. This one cost £13,278, which was about £600 more than those built {{at the same time}} with Walschaerts' valve gear. The aim of the experiment was to find out if a valve gear having variable lead (as opposed to the constant lead of the Walschaerts' motion) would affect performance. On trial, it proved to have no advantage, although in normal service it did gain a reputation as a good performer on banks.|$|R

50|$|The throw of the <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> {{must now}} be determined; The actual throw {{required}} from the crank is determined from {{the dimensions of the}} expansion link.|$|E
50|$|The end of {{the piston}} rod is {{connected}} to a built-up crank at {{the centre of the}} crankshaft. The crankshaft has the valve <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> at one end and a flywheel at the other.|$|E
50|$|The inside {{high-pressure}} cylinder had a slide valve below, {{while the two}} outside low-pressure cylinders had balanced slide valves above. The cylinder ratio was 1 to 2.45. The outside cranks were placed 90 degrees apart, while the middle inside crank was placed at 135 degrees {{from each of the}} outer two. All three cylinders actuated the middle coupled axle and their valves were actuated from this axle by an eccentric for the inside cylinder and two <b>return</b> <b>cranks</b> for the outer cylinders. The exhaust from the {{high-pressure cylinder}} passed directly into a large steam chest common to both low-pressure cylinders, which eliminated the need for a receiver pipe.|$|R
500|$|After initial running-in, E.S.Cox {{was quoted}} as discerning a {{distinct}} [...] "woolliness" [...] in their steaming, and although they missed their appointment at the Rugby Testing Station due to late completion, some modifications were carried out, most notably to {{the diameter of the}} blastpipe, resulting in better steaming and increased power. [...] Initially, the <b>return</b> <b>cranks</b> on the main driving wheels were of LNER block-type as seen on Arthur Peppercorn's A1s and A2s, but this was changed to the simpler LMS four-stud fitting. With time, enough information was gathered from operational feedback from crews to allow modifications to be applied to the further 15 locomotives on order in the second batch, had they been built.|$|R
500|$|Problems {{with the}} class were {{experienced}} immediately, with the first 25 locomotives being withdrawn in October 1951 after several complaints were received from crews regarding the driving wheels shifting on their axles. They were subsequently modified, and released back into revenue-earning service. [...] Initially the <b>return</b> <b>cranks</b> on the main driving wheels were of LNER block type, as seen on Arthur Peppercorn's A1s and A2s, but this was changed to the simpler LMS four-stud fitting. This {{was the result of}} a problem of overheating bearings within the cranks, and difficulty in removing the LNER-type casings. 70035–70039 were built with roller bearings on the leading and trailing coupled axles only and plain bearings on the remaining axles, whilst 70040–70049 were built with plain bearings throughout. However throughout their service the roller bearings used in remaining cases showed no advantage in reliability or cost.|$|R
5000|$|A {{main link}} which pivoted {{in the middle}} from {{the lower end of}} the swing links and whose lower end was {{connected}} to the eccentric rod (which in turn connects to the <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> on the driver, as in the Walschaert gear). This link had a characteristic [...] "J"-shape.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Walschaerts and Baker systems, the Southern {{valve gear}} {{dispensed}} with the combination lever which transmitted {{some of the}} crosshead motion to the valves. As with those systems it used a <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> on a driver (instead of the eccentrics used by the Stephenson valve gear). The <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> attached to the eccentric rod, which hung from a pivot close {{to the far end}} of the eccentric rod. This pivot attached to the end of the radius hanger, the other end of which attached to a link block which slid back and forth in a track curved in the same manner as the expansion link of a Walschaerts gear. In this system, however, the track was fixed in place; sliding the link block back and forth controlled reversing and cutoff.|$|E
50|$|It is {{most often}} {{employed}} in steam engines and used to convert rotary into linear reciprocating motion in order to drive a sliding valve or a pump ram. In order to do so an eccentric usually has a groove at its circumference around which is closely fitted a circular collar (eccentric strap) attached to which an eccentric rod is suspended {{in such a way}} that its other end can impart the required reciprocating motion. A <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> fulfils the same function except that it can only work at the end of an axle or on the outside of a wheel whereas an eccentric can also be fitted to the body of the axle between the wheels. Unlike a cam, which also converts rotary into linear motion at almost any rate of acceleration and deceleration, an eccentric or <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> can only impart simple harmonic motion.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{locomotives}} having Stephenson {{valve gear}} normally had this mounted {{in between the}} locomotive frames. In 1947, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway built a series of their Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 locomotives, most of which had the Walschaerts' valve gear that was normal for this class, but one of them, no. 4767, had Stephenson valve gear mounted outside the wheels and frames. Instead of eccentrics, double <b>return</b> <b>cranks</b> were used to drive the eccentric rods, and a launch-type expansion link was used. This one cost £13,278, which was about £600 more than those built {{at the same time}} with Walschaerts' valve gear.

50|$|With the {{reverser}} in mid {{gear position}} since {{there should be}} no superimposed <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> motion, the expansion link die slot should be an arc of a circle centred on the pivot in mid gear and of radius equal to the length of the radius rod. This condition precludes adjustment of the valve gear by altering the length of the radius rod.|$|E
50|$|The end of {{the piston}} rod is {{connected}} to a built-up crank at {{the centre of the}} crankshaft. The crankshaft has the valve <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> at one end and a flywheel at the other. Also at the flywheel end is a small pinion meshing with a larger gear wheel mounted on a bracket cast in with the engine frame, giving a slightly more than 2:1 speed reduction. The second shaft has a small pulley attached.|$|E
50|$|The locomotive's {{trailing}} wheels were positioned {{below the}} firebox. The cylinders were arranged outside the frames, with flat Murdoch's D slide valves arranged at an incline above the cylinders and actuated by Allan straight link valve gear, driven by eccentric sheaves which were {{mounted on a}} <b>return</b> <b>crank.</b> The brakes were actuated by hand screw from the cab. The engine had 4 in thick wooden buffer beams and was equipped with cowcatchers.|$|E
50|$|The {{eccentric}} crank (UK: <b>return</b> <b>crank)</b> (1) is rigidly {{attached to the}} con-rod pin connected to the main drive wheel. Note {{that this is the}} only suitable attachment point on any of the drive wheels that is not fouled by the passage of the coupling rod or the connecting rod. The {{eccentric crank}} is of a length such that the pin attachment to the eccentric rod (2) is 90 degrees out of phase with the lead motion.|$|E
50|$|The Baker {{valve gear}} replaces the {{expansion}} link of the Walschaerts gear with an assembly of levers and links which produces {{the same effect}} of allowing continuous variation valve travel. The remainder of the gear is the same, so that the <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> and combination lever take the same form, although the proportions are usually modified. The Pilliod Co. sold the gear as a single assembly which was {{mounted on the frame}} in the location ordinarily occupied by the Walschaerts expansion link.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1934 and 1940 {{eight of}} the first fifteen locos had their Gresley gear removed and were {{converted}} to a [...] "double Walschaerts" [...] valve gear which utilized a double eccentric (<b>return)</b> <b>crank</b> and second link {{on the right side}} (similar to the gear Baldwin used on its 3-cylinder experimental compound 4-10-2 #60000), which operated the valve for the inside cylinder. Union Pacific referred to this system as the [...] "third link." [...] The 4-12-2's constructed from 1928 utilized roller bearings in the Gresley lever bearings, thus none of these engines were converted. The pre-1928 engines not converted received the roller bearing levers in 1940, and no further conversions were made.|$|E
5000|$|The Hackworth {{valve gear}} is a design of valve gear used to {{regulate}} the flow of steam to the pistons in steam engines. It is a radial gear, with an actuating lever driven from the crank. The drive may be taken directly from the crank (top picture) or indirectly via a <b>return</b> <b>crank</b> (lower picture). The {{other end of the}} actuating lever is attached to a die block which slides in a slotted link. When the link is vertical, the engine is in mid-gear. Forward, reverse and cut-off adjustments are made by moving the link away from the vertical. The valve rod is pivoted to a point on the actuating lever.|$|E
