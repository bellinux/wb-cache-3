Based on the genetic algorithm, optimization under multiple flow rate conditions was conducted by modifying the leading edge ellipse ratio and blade thickness on the front 20 % meanline. By using CFD simulation, optimization was completed with obvious improvements on the cavitation inception performance. CFD results show that the pressure drop location had moved downstream with the increasement of the minimum pressure coefficient.

Pump-turbine operation along the hump-shaped curve can lead to unusual increases in water pressure pulsations, which lead to machine vibrations. Measurements of wall pressure in the stators were performed together with high-speed flow visualizations. Starting from the best efficiency point (BEP) and by decreasing the flowrate, a significant increase of the pressure fluctuations was observed mainly in the wicket gates channels. The analyses in frequency and time-frequency domains showed a rise of low frequency components. High-speed movies revealed a quite uniform flow pattern in the guide vanes channels at the normal operating range, whereas, the flow was highly disturbed by rotating stall passage at part load.

A lack of suitable data, {{in the form of}} the machine performance characteristics, during the early stages of a hydro-power station's development led to the investigation of alternative sources of performance characteristics, not based on the testing of a hydraulically similar model turbine. Two methods of obtaining turbine performance characteristics were developed, one based on the published performance characteristics of typical reaction turbines and the second based on performance characteristics from a turbine of similar specific speed. The problems particular to the unit parameter representation of four quadrant <b>reversible</b> <b>pump-turbine</b> performance characteristics for use in hydraulic transient analyses were investigated. A review of alternative forms of representation led to the solution of the pump-turbine boundary based on a modified unit parameter representation. The method reduces the multi-variable problem of the pump-turbine boundary condition to that of a single variable. The solution algorithm is equally successful for use with standard turbines.

To address the impacts of their unpredictable and intermittent characteristics on the future electricity grid, Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) plants should enhance their regulation capability by extending their continuous operating range far beyond the optimal normal working range. However, for the time being, the regulation capability of {{the new generation of}} PHES, equipped with <b>reversible</b> <b>pump-turbines</b> due to their cost-effectiveness, is limited at part load by instability problems.

40|$|Hydropower is {{the most}} widely adopted form of {{renewable}} energy in the world today, accounting for approximately 16 % of global energy production [1]. With increasing demand for electricity, and concern about reducing fossil fuel consumption, hydropower {{is likely to continue}} to {{play a key role in}} global energy production. The interest in pumped-storage systems is increasing, due to their ability to regulate power grids, increase the efficiency of thermal power (coal and nuclear), and maximise the penetration of renewable energy such as wind and solar. Since pumped-storage systems must respond quickly to load variations, transient flow phenomena are frequent. In the design of hydropower systems, transient effects are an important consideration, as rapid flow variations can lead to potentially catastrophic increases in pressure (water-hammer). Numerical techniques for hydraulic transient analysis appear to be well understood, but the hydraulic characteristics of <b>reversible</b> <b>pump-turbines</b> can create difficulties depending on the software used for the analysis. The “S” shape of the machine characteristic in the turbine runaway region is a cause of instability in real machines and a potential cause of numerical instability in incorrectly designed or unsuitable software packages. The commercial hydraulic analysis software package SIMSEN-Hydro was used to evaluate hydraulic transients in two systems. Project A is a 25. 5 MW run of river system utilising three Francis turbines. Hydraulic transients in the system were successfully modelled, and the results showed good agreement with load rejection data measured on site during commissioning of the project. Project B is a 1333 MW pumped-storage system utilising four <b>reversible</b> Francis <b>pump-turbines.</b> The machine curves include the characteristic “S” shape in the runaway region of the turbine zone. Using SIMSEN-Hydro, the transients in the system were modelled, utilising the machine characteristics. Results were similar to those obtained during preliminary design of the system. By undertaking a sensitivity analysis for Project B, the effect of modifying input parameters on the simulation results was highlighted. The choice of pipe friction factor, surge tank throttling coefficient and generator inertia all had a notable effect on the results of the analysis. While the range of pressure wave-speeds that were examined did not have a significant effect on the results, this may differ for other systems. Based on these results, it seems important that sensitivity analysis be included on all transient analysis projects, unless the modelling inputs are all known with a reasonable level of accuracy...|$|R

40|$|At present, {{pumped storage}} {{is the only}} system to store huge amounts of energy. The surplus {{of energy in the}} {{electrical}} grid is used for pumping water from a lower to a higher reservoir (pump operation). At peak hours or in case of emergency this water goes down generating electrical energy (turbine operation). In the last years, due to the massive entrance of wind power, the number of start and stop cycles have increased dramatically as well as the operation at very low loads. In this new scenario more cases of damage have been reported and an effective vibration monitoring is necessary. <b>Reversible</b> <b>pump-turbines</b> (RPT) are high performance machines that have to change operation from pump to turbine mode (reversing runner rotation and flow direction) in a short time. Due to their special design characteristics (large power concentration) and operating conditions, they generate large pressure pulsations and forces when in operation. In this paper the vibration monitoring of large RPT units have been analysed. The results obtained after 15 years of monitoring several power plants with this type of machines have been used for the analysis. In the last years, most of the supervised power plants have been monitored on-line remotely. First the monitoring system used is described. The main types of excitation forces expected during the operation of these machines are studied especially the most characteristic and distinctive that are the pressure pulsations due to the rotor/stator interaction. The vibration signatures measured in machines with different designs are analysed in detail and compared with the signatures of conventional turbines. The influence of the operation type (as a pump and or as a turbine) and on the power delivered has been studied and the changes of the signatures presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} thesis was {{to describe the}} challenges related to PSH, both for this particular study and in more general terms. The method used was to make assumptions that would apply to traditional hydropower and do calculations based on these. The assumptions {{and the results of}} the assumptions were both commented and discussed. Challenges encountered that are unique to the project area and challenges with PSH in general were also discussed. The project area lies in the Upper Otra area, north in Aust-Agder County, and includes the two reservoirs Urevatn and Botsvatn. Three alternatives with the same layout scheme were chosen with a capacity of 500, 1000 and 1500 MW, referred to as alternative 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The choice of turbines was Francis <b>reversible</b> <b>pump-turbines,</b> which are installed with 10 % extra capacity for frequency balancing. The excavation method is drill-and-blast, based on the flexibility and cost. The total cost were found to be 6900, 12900 and 18500 MNOK for alternative 1 - 3, where the cable cost was 4300, 8600 and 12900 MNOK. The price of pumping was chosen to be 0, 1 kr/kWh, and the necessary price for production that gave zero NPV, was found to be 0, 4 kr/kWh. Some environmental conditions would be affected in the area, but most likely this would not include the wild reindeers in the area. The total operation time was decreasing with a larger installation, and the number of days in a row with either pumping or production was stable regardless of the installation. With a larger installation there would be bigger fluctuations in the reservoirs, and more occurring larger fluctuations. It would be meaningless to have two different LRWL for summer and winter. The result would only be loss of production, but still large fluctuations. The biggest change in the water level during summer from one day to the next was 11 meter for Urevatn and 9 meter for Botsvatn. If the existing power plant were taken out of production the fluctuations in Urevatn and Botsvatn would have the same maximum and average, approximately 1, 5 and 3 meter/day. The efficiency for Holen III would decrease, if maintaining the current production level. The existing limitations in the operation regime should be ignored if developing PSH in Norway. The PSH-plant should be operated without limitations and have priority over any existing power plant in the same reservoir, to make full use of the PSH-plant and to make sure the investment would be profitable. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{quantities of}} non-programmable renewable energy plants are causing several {{problems for the}} management of power grids. In this context, the pumped hydro plants can {{play a vital role in}} the security and management of the electrical system. Seawater Pumped Hydro Storage (SWPHS), where the upper reservoir is located on the top of a steep shoreline and the lower reservoir is the sea, is more and more being considered as a viable alternative for hydro energy storage, especially for islands and coastal areas with significant density of non dispatchable renewable energy generation. In comparison with a traditional pumping station, it is highlighted the actual advantage, considering the low environmental impact of the works and the great extension of sea coasts with important level gradients in the vicinity. Near the Foxi Murdegu municipality in the Sardinia Island (Italy), a SWPHS plant location was identified, assuming the construction of an upper reservoir with a capacity of 1, 200, 000 m 3, a head of about 350 m and an installed capacity of near 170 MW. One aspect addressed in the present work regards the enhancement of the efficiency of the storage system and its flexibility, concerning especially the management of low amounts of energy during the states where the plant needs to work at partial loads. A new accurate model was developed, considering configurations with one, two and three <b>reversible</b> variable speed <b>pump-turbines.</b> The model includes the operation in the Day-Ahead Market, in the more remunerative Balanced Market, sharing energy also with the nearby wind farms.

Considering the high-risk financial investment, but at the same time the significant value of the indirect benefits to the electrical system, a package of incentive mechanisms through "certificates for pumping" has been proposed, with the partial redistribution of such welfares. The certification required to have a negative NPV zero financial risk, resulted 1. 7 €cents per kWh exchanged with the network: a value quite acceptable and lower than the indirect benefit to the entire Italian electricity system...|$|R
