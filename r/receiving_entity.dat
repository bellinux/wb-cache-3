30|$|The opinion {{source and}} target {{identification}} {{is very important}} to classify opinions accurately. A target is the <b>receiving</b> <b>entity</b> of the opinion to which the opinion is entitled whereas; source is the person holding the opinion. Source identification is a concern when authors present the opinion of a third person. In the example “I bought a pen 2  days ago. It was such a nice pen. Its feel in hand is really cool. Its tip is soft and is very fluent. However, my mother was mad with me as I did not tell her before I bought it. She also thought the pen was too expensive, and wanted me to return it to the shop”. The author himself/herself {{is the source of the}} first four lines whereas the source of the last two lines is author’s mother, (Patella and Ciaccia 2009). Dealing with negation is also of high importance, since it overturns the orientation of the opinion words. For example, the sentence “I am not interested in this car” is negative. Negation words need to be dealt with a lot of care as not all occurrences of such words mean negation. For example, not in “not only but also” is not used for negation. Similarly negation can also be used without explicitly using any negation words like “Theoretically it takes care of the screen resolution”.|$|E
40|$|Payment systems play a {{significant}} role in our daily lives. They are an important driver of economic activities and a vital part of the banking infrastructure of any country. Several current payment systems focus on security and reliability but pay less attention to users’ needs and behaviors. For example, people may share their bankcards with friends or relatives to withdraw money for various reasons. This behavior can lead to a variety of privacy and security issues since the cardholder has to share a bankcard and other sensitive information such as a personal identification number (PIN). In addition, it is commonplace that cardholders may lose their cards, and may not be able to access their accounts due to various reasons. Furthermore, transferring money to an individual who has lost their bankcard and identification information is not a straightforward task. A user-friendly person-to-person payment system is urgently needed to perform secure and reliable transactions that benefit from current technological advancements. In this paper, we propose two secure fund transfer methods termed QuickCash Online and QuickCash Offline to transfer money from peer to peer using the existing banking infrastructure. Our methods provide a convenient way to transfer money quickly, and they do not require using bank cards or any identification card. Unlike other person-to-person payment systems, the proposed methods do not require the <b>receiving</b> <b>entity</b> to have a bank account, or to perform any registration procedure. We implement our QuickCash payment systems and analyze their security strengths and properties...|$|E
40|$|Discrete Event Simulation is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} {{that is used to}} model and analyze complex systems in many fields of science and engineering. The increasingly large size of simulation models poses a serious computational challenge, since the time needed to run a simulation can be prohibitively large. For this reason, Parallel and Distributes Simulation techniques have been proposed to take advantage of multiple execution units which are found in multicore processors, cluster of workstations or HPC systems. The current generation of HPC systems includes hundreds of thousands of computing nodes and a vast amount of ancillary components. Despite improvements in manufacturing processes, failures of some components are frequent, and the situation will get worse as larger systems are built. In this paper we describe FT-GAIA, a software-based fault-tolerant extension of the GAIA/ARTÌS parallel simulation middleware. FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and distributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to tolerate crash-failures of computing nodes; furthermore, FT-GAIA offers some protection against byzantine failures since synchronization messages are replicated as well, so that the <b>receiving</b> <b>entity</b> can identify and discard corrupted messages. We provide an experimental evaluation of FT-GAIA on a running prototype. Results show that a high degree of fault tolerance can be achieved, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load of the execution units.

40|$|Telemetry {{system of}} {{spacecraft}} is meant for radioing {{information from a}} spacecraft to the ground. Telemetry is typically a mixture of payload or housekeeping health data. Engineering or health data is composed {{of a wide range}} of measurements, from switch positions and subsystem states to voltages, temperatures and pressures. Telemetry may be transmitted in real time, or it may be written to a data storage device until transmission is feasible. As the spacecraft health monitoring is very important to maintain the spacecraft in condition, Telemetry system becomes mission critical system in the spacecraft. Packet Telemetry and Telemetry Channel Coding services provide to the user reliable and transparent delivery of telemetry information. With the error detecting and correcting capability of the channel code chosen, errors which occur as a result of the physical transmission process may be detected and corrected by the <b>receiving</b> <b>entity.</b> The implementation of convolution encoder is simple, this means these encoders are small and consumes less power on-board spacecraft and thus it has a good attribute as a spacecraft hardware.

40|$|Middlewares are {{fundamental}} tools for progress {{in research and}} applications in robotics. They enable the integration of multiple heterogeneous sensing and actuation devices, {{as well as providing}} general purpose modules for key robotics functions (kinematics, navigation, planning). However, no existing middleware yet provides a complete set of functionalities for all robotics applications, and many robots may need to rely on more than one framework. This paper focuses on the interoperability between two of the most prevalent middleware in robotics: YARP and ROS. Interoperability between middlewares should ideally allow users to execute existing software without the necessity of: (i) changing the existing code, and (ii) writing hand-coded ``bridges'' for each use-case. We propose a framework enabling the communication between existing YARP modules and ROS nodes for robotics applications in an automated way. Our approach generates the ``bridging gap'' code from a configuration file, connecting YARP ports and ROS topics through code-generated YARP Bottles. %%The configuration file must describe: (i) the sender entities, (ii) the way to group and convert the information read from the sender, (iii) the structure of the output message and (iv) the <b>receiving</b> <b>entity.</b> Our choice for the many inputs to one output is the most common use-case in robotics applications, where examples include filtering, decision making and visualization. %We support YARP/ROS and ROS/YARP sender/receiver configurations, which are demonstrated in a humanoid on wheels robot that uses YARP for upper body motor control and visual perception, and ROS for mobile base control and navigation algorithms...|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} Information Science {{in the coming}} {{millennium}} {{is related to the}} structures of information and their flow. The relation between the flow of information and the public to whom it is directed, has been modified over time, like one of the functions of the different techniques which operate in the transfer of information – from the generator to the receptor. The flow represents a succession of events, a process of mediation, between the generation of information by an emitting source and the acceptance of the information by the <b>receiving</b> <b>entity.</b> What happens is what we believe to be the kernel of Information Science: the generation of knowledge by the individual in his immediate living space. Thus, it is our intention to prove in this document that the structure and flow of information which link generator and receptor, have gained in quality, from a direct relation with the phases through which the development of the process of transfer of information passed until it reached the phase of electronic communication which made viable the relation of interaction with greater intensity which we are interested in observing. Os caminhos da Ciência da Informação no próximo milênio são relacionados às estruturas de informação e ao seu fluxo.

In context inference on mobile devices processing power and battery life are limited and responsiveness to user actions is most important.
