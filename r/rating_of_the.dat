5|$|Kind Hearts and Coronets was {{released}} on 13 June 1949 in the United Kingdom, and was well received by the critics. It has continued to receive favourable reviews over the years, and in 1999 it was number six in the British Film Institute's <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Top 100 British films. In 2005 it was included in Times list of the top 100 films since 1923.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 port {{received}} less favorable reviews {{than the other}} two versions, but still had positive reviews overall. It contained a different longer bonus mission than the one included in the Xbox 360 port, but the chief complaints of the negative reviewers were downgraded graphics and long loading times. GameSpot has given the port a 7.1, making it the third lowest <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> F.E.A.R. franchise in GameSpot.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} city employees, or agents, grew from 40,000 in 2000 to 73,000 in 2013.

In September 2014, Mayor Hidalgo announced that the city would have budget shortfall of €400 million, largely because of a cut in support from the national government.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} it is shown that for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{nonlinear}} power amplifier behavioural modelling, the sampling rate {{can be set}} to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal, rather than to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal by making use of Zhu’s generalized sampling theorem. This claim is supported by measurements on a basestation power amplifier. The findings are that the model error obtained when the output signal is sampled at <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal is approximately 1. 5 dB higher than when the sampling rate is set to <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal. However, if a sampling <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> twice <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal is used, which is still typically, much lower than <b>the</b> Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal, the degradation is only 0. 2 dB. These are important findings that will substantially ease the requirements on ADCs used in measurement setups used for amplifier modelling...|$|R

The instrument {{includes an}} integrator which is configured to integrate <b>the</b> angular <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle to form non-compensated attitudes. Also included is a compensator coupled across the integrator, in a feed-forward loop, for receiving <b>the</b> angular <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle and outputting compensated angular <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle.

According to the 2010 Indices of Multiple Deprivation Manchester is the 4th most deprived local council in the England. Unemployment throughout 2012–13 averaged 11.9%, which was above the national average, but lower than some of the country's other comparable large cities. On the other hand, Greater Manchester is home to more multi-millionaires than anywhere outside London, with the City of Manchester taking up most of the tally.

5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E
