50|$|In the 1999 election, Blincoe {{missed out}} on a seat, as a list {{candidate}} under mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation, by a narrow margin once special votes had been counted. Initially it appeared that Blincoe would have a seat in Parliament, {{as well as a}} party member directly following him on the Labour party's list. With the counting of special votes, however, the Green Party crossed the minimum 5% threshold of votes and received an electorate MP, which in turn allowed them to have seats in Parliament. In addition, Winston Peters won the constituency seat of Tauranga by a narrow margin of sixty-two votes over a National Party candidate, and this enabled his New Zealand First party to acquire <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> seats in Parliament.|$|R

Analyses of variance, with specified contrasts, found the DAT patients to demonstrate a pervasive memory impairment affecting both the qualitative and quantitative memory indices compared to depressed and normal elderly. The depressed elderly demonstrated impairment, compared to normal elderly, on tasks requiring effortful processing. Findings support pervasive memory loss in DAT patients and do not support clear memory impairment in the present depressed sample...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} simple cubic {{fields in the}} {{function}} field setting, and also generalize {{the notion of a}} set of exceptional units to cubic function fields, namely the notion of k-exceptional units. We give a simple proof that the Galois simple cubic function fields are the immediate analog of Shanks simplest cubic number fields. In addition to computing the invariants, including a formula for the regulator, we compute the class numbers of the Galois simple cubic function fields over F_ 5 and F_ 7 using truncated Euler products. Finally, as an additional application, we determine all Galois simple cubic function fields with class number one, subject to a mild restriction.

On 31 August, a nervous Dylan arrived on stage in a cream suit recalling Hank Williams, with a haircut and a short beard. Backed by the Band, he performed recent pieces from his Nashville Skyline and John Wesley Harding albums, as well as countryfied versions of earlier songs such as [...] "Maggie's Farm", [...] "Highway 61 Revisited" [...] and [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". The contrast in musical style between this performance and his 1966 concerts led to surprise and consternation among both the festival crowd and the throng of international journalists who had descended on the island to cover the event. Levon Helm of the Band later commented: [...] "Bob had an <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> of songs with about eight or ten different titles ... that we would've gone ahead and done had it seemed like the right thing to do.

40|$|Some 65 {{years ago}} (1951) Wolfgang Pauli {{noted that the}} net zero-point energy density could be set to zero by a {{carefully}} fine-tuned cancellation between bosons and fermions. In the current article I will argue {{in a slightly different}} direction: The zero-point energy density is only one component of the zero-point stress energy tensor, and it is this tensor quantity that is in many ways the more fundamental object of interest. I shall demonstrate that Lorentz invariance of the zero-point stress energy tensor implies finiteness of the zero-point stress energy tensor, and vice versa. Under certain circumstances, (in particular, but not limited to, the finite QFTs), Pauli's cancellation mechanism will survive the introduction of particle interactions. I shall then relate the discussion to BSM physics, to the cosmological constant, and to Sakharov-style induced gravity.

5000|$|Allow the {{overhang}} [...] - [...] A {{party is}} allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, but other parties are still awarded {{the same number of}} seats that they are entitled to. This means that a party with overhang seats has more seats than its entitlement. Other parties may be given additional list seats (sometimes called [...] "balance seats" [...] or leveling seats) in order that they are not disadvantaged. This preserves the same ratio between parties as was established in the election. It also increases the size of the legislature, as overhang seats are added, and there may also be <b>extra</b> <b>list</b> seats added to counteract them. This system results is less proportional than full compensation, as the party with the overhang is still receiving a [...] "bonus" [...] above its proportional entitlement. The number of extra seats that may be created is sometimes limited to avoid an excessive increase {{in the size of the}} assembly, which approaches the second option.
