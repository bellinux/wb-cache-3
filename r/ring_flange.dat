25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary <b>ring</b> or <b>flange.</b> The secondary <b>ring</b> or <b>flange</b> is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and coesite.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{solutions}} for in-situ connections of steel tubular towersegments of onshore wind turbines are <b>ring</b> <b>flange</b> connections. These havecertain drawbacks, such as e. g. costly production, long delivery time and ratherlow fatigue endurance. Friction connections with long open slotted holes havepreviously {{been proven to}} be a competitive alternative. In this work, the newtype of connection is investigated in various scales: segment tests, down-scaledexperiments and full-scale models. The influence of tower cross-section shape,execution tolerance (horizontal gap between the tower segments) and length ofthe connection on the bending resistance is thoroughly studied. In addition,buckling behaviour of the shell {{in the vicinity of the}} friction connection intowers with circular and polygonal cross-sections is analysed in order to checkpossible advantages of either cross-section. The influence of two types of theexecution tolerances on the connection strength is investigated: inwards bent“fingers”, leading to inclined gaps, and a parallel gap created by differentdiameters of the tower segments. Based on validated finite element analysesrecommendations for execution tolerances are proposed. A closer look is taken at the level of bolt forces under load application for thenew friction connections as well as for the <b>ring</b> <b>flange</b> connection. For theformer case, the influence of slotted holes on the joint resistance is checked. For both types of connections, comparison is drawn to hand calculation modelsused in engineering practice. Additionally, the distribution of meridionalstresses in the shell in the vicinity of the connection is studied. Based on the findings from the above described investigations,recommendations for the design of friction connections with open slotted holesin steel tubular towers for onshore wind turbines are given.

40|$|International audienceL-stubs are {{commonly}} used to model the tensile parts of <b>ring</b> <b>flange</b> bolted connections.

In the present paper, the effects of contact between flange plates are modelled via a refined beam model which has been previously applied with success to represent the elastic behaviour of non-preloaded L-stubs and T-stubs. Taking into account the behaviour of the flange in the contact area and bolt bending, a model is developed to predict the plastic resistance of L-stub joints. Simplifications are proposed to facilitate the determination of the contact zone and the ultimate resistances corresponding to failure modes involving flange and bolt. The comparison between analytical results with 3 D finite element elasto-plastic analyses and experimental tests indicates that the proposed model provides good capacity predictions. Effects of contact, and therefore of the prying force, are particularly important in the case of relatively thin flanges. © 201...|$|E

40|$|Prestressed <b>ring</b> <b>flanges</b> are {{frequently}} used in slender structures subjected to wind loads such as chimneys or wind turbine towers. The alternating forces due to wind can cause both fatigue failure and ultimate load {{failure of the}} bolts. For the design of such connections it is therefore important {{to take into account}} possible variations of the bolt forces. Due to manufacturing tolerances the contact surfaces are not ideally plane. While the initial forces (under dead load only) in the bolts can be considered deterministic and uniformly distributed along the circumference of the tube, the forces will be redistributed non-uniformly in the presence of lateral loads. This is a consequence of the non-uniform prestressing state of the flange material. A random field model is assumed to describe the geometry of the contact surface. The mean surface is assumed to be the ideal contact plane, deviations are assumed to be log-normally distributed with an exponential spatial correlation function. A Stochastic Finite Element Model with 13, 000 DOF and 1500 random variables in conjunction with Monte-Carlo methods is then utilized to derive the statistical properties of the random ultimate load of the joint. It is shown that the effect of imperfect contact surfaces can considerably deteriorate structural performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hip {{arthroplasty}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently performed orthopedic procedures with high scores of success while its most common complication is aseptic loosening of the acetabular component, which may result from host bone loss or even from pelvis discontinuity. The purpose of the study was to evaluate results in patients after revision acetabular arthroplasty with reconstruction rings and allografts. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data was collected from 69 revisions of acetabular components, performed in a group of 69 treated patients (the mean age 65. 1 years). Before surgery, the patients had bone defects of type IIb (n = 5), IIc (n = 20), IIIa (n = 27) or IIIb (n = 17), according to Paprosky et al. Results: The mean followup period of the patients was 7. 2 years (range 3 - 19 years). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a 3 - and 10 year survival rate was 92. 8 % and 84. 8 % respectively, using further revision for any reason of the acetabular device as an end point. Eight patients revealed implant related complications. Four patients presented with ring loosening, one with a loose acetabular polyethylene cup, two hips demonstrated recurrent dislocations and one patient was with deep infection. Regarding the remaining 61 patients without re-revision surgery, the mean Harris hip score improved from 30. 5 to 73. 8 points. Conclusion: A modified, antiprotrusion cage provides an acceptable survival rate and radiological results, but complications could still be expected. It seems that the observed massive bone loss with pelvic discontinuity and an insufficient fixation of the cage to the ischium may result in implant loosening. Stable fixation of the ischial <b>ring</b> <b>flange</b> with screws is an essential condition to expect a good outcome...|$|E

The new HTS rotor has no central core and the rotor winding is built with 15 double pancake coils. Each coil has 38 turns of BiPb 2223 superconducting tape, with nominal current of 180 A at 77 K. In this design, only two flux diverters are used {{at the top and}} bottom of the winding to help shape the magnetic field. The coils are located on the inner wall of the cryostat. The construction of the cryostat poses our greatest mechanical challenge.

40|$|Grease is {{commonly}} used to lubricate various machine components such as rolling bearings and seals. In this paper the flow of lubricating grease passing restrictions is described. Such flow occurs in rolling bearings during relubrication events where the grease is flowing in the transverse (axial) direction through the bearing and is hindered by guide <b>rings,</b> <b>flanges</b> etc, {{as well as in}} seals where transverse flow occurs, for example during so-called breathing caused by temperature fluctuations in the bearing. This study uses a 2 D flow model geometry consisting of a wide channel with rectangular cross-section and two different types of restrictions to measure the grease velocity vector field, using the method of Micro Particle Image Velocimetry. In the case of a single restriction, the horizontal distance required for the velocity profile to fully develop is approximately the same as the height of the channel. In the corner before and after the restriction, the velocities are very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channel with two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the “pocket” between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving. This condition particularly applies to the cases with a low-pressure drop and where high consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease is not replaced in such “corners” and that some aged/contaminated grease will remain in seal pockets...|$|R

40|$|In a {{constantly}} increasing and competitive market {{the efficiency of}} the whole wind power plant is an issue. The tubular steel towers supporting wind turbines account for about 15 to 20 % of the total installation costs and their optimization may lead to substantial savings with regard to costs and use of material. One important aspect of the design is the connection between tower's sections. The currently used solution with bolted <b>ring</b> <b>flanges</b> is prone to low fatigue resistance which imposes limitations that can impair the overall efficiency. Improvement could be achieved by implementing friction connections. This idea is investigated and the principles of a new type of friction connection are presented. Long open slotted holes are used to facilitate assembly and the segments are clamped with Tension Control Bolts which can safely and easily be tightened from within the tower. In the first part, the behaviour of segment specimens is investigated experimentally by mean of static and long term tests as well as numerical analyses. Two types of surfaces are considered: ethyl silicate zinc rich paint and corroded weathering steel. The influence of hole's geometry as well as connection configuration are studied. Particular focus is given to the variations of bolt force and the slip resistance. In the second part, the resistance function of the tested connections is derived from statistical analysis according to Annex D of EN 1990. The influence of environmental parameters and workmanship on the pretension achieved by TCBs is also investigated to provide recommendation on optimal handling and design pretension. Finally, a method is proposed to design friction connections for wind towers. It is compared to the design of current L flange connections. One example of a 80 m-high tower is shown. It highlights the potential benefits of using friction connections as the design is made simpler and material costs savings of up to 80 % could be achieved. Godkänd; 2008; 20081202 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the <b>ring</b> joint <b>flange</b> of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique. The cracks encompassed approximately 180 deg of circumference and were located at both the inner and outer radius of the <b>flange</b> <b>ring</b> joint groove. The crack depth was 1. 0 in. ~ 25. 4 mm! on the innermost radius of the depths located at the base of the ring joint groove to evaluate the change in the crack tip driving force.
