If a tweeter has been subjected to elevated power levels, some thickening of the ferrofluid occurs, as a portion of the carrier liquid evaporates. In extreme cases, this can degrade the sound quality and output level of a tweeter, and the fluid must be removed and new fluid installed.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{experiments}} on the coalescence dynamics in flowing oil-in-water emulsions using an integrated microfluidic device. The microfluidic circuit permits direct observation of shear-induced collisions and coalescence events between emulsion droplets. Three mineral oils with a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>viscosities</b> 8 – 70 mPa s and five silicone oils with a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>viscosities</b> 6 – 100 mPa s were chosen as dispersed phase.

From the coalescence times obtained for ten thousands of droplet pairs we calculate coalescence time distributions for the different emulsions. For all systems, the coalescence time decreases with increasing capillary number and increases with increasing dispersed phase viscosity. Scaling relations for the coalescence time are derived and compared with theoretical predictions. The potential of the procedure as a diagnostic tool for the prediction of emulsion stability in oil/water separation is discussed, as well as alternative applications of the microfluidic circuits...|$|R
