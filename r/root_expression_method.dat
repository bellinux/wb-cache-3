The addition of 20. 7 muM indole-butyric acid (IBA) {{to the root}} induction medium did not significantly increase the rooting percentage (88 %). Putrescine, spermidine, cyclohexylamine (CHA) and aminoguanidine (AG) enhanced rooting up to 100 % (98. 66 % for AG), when applied during root induction {{in the absence of}} IBA, otherwise these compounds inhibited rooting, as did spermine and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) + difluoromethylarginine (DFMA). The root induction phase was characterized by a temporary increase in endogenous free indole-acetic acid (IAA) and putrescine concentrations during root induction, whereas the <b>root</b> <b>expression</b> phase was characterized by increased peroxidase activity and low concentrations of polyamines. These changes were specifically associated with the rooting process and did not depend on the presence of exogenous IBA, because application of exogenous IBA enhanced the amount of IAA in the cuttings but did not affect rooting or the pattern of changes in polyamines and peroxidase. The effects of CHA, AG and DFMO + DFMA on endogenous concentrations of auxins and polyamines highlight the close relationship between the effects of IAA and putrescine in root induction and suggest that polyamine catabolism has an important role in root formation and elongation.

However, current <b>expression</b> similarity measuring <b>methods</b> need to be improved to accurately measure similarity between gene expression profiles from different platforms or different experiments. Results We devised new gene <b>expression</b> similarity measuring <b>method</b> based on pathway information. In short, newly devised method measure similarity between gene expression profiles after converting them into pathway based expression profiles. To evaluate pathway based gene <b>expression</b> similarity measuring <b>method,</b> we conducted cell type classification test. Pathway based similarity measuring method shows higher classification accuracy. Especially, pathway based methods outperform at most 50 % and 10 % over conventional gene <b>expression</b> similarity <b>method</b> when search databases are limited to cross-platform profiles and cross-experiment profiles. Conclusion The pathway based gene <b>expression</b> similarity measuring <b>method</b> outperforms commonly used similarity measuring methods.

40|$|This {{study of}} {{functional}} diversity considers symbiotic associations between two plant species, Medicago truncatula and Lycopersicon esculentum, and seven species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The {{objective was to}} integrate physiological analyses with molecular techniques to test whether functional diversity between AMF species is not only apparent {{at the level of}} mycorrhiza formation, plant nutrient uptake and plant growth, but also at the molecular level as observed by variation in the <b>root</b> <b>expression</b> of plant genes involved in the plant's P-starvation response. The seven species of AMF varied widely in their influence on the <b>root</b> <b>expression</b> of MtPT 2 and Mt 4 from M. truncatula and LePT 1 and TPSI 1 from L. esculentum. At one extreme was Glomus mosseae, whereby its colonization of M. truncatula resulted in the greatest reduction in MtPT 2 and Mt 4 gene expression and the highest level of P uptake and growth, while at the other extreme was Gigaspora rosea, whereby colonization resulted in the highest levels of MtPT 2 and Mt 4 gene expression and the lowest P uptake and growth. The expression of LePT 1 and TPSI 1 within the roots of L. esculentum was low and relatively uniform across the seven mycorrhizas, reflecting the ability of this cultivar to maintain low and constant shoot P levels despite root colonization by a broad selection of AMF. This study extends current understanding of functional diversity and shows that plants can respond differently to AMF, not only at the level of colonization, nutrient uptake and growth, but also at the level of gene expression...|$|R
