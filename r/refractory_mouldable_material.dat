5000|$|Bakelite was {{the first}} fibre-reinforced plastic. Leo Baekeland had {{originally}} {{set out to find}} a replacement for shellac (made from the excretion of lac beetles). Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were polymers, and Baekeland investigated the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde. He first produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called [...] "Novolak" [...] that never became a market success, then turned to developing a binder for asbestos which, at that time, was moulded with rubber. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to phenol and formaldehyde, he found in 1905 he could produce his dreamed-of hard <b>mouldable</b> <b>material</b> (the world's first synthetic plastic): bakelite. He announced his invention {{at a meeting of the}} American Chemical Society on February 5, 1909.|$|R
40|$|Cold-welding on cogged {{surfaces}} can {{be performed}} by pressing a piece of aluminium on a cogged surface of a component {{made up of a}} more rigid, hardly <b>mouldable</b> <b>material.</b> The components have to be perfectly cleaned before being pressed. There have been made welded joints between aluminium (the soft, easily mouldable component) and copper, brass, carbon steel, stainless steel (the harder/more rigid component, cogged). Welding has been performed by deforming only the aluminium component with a degree of deformation of 20 … 30 %. The numeric modelling of the aluminium component modeling has allowed studying the state of the tension and of the local deformations in the welded joint. Thus, the correct technological parameters have been established in order to avoid problems such as cracks or insufficient joints / weak joints...|$|R
40|$|Present study {{presents}} the preschool children’s understanding of framework concept, geometric forms in which framework {{can be represented}} and favorized by children. In addition the present study explores the extend of children’s knowledge of various materials, used in framework construction, and their conclusions of possible geometric forms, made by various materials in framework construction. 4 and 5 year old children were involved in present study by answering the questions {{before and after the}} framework construction activities. 4 and 5 year old children understand the frame concept and can identify at least 5 types of different materials possibly used in framework construction. They favor rectangle frame shape more than round or triangular and <b>mouldable</b> <b>materials</b> more than unmouldable. Accordingly to children, all geometric shapes (rectangular, round and triangular) can be made from all the materials offered (clay, wood, plastics). Preschool children understand and recognize the concept of framework in three geometric forms with materials, available in kindergarten. ...|$|R
40|$|Long-fibre {{reinforced}} thermoplastics {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} growing segments in the composites industry. Thermoplastic pultrusion compounding is one of the techniques used to manufacture this injection <b>mouldable</b> <b>material.</b> The pultrusion compounding process used in this research consists of pulling a continuous glass roving over a series of staggered cylindrical pins immersed in a molten thermoplastic bath. This research reports on the effect of several key pultrusion compounding parameters (roving pulling speed, number and diameter of pins, melt temperature and initial roving tension) on the impregnation of nylon 6. 6 melt into glass roving. The interlaminar shear strength of pultruded strands and compression moulded test bars, as well as optical microscopy, void fraction measurements and injection moulded specimen physical properties are used to quantify impregnation. Simple mathematical models have been developed to simulate the effect of processing parameters on melt impregnation. Good qualitative agreement between the model and experimental data is observed...|$|R

40|$|Optimal {{orthopaedic}} implant placement {{is a major}} contributing factor to the long term success of all common joint arthroplasty procedures. Devices such as three-dimensional (3 D) printed, bespoke guides and orthopaedic robots are extensively described in the literature and {{have been shown to}} enhance prosthesis placement accuracy. These technologies, however, have significant drawbacks, such as logistical and temporal inefficiency, high cost, cumbersome nature and difficult theatre integration. A new technology for the rapid intraoperative production of patient specific instrumentation, which overcomes many of the disadvantages of existing technologies, is presented here. The technology comprises a reusable table side machine, bespoke software and a disposable element comprising a region of standard geometry and a body of <b>mouldable</b> <b>material.</b> Anatomical data from Computed Tomography (CT) scans of 10 human scapulae was collected and, in each case, the optimal glenoid guidewire position was digitally planned and recorded. The achieved accuracy compared to the preoperative bespoke plan was measured in all glenoids, from both a conventional group and a guided group. The technology was successfully able to intraoperatively produce sterile, patient specific guides according to a pre-operative plan in 5 minutes, with no additional manufacturing required prior to surgery. Additionally, the average guide wire placement accuracy was 1. 58 mm and 6. 82 ◦ degrees in the manual group, and 0. 55 mm and 1. 76 ◦ degrees in the guided group, also demonstrating a statistically significant improvement...|$|R
40|$|A joint {{research}} project was directed towards {{the investigation into}} the feasibility of substituting currently used thermosetting resins for the encapsulation of electronic components by <b>mouldable</b> thermoplasts. <b>Materials</b> based on liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) appeared to be favourable in view of their excellent flow characteristics, inherent inflammability and mouldability. Initially tested materials derived from BASF developmental LCP exhibited sufficient thermal conductivity and low ion content levels. The additional requirements of stability towards hydrolysis and soldering as well as good welding line strength, however, were met only by blends of LCP with poly(aryletherketone) s (PAEK). Adherence of these materials to lead frame metal surfaces was investigated by a team of the Fraunhofer Institute of Applied Materials Research (FhG-IFAM). A minimised temperature difference between thermoplast melt and mould was recognised to be decisive for good adherence. The structural stability was significantly enhanced by introducing a polyimide layer between thermoplast and lead frame. The developmental materials were evaluated by SIEMENS for direct and indirect (premoulded packaging) sheathing. With direct sheathing using the LCP/PAEK blends ''wire sweeps'' were unavoidable. Promising results were obtained with the same materials under conditions of premoulded packaging techniques, among which heated tool welding proved to be the best suited welding process. High potential of the developed blends in system packaging is expected providing new prospects for the electronics industryAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1281 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|No son pocos los arquitectos que, tras abrazar la modernidad, encontraron su {{particular}} conversión desde la experiencia táctil y espiritual del material o, incluso, desde la evocación de su memoria y nostalgia. A todos ellos les llegó un momento en el que los tensos planos enfoscados en blanco les parecían de una excesiva abstracción y, sobre todo, distantes de otras realidades materiales por las que sentían una atracción más honda y permanente, y que activaban, simultáneamente, su memoria y las razones espirituales del construir. De hecho, en esa blanca abstracción no se mantuvieron ni sus creadores. Uno de los conversos de más largo recorrido es Barragán y las transformaciones en su obra son deudoras de los múltiples encuentros con los materiales y sus paisajes. After a few {{early years}} {{working in the}} Guadalajara of his birth, Barragán seized a dream opportunity and relocated to Spain’s capital city in 1935. In Madrid he embarked on a productive and successful career, designing multi-dwelling units for private developers for 5 years. During that time, further {{to what he had}} learnt in his travels across Europe, Barragán saw in modern architecture a catalogue of precise postulates with a reproducible vocabulary. All the buildings he authored in that period indisputably drew from modernist precepts. Nonetheless, like other modern architects, including Le Corbusier himself, Barragán experienced the desolation of white abstraction, of inert and repetitive matter: precise and effective perhaps, but unable to engage with the spiritual values nesting in the deep recesses of the architect’s memory. Around 1940 Barragán decided to break with architectural practice. In so doing he redefined it beyond the stylistic limits that had been his reference until then. The source for that redefinition was the encounter with gardens as the material and object of design, along with the strong attraction exerted on the architect by that specific type of matter. The return to stone, wood or traditional rendering arose not only out of a need to evoke his own experience, but of a desire to conjure up in these materials the memory and nostalgia of other cultures. The El Pedregal gardens and adjacent Prieto House, built in 1945 - 1950, constituted a veritable laboratory where Barragán, deploying a materially dense architecture, spawned beauty by uniting landscape and aesthetic expression. In a word, the architect aspired to use matter to express humanity’s emotional link with nature, its ultimate haven. With his oeuvre, Barragán blurred the boundaries between technical and humanistic concerns, sensing in every element, every object, the spiritual reasons for building. As in the Capuchin Convent at Tlalpan (1952 - 1955) and the Gilardi House at Mexico City (19769, with that blurring matter also participates in continuity. Such continuity, converted in his architecture into spatial succession, elicits the feel of a close-knit, changing and uninterrupted sequence. The resulting sleekness is the origin of the joyful, still delight in a work that needs <b>mouldable</b> <b>materials</b> to create that effect. All that together associates memory with the experience of materials. Inherited matter contributes to the generation of timeless and universal architecture, which portrays it not portrayed as the opposite of the spirit but rather, paradoxically, as the vehicle for its expansion...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a new family of <b>mouldable</b> metastable composite <b>materials</b> has been demonstrated. Their special quality is derived from the ability to maintain the matrix as a supercooled liquid or gel whose solidification can be triggered mechanically, as desired, by a user. This article describes some aspects of the development work. In particular, the following are explained: the choice of matrix material; the use of additives to enhance the properties of the matrix; and the selection of reinforcement fibre. As part of the work, some mechanical testing was performed on several variations of a matrix-fibre pair and, to demonstrate the potential of such materials, some comparisons were made with a possible competitor material, a glass-reinforced urethane. It was shown that the metastable material could be formulated to provide mechanical properties that would make it suitable for applications such as orthopaedic casting, splinting and body armour, and in items of sports equipment, these being areas where its mouldability could be particularly desirable...|$|R
