The company was a subsidiary of Marex International, an international marine salvage firm located in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1992 Marex made a bid to seize control of the artefacts and the wreck itself by suing Titanic Ventures, arguing that the latter had abandoned its claim by not returning to the wreck since the 1987 expedition. It claimed a superior <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> based on a [...] "pill bottle" [...] and hull fragment that {{were said to have}} been retrieved by Marex. Marex simultaneously sent a vessel, the Sea Mussel, to carry out its own salvage operation. However, the Marex artefacts were alleged to have been illegally retrieved by the 1991 Russian-American-Canadian expedition and Marex was issued with a temporary injunction preventing it from carrying out its plans. In October 1992 the injunction was made permanent and the salvage claims of Titanic Ventures were upheld. The decision was later reversed by an appeals court but Marex's claims were not renewed. Even so, Titanic Ventures' control of the artefacts recovered in 1987 remained in question until 1993 when a French administrator in the Office of Maritime Affairs of the Ministry of Equipment, Transportation, and Tourism awarded the company title to the artefacts.|$|E

50|$|On December 8, 2006, the Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune {{reported}} that the city of Chillicothe sold the majority, about 30 mi, of the railroad to Seattle, Washington, based Montoff Transportation, LLC for $976,000.

I also examined the potential of vegetation variables that describe habitat structure to predict densities of birds, and the use of snags for foraging by two species <b>of</b> woodpeckers. <b>Salvage</b> logging influenced the density or relative abundance of seven species of birds, though the pattern of the influence varied. Five species (black-backed woodpecker, hairy woodpecker, western wood-pewee, brown creeper, and yellow-rumped warbler) had greater densities or relative abundances in the unsalvaged treatment than in either treatment <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> logging.

Thus, the study was launched with an aim to assess the availability <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> wood in damaged buildings.

40|$|BACKGROUND Prostate cancer {{treatment}} after failure of primary therapy by either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy can vary greatly. This {{study sought to}} determine trends and predictors <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> treatment after failure of primary treatment in a community cohort over the past 10 years. METHODS From the community-based Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database, 6275 patients were identified who initiated a form of primary treatment for prostate cancer; 839 of these were identified as failing treatment by biochemical recurrence or initiation of secondary treatment between 2000 and 2010. Salvage therapy was categorized as either systemic, local, or none. Patient characteristics were tested for association with salvage therapy using analysis of variance, Pearson chi-square tests, and multinomial logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of the 839 patients identified as failing therapy, 390 (47 %), 146 (17 %), and 303 (36 %) received systemic, local, or no salvage therapy, respectively. Type of primary treatment received was associated with type <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> therapy (P <. 01). There has been an increasing trend in the use <b>of</b> local <b>salvage</b> therapy over the past 10 years (P =. 04). Primary treatment type and biopsy Gleason score {{were significantly associated with}} type <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> therapy. CONCLUSIONS The use <b>of</b> local <b>salvage</b> therapy has increased over the past decade, whereas the use <b>of</b> systemic <b>salvage</b> therapy has declined.

40|$|Salvage felling {{is one of}} the {{indicators}} of the forest health quality and stability. Most of the European Union countries monitor forest harmful agents, which account for salvage felling, in order to see trends or functionality between factors {{and to be able to}} predict their development. The systematic evidence of forest harmful agents and volume <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> felling in Slovakia started at the Forest Research Institute in Zvolen in 1960. The paper focuses on the occurrence of the most relevant harmful agents and volume <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> felling in the Slovak forests over the last decade. Within the 10 years period (2004 – 2013) salvage felling in Slovakia reached 42. 31 mil. m 3 of wood, which was 53. 2 % of the total felling. Wind and European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus damaged 78. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> wood, i. e. they were the most important pest agents. Norway spruce (Picea abies) was the most frequently damaged tree species that represented the amount of 35. 6 mil. m 3 of wood (81. 2 % of total volume <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> felling). As Norway spruce grows mostly in mountains, these regions of Central and Northern Slovakia were most affected. At the damaged localities new forests were prevailingly established with regard to suitable ecological conditions for trees, climate change scenarios and if possible, natural regeneration has been preferred. These approaches in forest stand regeneration together with silvicultural and control measures are assumed to gradually decrease the amount <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> felling over long term perspective...|$|R
