40|$|This article {{studies the}} joint <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> and {{production}} scheduling {{problem for a}} manufacturer. The {{novelty of the work}} includes modeling the uncertainty in the customers order placement, as well as considering the detailed sequencing decision for multiple distinct orders, in a unified framework. We derive closed-form expressions for the expected production cost, measured by the total weighted completion time, under a given set of <b>price</b> <b>quotations</b> and then design dynamic programming algorithms to find the optimal <b>price</b> <b>quotations.</b> The proposed model and algorithms are validated by computational experiments. Important managerial insights are provided. First, the manufacturer only needs to evaluate a few discrete prices to quote, rather than consider a full, continuous spectrum of prices. Second, knowing accurate information on order placement probabilities is important for the manufacturer to make profitable pricing and scheduling decisions. Third, the integrated decision on <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> and production scheduling has a significant advantage in profit maximization compared with various alternative decision approaches. The quotation model also demonstrates efficiency in quoting dynamically arriving inquiries. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

40|$|Intuitively, quoting dynamic {{lead time}} and price to {{customers}} based on real-time system state provides more efficient capacity utilization and increases revenue compared with quoting static lead time and <b>price.</b> However, dynamic <b>quotation</b> may require higher operational {{costs for the}} firm and it is often inconvenient to customers. This study aims to compare dynamic and static lead time and <b>price</b> <b>quotations</b> under fixed capacity and different potential demand rates. We hypothesize that there exists a potential demand rate under which the additional costs of dynamic quotation and the additional profit from dynamic quotation are equal. Thus static quotation may yield better performance under certain potential demand rates. We use an M/M/ 1 queuing model to model the supply system of a firm and formulate profit maximization models in an average reward criterion under both static and dynamic lead time and <b>price</b> <b>quotations.</b> Numerical analyses are presented to illustrate performances of both static and dynamic lead time and <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> and thus find the threshold potential demand rate. Besides, we study performance of two different kinds of dynamic lead time quotation and find that when firm can decide their price, performance of dynamic lead time quotation is good enough and when firm cannot decide their price, the dynamic lead time quotation is good only when lead time sensitive factor is small and potential demand rate is big...|$|R

American Economic Review 79, 700 – 12] by relaxing {{the assumption that}} consumers obtain the first <b>price</b> <b>quotation</b> for free. When all <b>price</b> <b>quotations</b> are costly to obtain, the unique symmetric equilibrium need not involve full consumer participation. The region of parameters for which non-shoppers do not fully participate in the market becomes larger {{as the number of}} shoppers decreases and/or the number of firms increases. The comparative statics properties of this new type of equilibrium are interesting. In particular, expected price increases as search cost decreases and is constant in the number of shoppers and in the number of firms. Welfare falls as firms enter the market. We show that monopoly pricing never obtains with truly costly search. This discussion paper has resulted in a publication in the International Journal of Industrial Organization.
