I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies.

500|$|According to the Chicago Sun-Times and the St. Petersburg Times, Everything Tastes Better with Bacon is a niche {{work in the}} {{cookbook}} genre. Perry {{stated that}} bacon had undergone a renaissance period. Christian Science Monitor noted in a 2003 article that bacon was becoming an increasingly used cooking ingredient, despite having been maligned by nutritionists. Recipes from the book were selected for inclusion in The Best American Recipes 2003–2004: The Year's Top Picks from Books, Magazines, Newspapers and the Internet. Perry's recipe for [...] "Succulent Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp" [...] was referenced in the 2003 book Smoke & Spice: Cooking with Smoke, the <b>Real</b> <b>Way</b> to Barbecue. Fran McCullough, the author of The Best American Recipes, commented that the book was a surprising addition to the field. The Atlantic said that {{three years after the}} book's publication, bacon had become as popular as chocolate or olive oil. Leah A. Zeldes observed in a 2006 article for the Chicago Sun-Times that the book contributed to the body of works that display the adaptability of bacon in recipes. In his 2009 book Hungry Monkey, author Matthew Amster-Burton commented on the phenomena involving bacon and books on the subject in prior years, listing the book along with The Bacon Cookbook and Seduced by Bacon. A 2013 article in the British newspaper The Independent cited the book as an example of increasing interest in pork.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of 9.0: Live was generally positive. Reviewing for Allmusic, Johnny Loftus {{commented that the}} fans' relationship with Slipknot is [...] "what unifies the performances" [...] on the live album. He said that throughout the band's history, they have never compromised, and they had become [...] "metal stars the <b>real</b> <b>way,</b> through relentless touring, embracing fan support, and penning some truly brutal songs". Rolling Stones reviewer Christian Hoard wrote that the music featured on the album resembled a [...] "new-school Motörhead", with its [...] "scary-clown rap-metal bullshit getting steamrolled by big riffs and speed-punk beats". However, he noted the songs sounded similar to their recorded performances; Hoard called it the [...] "songs' samey-ness". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called 9.0: Live a [...] "very worthy live album", and complimented the band for gaining success the [...] "old-fashioned way, building a strong reputation as an extremely potent live act". Begrand noted the band's relationship with their [...] "extremely devoted fans" [...] as a strong point, and that the band's fans are [...] "arguably the most fervently loyal bunch {{since the early days}} of Metallica two decades ago". However, he complained that it was distracting to have the band perform in a variety of undisclosed locations, rather than the one set throughout. [...] Tom Day of musicOMH wrote that the song [...] "Before I Forget" [...] is a [...] "true gem and grinds out with a level of devastation that will make you green with envy if you weren't at these shows", and [...] that drummer Joey Jordison took [...] "centre stage" [...] throughout the performance. Blair Fischer of the Chicago Tribune gave the album [...] "three volume levels", writing, [...] "The most amazing feat is that nine genetic defectives can congeal for such synchronous brain-damaged fury". Billboard reviewer Christa Titus wrote that Slipknot was [...] "relentless in its delivery" [...] of their live performances, calling the album [...] "an overwhelming frenzy of sound and fury". Titus predicted the album would chart highly.|$|E

The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a <b>real</b> <b>way</b> of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy but he gave it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E
