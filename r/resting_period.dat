5|$|During that operation, American {{soldiers}} initially {{made only}} limited {{contact with the}} Viet Cong, but defeated enemy troops in two separate battles. On June 17 the 1/16th infantry battalion, re-enforced by a company of 2/28th infantry engaged in a six-hour battle supported by airstrikes and massive artillery. The majority of the casualties suffered from that engagement alone, when the operation concluded on June 26, the 1st Infantry Division had lost 57 soldiers dead and 197 wounded. Then in September, following a string of attacks on allied military installations by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops, Major General John H. Hay decided to temporarily stop conducting large-scale operations until the true intentions of Communist forces were known. Towards October, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment marched into the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, to rest and refit for their next major operation. To disrupt the Viet Cong's <b>resting</b> <b>period,</b> General Hay launched Operation Shenandoah II to clear a section of National Highway 13 which stretched from Chon Thanh to Loc Ninh.|$|E
5|$|With a {{gestation}} period estimated {{at up to}} 2224 months and a one-year <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> between pregnancies, female dusky sharks bear at most one litter of young every three years. The litter size ranges from 3 to 16, with 6 to 12 being typical, and does not correlate with female size. Sharks in the western Atlantic tend to produce slightly smaller litters than those from the southeastern Atlantic (averaging 8 versus 10 pups per litter). Depending on region, birthing may occur throughout the year or over a span of several months: newborn sharks have been reported from late winter to summer in the northwestern Atlantic, in summer and fall off Western Australia, and throughout the year with a peak in fall off southern Africa. Females move into shallow inshore habitats such as lagoons to give birth, as such areas offer their pups rich food supplies and shelter from predation (including from their own species), and leave immediately afterward. These nursery areas are known along the coasts of KwaZulu-Natal, southwestern Australia, western Baja California, and the eastern United States from New Jersey to North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|Double-vault UDDTs are {{alternatively}} called twin-vault, two-vault or two-chambered UDDTs. In double-vault UDDTs, the fecal material dehydrates in situ. The two above-ground vaults {{are used}} alternately. While one vault is filling up, the other (full) one stores the fecal material under dry conditions {{for at least}} six months. During this <b>resting</b> <b>period,</b> no fresh feces are allowed to enter the full vault. In order to switch from one vault to the other, the user interface can either be switched or both vaults can be equipped with fixed seats and a cover sufficient to prevent access to the full vault. When the second vault becomes full and at least 6 months have passed, the first vault is emptied with a shovel and then the user interface is moved over accordingly. The vaults are commonly sized so that one vault fills up in six to 12 months.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{dairy farms}} divide the animals into {{different}} management units {{depending on their}} age, nutritional needs, reproductive status, and milk production status. The group of cows that are currently lactating, the milking herd, is often managed most intensively {{to make sure their}} diet and environmental conditions are conducive to producing as much high quality milk as possible. On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different nutritional needs. The segment of the adult herd that are in the <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because they are not being milked. All female animals that have yet to give birth to their first calf are called heifers. They will grow up {{to take the place of}} older animals in the milking herd and thus are sometimes generally referred to as the replacement herd.|$|E
500|$|Following various engagements {{with the}} U.S. 1st Infantry Division during the {{previous}} months, Colonel Vo Minh Triet, commander of the Viet Cong 271st Regiment, was ordered to move his troops into an area known as the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, which was situated between National Highway 13 and the Michelin Rubber Plantation. It was located about [...] northwest of Saigon, in Binh Duong Province. There, Triet's regiment was supposed to receive troop replacements and food supplies, {{to prepare for a}} major offensive against an unspecified target in War Zone D. In previous years, the Viet Cong 9th Division had often used the month of September and October to rest and prepare for their winter-spring offensives, and 1967 was no different. For that reason Hay was determined to disrupt the Viet Cong's <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> by launching Operation Shenandoah II, with the objective of clearing Highway 13 from Chon Thanh to Loc Ninh.|$|E

The use of NSAIDs, hot and cold packs, and physical therapy modalities, such as ultrasound, phonophoresis, or iontophoresis, can be instituted during this stretching period, if effective. [...] Corticosteroid injections are recommended two to three months apart with a maximum of three injections. Multiple injections (four or more) have been shown to compromise the results of rotator cuff surgery which result in weakening of the tendon. However, before any rotator cuff strengthening can be started, the shoulder must have a full range of motion.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we focused}} on feeding {{patterns}} and examined the effect of feeding during the <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> in rats. Plasma glucose in the portal vein reflected feeding directly, but blood sugar in the hepatic vein was almost kept a fixed {{and there was no}} effect of feeding during the <b>rest</b> <b>period.</b> Although body weight and abdominal fat were maintained by consuming the same amount of food, we observed that the levels of plasma triglyceride and cholesterol increase in rats fed during the <b>rest</b> <b>period.</b> The hepatic glycogen had a circadian rhythm that increased by feedings during the active period, but did not increase after feeding during the <b>rest</b> <b>period.</b> Furthermore, the red muscle glycogen also did not increase after feeding during the <b>rest</b> <b>period.</b> These observations demonstrate that feeding habits during the <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> may change the rhythm of glycogen and lipid metabolism, and it is important for healthy daily life to consider the timing of food intake...|$|R
50|$|A regular weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> is {{a period}} of at least 45 {{consecutive}} hours. An actual working week starts {{at the end of a}} weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period,</b> and finishes when another weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> is commenced, which may mean that weekly rest is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday-Sunday) week. This is perfectly acceptable - the working week is not required to be aligned with the ‘fixed’ week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced weekly <b>rest</b> <b>period</b> of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent <b>period</b> of <b>rest</b> taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question.

50|$|In pots, the Coelogyne cristata orchids {{require a}} lot of light, but not direct sunlight.
