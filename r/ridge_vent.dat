40|$|A {{facility}} for controlled environment agriculture {{is under investigation}} at Kothara (Kutch), a hot and extremely arid region. It consists of a greenhouse of 120 m 2 floor area coupled in closed-loop mode to an earth-tube-heat-exchanger (ETHE) buried directly below. The ETHE provides conditioned air at 20 {{air changes per hour}} when needed. A 7. 5 hp blower moves the air. Greenhouse is furnished with two continuous roll-up side <b>vents,</b> close-able continuous <b>ridge</b> <b>vents</b> and a retractable top cover made of shade net. Greenhouse has a fertigation system and an array of overhead foggers to supplement humidity and cooling. The ETHE was able to heat the house easily from 9 oC to 22 - 23 oC in half hour in the cold winter nights. Static ventilation from side and <b>ridge</b> <b>vents</b> along with shading was effective for day time control till early March. Subsequently ETHE was operated.

40|$|Numerous {{seafloor}} observations {{show that}} the sizes of high-temperature hydrothermal sulfide edifices vary dramatically with spreading rate. On fast-spreading <b>ridges</b> <b>venting</b> occurs from spindly chimneys which reach heights of about 10 m, while on slow-spreading <b>ridges</b> <b>vents</b> are frequently located near the tops of large sulfide mounds whose volumes may reach IO”- lo 6 m 3. We argue that such variations {{are the result of}} a profound difference in the nature of hydrothermal heat extraction between fast-spreading ridges, where spreading occurs predominantly by magmatism, and slow-spreading ridges. where there is a significant component of tectonic extension. Along fast-spreading ridges, a steady-state axial magma chamber can be insulated by a relatively thick conductive boundary layer because heat extraction is limited by low permeability. In such systems, episodes of vigorous venting are linked to diking events not only because these introduce a significant heat source into the upper crust but also because the intrusion of a dike is the primary source of increased permeability near the ridge axis. Over a time scale of the order of a decade, mineral deposition tends to clog the reaction and upflow zones and there is a high probability that young sulfide structures will be buried by subsequent eruptions. On slow-spreading ridges, tectonic extension maintains the fluid pathways necessary to support vigorous convection. In the waning stages of magmatism, hydrothermal circulation driven by a dcwnward-migrating cracking front can cool the entire crust leading to the formation of very large sulfide deposits. As the depth of circulation increases, overburden pressure...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in improving air quality within livestock buildings. However, the influence of housing and management factors on air exchange rates and indoor gas concentrations is not well understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of housing and management factors on the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and air exchange rates in 160 representative Australian pig buildings. CO 2 concentrations were measured, air changes per hour (ACH) were estimated using a CO 2 balance method, and structural and management parameters were recorded. The mean CO 2 concentration measured was 858 ppm and a mean air exchange rate of 22. 8 ACH was estimated. The analysis showed that CO 2 concentrations were affected by the type of building, season, control of the wall and <b>ridge</b> <b>vents,</b> ceiling height, size of the wall vents and height of the <b>ridge</b> <b>vents.</b> Weaner buildings had the highest CO 2 concentrations while deep-bedding shelters had the lowest. Winter CO 2 concentrations were higher in all buildings compared to summer. Buildings with automated ridge ventilation control had the lowest CO 2 concentrations. The wall ventilation inlet height was negatively correlated with CO 2 concentration. Air exchange rates were primarily affected by the type of ventilation, inlet height, stocking density, and building width and height. In conclusion, the equable Australian climate has allowed the construction of cheaper pig buildings, which provide an adequate environment for pig production, although these buildings may not always provide an optimal environment for pig production...|$|R

50|$|Benjamin Obdyke Incorporated is a {{building}} materials manufacturer {{based in the}} Philadelphia suburb of Horsham, Pennsylvania. The company was started by its namesake, Benjamin P.

While the company’s origins are {{closely tied to the}} metal gutters and downspouts business, Benjamin Obdyke sold off that part of their business in the late nineties and now exclusively sells roof and wall products that help improve the building envelope, most of which feature the company’s patented matrix technology.|$|E
50|$|Screens with {{apertures}} {{small enough}} to block termites were developed in Australia and have widely used in the United States, mostly for plumbing penetrations, since the 1990s. One of the early uses of screens for pest exclusion was the implementation of screen doors and window coverings. Screens are required by building codes at vent openings. To exclude rats, screen openings must be ½” (13.7 mm) or smaller. To exclude mice, a screen aperture size of ¼” or smaller is required. Most insects can be excluded with screens measuring 1/16” (1.59mm) in aperture size, but to effectively exclude subterranean termites, required screen apertures measure 1/55” (0.46 mm). Application areas for screens in the building envelope include weep holes, soffits, gable and <b>ridge</b> <b>vents,</b> among others.|$|R
5000|$|This model {{locates the}} [...] "last {{universal}} common ancestor" [...] (LUCA) within the inorganically formed physical confines of an alkaline hydrothermal vent, rather than assuming {{the existence of}} a free-living form of LUCA. The last evolutionary step en route to bona fide free-living cells would be the synthesis of a lipid membrane that finally allows the organisms to leave the microcavern system of the vent. This postulated late acquisition of the biosynthesis of lipids as directed by genetically encoded peptides is consistent with the presence of completely different types of membrane lipids in archaea and bacteria (plus eukaryotes). The kind of vent at the foreground of their suggestion is chemically more similar to the warm (ca. 100 °C) off <b>ridge</b> <b>vents</b> such as Lost City than to the more familiar black smoker type vents (ca. 350 °C).|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to durability and expense, Wright incorporated {{such factors as}} thermal comfort into the design. First, he indicated that concrete construction would keep the house cooler {{in the summer and}} warmer in the winter. Concrete walls have greater thermal mass than walls of wood, and thereby lessen temperature fluctuations during the day and throughout the year. Furthermore, the roof overhang would have reduced overheating by shading part of the walls in summer. A third feature was perhaps the most innovative: Wright specified that the ceilings for the second floor rooms be installed eight inches below the roof slab. The resulting air space was to be fed by vents beneath the eaves and exhausted through the chimney to create a constant stream of moving air. Modern homes often use a similar soffit and <b>ridge</b> <b>vent</b> combination to keep the attic and the floor below cooler. Yet, at the time of publication, most wood houses lacked attic ventilation because buildings were not constructed as tightly as those built in recent years. The monolithic construction of the Fireproof House would have prevented most natural air infiltration, making the ventilated air space a necessity.|$|E
5000|$|Benjamin Obdyke Incorporated {{was started}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1868 by Benjamin P. Obdyke after he {{returned}} from serving the Union Army in the American Civil War. [...] Obdyke invented and patented the round corrugated downspout, beginning {{a long tradition of}} manufacturing innovative quality building products. The company and product line grew over the years to include a variety of rain carrying equipment, roof edging and trims. The manufacturing process included roll formers and various stamping dies. The products were manufactured from Galvanized steel, copper and later aluminum (both pre painted and mill finish). By 1997 the company was operating 26 roll formers in a 200,000 sq. ft. manufacturing and distribution facility located in Warminster, Pennsylvania. In 1988 BOI acquired the patent for a rolled <b>ridge</b> <b>vent,</b> which began a new era of innovative products such as Roll Vent, Rapid Ridge, Cedar Breather, and eventually Home Slicker. In the late nineties the company was approached by another old line gutter manufacturer, Berger Brothers located in Feasterville, Pennsylvania with interest to acquire the metal manufacturing portion of the business. Based on the growth of the newer innovative products, the company decided to sell the metal business to Berger and did so in December 1997. Today, the company actively markets its ridge ventilation and moisture management products under the Benjamin Obdyke brand to professional contractors all over North America through their diverse network of wholesale distributors.|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{ventilation}} ratio and vent balance on cooling load and air flow of naturally ventilated attics are studied {{in this paper}} using an unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Buoyancy-driven turbulent ventilations in attics of gable-roof residential buildings are simulated for typical summer conditions. Ventilation ratios from 1 / 400 to 1 / 25 combined with both balanced and unbalanced vent configurations are investigated. The modeling {{results show that the}} air flows in the attics are steady and exhibit a general streamline pattern that is qualitatively insensitive to the variations in ventilation ratio and vent configuration. The predicted temperature fields are characterized by thermal stratification, except for the soffit regions. It is demonstrated that an increase in ventilation ratio will reduce attic cooling load. Compared with unbalanced vent configurations, balanced attic ventilation is shown to be the optimal solution in both maximizing ventilating flow rate and minimizing cooling load for attics with ventilation ratio lower than 1 / 100. For attics with ventilation ratios greater than 1 / 67, a configuration of large <b>ridge</b> <b>vent</b> with small soffit vent favors ventilating air flow enhancement, while a configuration of small <b>ridge</b> <b>vent</b> with large soffit vent results in the lowest cooling energy consumption...|$|E
