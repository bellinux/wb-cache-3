The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of the train. The offset between the field exerted by magnets on the train and the applied field creates a force moving the train forward.|$|E

In this paper, {{a method}} of calculating the {{parameters}} of equivalent circuit model of linear induction motor(LIM) is proposed based on numerical analysis and finite element method(FEM).

50|$|A linear {{induction}} motor consists of two parts: the primary coil assembly and the <b>reaction</b> <b>plate.</b> The primary coil assembly consists of phase windings surrounded by steel laminations, and includes a thermal sensor within a thermal epoxy. The <b>reaction</b> <b>plate</b> consists of a 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) thick aluminum or copper plate bonded to a 6.4 mm (0.25 inch) thick cold rolled steel sheet. There is an air gap between these two parts that creates the frictionless property an electromagnetic propulsion system encompasses. Functioning of a linear {{induction motor}} begins with an AC force that is supplied to the coil windings within the primary coil assembly. This creates a traveling magnetic field that induces a current in the <b>reaction</b> <b>plate,</b> which then creates its own magnetic field. The magnetic fields in the primary coil assembly and <b>reaction</b> <b>plate</b> alternate, which generates force and direct linear motion.|$|E

50|$|The {{fifth and}} sixth {{modifications}} were the most advanced. The difference between them was in the transmission. The fifth had a mechanical transmission while the sixth was using a hydro-transmission. Both modifications used the 1200 hp А-85-2 engine. The nose section of the hull was increased in size even more, and changed in form. Armour protection of the turret was significantly improved and it was increased in size again, reaching a width of 3.12 meters (without explosive reactive armour); the widest rear of all welded turret Soviet tanks.

Platelet-rich plasma showed markedly higher levels of miRNAs than serum and platelet-poor plasma. Few abundant platelet miRNAs, such as miR- 24, miR- 197, miR- 191, and miR- 223, were also increased in serum com-pared with platelet-poor plasma.

50|$|LIMs provide {{traction}} through {{the interaction of}} magnetic fields generated on the vehicle and a fixed external conductor. The external conductor was normally made of plates of aluminium, chosen due to its high conductivity in relation to its price. The active portion of the motor consists of a conventional electric motor winding stretched out under the vehicle. When the motor windings are energised, an opposing magnetic field is induced in the nearby <b>reaction</b> <b>plate,</b> which causes the two to repel each other. By moving the fields down the windings, the motor pushes itself along the plate with the same force that is normally used to create rotation in a conventional motor. A LIM {{eliminates the need for}} strong physical contact with the track, requiring instead a strong <b>reaction</b> <b>plate.</b> It has no moving parts, a major advantage over conventional traction.|$|E

40|$|A microplant {{concept is}} {{introduced}} {{for the analysis}} of homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed liquid phase reactions. Esterification of acetic acid with butanol is considered as a benchmark problem. The plant configuration includes a micromixer (SIMMV- 2, IMM Mainz, Germany), which mixes the reactants fed at the reaction temperature (200 C, 60 - 800 C) followed by the microreactor. For the case of homogeneously catalyzed esterification, a long tube of 1 mm inner diameter acted as the reaction tube with reasonable residence time. The results from the experiments for the range of temperature and the different catalyst concentrations were consistent with the published literature. For the case of hererogeneously catalyzed esterification a micro fixed bed reactor (FBR) was designed by stacking and connecting several <b>reaction</b> <b>plates</b> on which several micro-channels were created through micro-machining. Amberlyst- 15 was used a catalyst and filled in the reactor channels (1. 43 m total length). The pressure drop across the length of the reactor was not very high even in the swollen condition of the catalyst particle. The reactor gave excellent conversion rates at steady state and the performance of the FBR was consistent for very long time (over 42 hrs of continuous operation). A change in the residence/reaction time and the reactive length was achieved by changing the total flow rate and the number of <b>reaction</b> <b>plates,</b> respectively. The microplant is flexible in terms of desired residence time, amount of the catalyst, particle size and the flow rates. The FBR developed in this investigation offered the following advantages: (i) the system can be maintained practically isothermal, (ii) due to the very long active life of the catalyst, the reactor needs not to be disassembled frequently, (iii) the mole ratio of the reactants can be modified externally, (iv) the system is suitable {{for the analysis of}} the dynamics of this adsorption enhanced reaction.

A study of the phenomena associated with the transportation of powders using linear motor devices has been commenced in a SERC project at Loughborough University of Technology.

50|$|A further {{modification}} {{produced a}} guideway {{that looked like}} a rightside-up T, although the vertical section was a trapezoidal girder almost as wide as the top of the T. The <b>reaction</b> <b>plate</b> for the LIM was moved to the underside of the horizontal portion of the T on one side, extending vertically down, while the other side contained the electrical conductors that provided power. In such an arrangement, rain, snow and debris would simply fall off the plates. The new guideway design was simulated at the Atlas Computer Laboratory.

The results were found to be consistent with the data from literature obtained with conventional equipment on lab scale, while deviations were seen at long reaction times and high catalyst concentrations. A novel miniaturized fixed-bed reactor (mFBR) was designed for the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction, with Amberlyst- 15 as a catalyst.

50|$|Through {{the same}} period, Eric Laithwaite had been {{developing}} the {{linear induction motor}} (LIM) at the University of Manchester.

50|$|As {{development}} of the testbed design continued at HDL, the problem of high-speed loads on the guideway became obvious.

This was a relatively new field for the civil engineers that were working on the guideway design, as their field was more generally concerned with static loads. The train layout was redesigned with a box-like main girder, with a top-mounted <b>reaction</b> <b>plate</b> being used for the LIM, and the vertical sides of the guideway being used for centring. Wing-like extensions extended down from the body of the train and covered the centring pads.

5000|$|In a maglev {{train the}} primary coil {{assembly}} lies below the <b>reaction</b> <b>plate.</b> There is a 1-10 cm (0.39-3.93 inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for {{speeds up to}} 500 km/h (310 mph). An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field. This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back. A typical Maglev train costs three cents per passenger mile, or seven cents per ton mile (not including construction costs). This compares to 15 cents per passenger miles for travel by plane and 30 cents for ton mile for travel by intercity trucks. Maglev tracks have high longevity due to minimal friction and an even distribution of weight. Most last for at least 50 years and require little maintenance during this time. Maglev trains are promoted for their energy efficiency since they run on electricity, which can be produced by coal, nuclear, hydro, fusion, wind or solar power without requiring oil. On average most trains travel 483 km/h (300 mph) and use 0.4 megajoules per passenger mile. Using a 20 mi/gallon car with 1.8 people as a comparison, travel by car is typically 97 km/h (60 mph) and uses 4 megajoules per passenger mile. The carbon dioxide emissions are based upon the method of electrical production and fuel use. Many renewable electrical production methods generate little or no carbon dioxide during production (although carbon dioxide may be released during manufacture of the components, e.g. the steel used in wind turbines). The running of the train is significantly quieter than other trains, trucks or airplanes.|$|E
