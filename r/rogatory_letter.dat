40|$|A presente tese examina a cooperação {{judicial}} internacional como um instrumento indispensável na relação entre os Estados. Todavia, não possui apenas os Estados como protagonistas, mas também deve ser reconhecida a pessoa física (que venha a figurar como alvo do pedido) como um sujeito de direitos neste âmbito. A tese se destina a comprovar que é de grande relevo o princípio do contraditório e o modo pelo qual deve ser observado e que, no entanto, em face de normas infraconstitucionais, muitas vezes não é cumprido, gerando, assim, uma invalidade. O contraditório é corolário da dignidade da pessoa humana, este princípio fundamental do Estado Democrático Constitucional de Direito. O controle da validade das normas, por sua vez, depende da compatibilidade formal e material das regras infraconstitucionais com a Constituição, bem como com os tratados internacionais de direitos humanos em sentido amplo ratificados e internalizados pelo Brasil. Uma vez que um dispositivo integrante de um ato administrativo de um respectivo Tribunal (e. g. o Superior Tribunal de Justiça) ofenda a lei ordinária, a Constituição, bem como tratados internacionais de direitos humanos em sentido amplo internalizados pelo Brasil, deve ser considerado inválido. O contraditório prévio ao deferimento de carta rogatória passiva deve ser a regra, e o seu afastamento, a exceção. Esse afastamento exige pedido fundamentado do Estado requerente, bem como decisão motivada de parte do Presidente do Superior Tribunal de Justiça neste sentido. Nesse contexto, a tese defende a invalidade do art. 8 º, parágrafo único, da Resolução nº 09, do Superior Tribunal de Justiça, de 2005, nos três planos: legalidade, constitucionalidade e convencionalidade. This study {{assesses the}} {{international judicial cooperation}} as an indispensable instrument in the relations between States. Nevertheless, the States {{are not the only}} protagonists here, but also the individual (who comes to participate as the pleading issue) as a subject of rights in this ambit. Here the principle of adversary is proven to be of great importance as well as {{the way it should be}} observed, although it is often not obeyed in face of infra-constitutional laws, causing voidness. The principle of adversary is a corollary of human dignity and a fundamental right of the Constitutional Democratic Rule of Law. The control of rule validity, on its turn, depends on formal and material compatibility of infra-constitutional rules with the Constitution, as well as the international treaties of human rights in a broad sense ratified and internalized in Brazil. Once an integrating device of an administrative act of a respective Court (e. g., the Superior Court of Justice) offends the ordinary law, the Constitution, as well as international treaties of human rights in broad sense internalized in Brazil, should be considered void. The observation of the principle of adversary prior to granting a passive <b>rogatory</b> <b>letter</b> of request should be the ordinary, and its denial, the exception. This denial requires a supported request from the plaintiff State and a motivated decision from the President of the Superior Court of Justice in this sense. With that in mind, this study states the invalidity of the 8 th article, paragraph, from the Superior Court of Justice Rule n. 09, from 2005, in these three aspects: legality, constitutionality and international treaties compatibility...|$|E

50|$|The Convention {{sets out}} {{rules for the}} {{enforcement}} of <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> by the authorities of a party ("requested party") which aim to procure evidence (audition of witnesses, experts and prosecuted persons, service of writs and records of judicial verdicts) or to communicate the evidence (records or documents) in criminal proceedings undertaken by the judicial authorities of another party ("requesting party").|$|R
50|$|A person {{seeking to}} take an action against a person located in another country may need to seek {{assistance}} from the judicial authorities in the other country.

50|$|In the past, <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> {{could not}} usually be {{transmitted}} directly between the applicable courts, {{and had to}} be transmitted via consular or diplomatic channels, which could make the whole process very slow. There have been various international conventions in regard to service of process and taking of evidence. One of the earliest conventions to simplify the procedure of <b>Letters</b> <b>Rogatory</b> was the 1905 Civil Procedure Convention, signed at The Hague. Drafted only in French, it was only ratified by 22 countries. Later conventions, created after the institution of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, drafted in both English and French commanded more support. The Hague Service Convention, ratified in 1965, enabled designated authorities in each of the signatory states to transmit documents for service to each other, bypassing the diplomatic route. This convention has been ratified by 60 states including the United Kingdom and the United States, neither of whom had ratified the 1905 convention. The Hague Evidence Convention, ratified in 1970, formalised procedures for taking of evidence. This convention has been ratified by 43 states. For situations exclusively among Member States of the European Union, two regulations, 1348/2000 and 1206/2001 superseded the two Hague Conventions. These two regulations apply to each of the Member States of the European Union with the exception of Denmark, which opted out.|$|R

The defendant must explain why the use of <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> or other judicial reciprocity tools are not sufficient and cannot replace actual transfer of the case.

50|$|International {{service of}} foreign {{judicial}} and extrajudicial documents is governed in general by the 1965 Hague Service Convention.

50|$|The Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters—more {{commonly}} referred to as the Hague Evidence Convention—is a multilateral treaty which was drafted {{under the auspices of the}} Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCPIL). The treaty was negotiated in 1967 and 1968 and signed in The Hague on 18 March 1970. It entered into force in 1972. It allows transmission of letters of request (<b>letters</b> <b>rogatory)</b> from one signatory state (where the evidence is sought) to another signatory state (where the evidence is located) without recourse to consular and diplomatic channels. Inside the US, obtaining evidence under the Evidence Convention can be compared to comity.|$|R

On 10 September 2001, a civil suit was filed in a Washington, D.C., federal court by the family of Gen. René Schneider, murdered former Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army, asserting that Kissinger ordered Schneider's murder because he refused to endorse plans for a military coup. Schneider was killed by coup-plotters loyal to General Roberto Viaux in a botched kidnapping attempt. As part of the suit, Schneider's two sons filed for civil damages against Kissinger and then-CIA director Richard Helms for $3 million.|$|R
50|$|Managing {{the stages}} of an asset {{recovery}} investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires {{a great deal of}} resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually {{come in the form of}} a Mutual Legal Assistance request or a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory,</b> though some common law countries allow the filing of a Mareva injunction in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the requested country in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.|$|R
50|$|Taking of {{evidence}} in civil cases prior to the regulation was done by either under the Hague Evidence Convention or {{by means of a}} <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> (also called a letter of request), a formal request from a court in one country to take evidence to another in which the witness is domiciled. This formal document usually required transmission from the originating court to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in the state of origin, who then forwarded it, possibly through various embassies, to the MFA in the destination state. The foreign MFA would then pass the documents to the judicial authorities in that state, who would then go about obtaining the required evidence. The evidence would then be returned via the same long winded channels.|$|R
