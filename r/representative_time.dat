5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India went out on the ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a <b>representative</b> <b>time,</b> but touched the guardrail at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile barely made it into Q2, but was under investigation for exiting the pit lane while it was closed.|$|E
25|$|The team's test driver, Christian Klien, {{drove the}} F110 {{for the first}} time in free {{practice}} for the Spanish Grand Prix, replacing Chandhok for the first session. Chandhok and Senna qualified 23rd and 24th, but Chandhok was again penalised five places on the starting grid, this time for an unscheduled gearbox change. Senna crashed out on the first lap of the race, whilst Chandhok sustained damage to the front end of his F110 after colliding with Jaime Alguersuari as the Toro Rosso driver lapped him, forcing him to retire. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Senna outqualified Chandhok by over a second after new parts were fitted to his car; the drivers started from 22nd and 23rd on the grid as Fernando Alonso was unable to take part in qualifying. In the race, both cars ran ahead of Jarno Trulli's delayed Lotus in the closing stages, but Senna retired with a hydraulic failure on lap 58, whilst Trulli's attempt to pass Chandhok eight laps from the finish resulted in the two cars colliding and retiring from the race, although Chandhok was classified in 14th position. Both drivers also hit Rubens Barrichello's steering wheel, which the Williams driver had thrown from his car after crashing earlier in the race. At the Turkish Grand Prix, Sakon Yamamoto drove the car {{for the first time}} in the first practice session instead of Senna. Senna outqualified Di Grassi whilst Chandhok qualified last, but both cars retired with mechanical problems in the race. At the Canadian Grand Prix, Chandhok missed the third free practice session and did not set a <b>representative</b> <b>time</b> in qualifying due to hydraulic and sensor problems, but Senna outqualified Di Grassi to take 22nd place on the grid. In the race, both drivers were able to race with the Virgin cars; Chandhok finished in 18th position, whilst Senna retired after losing second gear.|$|E

The small Italian outfit had signed an exclusive deal with Subaru to use their new Carlo Chiti-designed and Motori Moderni-built 1235 flat-12 engine and Gachot was selected to drive the sole entry. However, the engine was overweight and underpowered, resulting in an ill-handling car that rarely ran {{for more than a}} few laps and Gachot didn't look like getting out of prequalifying. At the season opener in Phoenix, Gachot's gear selector rod broke on his first flying lap and he was unable to set a <b>representative</b> <b>time.</b> Subaru withdrew entirely after the British Grand Prix. After that the car ran with a Cosworth DFR engine and performances improved; the withdrawal of Onyx ironically promoted Gachot to the main qualifying sessions but the car still wasn't quick enough and he failed to make the grid all season.|$|E

50|$|Rain {{between the}} first and second session meant that the circuit was {{declared}} wet at the start of the second Friday session, with the water washing away the rubber than had been laid down by the first session and support events. The Scuderia Toro Rosso drivers were the first out, gathering data on the performance on wet tyres. A dry line began to appear after forty minutes, and it was Sergio Pérez who set the first <b>representative</b> <b>time</b> of the day. The final fifteen minutes of the session were dominated by drivers running on the soft tyres, with Michael Schumacher besting Nico Hülkenberg's fastest time by one tenth of a second on his final lap. Several drivers, including Heikki Kovalainen, Mark Webber and Pastor Maldonado went off the circuit, but the session passed without interruption. Kamui Kobayashi spun at the final corner and narrowly avoided the wall, whilst Narain Karthikeyan once again came to a halt on the circuit, this time at Turn 6 after the session had ended. With the team having successfully completed his car in time for the second session, Pedro de la Rosa was further paralysed by hydraulics issues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{functional}} connectivity analysis, {{networks of}} interest are defined based on correlation with the mean time {{course of a}} user-selected ‘seed ’ region. In this work we propose to simultaneously estimate the optimal <b>representative</b> <b>time</b> courses that summarize the fMRI data well and the partition of the volume into a set of disjoint regions that are best explained by these <b>representative</b> <b>time</b> courses. Our approach offers two advantages. First, is removes {{the sensitivity of the}} analysis to the details of the seed selection. Second, it substantially simplifies group analysis by eliminating the need for a subject-specific threshold at which correlation values are deemed significant. This unsupervised technique generalizes connectivity analysis to situations where candidate seeds are difficult to identify reliably or are unknown. Our experimental results indicate that the functional segmentation provides a robust, anatomically meaningful and consistent model for functional connectivity in fMRI. ...|$|E

30|$|Our {{study focused}} on time series {{formation}} from the road accident monthly counts and then proposing a framework to analyze this time series data to know the trend of road accidents in different districts of Gujrat and Uttarakhand state of India. The framework normalizes the time series data of 39 districts of Gujrat and Uttarakhand states using z-score normalization. Further, average AGNES algorithm using DTW as a distance measure is applied to cluster the districts of Gujrat and Uttarakhand districts separately. This gives us different clusters for both the states in which districts with similar accident nature are clustered together in one group. As it is difficult and time consuming to analyze every time series of every cluster. A time series merging algorithm is also proposed to merge all the time series and form a <b>representative</b> <b>time</b> series for each cluster. Finally, this <b>representative</b> <b>time</b> series algorithm is analyzed using least square regression method. The trend line is plotted over the time series that fits the data using least square regression method. The trend for each cluster is further illustrates that in some cluster road accident trend is increasing across the years, while in some districts there {{is an increase in}} road accidents during some special events in those districts. Our future work will focus on developing novel approach using data mining techniques to analyze the different factors associated with road accidents in those districts where the road accident trend is increasing and providing some preventive measure to overcome the accidents.|$|E

This field configuration is of interest owing to its high degree of spherical symmetry in comparison with previously considered dihedrally symmetric fields. The simulations indicate that the octahedral field suppresses the instability comparably to the other previously considered candidate fields for light-heavy interface accelerations while retaining a highly symmetric underlying flow even at high field strengths. With this field, there is a reduction in the root-mean-square perturbation amplitude of up to approximately 50 % at <b>representative</b> <b>time</b> under the strongest field tested while maintaining a homogeneous suppression pattern compared to the other candidate fields...|$|E
