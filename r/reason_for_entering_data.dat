40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{longitudinal}} research examining the changing process of “the view of learning in the university” of university freshman students on two occasions. Two-hundred and thirty seven students completed the four sub-scales on the view of learning and the four sub-scales on the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>entering</b> the university when they entered university. They also corresponded to the same sub-scales at the half year later. To measure the individual differences on “the view of learning in the university,” the latent difference score model by structural equation modeling was conducted. The model on the relationships among the levels and the means of difference scores for the factors of four aspects on the view of learning indicated adequate fit for the longitudinal data. A path analysis model was used for the factor scores estimated for this measurement model and the four sub-scales on the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>entering</b> the university to analyze the relationships between the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>entering</b> the university and the view of learning. The findings of these analyses were discussed with particular reference to the issues of transition from high school to university. 　本論文の目的は，大学 1 年生における「大学での学習観」の 2 つの機会での変化過程について，縦断的研究から検討することである。 237 名の学生が，大学入学時に学習観の 4 下位尺度と大学進学理由の 4 下位尺度に回答し，半年後に全く同一の下位尺度に回答した。「大学での学習観」の個人差について測定するため，構造方程式モデリングによる潜在差得点モデルを行った。この学習観の 4 側面のレベルと差得点因子の平均間の関係についてのモデルは，この縦断データに十分適合していた。進学理由と学習観の関係について検討するため，この測定モデルについて推定した因子得点と大学進学理由の 4 尺度のパス解析を行った。高校から大学への移行に関係する問題と関連させて，これらの分析結果について議論した...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding client {{perspectives}} on treatment is increasingly recognized as key to improving care. Yet {{information on the}} perceptions and experiences of workers with private insurance coverage who receive help for substance use conditions is relatively sparse, particularly in managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) populations. Furthermore, the role of several factors including prior service use has not been fully explored. Methods Employees covered by a large MBHO who had received substance abuse services {{in the past year}} were surveyed (146 respondents completed the telephone survey and self-reported service use). Results The most common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>entering</b> treatment were problems with health; home, family or friends; or work. Prior treatment users reported more <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>entering</b> treatment and more substance use-related work impairment. The majority of all respondents felt treatment helped a lot or some. One quarter reported getting less treatment than they felt they needed. Discussion and conclusions Study findings point to the need to tailor treatment for prior service users and to recognize the role of work in treatment entry and outcomes. Perceived access issues may be present even among insured clients already in treatment. </p...|$|R
