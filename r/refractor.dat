5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved <b>refractor</b> panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} currently {{operates the}} old 9.5-inch <b>refractor</b> (now {{known as the}} rooftop telescope) at the university's University Circle campus, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. The old site on Taylor Road was sold in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instrument}} is a <b>refractor</b> of 12.4inches clear aperture and of 15ft. focal length. The optics are by John A. Brashear of Pittsburgh and the mechanical parts by the Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland. Eyepieces provide magnification ranging from 130 to 720 power.|$|E
50|$|There {{have even}} been some special edition <b>Refractors</b> {{variants}} for specific purposes such as Camo <b>Refractors,</b> which feature a camouflage border pattern are were issued to honor the US Armed Forces, and BCA Pink <b>Refractors,</b> which were issued for Breast Cancer Awareness.|$|R

5|$|Amalthea was {{discovered}} on 9 September 1892, by Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36 inch (91 cm) <b>refractor</b> telescope at Lick Observatory. It {{was the last}} planetary satellite to be discovered by direct visual observation (as opposed to photographically) {{and was the first}} new satellite of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei's discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610.|$|E
5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch <b>refractor</b> was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|The Rooftop Telescope is a 9.5-inch <b>refractor</b> {{that was}} {{originally}} constructed in 1894 by Warner and Swasey {{for their own}} use. The telescope was the first instrument of the Warner and Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was put into storage when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome {{on the roof of}} the A. W. Smith building.|$|E

40|$|In 19 th century <b>refractors</b> {{dominated}} in astronomical research. Lenses {{of these}} devices were made of the classical glasses. Main optical aberration of these telescopes was residual chromatism. In this paper residual chromatism of several important <b>refractors</b> is shown. We managed to get optical parameters of 40, 36, 25 inch <b>refractors</b> of Alvan Clark, 12 inch telescope of Greenwiche observatory and 6 inch heliometer of Joseph Fraunhofer with which paralax of star was measured for the first time. The paper contains parameters of the dublet of König telescope of Prague‘s observator...|$|R
5|$|When Robert Baker arrived he {{continued}} a photoelectric photometry program focusing on variable stars. He {{continued to use}} the 12-inch <b>refractor</b> until 1927 when a new photometer was constructed and attached it to the 30-inch reflector telescope in the Observatory annex. He supervised two graduate students who worked on this equipment in the early 1930s. On May 27, 1933 the star Arcturus provided light which fell onto a photo cell in the observatory's annex and sent a signal to open the Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier {{by letter}} urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's <b>refractor.</b> Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} {{was originally}} built by Worchester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey, owners of Warner & Swasey Company, which made precision instruments and telescopes {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. They became trustees of the Case School of Applied Science (later renamed to Case Institute of Technology), and built an observatory in East Cleveland, which they gave to the school in 1919. This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four {{miles east of the}} university campus and housed a 9.5-inch <b>refractor,</b> and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed by the firm of Walker and Weeks. In subsequent years the observatory grew to house several more telescopes and instruments, such as the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt telescope, as well as an astronomical library and public lecture hall.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except for color. Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the <b>refractor</b> are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch <b>refractor</b> and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} main {{instrument of}} the observatory, housed in the dome, was a 280mm <b>refractor</b> with a focal distance of 4.9 m. In 1895, this telescope {{was replaced by a}} 360mm <b>refractor</b> with a focal length of 4.9 m and a 200mm photographic lens with a focal length of 4.8 m. The purchase of the double <b>refractor</b> enabled the observatory to participate in photographic observations without having to give up visual observations. This double <b>refractor</b> is still found in the dome of the Østervold Observatory, while the 1861 <b>refractor</b> is displayed at the Steno Museum in Århus.|$|E

It was inaugurated {{in a great}} celebration by the German emperor, Wilhelm II. Although it did not realize all the hopes astronomers had for it, nevertheless two important discoveries should be mentioned: the interstellar calcium lines in the spectrum of the spectroscopic binary Delta Orionis by Johannes Hartmann in 1904 {{and the presence of}} stellar calcium emission lines — a hint of stellar surface activity — by Gustav Eberhard and Hans Ludendorff about 1900.|$|E
