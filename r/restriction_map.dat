40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the course, we looked at genetic mapping, which is the problem of identify the relative order of genes on a chromosome. Now we will look at physical mapping. A physical map of the DNA tells the location of precisely defined sequences along the molecule. Physical mapping often deals with real distances and not just a relative ordering. We have two approaches for physical mapping: <b>Restriction</b> <b>mapping</b> and Hybridization <b>mapping.</b> <b>Restriction</b> <b>mapping</b> involves the <b>mapping</b> of <b>restriction</b> sites (precise short sequences) of a cutting enzyme based on the lengths of the <b>restriction</b> fragments. Hybridization <b>mapping</b> involves the mapping of clones (fragments) based on hybridization data with probes.
