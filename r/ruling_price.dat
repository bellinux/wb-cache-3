60|$|The {{proprietor}} of the San Francisco News Letter had determined {{to be at the}} centre of the present excitement in the El Dorado, and to judge for himself, or, rather {{to solve the problem of}} how much gold, how many Indians, and how much humbug, went on board the Pacific mail steam-ship Cortes, Captain Horner, and made the passage to Victoria, 840 miles, in five days. Although nine hundred persons were on board, yet no actual inconvenience was felt by the high-pressure packing; the greatest good humour and accommodating spirit prevailing, controlled by the gentlemanly conduct of Captain J.B. Horner and his officers. On the day of arrival, the operations of the Government Land Office at the fort in Victoria was 26,000 dollars. The importance of the amount can best be realised by comparing it with the prices, viz. 100 dollars per lot, 60 by 100 feet, unsurveyed. Some of these lots have been sold at 200 to 1000 dollars. Lots at first sale, surveyed price, 50 dollars; lots, second and last sale, 100 dollars each, are now being sold from 500 to 1000 dollars each. Six lots together in the principal street are valued at 10,000 dollars. The figures at Esquimault Harbour and lots in that vicinity assume a bolder character as to value, from the fact that the harbour is a granite-bound basin, similar to Victoria, with an entrance now wide and deep enough to admit the Leviathan. Victoria has a bar which must be dredged, dug, or blown away. We noted at Victoria that the most valuable lot, with a flat granite level, with thirty feet of water, sufficient for any ship to unload without jetty, is now covered by a large building constructed of logs, belonging to Samuel Price and Company. A ship was unloading lumber at this wharf at 35 dollars per M, which was the <b>ruling</b> <b>price.</b> At Victoria, on the 21st June, a Frenchman landed from the steamer Surprise, who came on board at Fort Langley with twenty-seven pounds weight of gold on his person, which we saw and lifted. Another passenger, whom we know, states that there are six hundred persons within eight miles of Fort Hope, who are averaging per man an ounce and a half of gold per day minimum to six and a half ounces per day maximum. The largest sums seem to be taken out at Sailor's Bar, five miles above Fort Hope. The lowest depth as yet reached by miners is fifteen inches; these mere surface scratches producing often 200 dollars per day. At Fort Hope, potatoes were selling at 6 dollars per bag; bacon, 75 cents per pound; crackers, 30 cents. From Fort Hope to Fort Thompson the road is good, with the exception of twenty miles. For 20 dollars, the steamers will take miners from Victoria to the diggings at Fort Hope, and for three or four dollars more an Indian will accompany you to Fort Yale. Bowen, steward of the Surprise, says that about a hundred Indians usually ran after him to obtain little sweet cakes, which he traded off four or five for 1 dollar in gold dust. Sugar at Fort Langley, 1 dollar 50 cents per pound; lumber, 1 dollar 50 cents per foot; tea and coffee, 1 dollar per pound; pierced iron for rockers, 8 dollars; plain sheets, 2 dollars each; five pounds of quicksilver sold for 40 dollars--10 dollars per pound was the ordinary price. The actual ground prospected and ascertained to be highly auriferous extends to three hundred and fifty miles from the mouth of Fraser River. One hundred miles of Thompson River has been prospected, and found to be rich, south-east of Fraser River. The same will apply to all the tributaries of Thompson River. A large extent of auriferous quartz has been discovered ten miles from Fort Hope. Exceedingly rich quartz veins have been found on Harrison River.|$|E

5000|$|Another type of unequal {{exchange}} is a corollary of {{the tendency of}} the rate of profit to equalize under competitive conditions, insofar as producers obtain the <b>ruling</b> market <b>prices</b> for their output, irrespective of the different unit labor-costs of different producers of the same product.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} organic compositions {{of capital}} of different branches of industry raised {{a problem for}} the classical economic schema of David Ricardo and others, who could not reconcile their labor-cost theory of price with the existence of differences in the OCC between sectors. The latter imply different profit rates in different industries. Also, while market competition would establish a <b>ruling</b> <b>price</b> level for a type of output, different enterprises would use more or less labour to produce it. For these reasons, values produced and prices realised by different producers would quantitatively diverge.|$|E

Using a set of structured questionnaire, primary {{data were collected from}} 60 poultry farmers (30 broiler farmers and 30 layer farmers). Collected data were analyzed using a combination of descriptive and inferential statistics (regression model), convectional profit model and feed use efficiency model. The result revealed that the shadow price of a 25 kg bag of layer mash (N= 2498. 2) is less than the <b>ruling</b> <b>price</b> (Market price) of N 2500 by N 1. 8.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{analyses}} production marketing {{decision in}} turkey enterprise in South- western Nigeria {{in the context}} of Bayesian decision model so that economically rational decisions can be adopted by the entrepreneurs in live turkey business. The data used to achieve the objective of the study were obtained from a cross- sectional survey of forty turkey producers in eight local government areas of south-western Nigeria. The study revealed that turkey enterprise in the study area was a profitable venture. However, to guarantee this profitability, decision makers must take into account (i) the <b>ruling</b> <b>price</b> at the time of making such decision, (ii) extra cost of keeping their birds, (iii) price movements and (iv) likely losses that might result from theft, death, disease outbreak etc when deciding to delay sales to a future date...|$|E
50|$|If capital {{accumulation}} becomes the dominant motive for production, then producers {{will do everything}} they can to cut costs, increase sales and increase profits. Since they mostly lack control over the <b>ruling</b> market <b>prices</b> for their inputs and outputs, they try to increase productivity by every means at their disposal and maximise surplus labour. Because the lower the unit-costs of goods produced by an enterprise, the greater the margin will be between its own cost-prices and the <b>ruling</b> sale <b>prices</b> for those goods in the market, and therefore the larger the profits that can be realised as result when goods are sold. Producers thus become very concerned with the value added in what they produce, which depends crucially on productivity.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} Ayie is fixed {{within a certain}} range {{throughout}} the Luo communities in Kenya and Tanzania (<b>ruling</b> bride <b>price),</b> and it increases from time to time, although {{the mother of the}} bride may negotiate a higher price whilst the groom may also negotiate a lower price.|$|R
50|$|If {{producers}} produce commodities {{below the}} socially average labour-cost, they obtain extra profit upon sale at the <b>ruling</b> market <b>prices,</b> and conversely those producing at above this cost make a proportionate loss. A constant incentive therefore exists to reduce labour-costs {{by increasing the}} productivity of the labour force.|$|R
40|$|Credit {{rationing}} is by many Keynesian economists nowadays {{seen as one}} of {{the most}} important examples of market failure in a modern capitalistic economy. Credit rationing occurs if in equilibrium the demand for loans exceeds the supply at the <b>ruling</b> <b>price</b> (interest rate). Since (Belgian) SMEs heavily rely on bank finance, this restricted access to bank finance could have a negative effect on the investment in new profitable projects and growth of the economy. Due to the lack of empirical research in this domain, we study the empirical significance of credit rationing for SMEs in a Belgian (bank based) context for the period 1993 - 2001. The novelty of our research consists of the distinction we make between credit rationing for long and short term bank credit. Moreover, in contrast to the numerous previous studies, pioneered by Fazzari et al. (1988), we opt for an endogenous classification into ‘credit rationed ’ and ‘non credit rationed’ firms, allowing for switching between both groups throughout time. An extensive panel data set consisting of 2. 698 SMEs reporting data over the period 1993 - 2001 is used to estimate the demand-supply disequilibrium model for long and short term bank debt. This is done by means of the instrumental variable technique 3 Stage Least Squares (3 SLS) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{author of}} the paper {{presents}} and analyses the price relation of four cereals in People's Poland against the functioning of corn market in the circumstances of its segmentary break and its variety growing in time and space. He uses internal price relations, and so exchangeable relations of two cereals {{in one of the}} segmentary markets, to show convergence of market incentives and production trends. He examines the four cereals supply preferences against mutual price relations of the same cereal in various sections of the corn market in this country, as well as against the links and similarities of relations occurring in this country and in foreign markets. The author comes to the conclusion that price relations of each of the cereals in the 25 -years' period od People's Poland differred in stimulant and adjustment power. The research object considered in the abstract however, does not reflect all the real correlations and the influence determinants <b>ruling</b> <b>price</b> relations of the four cereals, because all the problems of interrelation with the complex agricultural market and the other ones had to be disregarded although they are essential directions of agricultural production and foodstuff consumption.

40|$|Low {{wellhead}} ceiling prices {{over the}} past decade have led to the beginning of a shortage in natural gas production. If the demand for gas grows as expected during the 1970 s, and if ceiling prices remain low as a result of restrictive regulatory policy, this shortage could grow significantly. This paper examines the effects of this and alternative regulatory policies on gas reserves, production supply, production demand, and prices over the remainder of this decade. An econometric model is developed to explain the gas discovery process, reserve accumulation, production out of reserves, pipeline price markup and wholesale demand for production on a disaggregated basis. By simulating this model under alternative policy assumptions, we find that the gas shortage can be ameliorated (and after four or five years, eliminated) through phased deregulation of wellhead sales, along the lines proposed in President Nixon's April 1973 Energy Message. But the shortage is not reduced by changes in regulatory <b>rulings</b> on <b>prices,</b> even when the <b>rulings</b> allow <b>price</b> increases that are the maximum likely to be acceptable to the Courts. These results are rather insensitive to alternative forecasts of such exogenous variables as GNP growth, population growth, and changes in the prices of alternate fuels. ...|$|R

40|$|Perspectives of {{the world}} oil market areclosely related to the {{possible}} tendencies of <b>price</b> <b>ruling</b> of that natural resource. To describe it, the author constructs a system considering all the main elements subject to changes in time, which are essentially related to the <b>ruling</b> of oil <b>prices.</b> Pricing strategies of the oil states are adopted as the initial variable. Its variants can be specified {{on the grounds of}} the formulated subsystems of independent and dependent variables. The first of subsystems comprises features relatively unchanged over time and common for all the states-producers of oil. The maeroeconomic target of the oil states economies is considered here as well as the long-run target in their export sectors and stimulating functions of price variables. This subsystem is supplemented by the conditions limiting free price-ruling within the framework of certain stimulating functions. The second subsystem considères the effect of three categories of determinants: internal (relations of export incomes to expenditures of the oil states, acquired level of productive forces in those states, conditions for realization of the accelerated economic development, freedom to „manipulate" resources), external ones (relation of demand to oil supply) and correcting (quality of oil, transport distance, extra economic factors, the volume of demand aparat of main oil importers). They constitute proper criteria of variating procedure. Defining the probability of appearance of one of the presented variants in practice and its effect on the level of oil prices requires a permanent observation of changes in the respective analysed factors and taking account of them. And that is the premise adopted by the author of the article. Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
40|$|Questions {{and answers}} {{relating}} to the European Court of Justice <b>ruling</b> on minimum <b>pricing</b> of alcohol in December 2015. What does the ruling mean? The key message is that minimum pricing is not illegal under EU free trade rules.

The most important of those is that the policy achieves additional benefits for public health or imposes fewer barriers to free trade than other available policy options.

40|$|Reference pricing {{pharmaceuticals}} in New Zealand involves reimbursing {{drugs at}} the lowest <b>price</b> <b>ruling</b> in a given therapeutic subgroup, and has been argued to promote competition leading to equalised prices among similar drugs. Disappointment at the inability to contain public drug expenditures sufficiently {{has led to the}} augmentation of reference pricing with cross-product strategic agreements. These require firms seeking subsidisation of new drugs to significantly reduce their prices in unrelated markets, typically for relatively unpopular drugs. An examination of the markets for statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in New Zealand shows that in neither case has price matching voluntarily accompanied these agreements. Although imperfect drug substitutability appears to be an important factor in explaining some of these results, particularly for statins, intrafirm cross-subsidisation induced by agreements and industry concern about international benchmarking of drug prices are proposed as major likely sources of influence.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the transmission}} mechanisms of monetary policy {{in a small}} open economy like Norway through structural VARs, paying {{particular attention to the}} interdependence between the monetary policy stance and exchange rate movements in the inflation-targeting period. Previous studies of the effects of monetary policy in open economies have typically found small or puzzling effects on the exchange rate; puzzles that may arise due to the recursive restrictions imposed on the contemporaneous interaction between monetary policy and the exchange rate. By instead imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing the interest rate and the exchange rate to react simultaneously to any news, the interdependence increases considerably. In particular, following a contractionary monetary policy shock, the real exchange rate appreciates immediately and thereafter depreciates back to baseline. Furthermore, output and consumer price inflation fall gradually as expected; thereby also <b>ruling</b> out any <b>price</b> puzzle that has commonly been found in the literature. Results are compared and found to be consistent with among other the findings from an “event study” that focuses on immediate responses in asset prices following a surprise monetary policy decision.
