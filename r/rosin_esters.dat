30|$|Four rosin derivatives, {{including}} <b>rosin</b> <b>esters</b> and rosinamides, were synthesized {{and used}} to prepare neutral rosin sizes. Their effects during sizing are discussed in detail. Compared to natural rosin, the rosin derivatives had nearly no effect on sizing even at high retention levels in paper. However, the rosin derivatives in the rosin sizes improved {{the stability of the}} emulsion size particles, and there was good correlation between the sizing effect and the stability of the emulsion sizes under neutral to alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the structure of the rosin derivatives significantly influenced the stability and sizing effect of the neutral rosin sizes. In particular, for glycerin rosin ester-rosin sizes, the emulsion stability and sizing effect increased with an increasing proportion of dirosinate, among the glycerin <b>rosin</b> <b>esters.</b> Consequently, it was suggested that the rosin derivatives hardly contribute to the sizing performance of paper but predominantly function to stabilize the neutral rosin size particles, thereby improving the efficiency of the size under neutral to alkaline sizing conditions. Also it was supposed that glycerol dirosinate in the neutral rosin size would probably enable formation of a more stable particle structure to prevent the destructive action of the OH− ion.|$|E
40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) hot melts containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol <b>rosin</b> <b>ester,</b> polyterpene resin, aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA hot melts on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA hot melts varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA hot melts showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with <b>rosin</b> <b>ester,</b> polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion. EBA containing aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifier was exceptional because of even being incompatible, it showed high tack. Financial support by REPSOL (Móstoles, Madrid, Spain) is acknowledged...|$|R

40|$|Ethylene n-butyl {{acrylate}} copolymer (EBA) instead of {{ethylene vinyl acetate}} copolymer (EVA) can be used as the base polymer for hot melts. The lower polarity of EBA should affect differently the compatibility with the wax and the tackifier as compared to EVA. In this study the compatibility, tack and viscoelastic properties of EBA copolymer–pentaerythritol <b>rosin</b> <b>ester</b> blended with waxes of different nature (Fischer–Tropsch and microcrystalline) and in different amounts were studied. An increase in compatibility of EBA-copolymer blend with microcrystalline wax was produced leading to increased tack and open time, and reduced viscosity. In contrast, the addition of Fischer–Tropsch wax decreased the compatibility and tack of the EBA-copolymer blend. The addition of a mixture of microcrystalline and Fischer–Tropsch wax caused a better balance in the rheological properties and thermal stability of the EBA-copolymer blends. Finally, an increase in the wax mixture content produced a complete removal of tack caused by dilution of the tackifier in the polymer blend rather than by differences in compatibility.

On the other hand, modification of rosin acid with maleic anhydride using Diles Alder reaction produced adduct (RMA) which esterified with MPEG 750 to produce branched nonionic surfactants to study the effect of rosin modification on both surface activity and corrosion inhibition efficiency in 1 M HCl.

In this study, we examined the amorphous aggregation behavior of mammalian serum albumins at pH 7. 5, i. e., two units above their isoelectric points (pI ~ 5. 5), and the roles played by positive charge and hydrophobicity of exogenously added rosin surfactant QRMAE. The study was carried out on five mammalian serum albumins, using various spectroscopic methods, dye binding assay, circular dichroism and electron microscopy. The thermodynamics of the binding of mammalian serum albumins to cationic rosin modified surfactant were established using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). It was observed that a suitable molar ratio of protein to QRMAE surfactant enthusiastically induces amorphous aggregate formation at a pH above two units of pI.

Here, we report biophysical insights in to the interaction mechanism of thymoquinone (TQ), copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) and QRMAE with bovine serum albumin (BSA) individually and also in complexes forms to determine their competitive binding affinity. We have also studied the aggregation-inhibition effects of Cu-NPs and TQ individually, as well as in complexes form in the presence of QRMAE surfactant which is responsible for induction of amorphous aggregates in BSA within hours of incubation at 65 degrees C and physiological pH. The formation of aggregates was established by using various spectroscopic methods and dye binding assay. The circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that QRMAE significantly altered the secondary structure of BSA. However, the presence of TQ and Cu-NPs restricted the aggregation process which was observed to be more efficient when TQ and Cu-NPs were present together. This study provides very significant competitive binding results of QRMAE, Cu-NPs, TQ and protein aggregation behavior at higher temperature which was induced by rosin surfactant QRMAE, and protein aggregation process was inhibited by Cu-NPs, TQ individually and together. Therefore, our finding suggested that rosin surfactant QRMAE has high propensity to induce amorphous aggregation in BSA which was favored at elevated temperature and higher concentration of the protein. When BSA-QRMAE sample was incubated in the presence Cu-NPs under similar condition, the aggregation propensity reduced, and drastically inhibited by TQ and Cu-NPs together. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Plant oil {{is one of the}} most promising renewable feedstocks. Plant oils and functionalized oleo-chemicals including functionalized soybean oils have become attractive sustainable chemicals for industrial applications. Especially, epoxidized oleo-chemicals such as epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) are one of the most well-known readily available inexpensive functionalized plant oils. In this study, novel polymers and nanocomposites for sustainable materials applications were designed and prepared via ring-opening of epoxide in plant oils, and their chemical and physical properties were characterized. The novel transparent elastomers derived from functionalized plant oils have a great potential as flexible electronic and biological applications with their inherent low toxicity. Especially, their rheological properties showed a potential for pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs). The dominant thermal stability and transparency were obtained via green processing: one pot, single step, fast reactions in moderate conditions, or solvent-free UV curing conditions. These oleo-based elastomers presented excellent end-use properties for PSAs application comparable to commercial PSA tapes. Based on the principal chemical studies, the roles of the each component have been identified: polymer derived from the ring-opening of epoxides as an elastomer, and dihydroxylated triglycerides as a tackifier. Their interaction was also elucidated with an element label analysis. The mechanical and rheological properties of the oleo-polymer as PSAs were able to be improved with a <b>rosin</b> <b>ester</b> tackifier. In addition, biogreases and bio-thermoplastics were developed via the environmentally benign process, which will contribute to further application on the production of new bio-based materials.

30|$|Anionic {{emulsion}} sizes {{consisting of}} <b>rosin</b> triglyceride <b>esters</b> and partly fortified rosin acids (i.e., rosin-ester sizes), {{have recently been}} used as internal sizes for alkaline papermaking. In this study, handsheets were prepared from pulp suspensions with alum and a rosin-ester size under various conditions, and sizing degree and size and aluminum contents of the handsheets were determined. Aluminum compounds originating from alum added to the pulp suspensions behave as retention aids of the rosin-ester size even in alkaline papermaking under limited conditions. Carboxyl groups in pulp are the primary retention sites of aluminum compounds in pulp suspensions. They form cationic sites on pulp fibers, and thus the anionic size emulsion particles are adsorbed on pulp fibers by electrostatic interactions. However, the cationic charges of aluminum compounds on pulp fibers decrease and finally disappear completely with the lapse of time after the alum addition by forming ionic bonds between the cationic sites and OH− ions. Thus, pH values of the pulp suspensions and timing of the size addition strongly influence the retention values of the rosin-ester size and the resultant sizing features.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel method for the rapid identification of complex organic materials, including macromolecules, that involves a high temperature simultaneous hydrolysis and derivatisation reaction. In this procedure, aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxides are made to react {{with a wide range of}} complex molecular species, including synthetic and natural polymers, under high temperature flash heating conditions. The hydrolysis products are converted to derivatives, such as alkyl esters or alkyl ethers. The reaction forms the basis for a modified pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC) identification technique. Although the process is primarily intended for the rapid identification of polymers which are susceptible to hydrolysis, it is also valuable for characterisation of a variety of hydrolysable lower molecular weight species, such as polymer additives, triglycerides and natural waxes. The reaction takes place when an intimate mixture of an aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxide solution is flash heated with the analyte in a conventional pyrolysis unit, and "on-line" GC-MS is used to separate and identify the reaction products. Analytes included synthetic polyester resins and phenolic polymers, natural products such as lipids and wood extractives, and natural polymers including lignocellulose, proteins and kerogen. Reaction variables, such as temperature, pH analyte particle size, substrate, and the derivatising reagent were studied, in order to find the optimum conditions for the reaction. While the reaction occurs at temperatures as low as 358 degrees celsius, a 770 degrees celsius reaction temperature was adopted to allow direct comparison with Py-GC data. A high pH of the derivatising reagent was found to be necessary to achieve an efficient hydrolysis of the macromolecule. Small particle size gives better conversion to derivatised ++products. The nature of the heating substrate did not appear to influence the reaction. Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides (TAAH) were found to be the most effective derivatising reagents for the reaction. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was the most useful derivatising reagent, since the methyl derivatives of the hydrolysed products were conveniently chromatographed and usually had well known mass spectra. Other TA-AHs were useful for (i) producing higher molecular weight alkyl derivatives of low molecular weight side chains in some polymers, e. g., acetate groups in polyvinyl acetate, (ii) the purpose of determining sites of pre-existing methylation in natural products such as lignocellulose, or (iii) cases where methylation products could be confused with existing pyrolysis products. The reaction mechanism is believed to involve hydrolysis of the organic material, formation of the tetra-alkylammonium salt, and thermal degradation of the quaternary ammonium salt to alkylated derivatives. Some evidence is presented to support this mechanism, which is considered to be ionic in character, rather than a free radical reaction. A detailed study of the reaction of alkyd resins indicated that polyhydric alcohols, polybasic acids, degree of cure, oil length, and rosin acid and epoxy modification could be determined. The reaction of rosin modified phenolic resins (tert-butyl phenol formaldehyde and para-nonyl phenol formaldehyde), gave <b>rosin</b> acid methyl <b>esters</b> and easily identifiable products from the synthetic components. Fatty acid methyl esters could be obtained directly from lipids, such as vegetable oils, without time consuming preparative steps. The problems of base catalysed isomerisation of the double bonds in polyunsaturated fatty acids were overcome by reducing the amount of base used for the reaction. The reaction facilitated the identification of fatty acids in ++woolwax, the triglycerides in cosmetic products, and lipids in trace quantities of human fingerprint deposits. A more reliable representation of the chemical structure of lignocellulose in softwood and hardwood species was obtained by the reaction, as compared to conventional PyGC which underestimates the aromatic carboxylic acid moieties. Gymnosperm or angiosperm origin was indicated by the presence of solely guaiacyl, or both guaiacyl and syringyl derived groups, respectively. Other extraneous extractable material was identified simultaneously, including aliphatic and aromatic acids, which would not normally be detected by conventional Py-GC. An alternative method involved extracting the wood with TMAH, followed by pyrolysis of the extract, to give less complex but more specific GC profiles. The TMAH extraction procedure also indicated some characteristic biomarker species as well as guaiacyl and syringyl derived compounds. The pyrolysis of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAH) extracts revealed the sites of pre-existing methylation in the Eucalyptus marginata species. The thermally assisted hydrolysis and alkylation method which has been developed is usually superior to the conventional Py-GC procedure for those polymers which are prone to hydrolysis, since it results in products which are more readily related to the polymer structure. For example, concerted hydrolysis and alkylation of polyester resins results in alkyl carboxylate esters and the alkyl ethers, whereas in conventional Py-GC the products are alkenes and carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids are more difficult to chromatograph by GC, and aromatic carboxylic acids in particular are susceptible to decarboxylation under the pyrolysis conditions. The reaction procedure has provided an alternative approach to the characterisation of submicrogram quantities of a range of synthetic polymers, natural products and ++natural polymers, which has not previously been possible without lengthy chemical degradation procedures. Although it has not displaced the conventional Py-GC technique, it has given a new dimension to the characterisation of organic materials, providing a powerful tool for forensic science investigations and the analysis of complex materials...|$|R
