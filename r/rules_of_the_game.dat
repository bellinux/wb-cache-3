5|$|The first preview {{screening}} of the 113-minute version of The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> took place on June 28, 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience. On June 29 the film was screened for the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts Jean Zay and for the jury of the annual Louis Delluc Prize for the best French film. When the awards were announced ten days later Marcel Carne's Le Quai des brumes won the first prize and The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir's previous films, The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> was highly anticipated and Zay had expected to award it the prize. Renoir later {{said he thought the}} film would be commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> was {{the most}} {{expensive}} film ever produced in France when it was released. Its original budget had been 2.5 million francs (which already made it the most expensive French film of that year) and was increased by another 2 million francs, costing over 5 million francs total.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the 85-minute {{version was}} the only one available, but despite this its {{reputation}} slowly grew. In 1956, boxes of original material were rediscovered and a reconstructed version of the film premiered that year at the Venice Film Festival, with only a minor scene from Renoir's first cut missing. Since then, The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> has often been called one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Numerous film critics and directors have praised it highly, citing it as an inspiration for their own work.|$|E

In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited {{for such things as}} arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> (original French title: La Règle du Jeu) is a 1939 French film {{directed}} by Jean Renoir. It features an ensemble cast of Nora Gregor, Paulette Dubost, Mila Parély, Marcel Dalio, Julien Carette, Roland Toutain, Gaston Modot, Pierre Magnier and Jean Renoir himself. Renoir's {{portrayal of the}} wise, mournful Octave anchors the fatalistic mood of this pensive comedy of manners. The film depicts members of upper-class French society and their servants just {{before the beginning of}} World War II, showing their moral callousness on the eve of impending destruction.|$|E

5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1956 film enthusiasts Jean Gabarit and Jacques Marechal {{founded the}} Societe des Grands Films, a film {{restoration}} company focused on neglected films. The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> {{was one of}} the company's first restorations; they persuaded Camille Francois to sell them the rights to the film. With Francois' help they discovered records that led to 224 boxes that had been found at the bombed G.M. Film Lab site. These boxes included negative prints, duplicated prints and sound mixes of the film. With the help and advice of Renoir and Jacques Durand, Gabarit and Marechal restored most of the cut footage from Renoir's original version and assembled a new 106-minute version of the film.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a game theoretic {{approach}} {{is used to}} derive the optimal power allocation in multiple access channels (MAC) for decentralized systems. Unlike previous results, a simple coordination mechanism is used between selfish users. The nature and influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coordination mechanism is studied in details for single antenna and multiple antenna terminals. In the proposed framework, the coordination signal indicates to the users in which order the receiver applies successive interference cancelation and with which frequency this order is used: it establishes <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Remarkably, in Gaussian single input single output MACs, it is shown that, whatever <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> <b>the</b> selfish behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> users leads to a socially efficient network {{that is to say}} it is always sum-capacity achieving. However, for fast fading MAC with multi-antenna terminals, there can be a performance gap between the decentralized system and its centralized counterpart.

5|$|The first box {{lacrosse}} match {{conducted in}} Australia came about {{as part of}} a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne. The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match {{as part of a}} multi sport carnival at the Plaza (Wattle Path Palais) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931. After a lightning six-a-side (outdoor) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior, it was decided to play six-a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs, with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match. Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia, with P J Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from the VLA Secretary. By 1933, box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The game's story follows Neku {{over the}} course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with {{partners}} Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died or how he arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners, he starts to understand the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game.</b> After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to the living, and she promises to meet Neku at the statue of Hachiko. He also recovers his entry fee, which was his memories, except for the events leading up to his death. However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his new entry fee for the second week. During the second week he recalls small details of his death; eventually, he recognizes that he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from an explosion created by Minamimoto.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during {{the first game of the}} day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E

30|$|The final {{speeches and}} the {{declarations}} made cannot escape the evaluation from an ideological canon of geo-political location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants.

25|$|Another {{version of}} {{formalism}} is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem {{is not an}} absolute truth, but a relative one: if one assigns meaning to the strings {{in such a way}} that the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), then one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> hold. (Compare this position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.|$|E
