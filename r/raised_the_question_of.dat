5|$|Following a short illness, on {{the night}} of 14–15 June 1341 the emperor Andronikos III died at the {{relatively}} early age of 45, possibly due to chronic malaria. His nine-year-old son John (John V) was the obvious successor, but he had not been officially proclaimed or crowned as co-emperor. This left a legal vacuum, and <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> who would lead the Empire's government.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} in the orbit of HAT-P-33, which lies 1,367 light years away from Earth. Its {{discovery}} was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as {{with the discovery of}} similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E

Facing the uncertain future of Hong Kong and expiry of land lease of New Territories beyond 1997, Governor MacLehose <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Hong Kong's return to China in the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and {{the initial}} {{motivation}} for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as {{it was discovered that}} the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson would say that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 September Chamberlain left Heston Aerodrome (to the east of today's Heathrow Airport) for his third and final visit to Germany. On arrival in Munich the British {{delegation}} was taken directly to the Führerbau, where Daladier, Mussolini and Hitler soon arrived. The four leaders and their translators held an informal meeting; Hitler said {{that he intended to}} invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October. Mussolini distributed a proposal similar to Hitler's Bad Godesberg terms. In reality, the proposal had been drafted by German officials and transmitted to Rome the previous day. The draft was debated by the four leaders and Chamberlain <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens, but Hitler refused to consider this.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E

5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|His lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, felt Hess {{was too old}} {{and frail}} to have managed to kill himself. Wolf Rüdiger Hess {{repeatedly}} claimed {{that his father had}} been murdered by the British Secret Intelligence Service to prevent him from revealing information about British misconduct during the war. Abdallah Melaouhi, who served as Hess's medical orderly from 1982 to 1987, was dismissed from his position at his local district parliament's Immigration and Integration Advisory Council after he wrote a self-published book on a similar theme. According to an investigation by the British government in 1989, the available evidence did not back up the claim that Hess was murdered, and Solicitor General Sir Nicholas Lyell saw no grounds for further investigation. Moreover, the autopsy results support the conclusion that Hess had killed himself. A report released in 2012 again <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether Hess was murdered. Historian Peter Padfield claims the suicide note found on the body appears to have been written when Hess was hospitalised in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; {{but there would be}} no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that {{he would be able to}} correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not be available in the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough.|$|E

5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{the future of the}} remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E
