40|$|Conclusion - Problems of custody {{instrument}} The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is area of problems of custody instrument. This security instrument of procedural criminal law brings many problems {{especially in the}} area of its application and its performance. Nowadays this issue is considered to be greatly controversial which is obvious with regards to its grave breach of human rights. Custody also provides great space for existence of judicial errors due to <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> decision and contradictory interests of accused person and investigation authority. The topic of diploma thesis is divided into 4 chapters. The first chapter comprises development of criminal procedural law and related development of custody. This chapter provides general summary of the development of custody and it should introduce custody from the perspective of excursion into history of custody. The chapter also appoints to the most important phases of development of custody instrument. Following chapter contains facts about material custody law de lege lata. For first there is interpreted the term of custody instruments and assumptions for its application. This chapter also deal with the most important principles of custody and reasons of custody and its application. The end of this chapter focus on strengthened custody and [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We model a trader’s {{decision}} {{to supply liquidity}} by submitting limit orders or demand liquidity by submitting market orders in a limit order market. The best quotes and the execution probabilities and picking off risks of limit orders determine the price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> The price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> and the trader’s willingness to pay for immediacy determine the trader’s optimal order submission, with the trader’s willingness to pay for immediacy depending on the trader’s valuation for the stock. We estimate the execution probabilities and the picking off risks using a sample from the Vancouver Stock Exchange to compute the price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> The price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> changes with market conditions — a trader’s optimal order submission changes with market conditions. We combine the price <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> with the actual order submissions to estimate the unobserved arrival rates of traders {{and the distribution of}} the traders’ valuations. High realized stock volatility increases the arrival rate of traders and increases the number of value traders arriving — liquidity supply is more competitive after periods of high volatility. An increase in the spread decreases the arrival rate of traders and decreases the number of value traders arriving — liquidity supply is less competitive when the spread widens. discrete choice; high frequency data; limit orders; liquidity; market orders...|$|R

40|$|Responding to onto-theology, Eliot Deutsch proposes {{the idea}} of "knowing religiously," stating "religious {{knowledge}} doesn't so much have a distinctive or special object as it has a unique style or manner [...] . a reverential knowing that is centered in reality. " Based on the teachings of Chinese Chan and Tibetan Dzogchen, this dissertation builds upon Deutsch's premise to investigate the mechanism of 'im-mediate' knowing, or the logic <b>of</b> <b>immediacy,</b> in contemplation and philosophical expression. In particular, this dissertation shows that the meaning of one's being lies in spontaneous self-or-open awareness {{rather than in a}} highest being or transcendental divinity. Similar to Maurice Merleau-Ponty's "question-knowing," this open awareness has "an original manner of aiming at something," for it inspires one to embrace all but reify none. With this non-reifying-yet-all-embracing awareness, one's relationship with Being is embodied in a nondual dynamic, in which one unfolds being and knowing in wholeness. This holistic relationship is the insight derived from the logic <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> It also provides an alternative paradigm to explore the nature of religious knowledge. This dissertation also shows that the logic <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> does not reject nominal intermediaries. Rather, it employs them in specific ways so that immediacy is realized without the dualistic bondages and conceptual limitations implied by methods of mediation. As this understanding is seen via a contemplative perspective, it offers an alternative to the sociopolitical perspective in extending our reach beyond the sectarian and the historical so that we can better appreciate the nuances of the teachings and the values of religious developments. Since the complex set of theses regarding the experience and thematization <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> emerges over time and in conversation with thinkers from different quarters of the religious-philosophizing spectrum, the narration of this dissertation starts with an origin narrative and an exemplar of the logic <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> in Chan Following the footsteps of Chan monks westwards, it delves into the development and teachings of sTon mun, a tradition of encounter between Chinese Chan monks and Tibetan tantric practitioners. It concludes this tracing of the logic <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> with the early teachings of Dzogchen which emphasizes spontaneity...|$|R

40|$|Instructor immediacy has {{a direct}} {{positive}} association with students??? perceptions of instructor credibility, referent power, and likability in the classroom. These same variables are associated with increased affective learning. In addition, students prefer technology-enhanced communication. Based on this information, this study tested the hypothesis that different levels <b>of</b> computer-mediated <b>immediacy</b> (i. e., high, low, and none) {{would be associated with}} differences in perceived instructor credibility, perceived instructor referent power, and perceived instructor likability. Participants (N = 144) were drawn from three discussion sections of a lower division public speaking course from a university located in the Western United States. Data were collected over the course of one fall and one spring semester, consecutively. Teacher immediacy on Facebook was manipulated in two experimental groups, high immediacy and low immediacy, with a third group serving as a control. One-month after exposure to the Facebook pages, students in all three groups completed a questionnaire containing several self-report measures. Results indicate that contrary to what was predicted, different levels <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> communicated through Facebook had no impact on students??? perceptions <b>of</b> instructor <b>immediacy,</b> nor did it impact perceptions of instructor credibility, referent power, or likability. The {{results of this study suggest}} that instructors should maintain their focus on demonstrating immediacy in the classroom because in this study, adding Facebook to the face-to-face classroom environment to increase perceptions <b>of</b> instructor <b>immediacy</b> had no significant impact. Students across the three groups perceived the instructor as highly immediate, suggesting that the communication <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> that occurs in the classroom environment might wash out any potential benefits <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> communicated via social media.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} evidence <b>of</b> how <b>immediacy</b> affects consumer engagement behaviour in {{a social}} media setting. It answers the research question: Does immediacy influence consumer engagement behaviours with brands on Facebook? This research context is important and timely because of the rapidly increasing usage of social media by consumers and the resultant unexplored marketing challenges faced by brand managers. This thesis is informed by Social Impact Theory (SIT) (Latané, 1981), which proposes that immediacy is a determinant of influence in off-line environments. This study focuses upon three forms <b>of</b> <b>immediacy,</b> physical, social and temporal, that are identified within prior literature. This thesis measures the effect and develops SIT to account for immediacy as a social influence determinant of social media behaviour. The thesis follows a mixed method approach using focus groups and experimental design to measure the impact of each form <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> on four types of engagement behaviour: page liking, content liking, content sharing and content commenting. A series of three focus groups and three experimental studies were conducted {{with a total of}} 312 student participants who were presented with Facebook pages (created specifically for this study). Each Facebook page treatment was modified so that it contained either a high, low or neutral levels of each of the three types <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> identified in the literature and the subsequent change in participant engagement behaviour was measured. The results show that social immediacy significantly affects brand engagement intentions in terms of page liking, content liking and content sharing, whereas physical immediacy significantly affected page liking and content liking intentions. Temporal immediacy did not show any effects on the engagement intentions being measured in this thesis. This thesis presents three original contributions to knowledge. First, it makes a theoretical contribution by measuring the effects of three types <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> as social impact factors on engagement behaviours in social media. Second, it makes a contextual contribution by exploring how immediacy is perceived in the context of Fan pages, and by identifying other factors that can moderate the social impact <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> on consumer behaviour. Finally, this thesis measures the effects of product involvement, Facebook intensity usage and gender as moderators of social impact in social media settings...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{religion}} in philosophy {{and the human}} sciences have been focusing increasingly {{on the relationship between}} religion and media. In much of this work, a key concern has been to understand what constitutes mediation and, concomitantly, the lure <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> that drives some types of religiosity. In this essay, I link Alain Badiou's philosophy to this concern, examining in particular how his approach to number and appreciation for Saint Paul are fueled by a similar lure <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> To illustrate this claim, I juxtapose Badiou's work {{to the ways in which}} nineteenth-century British evangelicals (who had their own, distinct reverence for Paul) used numbers and statistics to imagine what we might understand today as a "global Christianity. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{his most}} "philosophical'' texts, Jorge Luis Borges paradoxically posits {{the act of}} reading as the scene of affectively "immediate" experience: his reader reads a reader reading (ad infinitum). This sort of hyper-meditated, {{specular}} imitation actually comes to mirror the substantive preoccupation of the "philosophical" text itself. Borges thereby breaks down what Theodor Adorno calls "concept fetishism'' by making mimesis his textual concept. Given Italo Calvino's claim for the novelty of "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" in relation to modern genres, I propose a two-fold thesis: first, that this typically Borgesian narrative juxtaposes concept and mimesis (a traditional philosophical antinomy) and then subverts the difference between them as a mediation <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> itself. He creates thereby a second-level "rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> " Borges thus arrives at a re-inscription {{of the kind of}} narrative technique upon which traditional texts, even texts that form a part of a sacred canon, operate. The drama and rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> exploited by Borges—and what is allegory, if not a "rhetorical drama''?—far from amounting to the last innovation of modem forms, as Calvino claims, might more accurately be called the oldest trick of presence in the book of absence...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{prospects of}} Japanese mobile telepresence robotics where small anthropomorphic devices {{are designed to}} act as intermediaries between remote interlocutors. First, an emic perspective of involved scientists and engineers is presented, focusing on example technologies being developed at the Hiroshi Ishiguro Lab in Kyoto (Japan), particularly a „cellphone-type tele-operated android [ [...] . ] transmitting human presence“ called Elfoid. It represents {{an attempt to get}} “behind the veil of the machine” (Sekiguchi/Inami/Tachi 2001, about their RobotPHONE prototype which uses a similar concept) in that it is supposed to act as a solid substitute for a dialog partner through evoking a feeling of presence (sonzaikan in Japanese philosophy, the feeling that someone is sharing the same physical space). 			In such undertakings, specific utopian ideals of communication become apparent. Paradoxically, the high-tech developments aim at constituting seemingly immediate interactions, preferably bypassing any potentially troublesome interface. The existence of a phantasm <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> (Bolter/Grusin 2000) {{can be traced back to}} decisive moments in media history and belongs to the central promises of new technological interfaces. Interestingly, the engineers’ statements reveal a latent technophobia, an ambition to overcome the limitations of physical devices altogether and to move on to more direct means of communicative exchange (including the mythical dimension of telepathy). 			Two questions are of particular concern: 			 1. On what different levels does the notion <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> operate? 			Not only does it refer to a spiritual ideal of unmediated communion, but it also influences practical decisions in interface design. “Natural” and “Tangible” User Interfaces are the result of a practice of disguise in that they mask their factual hypermediacy to allow for a seamless knotting up of real and mediated environments. 			 2. What is the relationship between media and the immediate? 			The concept <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> has so far been met with an almost univocal intellectualist disdain on the part of media theorists. The reason for this rejection is simple enough: If one takes ideas <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> serious, the self-image of a whole field of study is called into question. The paper thus attempts to provide a contribution to the question of how media build on notions <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> Any theoretical attempt at describing their operations should take into account the intricate relationship between media and the immediate...|$|R

Communication mediums that have {{the greatest amount of}} emotional cues and <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> feedback will be best to reduce conflict. [...] Increased emotional cues allow for better detection of negative affect, and greater displays of positive affect to counter any negative emotions. <b>Immediacy</b> <b>of</b> feedback relates to how quickly messages are transmitted via a particular communication medium, and the expectation for which they will be responded. [...] For example, instant messaging has a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> <b>of</b> feedback than email because instant messaging tends to result in much more synchronous communication than email. <b>Immediacy</b> <b>of</b> feedback allows individuals to detect and address frustration and other negative emotions more quickly. Furthermore, communication mediums that are more synchronous better allow for spontaneous comments, such as jokes, which are necessary for positive affect. [...] Increased positive affect helps to create positive interactions which reduce the likelihood of conflict.|$|R
40|$|Objectives This {{review is}} {{intended}} to 1) describe the construct <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> by analyzing how immediacy is used in social relational research and 2) discuss how immediacy behaviors {{can be incorporated into}} patient–provider interventions aimed at supporting patients’ medication management. Methods A literature search was conducted using Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Google Scholar, OVID, PubMed, and Education Resource Information Center (ERIC) EBSCO with the keyword “immediacy”. The literature was reviewed and used to describe historical conceptualizations, identify attributes, examine boundaries, and identify antecedents and consequences <b>of</b> <b>immediacy.</b> Results In total, 149 articles were reviewed, and six attributes <b>of</b> <b>immediacy</b> were identified. Immediacy is 1) reciprocal in nature and 2) reflected in the communicator’s attitude toward the receiver and the message, 3) conveys approachability, 4) respectfulness, 5) and connectedness between communicators, and 6) promotes receiver engagement. Immediacy is associated with affective learning, cognitive learning, greater recall, enhanced relationships, satisfaction, motivation, sharing, and perceptions of mutual value in social relationships. Conclusion Immediacy should be further investigated as an intervention component of patient–provider relationships and shared decision making in medication management. Practice implications In behavioral interventions involving relational interactions between interveners and participants, such as in medication management, the effects of communication behaviors and immediacy during intervention delivery should be investigated as an intervention component...|$|R
