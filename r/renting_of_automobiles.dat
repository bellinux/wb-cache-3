40|$|The {{longitudinal}} axis {{was an important}} feature <b>of</b> <b>automobile</b> which extraction had special significance in vehicle testing field. In {{order to meet the}} increased demand for automobile detection, the method <b>of</b> <b>automobile</b> {{longitudinal axis}} extraction using vision image processing technologies was studied. The basic two methods <b>of</b> <b>automobile</b> longitudinal axis technologies were introduced, including the method based on image processing and the way based on machine vision. The system total structure <b>of</b> <b>automobile</b> longitudinal axis extraction was designed which consisted of single camera, computer and tested automobile. After being preprocessed, the sub-pixel level corners <b>of</b> overhead <b>automobile</b> image were detected by Harris method and fitting interpolation for corner sub-domain. The symmetric corners were found by making use of modified normalized cross correlation based on pixel by pixel symmetry method and finally the automobile longitudinal axis was extracted. The system running showed that this method effectively realized the task <b>of</b> <b>automobile</b> axis extraction, which laid good foundation for later automobile detection...|$|R

The center axis detection method based on centroid method was proposed. The mass center <b>of</b> <b>automobile</b> outline was gotten based on the binary image. By detecting the nearest two points in the outline fitting line from the center, the center axis <b>of</b> <b>automobile</b> was gotten.
