25|$|This {{decline in}} waxcap grasslands has been mainly {{the result of}} {{agricultural}} improvement of pastures by ploughing and <b>reseeding,</b> by manuring, and {{by the use of}} fertilizers and other chemicals. In 1988, Arnolds estimated that only some 200 ha of unimproved waxcap grasslands remained in the Netherlands. As a result, both the grasslands and the larger fungi typical of such grasslands are of conservation concern, with the majority of species featuring in one or more national red lists of threatened fungi in Europe.|$|E

NJT installed new structural support beams {{on the west side of}} the depot, creating a new foundation for the depot, replacing walls, floors and gutters. The exterior was stuccoed. However, the unused service windows and general unkemptness persisted afterward.

25|$|Extensive logging of redwoods {{began in}} the early nineteenth century. The trees were felled by ax and saw onto beds of tree limbs and shrubs to cushion their fall. Stripped of their bark, the logs were transported to mills or {{waterways}} by oxen or horse. Loggers then burned the accumulated tree limbs, shrubs, and bark. The repeated fires favored secondary forests of primarily redwoods as redwood seedlings sprout readily in burned areas. The introduction of steam engines allowed logs to be dragged through long skid trails to nearby railroads, furthering the reach of loggers beyond the land nearby rivers previously used to transport trees. This method of harvesting, however, disturbed large amounts of soil, producing secondary-growth forests of species other than redwood such as Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western hemlock. After World War II, trucks and tractors gradually replaced steam engines, giving rise to two harvesting approaches: clearcutting and selection harvesting. Clearcutting involved felling all the trees in a particular area and was encouraged by tax law which exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested. Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and <b>reseeding.</b> This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock. Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.|$|E

500|$|Banksia grossa resprouts {{from its}} woody {{lignotuber}} after bushfire. Shrubs carry relatively low numbers of seeds compared with plant species that regenerate by seed after bushfire. A field study in Eneabba showed shrubs bore anywhere from 30 to 90 seeds per plant. Seeds borne on plants, however, {{are less likely}} to be eaten by animals than seed lying dormant in the soil, and hence survive to produce future seedlings. Populations of resprouting plants, like B.grossa, benefit more from longer intervals between fires as their stored seedbank takes longer to accumulate than <b>reseeding</b> species. [...] The follicles generally open after bushfire, releasing seeds which germinate after disturbance. Species with persistent flowers on old spikes often require higher temperatures for follicles to open after burning; laboratory testing resulted in 50% opening after exposure to 270°C and 90% after 400°C.|$|E

500|$|Once released, seed germinates at {{temperatures}} between [...] to optimise timing with autumn and winter rains and hence maximise chance of survival. Still, many seedlings die {{off in the}} hot and dry summer months. Seedling survival for the species is lower than for banksias which regenerate by seeding over time. Despite this, the longevity of mature plants allows for maintenance of population until favourable years enable better survival of young plants. As they mature, plants {{are less likely to}} perish, and estimated to live for 300years or more. Analyzing the seed bank and longitudinal results over fifteen years on the Eneabba sandplain showed that B.attenuata would become more abundant over time with fire intervals averaging between 6 and 20years, peaking with intervals around 10 to 12years, compared with longer intervals for the reseeders B.hookeriana and B.prionotes. Placed against its rivals, B.attenuata would be dominant between 8 and 10 or 11years, but at longer intervals is outcompeted by B.hookeriana. Variability in the timing between fires allows all three species to coexist. Exaggerated good and bad weather conditions favours B.attenuata over the <b>reseeding</b> species, which suffer more.|$|E
500|$|It is {{moderately}} serotinous, storing {{only one}} tenth {{the number of}} seeds in its seed bank as the <b>reseeding</b> B.hookeriana with which it coexists on sand dunes in scrub at Eneabba north of Perth. Even then, many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire, but instead after successive autumn rains. An experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of Banksia attenuata cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly immersions in water after being heated in a ring Bunsen flame to around [...] for two minutes. Cones that {{had been exposed to}} water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time; around 40% released at threeweeks, increasing steadily to almost 90% at tenweeks, compared with a series of controls (which were kept dry) of which fewer than 10% of seed released. Thus, the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter (instead of dryer summer), increasing the chance of survival. After the follicle is split, the seed and separator are exposed to the elements. The wings of the woody separator are hygroscopic, and move together when wet, and spread and curl apart when dry. The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand has, {{like other}} parts of the world, lost large areas of peatland; the latest {{estimates}} for wetland loss in New Zealand are 90% over 150 years. In some cases, better care is taken during the harvesting of Sphagnum to ensure enough moss is remaining to allow regrowth. An eight-year cycle is suggested, but some sites require a longer cycle of 11 to 32 years for full recovery of biomass, depending on factors including whether <b>reseeding</b> is done, light intensity, and the water table. This [...] "farming" [...] is based on a sustainable management program approved by New Zealand's Department of Conservation; it ensures the regeneration of the moss, while protecting the wildlife and the environment. Most harvesting in New Zealand swamps is done only using pitchforks without the use of heavy machinery. During transportation, helicopters are commonly employed to transfer the newly harvested moss from the swamp to the nearest road.|$|E

[...] Overall the park contains Laurentian Mixed Forest comprising both conifers and broadleafs. [...] Before European settlement the Brule River Valley would have been forested mostly with white pine. [...] Extensive logging and forest fires have altered the park's vegetation significantly, except around the rocky and inaccessible ridgetops. [...] Today's secondary forest is dominated by aspen and birch, with stands of white spruce, sugar maple, and basswood. [...] There are a few remnant stands of white pine on hilltops and ravines, especially along Gauthier Creek. [...] Large northern white cedars are abundant along the river. [...] Inland are many dense stands of white spruce, the result of planting and vigorous natural <b>reseeding</b> after the timber harvests. [...] Around the waterfalls, the constant mist creates a microclimate conducive to several plant species not found elsewhere in the park.|$|E
2500|$|A grassed {{waterway}} reduces {{soil erosion}} and captures most nutrients and pesticides {{that would normally}} wash out of crop fields and into major waters. These waterways help to carry surface water at a non-erosive velocity to an area where {{it will have a}} stable outlet. [...] Outlets must be adequate enough to allow water to drain without ponding or flooding the area being protected, while also preventing erosion of the water into the outlet which can be accomplished through the use of riprap. [...] A limitation is during large runoff events, when soil is saturated, grassed waterways will have a very concentrated flow of water making them not as effective during high rainfalls. Grassed waterways require very little maintenance once they are introduced with major upkeep being mowing of the grass and <b>reseeding.</b> Farm machinery and cattle can cross these waterways but it may be hazardous during wet periods. One of the major disadvantages of waterways are actually getting them established. A late summer or early fall seeding when rainfall is minimal is recommended to allow the seed to have the best chance at establishing a root system.|$|E
