40|$|Rotating {{machinery}} has a subtle, but {{profound impact}} on contemporary societies. Many modern achievements owe their existence to these machines, ranging from electrical power, cars, airplanes, to rockets. In these machines, <b>rotor</b> <b>unbalances</b> cause vibrations and stresses, decreasing their lifetime and leading to noise pollution. For decades, balancing and damping were the only methods to reduce these vibrations. The introduction of active magnetic bearings enabled new possibilities for rotor vibration reduction. Sophisticated control algorithms do not only allow for a reduction, but for a complete elimination of bearing forces caused by unbalances. Still, the existing methods suffer from drawbacks, including unclear behavior in rotor resonances, and poor stability. The invention of active bearings based on piezoactuators complicated the situation further: depending on the researcher’s background, contradicting methods are used for vibration reduction, resulting in an unclear and fragmented problem understanding. This work strives to resolve the apparent contradictions and drawbacks of the currently available methods to eliminate unbalances, generating a unified Problem solution for different active bearing technologies. After a careful Revision of the JEFFCOTT rotor, a new control approach is suggested. The latter does not only eliminate the <b>rotor’s</b> <b>unbalance</b> forces, but also the rotor’s resonance. The approach is extended to cover rotors with arbitrary mass, stiffness, damping and gyroscopic properties. A general, analytic solution indicates that the proposed control algorithm allows for a complete elimination of bearing forces and two rotor resonances. This is possible even when the rotor is attached to an arbitrary, flexible structure. The theoretical considerations allow for a derivation of control strategies for different actuator principles, technologies and arrangements, resulting in a consistent problem treatment and understanding. Actuator dimensioning Guidelines enable an effortless practical realization. This work introduces a new stability theorem for arbitrary mechanical Systems with collocated controllers. The theorem is subsequently applied to proof the controller’s superior stability properties, resulting in unconditional stability for general rotors...|$|R

Test performance with the original damper of length 5. 84 mm was marginal, with nonsynchronous whirling at the overhung seal test disk and high amplitude synchronous response above 32, 000 rpm near the drive spline section occurring. A system critical speed analysis of the drive system and the high-speed seal test rotor indicated that the first two critical speeds {{are associated with the}} seal test rotor. Nonlinear synchronous unbalance and time transient whirl studies were conducted on the seal test rotor with the original and extended damper lengths.

Fault detection and isolation are important features to ensure their reliable operation. This research work aims to achieve an integrated control and fault detection functionality with minimum number of components. Piezomaterials can be used both as sensors and actuators due to their inherent coupling between electrical and mechanical properties. In this thesis, piezoelectric actuators which are being researched for active vibration control on flexible rotors, are also used as sensors. These self-sensing actuators reconstruct their mechanical deflection from the measured voltage and current signals. The systems under investigation are a numerical aircraft engine model and its scaled representation in a rotor test bench. Since the actuators are mounted in rotor bearings, their displacement represent the bearing deflection directly. In this research work, the virtual sensor signals are utilised for model-based fault diagnosis in rotor systems, with focus on <b>unbalances</b> in <b>rotors.</b> <b>Unbalance</b> magnitude and phase were estimated in frequency domain using a parameter estimation method by least squares optimisation. The robustness of the estimates against signal outliers is improved by method of M-estimators. Identifying the fault location is also explored using the hypothesis of localization of faults. In simulation, models of both systems (aircraft engine and test bench) were used to detect unbalance faults. In the former system, the influence of actuator placements in fault detection ability is examined. The fault detection method is also validated at the real test bench, as a first step.
