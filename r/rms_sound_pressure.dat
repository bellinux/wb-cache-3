Understanding the effect of <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> on the acoustic properties of these materials is crucial when attempting to predict silencer performance. In this article, we experimentally investigate the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials at high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level. The effects of material parameters on the sound absorption characteristics of porous metal materials under high <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level are further explored experimentally.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a two-ring bubble curtain system in reducing underwater sound pressures during marine pile driving was assessed through underwater sound pressure measurements. This was conducted when the three 108 m long, 2. 4 m diameter cast in steel shell piles driven in 2000 {{as part of the}} PIDP, were restruck in December of 2002. During the measurements, the bubble curtain system was turned ON and OFF. The restrike involved driving the piles at refusal with the hammer at maximum energy (1, 600 to 1, 740 kilojoules). This condition is not anticipated during the east span SFOBB new east span construction. The reduction in sound pressures provided by the bubble curtain system ranged considerably. The direct reduction in sound pressures, which is evaluated by comparing bubble curtain ON and OFF measurements, for Piles 1 and 2 was 6 to 17 dB for peak pressures and 3 to 10 dB for <b>RMS</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels. Piles 1 and 2 were located next to each other. Reductions at Pile 3, which was in shallower water, were over 20 dB for both peak pressures and <b>RMS</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels on the north side. However, the reductions on the south side for Pile 3 were much less. Close to Pile 3 on the south side, the reductions were on the order of 5 to 7 dB. Further away at about 450 m south, the reductions were only about 2 dB. Uneven bottom topography around Pile 3, which could have compromised the bubble curtain performance near the bay bottom, is suspected to have resulted in the lower reductions to the south. It {{is important to note that}} overall sound pressures associated with Pile 3 were lower than those with Piles 1 and 2.

Dose–response functions demonstrated a robust relationship between received SPL and the probability of response and indicated rapid habituation to repetitive exposures with received SPL ≤ 160 dB.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} in part by a contract between BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and the University of California, Santa Barbara (E. F.), and by the North Slope Borough. Potential responses of marine mammals to anthropogenic underwater sound are usually assessed by researchers and regulators on the basis of exposure to a single, relatively loud sound source. However, marine mammals typically receive sounds from multiple, dynamic sources. We developed a method to aggregate modeled sounds from multiple sources and estimate the sound levels received by individuals. To illustrate the method, we modeled the sound fields of 9 sources associated with oil development and estimated the sound received over 47 d by a population of 10 000 simulated bowhead whales Balaena mysticetus on their annual migration through the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Empirical data were sufficient to parameterize simulations of the distribution of individual whales over time and their range of movement patterns. We ran 2 simulations to estimate the sound exposure history and distances traveled by bowhead whales: one in which they could change their movement paths (avert) in response to set levels of sound and one in which they could not avert. When animals could not avert, about 2 % of the simulated population was exposed to root mean square (<b>rms)</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels (SPL) ≥ 180 dB re 1 mu Pa, a level that regulators in the U. S. often associate with injury. When animals could avert from sound levels that regulators often associate with behavioral disturbance (rms SPL > 160 dB re 1   μPa), < 1 % of the simulated population was exposed to levels associated with injury. Nevertheless, many simulated bowhead whales received sound levels considerably above ambient throughout their migration.
