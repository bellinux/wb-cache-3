Low CL emission intensity is observed {{at the apex of}} V-shape pits due to the enhanced nonradiative recombination. Raman spectra show that there are higher carrier concentration and low strain in the pit in comparison to the flat region out of the pit. The strain relaxation may be the main mechanism of the V-shape pits formation on the GaN film surface. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The effects of different breach sizes and locations, and different failure pressures on the dispersion were studied, specifically by testing central holes, lateral holes, horizontal rips, and complete ripping of the bottom head. The experiments have shown, that lateral failures lead to smaller melt dispersal out of the <b>reactor</b> <b>pit</b> than failures in {{the central part of the}} lower head. With holes at the base of the bottom head, the most important parameters governing the dispersion of melt are the hole size and the burst pressure.

A cavity geometry with a direct path into the containment and one with a closed <b>reactor</b> <b>pit,</b> where the only flow path out of the pit is along the main cooling lines leading into reactor rooms, were investigated. Also, an experiment with nitrogen driven melt is compared to one with steam driven melt. With a closed <b>reactor</b> <b>pit,</b> {{there will be a}} considerable melt ejection into the pump and steam generator rooms, but almost nothing into the open space of the containment. The pressure increase will stay moderate and well below the design pressure of most containments. The comparison of two tests with and without steam, showed the strong effect of hydrogen production and combustion on both, the melt dispersal and the temperature and pressure load on the containment. This is important for the development of appropriate models to be incorporated in codes. 1...|$|E

40|$|The Argonne Fast Source Reactor is {{designed}} to operate at low power (nominally 1000 watts) to supply neutron fluxes, both fast and thermal, for laboratory experiments. It is built around a cylindrical core (with vertical axis) of solid, highly enriched uranium approximately 4 1 / 2 in. in diam. by 4 / 4 in. high. The blanket is of solid depleted uranium with a minimum thickness of eight in.; its outer form is cylindrical, 20 5 / 8 in. in diam. by 20 5 / 8 in. high. The reactor, contained in a shield of high density concrete of minimum thickness 4 1 / 2 ft, is freestanding {{on the floor of}} the reactor building. A graphite thermal column 4 x 4 x 6 ft is provided. All control and safety mechanisms are located in a pit beneath the reactor. The hazards associated with operation of the reactor have been analyzed. A number of potentially dangerous circumstances were studied to determine the probable severity of the resultant excursions. As an upper limit, a detailed study was made of the extreme case in which the reactor, overloaded by five kilograms of U/sup 235 /, goes critical at the air cylinder speed of 18 in. /min. It is estimated that the excursion would amount to 3. 6 x 10 /sup 17 / fissions. This is expected to destroy the core and eject all core material into the pit where it burns, greatly adding to the total energy of the excursion. No rupture of reactor shield or building is expected. The <b>reactor</b> <b>pit</b> and reactor building will be heavily contaminated and some radioactive material will escape from the building.

40|$|In the {{reporting}} period, the ISR performed 9 meetings and workshops with international participation. It is especially worth mentioning the workshop on 'Process Control and Condition Monitoring in Chemical Plants' that was {{conducted for the}} first time, and the concluding conference of the DFG Innovationskolleg 'Magneto-Hydrodynamics of Electrically Conducting Fluids'. At the ROCOM test facility (Rossendorf Coolant Mixing facility), a large series of experiments was performed dedicated to coolant mixing phenomena in PWRs during boron dilution and cold water transients. CFD models were validated against those experiments and a so called semi-analytical mixing model was developed. By coupling that semi-analytical model with the DYN 3 D reactor dynamics code it could be shown that a shut down reactor gets re-critical when a plug of 36 m" 3 deionated water enters the core after switching on the first main coolant pump. However, that deionated plug {{does not lead to}} non-allowed high coolant pressure or fuel temperatures. The behavior of a RPV lower callotte during a severe accident with melt slumping into the lower plenum is studied in 1 : 10 test at Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm. At the ISR computational methods were developed for pre- and post-test calculations of those experiments in order to predict the time and mode of RPV failure. The temperature, as well as location, and time of the RPV failure were found in good agreement with the experiment. Two patents resulted from those studies. One of them proposes a creep stool to mechanically support the RPV deformed by creeping, and the flooding of the <b>reactor</b> <b>pit</b> for ex vessel cooling of the melt inside the vessel. Such measures extend the time till RPV failure and offer the possibility for additional accident management procedures that can prevent the RPV meltthrough. The MHD department of ISR was especially successful in 2001. In the framework of the Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) initiative 'Innovative Gruenderlabore' they were granted an amount of 750, 000 DM to be able permanently to create the conditions for applied and market relevant developments that allow young scientists to found their own private technology business.

40|$|Concerning the {{mitigation}} of {{high pressure}} core melt scenarios, the design objective for future PWRS is to transfer high pressure core melt to low pressure core melt sequences, {{by means of}} pressure relief valves at the primary circuit, with such a discharge capacity to limit the pressure in the reactor coolant system to less than 20 bar. Studies have shown that in late in-vessel reflooding scenarios {{there may be a}} time window where the pressure is indeed in this range, at the moment of the reactor vessel rupture. It has to be verified that large quantities of corium released from the vessel after failure at pressures < 20 bar cannot be carried out of the <b>reactor</b> <b>pit,</b> because the melt collecting and cooling concept of future PWRs would be rendered useless. Existing experiments investigated the melt dispersal phenomena {{in the context of the}} DCH resolution for existing power plants in the USA, most of them having cavities with large instrument tunnels leading into subcompartments. For such designs, breaches with small cross sections at high vessel failure pressures had been studied. However, some present and future European PWRs have an annular cavity design without a large pathway out of the cavity other than through the narrow annular gap between the RPV and the cavity wall. Therefore, an experimental program was launched, focusing on the annular cavity design and low pressure vessel failure. The first part of the program comprises two experiments which were performed with thermite melt steam and a prototypic atmosphere in the containment in a scale 1 : 10. The initial pressure in the RPV-model was 11 and 15 bars, and the breach was a hole at the center of the lower head with a scaled diameter of 100 cm and 40 cm, respectively. The main results were: 78 % of melt mass were ejected out of the cavity with the large hole and 21 % with the small hole; the maximum pressures in the model containment were 6 bar and 4 bar, respectively. In the second part of the experimental program a detailed investigation of geometry effects is being carried out. The test facility DISCO-C has been built for performing dispersion experiments with cold simulant materials in a 1 / 18 scale.

40|$|The DISCO-H Test Facility at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe {{was set up}} {{to perform}} scaled {{experiments}} that simulate melt ejection scenarios under low system pressure in Severe Accidents in Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR). These experiments are designed to investigate the fluid-dynamic, thermal and chemical processes during melt ejection out of a breach in the lower head of a PWR pressure vessel at pressures below 2 MPa with an iron-alumina melt and steam. In the past, a detailed study of pressure and geometry effects on the fluid dynamics of the melt dispersion process had been performed with cold model fluids in the facility DISCO-C. The main components of the facility are scaled about 1 : 18 linearly to a large European pressurized water reactor. Standard test results are: pressure and temperature history in the RPV, the cavity, the reactor compartment and the containment, post test melt fractions in all locations with size distribution of the debris, video film in reactor compartment and containment (timing of melt flow and hydrogen burning), and pre-and post test gas analysis in the cavity and the containment. The results of six experiments are presented here. All experiments were done with 10. 6 kg of iron-alumina melt (scaling to 16 m" 3 corium), and a hole of 56 mm diameter (1 m scaled) or 28 mm {{at the center of the}} lower head. For comparison with a similar experiment conducted in a larger scale (1 : 10), the basis experiment was performed with an open path from the <b>reactor</b> <b>pit</b> to the containment (open pit), with prototypical conditions concerning the steam driven ejection out of the RPV, and a containment atmosphere, that was part air and part steam at an elevated pressure, with 3 mole-% hydrogen. In this and other tests, hydrogen production and combustion occurred. In one experiment the hydrogen effect was excluded by using only nitrogen as driving gas and a pure air atmosphere in the containment. In some tests the direct path to the containment was closed (closed pit). The pressure rise in the containment is highest with an open pit and hydrogen combustion. With a closed pit the gas and the debris have to flow first into the subcompartment and then through relatively small cross sections into the containment. Considerable less hydrogen was produced and burned in this case. In the test without steam, no hydrogen effect was present, but, with the direct path to the containment open, a large amount of debris was dispersed into the containment, and efficiently transferred heat to its atmosphere.

40|$|Considering {{the late}} in-vessel phase of an {{unlikely}} core melt down scenario {{in a light}} water reactor (LWR) {{with the formation of}} a corium pool in the lower head of the re-actor pressure vessel (RPV) the possible failure modes of the RPV and the time to failure have to be investigated to assess the possible loadings on the containment. In this work, an integral model was developed to describe the processes in the lower plenum of the RPV. Two principal model domains have to be distinguished: The temperature field within the melt and RPV is calculated with a thermodynamic model, while a mechanical model is used for the structural analysis of the vessel wall. In the introducing chapters a description is given of the considered accident scenario and the relevant analytical, experimental, and numerical investigations are discussed which were performed worldwide during the last three decades. Following, the occur-ring physical phenomena are analysed and the scaling differences are evaluated between the FOREVER-experiments and a prototypical scenario. The thermodynamic and the mechanical model can be coupled recursively {{to take into account the}} mutual influence. This approach not only allows to consider the tem-perature dependence of the material parameters and the thermally induced stress in the mechanical model, it also takes into account the response of the temperature field itself upon the changing vessel geometry. New approaches are applied in this work for the simulation of creep and damage. Using a creep data base, the application of single creep laws could be avoided which is especially advantageous if large temperature, stress, and strain ranges have to be covered. Based on experimental investigations, the creep data base has been de-veloped for an RPV-steel and has been validated against creep tests with different scalings and geometries. It can be stated, that the coupled model is able to exactly describe and predict the vessel deformation in the scaled integral FOREVER-tests. There are uncertainties concerning the time to failure which are related to inexactly known material parame-ters and boundary conditions. The main results of this work can be summarised as follows: Due to the thermody-namic behaviour of the large melt pool with internal heat sources, the upper third of the lower RPV head is exposed to the highest thermo-mechanical loads. This region is called hot focus. Contrary to that, the pole part of the lower head has a higher strength and therefore relocates almost vertically downwards under the combined thermal, weight and internal pressure load of the RPV. On the one hand, it will be possible by external flooding to retain the corium within the RPV even at increased pressures and even in reactors with high power (as e. g. KONVOI). On the other hand, there is no chance for melt retention in the considered scenario if neither internal nor external flooding of the RPV can be achieved. Two patents have been derived from the gained insights. Both are related to pas-sively working devices for accident mitigation: The first one is a support of the RPV lower head pole part. It reduces the maximum mechanical load in the highly stressed area of the hot focus. In this way, it can prevent failure or at least extend the time to failure of the vessel. The second device implements a passive accident mitigation measure by making use of the downward movement of the lower head. Through this, a valve or a flap can be opened to flood the <b>reactor</b> <b>pit</b> with water from a storage res-ervoir located at a higher position in the reactor building. With regard to future plant designs it can be stated - differing from former presump-tions - that an In-Vessel-Retention (IVR) of a molten core is possible within the reac-tor pressure vessel even for reactors with higher power...|$|E
