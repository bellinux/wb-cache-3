40|$|A {{stainless}} steel, Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) chamber, {{featuring a}} large vertical rectangular port (53 ”W by 16 ”H), has been fabricated {{to house the}} one-meter magnet assembly of a newly installed undulator insertion device for beamline X- 25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source. To achieve UHV, the new chamber {{is equipped with a}} differential ion pump, NEG pump, nude ion gauge, residual gas analyzer, and an all metal <b>roughing</b> <b>valve.</b> Temperature of the magnet assembly is maintained below 90 oC during vacuum bake. The large rectangular port cover is sealed to the main flange of the chamber using a one-piece flat aluminum gasket and special sealing surfaces developed exclusively by Nor-Cal Products, Inc. The large flange provides easy access to the gap of the installed magnet girders for in situ magnetic measurements and shimming. Special window ports were designed into the cover and chamber for manipulation of optical micrometers external to th...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{important}} components of the vacuum system are shown. At the left, the rectangular box is a sputter-ion pump inside its bake-out oven. The assembly in the centre includes a sector <b>valve,</b> three <b>roughing</b> <b>valves,</b> a turbomolecular pump, a rotary backing pump and auxiliary equipment. At the right, the small elbow houses a Bayard...|$|R
50|$|The White Plaxiphora Chiton {{reaches a}} common size of about 95 mm, {{with a minimum}} and maximum length of 40 - 100 mm and a width of 25 - 38 mm. The shell of this large chiton is dark green to brown, humped and oval shaped, with eight <b>rough</b> <b>valves.</b> Its girdle is leathery, brown with darker bars and with long bristles.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{mathematical}} modeling of axial piston pump through dividing the failure development of friction pair into lubrication, mixed lubrication and abrasion. Directing to the wedge-shaped oil film between cylinder block and valve plate, the support force distribution under the temperature variance was obtained. Considering the <b>rough</b> peak of <b>valve</b> plate, the contact load model is built under plastic deformation and elastic deformation and the corresponding wear volume is calculated. Computing {{the wear and tear}} along the counter-clockwise, the total amount of friction and wear can be calculated. Simulation and preliminary wear particle monitoring test indicates that proposed modeling and analysis can effectively reflect the real abrasion process of hydraulic piston pump...|$|R
