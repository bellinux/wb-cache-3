40|$|All server storage environments {{depend on}} disk arrays {{to satisfy their}} capacity, reliability, and {{availability}} requirements. In order to manage these storage systems efficiently, {{it is necessary to}} understand the behavior of disk arrays and predict their performance. We develop an analytical model that estimates mean performance measures of disk arrays under a synchronous I/O workload. Synchronous I/O requests are generated by jobs that each block while their request is serviced. Upon I/O service completion, a job may use other computer resources before issuing another I/O request. Our disk array model considers the effect of workload sequentiality, <b>read-ahead</b> <b>caching,</b> write-back caching, and other complex optimizations incorporated into most disk arrays. The model is validated against a mid-range disk-array for a variety of synthetic I/O workloads. The model is computationally simple and scales easily as the number of jobs issuing requests increases, making it potentially useful to performance engineers...|$|E
40|$|To address {{mass storage}} needs common to both DESY and Fermilab, a rate-adapting buffer cache is under development. The {{aim is to}} {{maximize}} utilization of limited tiary storage resources {{by the use of}} prefetching (<b>read-ahead)</b> and <b>caching</b> of files based on access statistics, as well as decoupling network transfer rate from tape I/O rate. A modular architecture allows cache capacity to be dynamically reconfigured by adding or removing ”cache pools”, as well as allowing the system to work with several different mass storage systems. PNFS is used to provide the underlying namespace and to store cache-related metadata...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{magnetic}} disks support advanced mechanisms, such as <b>read-ahead</b> and <b>caching,</b> {{to optimize}} disk access performance. However, {{most of the}} proposed disk models {{in the literature of}} multimedia storage systems are too simplified to include the advanced feature that result in inaccurate performance prediction. In this paper, we propose an accurate, detailed SCSI disk model customized for multimedia storage systems. The methodologies of extracting the parameters of the proposed model are presented. Disk throughput is analyzed and verified by experiments under various contexts. The model and methodologies proposed in the paper can benefit the design of multimedia storage system in many ways, such as performance prediction, file layout design and disk I/O scheduling policy. 1 1 Introduction Modern magnetic disks play a very important role in multimedia computing, such as file cache in a hierarchical multimedia storage system[7, 10], and storage for multimedia clips[6] and (long) continu [...] ...|$|R
