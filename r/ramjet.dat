5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a <b>ramjet</b> engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures {{for at least an hour}} and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a <b>ramjet</b> powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{noted for its}} visual style {{employing}} highly saturated colors and varying shapes. Jones {{was inspired by the}} limited-animated series Roger <b>Ramjet</b> and The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, which he felt employed good character design, cohesiveness, jokes, and timing. He credited The Problem Solverz as the first seamless use of Flash for television animation, with conceptualization and the end result occurring in the same program. Writing was the longest aspect of production, taking up to several months for the crew to conceive the story and draft a script. Animation was comparatively quicker, with the team delivering work in only a few weeks given the digital approach; Jones felt that the animators could to play to the strengths of the fully digital animation process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ramjets</b> {{differ from}} pulsejets, which use an {{intermittent}} combustion; <b>ramjets</b> employ a continuous combustion process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ramjets</b> are {{frequently}} confused with pulsejets, which use an intermittent combustion, but <b>ramjets</b> employ a continuous combustion process, {{and are a}} quite distinct type of jet engine.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} start the <b>ramjets,</b> a small 2 hp {{auxiliary}} power unit set the main rotor in motion. At a rotor-speed of 70 rpm, the <b>ramjets</b> were to be ignited.|$|R
5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its <b>ramjet</b> to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ramjet</b> engines {{differ in}} many ways from {{traditional}} gas turbine engines, {{but most of the}} same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle. This allows <b>ramjet</b> combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many <b>ramjet</b> combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some <b>ramjet</b> combustors are dump combustors rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors). That said, many <b>ramjet</b> combustors are also similar to traditional gas turbine combustors, such as the combustor in the <b>ramjet</b> used by the RIM-8 Talos missile, which used a can-type combustor.|$|E

50|$|René Leduc (1898-1968) was a French {{engineer}} who is much acclaimed {{for his work}} on <b>ramjets.</b> In 1949 he created the first aircraft to fly under the power of <b>ramjets</b> alone, the Leduc 0.10.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ramjets</b> made {{a complex}} engine and gear box unnecessary. Kromhout {{designed}} and built the <b>ramjets.</b> Each engine generated 20 kg thrust. The last models had an improved engine, built by Aviolanda, generating 23 kg thrust.|$|R
50|$|Scramjets are an {{evolution}} of <b>ramjets</b> that {{are able to}} operate at much higher speeds than any other kind of airbreathing engine. They share a similar structure with <b>ramjets,</b> being a specially shaped tube that compresses air with no moving parts through ram-air compression. Scramjets, however, operate with supersonic airflow through the entire engine. Thus, scramjets do not have the diffuser required by <b>ramjets</b> to slow the incoming airflow to subsonic speeds.|$|R
25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem is the removal of the turbine. The <b>ramjet</b> engine consists mostly of a large tube, and is relatively easy to air-cool by forcing extra air around the engine. Experimental <b>ramjet</b> aircraft of the era, like the Lockheed X-7, were reaching speeds as high as Mach4. There are numerous problems with the <b>ramjet</b> engine, however. Fuel economy, or thrust specific fuel consumption in aircraft terms, is extremely poor. This makes general operations like flying from one airbase to another expensive propositions. More problematic is the fact that ramjets rely on forward speed to compress the incoming air, and become efficient above Mach1.|$|E
25|$|The Škoda-Kauba Aircraft Industries, {{located in}} a suburb of Nazi-occupied Prague, {{designed}} the Sk P.14 as a single-seat monoplane powered by a Sänger <b>ramjet</b> engine. Since the <b>ramjet</b> had a diameter of 1.5 m and a length of 9.5 m, the massive engine and its tubular air-intake duct formed most of the fuselage structure. The cockpit had the pilot flying the aircraft in a prone position. Its landing gear was a retractable skid. In order to bring the <b>ramjet</b> to a speed where it would work, take off was by means of booster rockets fitted to a three-wheel detachable dolly. Only parts of the aircraft had been built when the project was terminated.|$|E
25|$|Studies of the rocket-ramjet and solid-fueled <b>ramjet</b> {{concepts}} {{began at}} the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Missile Test Center– later the Naval Missile Center– at Point Mugu, California in 1956, {{with the intent of}} increasing the range of small air-to-air missiles through using the combined <b>ramjet</b> and rocket propulsion system with solid fuels only. Following extensive ground testing, the concept was considered promising enough for a flight-test vehicle to be constructed to fully evaluate the new engine.|$|E

25|$|The Skoda-Kauba Sk P.14 {{project had}} two {{different}} variants. Both {{of them would}} be powered by a single Sänger <b>ramjet</b> that would give the aircraft a speed nearing 1000km/h.|$|E
25|$|A {{combustor}} is {{a component}} or {{area of a}} gas turbine, <b>ramjet,</b> or scramjet engine where combustion takes place. It {{is also known as}} a burner, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the combustor or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a <b>ramjet</b> or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.|$|E

25|$|The Gorgon V {{project was}} begun in 1950 {{to develop an}} air-to-surface missile capable of {{dispersing}} chemical warfare agents over a combat area. Designing of the missile was contracted to the Glenn L. Martin Company, which used the company's earlier PTV-N-2 Gorgon IV <b>ramjet</b> test missile {{as a basis for}} the weapon's design. The Gorgon V was to be a long slender missile, with swept wings and conventional tail. The Gorgon IV's <b>ramjet</b> engine, slung beneath the missile's tail, was replaced in the Gorgon V with a X14A aerosol generator, developed by the Edo Aircraft Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Power {{was to be}} {{provided}} by a Walter HWK rocket engine for takeoff, and two Pabst <b>ramjets.</b> The <b>ramjets</b> were located on {{the tips of the}} sharply swept tailplanes and would be used for cruising. The wings were swept at 45° and were mounted low in the fuselage. Armament was to have been two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon.|$|R

25|$|Earlier Chinese {{missiles}} of such capability {{from before}} the 1990s include the C-301 (also known as HY-3). With its four <b>ramjet</b> engines, it has a range of 130km and a speed greater than Mach 2.5. Though a success, the missile {{is far from being}} as potent as the SS-N-22, mainly because it can fly only at a higher cruise altitude of 50 m, rather than cruising at wave tops (such as the 20 m cruise altitude of SS-N-22), so it is easier to intercept in comparison to SS-N-22. the PLAN's air force has also purchased both the KH31 <b>ramjet</b> supersonic missile and the AS-20 turbojet subsonic anti-ship missile from Russia to arm its fighters.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, {{the design}} bureau headed by Pavel Tsybin started {{development}} of a <b>ramjet</b> powered supersonic strategic bomber, the RS. This design proved impracticable, and a smaller derivative, the 2RS was proposed, which would achieve intercontinental range by being air launched from a modified Tupolev Tu-95 bomber.|$|E
25|$|Engineer Eugen Sänger {{worked on}} this <b>ramjet</b> fighter project after his Silbervogel {{proposal}} for a suborbital glider to the Reich Air Ministry was rejected. The fighter was an approved project {{in line with the}} 1944 designs of the High Command of the Luftwaffe for basic interceptors.|$|E
50|$|Both the Army and USAF {{evaluated}} the five prototype Jet Jeeps. They {{proved to be}} rugged and durable vehicles with {{a top speed of}} 80 mph and a ceiling of 7,000 feet. Unfortunately, the pulse jets produced an unacceptable amount of noise and the drag of the engines in the event of power loss would prevent safe landings by autorotation. For these two reasons the Army found the pulse jet helicopters unsuitable as it had those with <b>ramjets.</b> Finally, cost considerations forced the cancellation of the program. The replacement of the XH-26's pulse jets with <b>ramjets</b> was suggested but never undertaken; however, the Hiller YH-32 Hornet helicopter was built using blade tip <b>ramjets.</b>|$|R
