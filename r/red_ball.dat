5|$|The daily {{rail and}} water <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> Express from Yokohama to Sasebo to Pusan began on July 23. By August it was {{operating}} with increased efficiency, demonstrating {{that it could}} promptly deliver any supplies available in Japan to Korea. On August 5, for example, it delivered 308tonnes; on August 9, 403tonnes; on August 22, 574tonnes; and on August 25, 949tonnes. The success of the <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> Express cut down the amount of airlift tonnage. This fell from 85tonnes on July 31 to 49tonnes on August 6. The express eliminated the need for nearly all airlift of supplies to Korea from Japan. It delivered supplies to Korea in an average time of 60–70 hours, while the airlift delivery varied from 12 hours to 5 days. The <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> delivery was not only more cost effective, it was more consistent and reliable.|$|E
5|$|Documentation {{indicated}} that the missing uranium {{had been sent to}} Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Boris Pash's command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a Geiger counter. When the needle jumped near some barrels, they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseilles, where Furman supervised their loading on a ship bound for the United States.|$|E
5|$|The drop in air {{delivery}} to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> Express and {{increased use of}} the airlift to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water-borne supplies in a timely manner. The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2½-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers.|$|E

5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Central to the UN {{defensive}} {{plan was}} to hold the port of Pusan, where vital ground supplies and reinforcements were arriving from Japan and the US. Pusan possessed airfields where US combat and cargo aircraft were streaming into Korea with more supplies. A system similar to the <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> Express in World War II was employed to get supplies from Pusan to the front lines. Hundreds of ships arrived in Pusan each month, starting with 230 in July and increasing steadily thereafter. On July 24, the UN established its highest command under General of the Army Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo, Japan. North Korean forces in the meantime were suffering from overextended supply lines which severely reduced their fighting capacity.|$|E
5|$|USS Kelvin, {{the ship}} Kirk's father serves on, {{is named after}} J.J. Abrams' grandfather, {{as well as the}} {{physicist}} and engineer Lord Kelvin (William Thomson). Kelvins captain, Richard Robau (Faran Tahir), is named after Orci's Cuban uncle: Orci theorized the fictional character was born in Cuba and grew up in the Middle East. Another reference to Abrams' previous works is Slusho, which Uhura orders at the bar where she meets Kirk. Abrams created the fictitious drink for Alias and it reappeared in viral marketing for Cloverfield. Its owner, Tagruato, is also from Cloverfield and appears on a building in San Francisco. The red matter in the film is {{in the shape of a}} <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> an Abrams motif dating back to the pilot of Alias.|$|E

5|$|The Alsos Mission now {{attempted}} {{to recover the}} shipment that {{had been sent to}} France. Documentation was discovered that said that part of it had been sent to Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Pash's command reached Toulouse on 1 October and inspected a French Army arsenal. They used a Geiger counter to find barrels containing 31 tons of the uranium from Belgium. Conrad persuaded Major General Frank S. Ross to release the U.S. 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company from the <b>Red</b> <b>Ball</b> Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were loaded on a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell into the water and had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that had been sent to Italy, which now rejoined them. The remaining 49 tons of the original shipment to France were never found.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls. Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} why the two distributions are different, we may consider the following extreme example: An urn contains one <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> with the weight 1000, and a thousand white balls each with the weight 1.

25|$|First we {{consider}} the Wallenius model. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is not taken in the first draw is 1000/2000 = ½. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is not taken in the second draw, {{under the condition that}} it was not taken in the first draw, is 999/1999 ≈ ½. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is not taken in the third draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first two draws, is 998/1998 ≈ ½. Continuing in this way, we can calculate that the probability of not taking the <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> in n draws is approximately 2−n as long as n is small compared to N. In other words, the probability of not taking a very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n in Wallenius’ model. The exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together.|$|E

25|$|Pink balls were {{developed}} in the 2000s to enable Tests and first-class matches played at night. The <b>red</b> <b>ball</b> is unsuited to night tests due to poor visibility, and the white ball is unsuited to first-class cricket because its rapid deterioration makes it unable {{to be used for}} eighty overs as specified in the rules, so the pink ball was designed to provide a satisfactory compromise on both issues. It is still considered more difficult to see than a white ball; and the leather is more heavily dyed than in a <b>red</b> <b>ball,</b> which better preserves its colour and visibility as it wears but also gives it slightly different wear characteristics. It has performed well enough in testing and first-class cricket to be approved for use in international cricket. A pink ball was used {{for the first time in}} an international match in July 2009 when the England Woman's team defeated Australia in a one-day match at Wormsley, and a pink ball was used in a day-night Test match for the first time in November 2015. Other colours were also experimented with, such as yellow and orange (glowing composite), for improved night visibility, but pink proved to be the preferred option.|$|E
