50|$|The main civil {{engineering}} challenge {{is that the}} current SNO vessel {{is supported by a}} series of ropes, to prevent the weight of the heavy water inside from sinking it in the surrounding normal water. The proposed liquid scintillator (linear alkyl benzene) is lighter than water, and must be held down instead, but still without blocking the view of its interior. The existing support <b>rope</b> <b>attachment</b> points, cast into the acrylic sphere's equator, are not suitable for upside-down use.|$|E
5000|$|Ludington and Griswold {{had formed}} Ludington-Griswold, Inc. in Saybrook, Connecticut, where a new {{building}} was erected for their research. They had left employment from the Gould Aeronautical Division after the Navy picked up the contract for the LNE-1 glider and production begun. Pratt-Read had won a contract from Materiel Division, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, to manufacture the Army Air Forces Waco CG-4A combat glider. The Ludington-Griswold company shifted their development work to improvements to the CG-4A. Roger Griswold developed a more aerodynamic nose section to replace the boxy and poorly protected cockpit section of the CG-4A with his own design known as the [...] "Griswold Nose." [...] This was fitted to a Pratt-Read glider and flown to Wright Field for evaluation and testing. The nose section {{was found to be}} more aerodynamic, used a tow <b>rope</b> <b>attachment</b> centered {{at the front of the}} nose (unlike the top of the nose attachment found on the CG-4A), and incorporate better protection for the pilots. Wright Field felt that adding the Griswold Nose to the present CG-4A glider would slow down production at a time when glider production was a priority. However, Materiel Division asked Ludington-Griswold to produce a simplified version of the pilot protection assembly and produce it as a bolt on kit to the front of the CG-4A nose section. This led to the development, testing, and production of the [...] "Ludington-Griswold Crash Protection Device" [...] which was manufactured in time to be installed on a number of the CG-4A gliders used in the Normandy D-Day invasion. Subsequent overseas gliders were also fitted with the device which many glider pilots credited in saving injuries and lives.|$|E
30|$|The actual {{height of}} the winch <b>rope</b> <b>attachment</b> on the tree stem, the {{magnetic}} bearing and distance between the vehicle winch and the tree, and the tension force on the load cell, were measured and {{used to calculate the}} horizontal force and bending moment acting on the tree during the stem bending. The bending moment due to the self-weight of the off-set stem and crown was not calculated in this study, due to the relatively small deflection angles of the tree from vertical.|$|E

60|$|With such {{energy was}} that strong man cannonading {{himself through the}} air that at each {{extremity}} of his increasing arc his body, standing in the swing, was almost horizontal. Should he once pass above {{the level of the}} <b>rope's</b> <b>attachment</b> he would be lost; the rope would slacken and he would fall vertically to a point as far below as he had gone above, and then the sudden tension of the rope would wrest it from his hands. All saw the peril--all cried out to him to desist, and gesticulated at him as, indistinct and with a noise like the rush of a cannon shot in flight, he swept past us through the lower reaches of his hideous oscillation. A woman standing at a little distance away fainted and fell unobserved. Men from the camp of a regiment near by ran in crowds to see, all shouting. Suddenly, as Thurston was on his upward curve, the shouts all ceased.|$|R

30|$|The stem bending {{was applied}} using an {{electric}} vehicle winch (EP 9.0, Superwinch, Inc., USA) with the tension {{force on the}} winch rope measured using a load cell (EMC 1000 kg S type tension load cell) that was graduated in 1 kg increments. The nominal height of the winch <b>rope</b> <b>attachment</b> on the tree stem was 75 % of tree height. Each stem was bent four times, twice {{in the direction of}} the prevailing wind (magnetic bearing 158 °), and then twice at 90 degrees to the prevailing wind (magnetic bearing 68 °). On each occasion, stems were bent to 30 or 40 % of the calculated stem failure load, held for five minutes, then slowly released. The stem bending was immediately repeated in the same direction.|$|E
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: This work {{covers the}} design, {{realization}} and validation of an autonomous load transportation system, utilizing several small size helicopters. The number of participating helicopters is configurable for the described system, {{depending on the}} requirements of the transported load. The presented models and controllers have been validated in computer simulation and flight experiments. Two non-linear models are presented: One model covers single-lift and one model covers dual- and multi-lift configurations. Simplified models are introduced beside the complex models, which are utilized for the translation controller design. A generic orientation controller is presented, which is applicable for the control of all presented slung load configurations. The utilization of this controller significantly simplifies the design of the translation controllers. The independence from the actual slung load configuration is achieved through measurement of the rope force vector in the <b>rope</b> <b>attachment</b> point, which is located on the helicopter fuselage. Three translation controllers are described: A controller for single-lift configurations, which allows the active compensation of load oscillations and a distributed controller for multi-lift configurations. A dual-lift translation controller is presented, which resembles a combination of single- and multi-lift translation controller. The presented controllers for dual- or multi-lift configurations do not utilize auxiliary constructs, like spreader-bars. The position of the load is estimated from the measured orientation of the rope, close to the helicopter fuselage. External disturbances, like wind gusts, are able to stimulate internal oscillations of the rope, which disturb the estimated load position. The internal motion of the rope as well as the influence of the used measurement device are analyzed and a flexible rope model is presented. Based on the results a load motion observer is developed and validated in several experiments. This load motion observer is essential for the safe operation of the slung load system, especially during bad weather conditions. The derived non-linear models of the system as well as the proposed controllers for single- and multi-lift configurations have been validated in flight experiments. The system has been proven to be operable even in presence of adverse weather conditions...|$|E
