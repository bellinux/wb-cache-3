However, the application of biochar to agricultural land must have few if any negative economic and environmental consequences if farmers are to readily adopt biochar as soil amendment. Biochar use as an organic amendment has been recently rising due to its positive effect on soil fertility, {{but there is still}} limited information available about longer-term effects, especially with regard to the effects on soil pollutant content and distribution. In a field-scale trial we investigated the effect of single doses of biochar (25 and 50 t ha- 1) and repeat-applications (two years later) of biochar (25 + 25 and 50 + 50 t ha- 1) on heavy metal (As, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni) content and distribution in soil, together with metal concentrations in plants (barley, beans) over <b>repeated</b> <b>cropping</b> cycles. Here we demonstrate that biochar produced from forest residues is of a low risk due to its inherently low metal content and the lack of observed negative effects on crop or soil quality. Although biochar did cause small changes in metal fractionation in soil, it did not alter total metal concentrations in soil or plants. We conclude that the application of wood-derived biochar does not increase the concentrations of metals in this soil, even after repeated applications, and could be safely used for agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) maize containing {{genes from}} the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) was cultivated on 29 % of the total maize production area worldwide in 2009. Most studies to date compare Bt- maize varieties with their near isogenic lines; however, there is little information on the variability of conventional maize breeding lines and how the effects of Bt varieties are ranked within. In our study on the potential risks of Bt- maize varieties, we analyzed tissue quality and compared the effects of ten conventional and GM maize varieties on soil microbiological properties in a replicated climate chamber experiment. All maize varieties were cultivated twice in the same soil microcosm. Shoot yields and soluble C in leaf tissue of Bt varieties were higher than the ones of non- Bt. Soil dehydrogenase activity was reduced by 5 % under Bt varieties compared to non- Bt, {{while most of the}} other soil microbial properties (soil microbial biomass, basal respiration) showed no significant differences between Bt and non- Bt varieties. The leaves and roots of one Bt variety were decomposed {{to a greater extent than}} the ones of its near isogenic line; the conventional breeding lines also showed higher values. Changes in crop and soil parameters were found when comparing the first and the second crops, but the effects of <b>repeated</b> <b>cropping</b> were the same for all tested varieties. For the studied parameters, the variation among non- Bt- maize varieties was similar to the difference between Bt and non- Bt varieties...|$|E

RFLP analysis confirmed that one type (designated T 2), unlike the other type (T 1), was associated more with barley than with triticale or wheat. RFLP analysis and other methods were also used to compare isolates of the take-all fungus from wheat seedlings grown in soil from first and second wheat crops. from wheat crops grown in longer sequences, and from oat crops grown as breaks from susceptible cereals. These provided samples from different stages of disease build up and decline in the take-all epidemic. Differences in frequencies of some characteristics were found at conventional significance levels (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05) : in a cereal sequence experiment at Rothamsted, U. K., isolates containing dsRNA were less frequent in T 2 isolates than T 1 isolates except in second wheats; perithecia were produced more abundantly on roots of wheat seedlings inoculated with T 1 isolates than with T 2 isolates, regardless of their origin. A weaker association (P less than or equal to 0. 1) was also found: T 2 isolates were often more frequent from second wheat crops, before take-all peaked in wheat sequences, than from other wheat crops or oats break crops. Collectively, the findings add only modest support to the controversial hypothesis that changes in the population of the take-all fungus occur during <b>repeated</b> <b>cropping</b> of wheat. The limitations of traditional sampling and assessment methods in such studies are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} independent {{reports of}} yield decreases in several agricultural {{systems that are}} associated with <b>repeated</b> <b>cropping</b> under wet or submerged soil conditions. Crop and soil data from most of these agroecosystems have led researchers to attribute yield decreases to a reduction in crop uptake of N mineralized from soil organic matter (SOM). These trends are most evident in several long-term field experiments on continuous lowland rice systems in the Philippines, but similar trends are evident in a continuous rice rotation in Arkansas, USA and with no-till cropping systems in North American regions with cool, wet climatic conditions in Spring. Soil analyses from some of these systems have found an accumulation of phenolic lignin compounds in SOM. Phenolic compounds covalently bind nitrogenous compounds into recalcitrant forms in laboratory conditions and occurrence of this chemical immobilization under field conditions would be consistent with field observations of reduced soil N supply. However, technological shortcomings have precluded its demonstration for naturally formed SOM. Through recent advances in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, agronomically significant quantities of lignin-bound N were found in a triple-cropped rice soil in the Philippines. A major research challenge is to demonstrate in the anaerobic agroecosystems that these lignin residues bind sufficient quantities of soil N to cause the observed yield decreases. A key objective will be to elucidate the cycling dynamics of lignin-bound N relative to the seasonal pattern of crop N demand. Anaerobic decomposition of crop residues may be the key feature of anaerobic cropping systems that promotes the accumulation of phenolic lignin residues and hence the covalent binding of soil N. Potential mitigation options include improved timing of applied N fertilizer, which has already been shown to reverse yield decreases in tropical rice, and aerobic decomposition of crop residues, which can be accomplished through field drainage or timing of tillage operations. Future research will evaluate whether aerobic decomposition promotes the formation of phenol-depleted SOM and greater in-season N mineralization, even when the soil is otherwise maintained under flooded conditions during the growing season...|$|E

After four lupin crops symptoms of root rot and wilt began in an inhomogeneous pattern over the field, and after another three lupin crops susceptible lupins are destroyed before flowering homogeneously over the field and caused total crop failure. The dominating pathogens isolated from diseased lupins with root rot and wilt symptoms in this field are in descending order F. oxisporum, F. solani, F. culmorum, and F. avenaceum, the latter only being isolated from young autumn sown plants. A core collection of lupin genotypes was studied for susceptibility in this field. Varieties from Poland and Australia were severely damaged by Fusarium wilt whereas varieties from Russia, Bellarussia, Germany and Denmark appeared to have almost normal growth with a good pod set. The genetic control of resistance to Fusarium root rot and wilt were studied in F 1, F 2 and F 3 hybrid populations between resistant and susceptible genotypes. F 1, and single pod descent F 2 and F 3 hybrid populations showed that wilt resistant genotypes have two dominant non-allelic resistance genes. We call this gene Relation to Fusarium oxisporum (Rfo 1,Rfo 2). Susceptible genotypes have either two wild genes (++ ++) or one wild and one dominant resistant gene (++ Rfo 2 Rfo 2, or Rfo 1 Rfo 1 ++). Crossing ‘++ Rfo 2 Rfo 2 ’ to ‘Rfo 1 Rfo 1 ++’ segregates in 9 : 7 resistant to susceptible in F 2, the same segregation was observed by crossing ‘Rfo 1 Rfo 1 Rfo 2 Rfo 2 ’ to ‘++ ++’. Segregation pattern in F 1, F 2 and F 3 populations revealed three non-allelic dominant resistance genes to Fusarium root rot. Genotypes possessing 2 of these 3 genes are resistant. The presence of 3 non-allelic resistance genes gives the option in future to create varieties with 3 resistance genes, which might increase {{the stability of the}} Fusarium resistance compared to genotypes only possessing 2 of the 3 resistance genes. It is recommended to breed Fusarium root rot and wilt resistant varieties to avoid problems in new lupin growing areas despite resistant varieties can be grown in the first years. ...|$|E

The economy of the Prairie Provinces, and much of Canada, was dependent on the success of wheat farming. Wheat had been a staple crop for the Volga Germans in Russia, and translated well to the climate of the Canadian West. <b>Repeated</b> <b>crop</b> failures meant a large influx of the German-Russian population into larger cities and towns, a fact that would contribute to the gradual decline of their culturally homogeneous communities.

40|$|Pedosphere, {{biosphere}} {{and atmosphere}} form a complex system with strong interactions. Small scale variability in one sphere will find its counterpart in another. In an agricultural context, soil textural heterogeneity within a field {{will result in}} spatially variable crop growth and yield responses. Although often reported this relationship has rarely been quantified under field conditions. To study the interactions of the soil-crop response system we carried out geophysical and plant physiological measurements at three agricultural fields with high texture variability for winter wheat and sugar beet in the Western part of Germany. We also tested whether observed spatial patterns in crop growth and yield can be reproduced by a crop model (GECROS). We used electromagnetic induction measurements (EMI) indicating the apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) to reveal spatial differences in soil texture. According to the respective patterns of ECa <b>repeated</b> <b>crop</b> measurements of leaf area index, crop dry matter and yield were taken. Using linear regression we found moderate to high correlations between crop measurements and ECa (R 2 0. 39 – 0. 89). We conclude that these statistical relationships are controlled by variabilities in clay content and hence are a function of soil water holding capacity and nutrient distribution. For evaluating the crop growth model GECROS we used the soil-related information as input. Since this model comprises a detailed, dynamic photosynthesis part we evaluated it for individual processes, for instance the daily CO 2 and H 20 fluxes {{as well as the}} organ-specific biomass growth and LAI. When initially applied the model was not able to reproduce the spatial differences in measured crop data. Replacing its soil routines with a more advanced soil model (SLIM) improved the simulation results noticeably. The simulation results of winter wheat were closer to the measured than those of sugar beet which is likely due to a larger growth variability of sugar beet.

We obtained the followings results. (1) The 1870 s saw a new rice-cultivating technology being introduced and spread in the Tsugaru district. This technological improvement realized labor savings in rice production in peasant households and also led to improvements in land productivity. However, the harvest was not sufficient enough to stabilize the peasant householdsf economy because of the poor condition of the land and <b>repeated</b> <b>crop</b> failures. As such, by the 1900 s, peasant households also began producing commercial goods as a side-business to offset the risks of agriculture and to acquire extra cash. (2) In Tsugaru, one of the side-businesses peasant households engaged in was straw craft manufacturing. However, by the 1920 s, the Aomori Prefecture had lost its competitive advantage to the Hokkaido market in the Kinki district. On the other hand, apple production increased in Tsugaru. Further, apple was designated as a competitive commercial product by the Meiji Government, who then was importing apples in significant quantities from the western countries. (3) In this paper, effective insect/pest-control was found {{to be one of the}} important reasons why Tsugaru became the largest apple producer. In particular, the Aomori Prefectural Agriculture Research Center played an important role in the development and diffusion of scientific technologies. Additionally, since the 1870 s, Tsugaru was blessed with effective institutions that halted the spread of disease and reduced insect damage. This might have enabled the quick penetration of technologies. (4) In the expansionary phase of apple production, peasant households reduced the amount of labor they invested in rice production and weed eradication, and concentrated heavily on apple production. This labor-intensive apple production realized not only savings in employment costs but also mass production with high quality. As a result, apple production contributed heavily to the stabilization of the householdsf economy. Japanese Economic History, Agricultural Development, Peasant HouseholdCLabor Allocation...|$|R

This difference was not easily explainable but might be ascribed to the compaction of the topsoil due to <b>repeated</b> ploughing for <b>cropping</b> practices (Agoumé and Birang 2009). In general, higher BD might be ascribed to the higher clay content and compaction due to <b>repeated</b> ploughing and <b>cropping</b> practices for a long time. The significant decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity values towards greater depths of soil profile for each site under different cropping systems indicated the greater clay contents in lower depths of soils. Among all sites, Ks values were lower in the sites 3 and 4 having higher clay content in rice-sugarcane crop rotation. The difference and the trends are in conformity with the sand and clay contents. The results are {{in agreement with the}} research findings of McBratney et al. (2002), Santra and Das (2008) and Wösten et al. (2001). Of course, the aggregate size also determines the water transport in soils (Sławiñski et al. 2011). Water retention at field capacity and permanent wilting point increased significantly with the increase in soil depth for every site. The reasons and underlying factors for difference in PWP values were mostly governed by the difference in clay contents. Available water capacity was greater at sites 3, 4 in the rice-sugarcane system. Basically, it was the clay fractions in the soils of different sites which determined the higher FC, and in turn the higher AWC of soils. The available water capacity was also related to the soil organic matter content of soils as was evident from higher SOC values. Our results match with the finding of Gol (2009).|$|R

The expenses {{involved in the}} change of domains from distant Shimabara meant that the Matsudaira had to press for increased taxes, which led to several peasant revolts, {{which had to be}} suppressed by military force. To add to their woes, Utsunomiya town also suffered from repeated fires, which caused yet more damage and economic issues. Matsudaira Tadahiro was transferred back to Shimabara in 1774, trading places again with the Toda clan.|$|R
