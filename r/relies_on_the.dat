5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> claimant having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{component}} of Röyksopp's song repertoire <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{use of multiple}} lead vocalists. For instance, Melody A.M. features the vocal talents of Anneli Drecker and Erlend Øye, The Understanding features Kate Havnevik, Chelonis R. Jones, and Karin Dreijer Andersson, and Junior features Robyn, Anneli Drecker, Karin Dreijer Andersson, and Lykke Li.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> combination of the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.|$|E
5|$|Jürgen von Beckerath is less {{assertive}} about Sheshi's {{identity and}} assigns {{him to his}} combined 15th/16th Dynasty, where he regroups Hyksos rulers whose chronological position is uncertain together with kings whom he sees as vassals of the Hyksos. Von Beckerath's analysis <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis that Manetho's 16th Dynasty comprised minor rulers of the Nile Delta region, called lesser Hyksos, who served the great Hyksos kings of the 15th Dynasty such as Khyan and Apophis.|$|E

5|$|Lacking Havok, Euphoria, and DMM, Krome's Wii version <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> company's {{in-house}} physics engine. Some character animations may be ragdoll {{while others}} are preset; in developing the game, Krome tried to blur {{the distinction between the}} two. The lighting system in the Wii version is more advanced than that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E
5|$|Michaelis–Menten {{kinetics}} <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> law of mass action, {{which is}} derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.|$|E

Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snow shoeing, and snowmobiling.

5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is an ambush predator that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision is of little importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E

5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E

5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> very {{high rate of}} nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roadway {{itself to}} absorb stresses, the suspension cables {{could not be}} installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{buildings}} from Basin's heyday form much of {{the core}} of the CDP's small business district, which includes a fire station, a post office, two restaurants, a bar, a commercial gallery, small specialty shops. Basin has a small elementary school, its own water system, and a low-power radio station. Local volunteers and elected trustees provide limited services to the settlement, but it <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government of Jefferson County, Montana, for law enforcement and other services. From 1993 through 2011 Basin was home to the Montana Artists Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E
