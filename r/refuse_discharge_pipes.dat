As Fenella cleared to the southeast of Douglas Bay she developed problems with her <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe,</b> {{as a consequence of}} the condenser being choked. Fenella had been moored in the outer harbour at Douglas the previous night, and <b>refuse</b> <b>discharges</b> from a hopper barge had been washed up by the incoming tide, choking the pipe.

A safety device called a temperature and pressure relief (T&P or TPR) valve, is normally fitted {{on the top}} of the water heater to dump water if the temperature or pressure becomes too high. Most plumbing codes require that a <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> be connected to the valve to direct the flow of discharged hot water to a drain, typically a nearby floor drain, or outside the living space.

30|$|The use of porous ducts {{to deliver}} water to {{agricultural}} fields {{is an old}} technique which helps saving water and prevents ground erosion. Designing porous duct is not as a simple task as it looks and apparently {{has never been the}} subject of mathematical research. Here the problem is addressed making use of a double rescaling of space and velocity variables, which allows the derivation of the governing equations starting from the study of the classical Navier Stokes equations in a pipe. Such equations are then solved obtaining results of practical interest in design of irrigation pipes, both for low <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> (small plants) and for high <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> (large plants).|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The transport of solids in "horizontal" above ground drainage pipes {{was the subject of}} an investigation aimed at establishing a method for the design of deposit free drainage systems. Tests were based on the measurement of solid velocity in a <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> of variable gradient, the solid being a maternity pad either with or without three paper towels. A test rig capable of supporting <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> of various materials, enabling the incorporation of bends and junctions, was employed and an instrumentation method for measuring solid velocity, depth of flow and rate of flow was developed. Results showed that solid velocity in straight <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> can be characterized by three separate zones of flow, the second zone being the most fundamental, with solid velocity defined by an equation of the form V = (C 1 -C 2) *Sqrt(L/G), where C 1 and C 2 are empirical coefficients, L is the distance travelled from the w. c. discharge and G is the pipe gradient. The limits of the flow zones can be defined by values of Sqrt(L/G), the larger limit defining the maximum length of deposit free <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> at any gradient. The effect of pipe fittings on the velocity of the solid can be represented by a sharp velocity reduction followed by a gradual velocity regain and may be ignored as long as the pipe fitting is positioned approximately 5 metres {{before the end of the}} second flow zone conditions, as defined by a value of Sqrt(L/G), thus allowing sufficient length for the velocity to regain its straight pipe characteristic value. A design method is presented, based on the experimental data collected, which in its present form can be applied to check for the possible deposition of Solids within the "horizontal" <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> system, either due to traversing excessive lengths of horizontal pipework or as a result of bend or junction positioning.

40|$|In {{nitrogen}} drilling, entrained sand {{particles in}} the gas flow may cause erosive wear on metal surfaces and {{have a significant effect}} on the operational life of discharge pipelines, especially for elbows. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based code FLUENT is carried out to investigate the flow erosion on a sand <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> in conjunction with an erosion model. The motion of the continuum phase is captured based on solving the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, while the kinematics and trajectory of the sand particles are evaluated by the discrete phase model (DPM). The flow field has been examined in terms of pressure, velocity, and erosion rate profiles along the flow path in the bend of the simulated <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe.</b> Effects of flow parameters such as inlet velocity, sandy volume fraction, and particle diameter and structure parameters such as pipe diameter and bend curvature are analyzed based on a series of numerical simulations. The results show that small pipe diameter or small bend curvature leads to serious erosion, while slow flow, little sandy volume fraction, and small particle diameter can weaken erosion. The results obtained from the present work provide useful guidance to practical operation and <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> design...|$|R

50|$|An airlift pump is a pump {{that has}} low suction and {{moderate}} discharge of liquid and entrained solids. The pump injects compressed {{air at the}} bottom of the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> which is immersed in the liquid. The compressed air mixes with the liquid causing the air-water mixture to be less dense than the rest of the liquid around it and therefore is displaced upwards through the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> by the surrounding liquid of higher density. Solids may be entrained in the flow and if small enough to fit through the <b>pipe,</b> will be <b>discharged</b> with the rest of the flow at a shallower depth or above the surface. Airlift pumps are widely used in aquaculture to pump, circulate and aerate water in closed, recirculating systems and ponds. Other applications include dredging, underwater archaeology, salvage operations and collection of scientific specimens.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{acoustic}} resonance and volute geometry on phase resonance are studied theoretically and experimentally using a centrifugal fan. One dimensional theoretical model is developed taking {{account of the}} reflection from the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> end. It {{was found that the}} phase resonance occurs, even with the effects of acoustic resonance, when the rotational speed of rotor-stator interaction pattern agrees with the sound velocity. This was confirmed by experiments with and without a silencer at the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> exit. The pressure wave measurements showed that there are certain effects of the cross-sectional area change of the volute which is neglected in the one dimensional model. To clarify the effects of area change, experiments were carried out by using a ring volute with a constant area. It was demonstrated that the phase resonance occurs for both interaction modes travelling towards/away from the volute. The amplitude of travelling wave grows towards the volute exit for the modes rotating towards the volute exit, {{in the same direction as}} the impeller.
