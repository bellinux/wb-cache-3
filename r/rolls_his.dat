25|$|Breckinridge's {{previous}} stage experience convinced Wood to {{cast him}} as the alien ruler who oversees an attempt {{to take over the}} Earth using an army of reanimated corpses. Indeed, his background {{made him one of the}} few truly experienced actors in the entire cast. Dressed in a pajama-like outfit which is curiously less ornate than those worn by his underlings, he sports very visible mascara and lipstick, and constantly <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> eyes and mugs for the camera.|$|E
25|$|Like other ecclesiastical {{lawyers and}} civil {{servants}} {{of the day}} Chichele was paid with ecclesiastical preferments. On 13 April 1396, he obtained ratification of the parsonage of St Stephen's, Walbrook, presented on 30 March by the abbot of Colchester, no doubt through his brother Robert, who restored the church and increased its endowment. In 1397 he was made archdeacon of Dorset by Richard Mitford, bishop of Salisbury, but litigation was still going on {{about it in the}} papal court until 27 June 1399, when the pope extinguished the suit, imposing perpetual silence on Nicholas Bubwith, master of the <b>rolls,</b> <b>his</b> opponent. In the first year of Henry IV Chicheley was parson of Sherston, Wiltshire, and prebendary of Nantgwyly in the college of Abergwilly, Wales; on 23 February 1401/2, now called doctor of laws, he was pardoned for bringing in, and allowed to use, a bull of the pope providing to him the chancellorship of Salisbury Cathedral, and canonries in the nuns' churches of Shaftesbury and Wilton in that diocese; and on 9 January 1402/3 he was archdeacon of Salisbury.|$|E
500|$|But Charles Stinson of the Los Angeles Times was notably unimpressed by the film: [...] "The uncredited [...] {{scenario}} violates Poe's gothic {{style with}} passages of flat, modernized dialogue…But the [...] {{of the script}} pale beside the acting…Price mugs, <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> eyes continuously, and delivers his lines in such an unctuous tone that he comes near to burlesquing the role. His mad scenes are just ludicrous. The audience almost died laughing." ...|$|E

500|$|In Halo Wars, set 20 {{years before}} Halo: Combat Evolved, a second Arbiter is shown, {{possibly}} {{as the last}} to wear the armor before the more recognized character. He {{is described as a}} [...] "mean guy," [...] lead designer David Pottinger comparing him to Darth Vader. The second Arbiter is the main antagonist of Halo Wars. He leads the Covenant to the fleet of Forerunner ships as well as capturing Ellen Anders in order to do so. After a fight he is killed by Sergeant Forge and a Spartan <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> body off a cliff. This particular Arbiter is voiced by David Sobolov.|$|E
500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of [...] "Solitudes", a joke was played on Richard Dean Anderson. Whilst filming, when O'Neill asks how Carter is getting along with unearthing the Stargate's DHD, Carter starts ranting at O'Neill for being completely [...] "MacUseless" [...] even though he spent seven years on MacGyver, referring to Richard Dean Anderson's role in both shows. The prank was organized by Tapping {{in cooperation with the}} director. Similarly, in the first episode, [...] "Children of the Gods" [...] Carter speaks of [...] "MacGyvering" [...] the Stargate into operation while O'Neill <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> eyes. The 2009 DVD version of this episode does not contain the MacGyver reference. [...] "Politics" [...] contains a scene that references uploading a virus to an alien mothership, alluding that the solution to the movie Independence Day will not work in this situation. [...] "Within the Serpent's Grasp" [...] contains the only scene produced especially for Showtime, not shown on the syndicated versions. When seeing a floating metal ball, Teal'c explains [...] "It is a Goa'uld long-range visual communication device, somewhat like your television, only much further advanced." [...] In the Showtime version, O'Neill says [...] "Think it gets Showtime?" [...] While this scene remains in the DVD versions of the episode, syndication runs have O'Neill instead saying, [...] "Hmm....Goa'uld TV..." [...] (in a manner similar to that of Homer Simpson) ...|$|E

500|$|Moon founded The Washington Times in Washington D.C. {{as a part}} of his {{international}} media conglomerate News World Communications in the same year Inchon was released. According to The Times rival The Washington Post, a full-length two and a half page version of a film review of Inchon written by critic Scott Sublett that was originally planned for the September 16, 1982 issue of The Times was killed by the newspaper's publisher and editor James R. Whelan. Whelan told Sublett that The Times had a conflict of interest with regard to reviewing Inchon, and would not print his review. Instead, The Times printed a one-paragraph critical synopsis of the film, also written by Sublett, which said in full: [...] "Puerile dialogue, perfunctory acting and haphazard construction doom from the start this visually impressive would-be epic about love and dead Reds in wartime Korea. Olivier (in a performance that is the nadir of his career) joshes, minces and <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> eyes absurdly as Doug MacArthur. The script, by Robin Moore, is pure twaddle [...] a cross between South Pacific and The Green Berets." [...] Moore {{is the author of the}} novel The Green Berets, upon which the 1968 movie was based. On Monday the 21st The Times ran The New York Times review of the film. Reviewers Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert selected the film as one of the worst of the year in a 1982 episode of their program Sneak Previews.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore and {{his wife}} both {{appeared}} in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy Midnight, her only film role. The New York Times thought the film was [...] "one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season" [...] and that Barrymore, [...] "the [...] Gehrig of eye-brow batting, <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> phrases with his usual richly humorous effect". The film {{was inducted into the}} National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore {{and his wife}} appeared together in the stage farce My Dear Children, which opened in March 1939 at Princeton University's McCarter Theatre. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been. Because of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. Life magazine wrote that [...] "People flock to see , not for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight. Usually he forgets his lines. But he always puts on a great show." [...] When the show reached Broadway, Life wrote that [...] "Barrymore's return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph". Brooks Atkinson, writing for The New York Times thought that Barrymore was [...] "still the most gifted actor in this country.... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody's fool in My Dear Children but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday." [...] Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play's run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.|$|E
2500|$|There is meta-humor in this strip; for example, the {{characters}} talk with their mouths closed. Their dialogue has many exclamation points {{when they talk}} quietly or nicely like the dialogue in Peanuts. Also, in some strips, there are repeated drawings and lines (i.e. in the May 21, 2008 strip, Buckles steps back from a harmless garter snake, horrified.
