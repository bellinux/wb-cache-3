The next update was in 2009 and brought RoHS compatibility, increased backplane speed (5Tbit/s, up from 4Tbit/s) and 1Gbit/s Onboard Administrator connectivity. Fourth version - c7000 Platinum {{was announced in}} February 2013. It features location discovery services, thermal discovery services and redesigned backplane. The new backplane increased aggregate bandwidth 40% from 5 to 7 Tbit/s to allow use newest high-speed interconnect modules (such as 16Gbit/s FC and 56Gbit/s FDR InfiniBand). Also the new Platinum Plus <b>rating</b> <b>power</b> supplies were announced with higher efficiency than previous Gold Plus <b>rating</b> <b>power</b> supplies.|$|E

50|$|This year’s Tourist Trophy {{could come}} up with a sport {{historical}} particularity. Similar to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the handicap index rating was extended in the TT. In this <b>rating,</b> <b>power</b> and engine capacity of the vehicle in relation to the weight were set. This led to a handicap for large-displacement vehicles. This index score was extended parallel to the overall rating. Although the overall standings was used for the World Sportscar Championship, the index score was used to the decide the outcome of the Tourist Trophy. Thus this was won by the small D.B. HBR Panhard by Paul Armagnac and Gérard Laureau , who finished only 21st place in the overall standings. Having won the scratch race, Ferrari gained the necessary points advance over Lancia to take the World Championship for Manufacturers title for the second season in a row, with one round remaining in Mexico. Should Ferrari win the 1954 Carrera Panamericana, they would have the maximum score available due to have the points are awarded, as only the best 4 results out of the 7 races could be retained by each manufacturer.|$|E

The load {{rotational}} {{moment and}} power of a centrifuge with rotational arms (CWRA) consist of aerodynamic, inertial and frictional rotational moments and related powers, respectively. The chosen electromotor based on previous calculations cannot accurately provide proper moment and power for dynamic CWRAs. In this paper, the maximum load rotational moment and maximum load power of a CWRA were formulated, a method to calculate the <b>rating</b> <b>power</b> of its driving electromotor was suggested, and an analytical computational example was performed.

High-spending authorities, as assessed in accordance with current and historic data, are given annual rate limits by central government, with rights of appeal and negotiation.

30|$|In {{the grid}} topology, the total energy {{consumption}} {{depends on the}} routing combination from the lowest tier to the highest tier. Since we suppose that all the sensor nodes send signals with the same <b>rating</b> <b>power</b> level (133 [*]dB), the lowest energy consumption is obtained if the beeline paths are used in all the tiers (refer to Figures 14 (a) and 14 (b)), and the highest one is obtained when biased pathes are used in each tier (refer to Figures 14 (c) and 14 (d)). If the routing combination is a hybrid of beeline and biased pathes, the energy consumption is between the minimum and the maximum.|$|E

40|$|First order {{predictions}} {{were made}} in determining the effects of various sources of inefficiency in rowing on shell speed. These predictions were then tested using a MATLAB model of the rowing stroke. The model simulates an eight man oared rowing shell and determines average shell speed, stroke <b>rating,</b> <b>power</b> per stroke, and time over a 2000 meter race. Several parameters of the rowing model are manipulated {{to determine the effects}} of each source of inefficiency on shell speed. Of the sources tested, three can be attributed to the shell manufacturer, and the others can be attributed to the rowers themselves. The sources of inefficiency tested are wetted surface area, coefficient of friction, dynamic and static weight, stroke length, slide acceleration, and stroke rating. The effects on shell velocity were normalized to determine which sources resulted in the greatest inefficiencies. The ranking of sources from greatest to smallest effect on shell speed are stroke rating, coefficient of friction, wetted surface area, stroke length, static weight, dynamic weight, and slide acceleration. by Stephen F.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that calculates flicker levels for induction motors depending on their starting operation mode. The GUI implements a standardized method of calculating flicker levels at different points in the network including at the transformer primary and secondary sides and at the substation terminals. This program developed in matlab, requires the user to input certain data including the motor’s power <b>rating,</b> <b>power</b> factor and efficiency. A separate excel data file containing the utility’s different varieties of substations, transformers and feeders is interfaced with Matlab so the user can specify the components of the network were the motor flicker arises. The main program converts impedances to per unit. These impedances at the point of common coupling (PCC) are used as a reference to calculate the voltage change caused by the changing current during transient. This is used to calculate the flicker level using the flicker evaluation methods as outline in Australian Standard AU/NZ 61000. 3. 7 : 2001. The program implements a convenient way to calculate flicker were the utilities infrastructure (substations, transformers etc) are standardize and offers a fast way of checking whether particular customer load can be connected to a certain network configurations without coursing excessive flicker. 1...|$|E
