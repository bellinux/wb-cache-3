5|$|The bulky body of Styracosaurus resembled {{that of a}} rhinoceros. It had {{powerful}} shoulders {{which may}} have been useful in intraspecies combat. Styracosaurus had a <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> tail. Each toe bore a hooflike ungual which was sheathed in horn.|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} re-embedding {{paraffin}} sections into epoxy resin for diagnostic electron microscopy is described.

40|$|Discolaimus constrictus sp. n. is {{differentiated}} from D. mucurubanus Loof, 1964, {{the only}} other species in the genus in which the basal bulb is set off by a constriction, by its larger size, <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> oesophagus, <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> tail and more posteriorly situated vulva. In general appearance it more closely resembles D. affinis Loof, 1964, D. similis Thorne, 1939 and D. silvicolus Sauer & Annels, 1985. A large population of D. monoplanus Heyns, 1963 is described from Namibia. The remarkable similarity between D. monoplanus, D. texanus Cobb, 1913 and D. brevis Siddiqi, 1964 is pointed out, and the biometrics of all recorded populations of these three species are tabulated and briefly discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the follicles depends {{on the number of}} seeds; the beak (empty upper part) of the carpel is {{elongated}} in two-seeded plants, whereas in many-seeded plants the seeds occupy more of the follicle and the beak is <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> and less well defined.|$|R
5|$|The carrot is a diploid species, and {{has nine}} <b>relatively</b> <b>short,</b> uniform-length {{chromosomes}} (2n=18).

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 36 mm for males and 41 mm for females. It is similar to Isognathus menechus but smaller and the ground colour {{of the body and}} wings (both above and below) is much darker. Furthermore, the forewings are <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In English, {{stressed}} syllables {{in a word}} are pronounced louder, longer, {{and with}} higher pitch, while unstressed syllables are <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> in duration. In Japanese, all moras are pronounced with equal length and loudness. [...] Japanese is therefore {{said to be a}} mora-timed language.|$|R
40|$|Two {{nematode}} species {{isolated from}} sediments of the littoral zone of South China Sea {{on the coast}} of Vietnam are de-scribed and illustrated. Paracomesoma minor sp. n. is closely related to P. elegans Gagarin & Thanh, 2009 and P. lissum Gagarin & Thanh, 2009. It differs from the former species in the shorter body, longer and more slender tail, longer cephalic setae and shorter spicules, and from the latter species in the shorter body, longer cephalic setae, presence of cervical setae and smaller number of precloacal supplements in males. Microlaimus validus sp. n. is morphologically closest to M. citrus Gerlach, 1959 and M. nanus Blome, 1982 and differs from both species in the longer body, <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> pharynx and <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> and thicker tail...|$|R
