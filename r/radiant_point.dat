6000|$|See, then, the {{contrast}} between the two hypotheses. That of Laplace, looking probable while there were only four planetoids, but decreasing in apparent likelihood as the planetoids increase in number, until, as they pass through the hundreds {{on their way to the}} thousands, it becomes obviously improbable, is, at the same time, otherwise objectionable. It pre-supposes a nebulous ring of a width so enormous that it would have overlapped the ring of Mars. This ring would have had differences between the angular velocities of its parts quite inconsistent with the Nebular Hypothesis. The average eccentricities of the orbits of its parts must have differed greatly from those of adjacent orbits; and the average inclinations of the orbits of its parts must similarly have differed greatly from those of adjacent orbits. Once more, the orbits of its parts, confusedly interspersed, must have had varieties of eccentricity and inclination unaccountable in portions of the same nebulous ring; and, during concentration into planetoids, each must have had to maintain its course while struggling through the assemblage of other small nebulous masses, severally moving in ways unlike its own. On the other hand, the hypothesis of an exploded planet is supported by every increase in the number of planetoids discovered; by the greater numbers of the smaller sizes; by the thicker clustering near the inferred place of the missing planet; by the occurrence of the greatest mean distances among the smallest members of the assemblage; by the occurrence of the greatest eccentricities in the orbits of these smallest members; and by the entanglement of all the orbits. Further support for the hypothesis is yielded by aerolites, so various in their kinds, but all suggestive of a planet's crust; by the streams of shooting stars having their <b>radiant</b> <b>points</b> variously placed in the heavens; and also by the solitary shooting stars visible to the naked eye, and the more numerous ones visible through telescopes. Once more, it harmonizes with the discovery of a family of comets, twelve out of thirteen of which have mean distances falling within the zone of the planetoids, have similarly associated periods, have all the same direct motions, and are connected with swarms of meteors and with meteoric streams. May we not, indeed, say, that if there once existed a planet between Mars and Jupiter which burst, the explosion must have produced just such clusters of bodies and classes of phenomena as we actually find? ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{realistic}} visual representation of {{buildings on the}} computer having reached maturity, the emphasis has now shifted to the performance simulation of buildings on the computer. The challenge of performance simulation in computer-based models of buildings lies in the integration of various simulation techniques that require different kinds of building representations. Traditional simulation techniques for luminous, acoustic and thermal environments require different building representations. Thepaper proposes that an enhanced boundary representation is a viable, common building representation format for performance simulation of illumination levels, acoustical parameters and thermal comfort, thereby providing a building representation format for multi-domain performancesimulation on the computer. Simulation techniques {{that have been developed}} for radiosity-based modelling of illumination in buildings, radiation-based modelling of sound propagation in spatial enclosures, and the modelling of thermal comfort based on mean <b>radiant</b> temperatures, <b>point</b> to a convergence of techniques.

60|$|Having, in {{the last}} Observation, premis'd some {{particulars}} observable in the medium, through which we must look upon Coelestial Objects, I shall here add one Observation of the Bodies themselves; and for a specimen I have made choice of the Pleiades, or seven Stars, commonly so called (though in our time and Climate there appear no more then six to the naked eye) and this I did the rather, because the deservedly famous Galileo, having publisht a Picture of this Asterisme, was able, it seems, with his Glass to discover no more then thirty six, whereas with a pretty good twelve foot Telescope, by which I drew this 38 Iconism, I could very plainly discover seventy eight, placed in the order they are ranged in the Figure, and of as many differing Magnitudes as the Asterisks, wherewith they are Marked, do specifie; there being no less then fourteen several Magnitudes of those Stars, which are compris'd within the draught, the biggest whereof is not accounted greater {{then one of the}} third Magnitude; and indeed that account is much too big, if it be compared with other Stars of the third Magnitude, especially by the help of a Telescope; for then by it may be perceiv'd, that its splendor, to the naked eye, may be somewhat augmented by the three little Stars immediately above it, which are near adjoyning to it. The Telescope also discovers a great variety, even in the bigness of those, commonly reckon'd, of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Magnitude; so that should they be distinguish'd thereby, those six Magnitudes would, at least, afford no less then thrice that number of Magnitudes, plainly enough distinguishable by their Magnitude, and brightness; so that a good twelve foot Glass would afford us no less then twenty five several Magnitudes. Nor are these all, but a longer Glass does yet further, both more nicely distinguish the Magnitudes of those already noted, and also discover several other of smaller Magnitudes, not discernable by the twelve foot Glass: Thus have I been able, with a good thirty six foot Glass, to discover many more Stars in the Pleiades then are here delineated, and those of three or four distinct Magnitudes less then any of those spots of the fourteenth Magnitude. And by the twinkling of divers other places of this Asterisme, when the Sky was very clear, I am apt to think, that with longer Glasses, or such as would bear a bigger aperture, there might be discovered multitudes of other small Stars, yet inconspicuous. And indeed, for the discovery of small Stars, the bigger the aperture be, the better adapted is the Glass; for though perhaps it does make the several specks more radiant, and glaring, yet by that means, uniting more Rays very near to one point, it does make many of those <b>radiant</b> <b>points</b> conspicuous, which, by putting on a less aperture, may be found to vanish; and therefore, both for the discovery of the fixt Star, and for finding the Satellites of Jupiter, before it be out of the day, or twilight, I alwayes leave the Object-glass as clear without any aperture as I can, and have thereby been able to discover the Satellites a long while before; I was able to discern them, when the smaller apertures were put on; and at other times, to see multitudes of other smaller Stars, which a smaller aperture makes to disappear.|$|R

He was reporter to the committee of the British Association on the 'observations of luminous meteors,' and from 1862 to 1881 drew up annually complete reports of the large meteors observed, and of the progress of meteoric science. For the British Association (1874-81) he prepared reports of a committee, consisting of himself, his colleague at Newcastle, George A. Lebour, and John T. Dunn, which was formed to determine the thermal conductivities of certain rocks. For the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, he prepared the annual reports on meteoric astronomy each February from 1872 to 1880 and contributed many other important papers to the Notices. In a June 1872 paper, he showed the connection between meteors (the Andromedids) and comets (Biela's Comet), and he predicted the shower which recurred on 27 November of that year. Herschel acquired great precision in noting the paths of meteors among the stars.

Chromosphere: The kinematic parameters of the Moreton wave event, associated with a X 6. 5 flare, are determined. Corona: Small-scale ejecta and the winking of remote filaments are analysed to discuss the type of coronal MHD wave that can originate the observed patterns in Hα images and its probable origin.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for rendering translucent materials that combines photon tracing with diffusion. This combination {{makes it possible}} to efficiently render highly scattering translucent materials while accounting for internal blockers, complex geometry, translucent inter-scattering, and transmission and refraction of light at the boundary causing internal caustics. These effects cannot be accounted for with previous rendering approaches using the dipole or multipole diffusion approximations that only sample the incident illumination at the surface of the material. Instead of sampling lighting at the surface we trace photons into the material and store them volumetrically at their first scattering interaction with the material. We hierarchically integrate the diffusion of light from the photons to compute the <b>radiant</b> emittance at <b>points</b> {{on the surface of the}} material. For increased accuracy we use the incidence plane of the photon and the viewpoint on the surface to blend between three analytic diffusion approximations that best describe the geometric configuration between the photon and the shading point. For this purpose we introduce a new quadpole diffusion approximation that models diffusion at right angled edges, and an attenuation kernel to more accurately model multiple scattering near a light source. The photon diffusion approach is as efficient as previous Monte Carlo sampling approaches based on the dipole or multipole diffusion approximations, and our results demonstrate that it is more accurate and capable of capturing several illumination effects previously ignored when simulating the diffusion of light in translucent materials...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{visibility}} in a smoke laden environment. For many years, {{researchers and}} engineers in fire safety {{have criticized the}} inadequacy of existing theory in describing the effects such as colour, viewing angle, environmental lighting etc. on the visibility of an emergency sign. In the current study, the author has raised the fundamental question {{on the concept of}} visibility and how it should be measured in fire safety engineering and tried to address the problem by redefining visibility based on the perceived image of a target sign. New algorithms have been created during this study to utilise modern hardware and software technology in the simulation of human perceived image of object in both experiment and computer modelling. Unlike the traditional threshold of visual distance, visibility in the current study has been defined as a continuous function changing from clearly discemable to completely invisible. It allows the comparison of visibility under various conditions, not just limited to the threshold. Current experiment has revealed that different conditions may results in the same visual threshold but follow very different path on the way leading to the threshold. The new definition of visibility has made the quantification of visibility in the pre-threshold conditions possible. Such quantification can help to improve the performance of fire evacuation since most evacuees will experience the pre-threshold condition. With current measurement of visibility, all the influential factors such as colour, viewing angle etc. can be tested in experiment and simulated in numerical model. Based on the newly introduced definition of visibility, a set of experiments have been carried output in a purposed built smoke tunnel. Digital camera images of various illuminated signs were taken under different illumination, colour and smoke conditions. Using an algorithm developed by the author in this study, the digital camera images were converted into simulated human perceived images. The visibility of a target sign is measured against the quality of its image acquired. Conclusions have been drawn by comparing visibility under different conditions. One of them is that signs illuminated with red and green lights have the similar visibility that is far better than that with blue light. It is the first time this seemingly obvious conclusion has been quantified. In the simulation of visibility in participating media, the author has introduced an algorithm that combines irradiance catching in 3 D space with Monte Carlo ray tracing. It can calculate the distribution of scattered radiation with good accuracy without the high cost typically related to zonal method and the limitations in discrete ordinate method. The algorithm has been combined with a two pass solution method to produce high resolution images without introducing excessive number of rays from the light source. The convergence of the iterative solution procedure implemented has been theoretically proven. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated by comparing with the analytical solution of a <b>point</b> <b>radiant</b> source in 3 D space. Further validation of the simulation model has been carried out by comparing the model prediction with the data from the smoke tunnel experiments. The output of the simulation model has been presented {{in the form of an}} innovative floor map of visibility (FMV). It helps the fire safety designer to identify regions of poor visibility in a glance and will prove to be a very useful tool in performance based fire safety design...|$|R

40|$|A Moreton wave was {{detected}} in active region (AR) 12017 on 29 March 2014 with very high cadence with the Halpha Solar Telescope for Argentina (HASTA) {{in association with}} an X 1. 0 flare (SOL 2014 - 03 - 29 T 17 : 48). Several other phenomena took place {{in connection with this}} event, such as low coronal waves and a coronal mass ejection (CME). We analyze the association between the Moreton wave and the EUV signatures observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These include their low-coronal surface-imprint, and the signatures of the full wave and shock dome propagating outward in the corona. We also study their relation to the white-light CME. We perform a kinematic analysis by tracking the wavefronts in several directions. This analysis reveals a high-directional dependence of accelerations and speeds determined from data at various wavelengths. We speculate that a region of open magnetic field lines northward of our defined <b>radiant</b> <b>point</b> sets favorable conditions for the propagation of a coronal magnetohydrodynamic shock in this direction. The hypothesis that the Moreton wavefront is produced by a coronal shock-wave that pushes the chromosphere downward is supported by the high compression ratio in that region. Furthermore, we propose a 3 D geometrical model to explain the observed wavefronts as the chromospheric and low-coronal traces of an expanding and outward-traveling bubble intersecting the Sun. The results of the model are in agreement with the coronal shock-wave being generated by a 3 D piston that expands at the speed of the associated rising filament. The piston is attributed to the fast ejection of the filament-CME ensemble, also consistent with the good match between the speed profiles of the low-coronal and white-light shock-waves.

We present high {{temporal}} resolution observations of a Moreton wave event detected with the Hα Solar Telescope for 							Argentina (HASTA) in the Hα line 656. 3 nm, on December 6, 2006. 							Aims. The {{aim is to}} contribute to the discussion about the nature and triggering mechanisms of Moreton wave events. 							Methods. We describe the HASTA telescope capabilities and the observational techniques. We carried out a detailed analysis to determine the flare onset, the <b>radiant</b> <b>point</b> location, the kinematics of the disturbance and the activation time of two distant filaments. We used a 2 D reconstruction of the HASTA and corresponding TRACE observations, together with conventional techniques, to analyze the probable origin of the phenomenon. 							Results. The kinematic parameters and the probable onset time of the Moreton wave event are determined. A small-scale ejectum and the winking of two remote filaments are analyzed to discuss their relation with the Moreton disturbance. 							Conclusions. The analysis of the Moreton wave event favors the hypothesis that the phenomenon can be described as the chromospheric imprint of a single fast coronal shock triggered from a single source in association with a coronal mass ejection. Its onset time is concurrent with a Lorentz force peak measured in the photosphere, as stated by other authors. However, the existence of multiple shock waves that were generated almost simultaneously cannot be discarded. Fil: Francile, Carlos Natale. Universidad Nacional de San Juan.
