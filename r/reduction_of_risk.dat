25|$|A {{wide range}} of {{beneficial}} effects of phytoestrogens on the cardiovascular, metabolic, central nervous systems as well as <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> of cancer and post menopausal symptoms have been claimed. However there is also concern that phytoestrogens may act as endocrine disruptors that adversely affect health. Based on currently available evidence, {{it is not clear}} whether the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens outweigh their risks.|$|E
25|$|In {{low-risk}} pregnancies, {{the association}} between cigarette smoking and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology {{increases the risk of}} preeclampsia {{to such a degree that}} any measurable <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> due to smoking is masked. However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of preeclampsia. It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.|$|E

2500|$|Radiotherapy {{is given}} after surgery {{to the region}} of the tumor bed and {{regional}} lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumor cells that may have escaped surgery. It may also have a beneficial effect on tumor microenvironment. Radiation therapy can be delivered as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy). Conventionally radiotherapy is given after the operation for breast cancer. [...] Radiation can also be given at the time of operation on the breast cancer. Radiation can reduce the risk of recurrence by 50–66% (1/2 – 2/3 <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk)</b> when delivered in the correct dose and is considered essential when breast cancer is treated by removing only the lump (Lumpectomy or Wide local excision).|$|E
