Webmasters create an RSS file containing headlines and description of specific information.

Number of RSS feeds available differ significantly from libraries to libraries. This is significant in exploring the various possibilities of RSS in libraries...|$|R

50|$|RSS-0.90 was {{released}} by Netscape circa March 1999, {{at which point the}} acronym implied RDF Site Summary. The functionality was remarkably different from what is now known as RSS, or <b>Really</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Syndication.</b> The former simply provided a website summary, while the latter was designed for syndication. July 1999 saw the release of RSS-0.91, an improvement on its predecessor; the latter was XML-based, as opposed to the use of RDF (or Resource Description Framework) by the earlier version, which was then deprecated by Netscape. The new version also provided support for DTD, allowing for additional HTML-like functionality.|$|E

5000|$|RSS (Rich Site Summary; {{originally}} RDF Site Summary; {{often called}} <b>Really</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Syndication)</b> {{is a type}} of web feed which allows users to access updates to online content in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. The news aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content, allowing the content to be automatically passed from website to website or from website to user. This passing of content is called web syndication. Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, video. An RSS document (called [...] "feed", [...] "web feed", or [...] "channel") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name.|$|E
