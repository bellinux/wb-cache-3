5|$|Reed and Sue {{contemplate}} abandoning {{their lives}} as superheroes {{in order to have}} a normal life and <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> but are unaware Johnny is listening. With the Surfer creating craters around the globe, Reed determines that the next will appear in London. The team arrives too late to stop the crater, which drains the River Thames, but they manage to prevent the London Eye from collapsing after it is damaged by the quake (although Johnny nearly thwarts their attempt when he unwillingly switches powers with Reed). Meanwhile, the Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects their ex-friend Victor Von Doom, freeing him from two years encased in metal. A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and offers to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer retaliates, blasting Doom through the ice, but the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.|$|E

25|$|During the Spanish Inquisition, Spanish women (as well as Native American and African American {{women in}} the Spanish colonies) were {{expected}} to behave {{in a manner that}} would promote the Spanish culture and uphold the standards of Catholicism. Women were typically limited to the following roles: nun, wife/housewife, and mother. Any other role was looked down upon as it defied the Crown and Spanish culture. In fact, Spanish women were expected to teach the Indigenous and African women how to raise their children and take care of their family. Because familial endeavors were highly emphasized by the monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, women were encouraged to have children, <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> and secure Spanish ideals and Catholic customs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{writers and}} {{academics}} have {{written on the}} subject of the increasing suburbanization of the U.S. For instance, some social scientists point out the role played by racism. During World War I, the massive migration of African Americans from the South resulted in an even greater residential shift toward suburban areas. The cities became seen as dangerous, crime-infested areas, while the suburbs were seen as safe places to live and <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> leading to a social trend known in some parts of the world as white flight. This phenomenon runs counter to much of the rest of the world, where slums mostly exist outside the city, rather than within them. With the increasing population of the older, more established suburban areas, many of the problems which were once seen as purely urban ones have manifested themselves there as well. These social scientists suggest that the historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege that have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism.|$|E
