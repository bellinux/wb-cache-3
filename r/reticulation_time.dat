The conference was organised by Brunel University and supported by the Italian Union of Thermofluiddynamics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, University of Thessaly, IPEM, the Process Intensification Network, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Heat Transfer Society, HEXAG - the Heat Exchange Action Group, and the Energy Institute. We have designed a microfluidic system that combines a double flow-focusing setup for calibrated capsule fabrication with a microchannel for the characterization of their mechanical properties. The double flow-focusing system consists of a first Y junction to create the microdroplets and of a second Y junction to introduce the cross-linking agent allowing the membrane formation. The human serum albumin (HSA) aqueous solution for the dispersed solution, hydrophobic phase for the continuous solution and cross-linking agent solution are introduced by means of syringe pumps. A wavy channel after the second junction allows to control the <b>reticulation</b> <b>time.</b> A cylindrical microchannel then enables to deform and characterize the capsules formed. The mechanical properties of the capsule membrane are obtained by inverse analysis (Chu et al. 2011). The results show that the drop size increases with the flow rate ratio between the central and lateral channels and does not change much regardless of the flow rate of the reticulation phase. The mean shear modulus of the capsules fabricated after 23 s of reticulation is of the order of the surface tension of HSA solution with Dragoxat indicating that the <b>reticulation</b> <b>time</b> is too short to form an elastic membrane around the droplet. When the <b>reticulation</b> <b>time</b> is increased to 60 s, the membrane shear modulus is multiplied by a factor of 3 confirming that a solid membrane has formed around the drop...|$|E

Membranes were tested as proton conductor in low temperature H 2 -O 2 fuel cell allowing to get peak power densities up to 300 mWcm - 2.

40|$|The present work evaluates a newly {{developed}} silated hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Si-HPMC) -based hydrogel as a scaffold for 3 D culture of osteogenic cells. The pH variation {{at room temperature}} catalyzes the reticulation and self-hardening of the viscous polymer solution into a gelatine state. We designed <b>reticulation</b> <b>time,</b> final consistency and pH {{in order to obtain}} an easy handling matrice, suitable for in vitro culture and in vivo injection. Three human osteogenic cell lines and normal human osteogenic (HOST) cells were cultured in 3 D inside this Si-HPMC hydrogel. We show here that osteosarcoma cells proliferate as clonogenic spheroids and that HOST colonies survive for at least 3 weeks. Mineralization assay and gene expression analysis of osteoblastic markers and cytokines, indicate that all the cells cultured in 3 D into this hydrogel, exhibited a more mature differentiation status than cells cultured in monolayer on plastic. This study demonstrates that this Si-HPMC hydrogel is well suited to support osteoblastic survival, proliferation and differentiation when used as a new scaffold for 3 D culture and represents also a potential basis for an innovative bone repair material...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Jansson and Sung showed that, given a dense set {{of input}} {{triplets}} T (representing hypotheses about the local evolutionary relationships of triplets of taxa), {{it is possible}} to determine in polynomial time whether there exists a level- 1 network consistent with T, and if so, to construct such a network [24]. Here, we extend this work by showing that this problem is even polynomial time solvable for the construction of level- 2 networks. This shows that, assuming density, it is tractable to construct plausible evolutionary histories from input triplets even when such histories are heavily nontree-like. This further strengthens the case for the use of triplet-based methods in the construction of phylogenetic networks. We also implemented the algorithm and applied it to yeast data. 1 Index Terms—Phylogenetic networks, level- 2, triplets, <b>reticulations,</b> polynomial <b>time</b> algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} first decade of Ian Wedde's poetry, 1967 - 1978. It focuses on the three main {{collections}} of his verse published in these years, Made Over (1974), Earthly: Sonnets For Carlos (1975) and Spells For Coming Out (1977), after which discussion moves to the as-yet uncollected poems dating from about 1974. My concern with Made Over was to establish the mechanics of Wedde's poetic voice by scrutinising what I consider to be the seminal poems of that collection. Their thematic connectedness is the most important feature to emerge from the investigation; Wedde's most distinctive trait is discovered here. Attention then turned to the period Wedde spent in the south, 1972 - 1974, out of which came Earthly, Dick Seddon's Great Dive (novel) and later Spells; all three display a common core of imagery which I have called the 'Otago vision'. Dick Seddon is considered insofar as it has bearings on the poetry Wedde was writing {{at the same time as}} the novel. Earthly is made the occasion of a detailed exploration of the Otago-inspired iconography and the massive <b>reticulation</b> of <b>time,</b> place, and energy which this vision gives rise to. Spells takes up the problems of this multi-connectiveness and my intention was to bring out the play of the personal co-ordinate against the deeply serious explorative one. As for the uncollected work, it seemed to me necessary to bring Wedde's poetry as far up to date as possible. To have left off at Spells would have meant leaving the thesis poetically in 1974, which is a long way back in terms of a poet as prolific and technically innovative as Wedde. For one thing, his most exciting long poems were written in this later period. I felt that nothing barred an interpretative study from at least attempting to understand where Wedde is now, 1978...|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} full close they clap their hands to stop the musicians, who recommence with a saraband, during which a strange figure appears on the path beyond the temple. He is deep in thought, {{with his eyes closed}} and his feet feeling {{automatically}} for the rough irregular steps as he slowly descends them. Except for a sort of linen kilt consisting mainly of a girdle carrying a sporran and a few minor pockets, he is naked. In physical hardihood and uprightness he seems to be in the prime of life; and his eyes and mouth shew no signs of age; but his face, though fully and firmly fleshed, bears a network of lines, varying from furrows to hairbreadth <b>reticulations,</b> as if <b>Time</b> had worked over every inch of it incessantly through whole geologic periods. His head is finely domed and utterly bald. Except for his eyelashes he is quite hairless. He is unconscious of his surroundings, and walks right into one of the dancing couples, separating them. He wakes up and stares about him. The couple stop indignantly. The rest stop. The music stops. The youth whom he has jostled accosts him without malice, but without anything that we should call manners.|$|R
