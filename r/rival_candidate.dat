25|$|Moscoe {{asked the}} Law Society of Upper Canada to {{intervene}} in his 1982 re-election campaign, alleging that <b>rival</b> <b>candidate</b> Sydney Moscoe was running with the deliberate intent of confusing voters. He informed the media that the ten nominees who signed Sydney Moscoe's papers also signed those of Eleanor Rosen, a more serious challenger associated with the Progressive Conservatives. A Supreme Court of Ontario judge ruled that both Moscoes were legitimate candidates. Moscoe was re-elected, although by a reduced margin.|$|E
25|$|Speculating that {{production}} and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues {{need to be}} considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy gamma radiation, and especially also as neutrinos, so that only about 40% of mc2 would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally. Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of mc2 yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best <b>rival</b> <b>candidate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Miller used a broom as a prop in this campaign, symbolizing his {{commitment}} to cleaning up Toronto both literally, in terms of litter, and metaphorically, arguing that there were shady deals at City Hall. He pledged to cancel the airport bridge, appoint a municipal ethics commissioner, and promote public transit by fully implementing the TTC's ridership growth plan. He supported a police request to hire thirty-two new officers, and opposed <b>rival</b> <b>candidate</b> John Tory's plans for trash incineration in favour of continuing garbage shipments to Michigan.|$|E

25|$|Some {{historians are}} {{of the opinion that}} the {{selection}} of Purandar Singha over Chandrakanta Singha as a tributary ruler of Upper Assam was part of British political game. Since Chandrakanta Singha inherited the kingdom from his elder brother, the Ahom king Swargadeo Kamaleswar Singha, therefore the legal basis of Chandrakanta Singha was more firm than Purandar Singha. Purandar Singha lived most of his life in exile with his father; therefore if the British install Purandar Singha to the throne, he would be more grateful and will submit to British rule more readily than his <b>rival</b> <b>candidate</b> Chandrakanta Singha.|$|E
25|$|On May 12, 2006, Trudeau-era Deputy Prime Minister Allan MacEachen backed Rae's {{leadership}} bid becoming honorary campaign chair.

He was also endorsed by MPs Irwin Cotler, Ujjal Dosanjh, Lawrence MacAulay, Diane Marleau and Brian Murphy, as well as several Senators. <b>Rival</b> <b>candidate</b> Maurizio Bevilacqua withdrew from the contest on August 14 to endorse Rae, and Carolyn Bennett did the same on September 15, followed by Hedy Fry on September 25 and John Godfrey on October 20.|$|E
25|$|Swimmer's {{executive}} order was analyzed by some observers as one way Swimmer excluded {{people who were}} supporting a <b>rival</b> <b>candidate,</b> former deputy chief Perry Wheeler, for Principal Chief. After the 1983 Cherokee Nation elections and the re-election of Swimmer, Wheeler and his running mate, Agnes Cowen, initiated a series of legal proceedings such as filing cases with the Cherokee Judicial Appeals Tribunal, petitioning the Bureau of Indian Affairs to conduct {{an investigation of the}} election, and filing a case with the US District Court. Wheeler and Cowen alleged that the election was a violation of federal and tribal law and that the Cherokee Freedmen were unjustly removed from voting because they were allies of Wheeler. All cases and subsequent appeals were defeated.|$|E

Opponents also accused him of courting conservative voters in policy-making {{in a bid to}} capitalise on right-wing sentiments among some communities. However, his popularity was sufficient to see him polling as the frontrunner throughout the later campaign period, consistently ahead of <b>rival</b> Socialist <b>candidate,</b> Ségolène Royal.|$|R
25|$|Romney {{also said}} during the primary {{campaign}} that he would seek to make the U.S. a much less hospitable place for undocumented immigrants by eliminating {{what he called the}} magnets that attract them. An example of a magnet, he said, would be offering to undocumented immigrants the same tuition discounts that are offered to legal residents who attend public colleges in their states, a benefit that <b>rival</b> <b>candidate</b> Governor Rick Perry supported for Texas students who had been brought as children to the U.S. by their undocumented immigrant parents. Romney similarly said that he opposed all forms of amnesty because he regards amnesty as another magnet for illegal immigration. He vowed that as president he would veto the DREAM Act (legislation which would allow individuals who had been brought to the U.S. as children when their families immigrated illegally an opportunity to qualify for permanent residency if they met certain qualifications), because he considered it yet another magnet for illegal immigration.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, L'Auto was closed– {{its doors}} nailed shut– and its belongings, {{including}} the Tour, sequestrated {{by the state}} for publishing articles {{too close to the}} Germans. Rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government. Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, L'Équipe, but there was a <b>rival</b> <b>candidate</b> to run the Tour: a consortium of Sports and Miroir Sprint. Each organised a candidate race. L'Équipe and Le Parisien Libéré had La Course du Tour de France and Sports and Miroir Sprint had La Ronde de France. Both were five stages, the longest the government would allow because of shortages. L'Équipes race was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams that had been successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high. L'Équipe was given the right to organise the 1947 Tour de France. However, L'Équipes finances were never sound and Goddet accepted an advance by Émilion Amaury, who had supported his bid to run the post-war Tour. Amaury was a newspaper magnate whose condition was that his sports editor, Félix Lévitan should join Goddet for the Tour. The two worked together, Goddet running the sporting side and Lévitan the financial.|$|E
500|$|Democrat William Goebel chose Beckham as {{his running}} mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial {{election}} of 1899. Goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election, and Beckham's native Nelson County was already committed to a <b>rival</b> <b>candidate.</b> But friends of Goebel assured him that Beckham would be loyal to Goebel's reform agenda, whereas the two other men Goebel was considering as running mates would [...] "stack the Senate committees against him."

500|$|Sue's {{campaign}} {{for congress in}} the third season has not heretofore found much favor with reviewers, though Futterman felt that the addition of Burt Hummel as a <b>rival</b> <b>candidate</b> [...] "gives us a sliver of hope, mainly because Mike O'Malley has managed to do no wrong thus far" [...] as Burt, and VanDerWerff, while otherwise unimpressed, said he liked [...] "the idea of the show pitting its most purely heroic figure against its most purely villainous". Bell {{was pleased with the}} new development, and noted that in three seasons, [...] "no character has grown more than Burt". Canning said he loved having Burt as Sue's nemesis, and Kubicek wrote that the two are [...] "awesome together".|$|E
500|$|His {{first term}} as mayor {{also saw the}} issue of {{possible}} amalgamation of the [...] "twin cities" [...] of Edmonton and Strathcona, an issue that had been spoken of as a possibility in the previous few years. Approved by councils of both cities, a successful plebiscite was held, and bylaws permitting the merge were passed and Edmonton's annex of Strathcona came into effect in February 1912. Armstrong put his name up {{once again in the}} mayoral election mandated by the agreement and defeated his <b>rival</b> <b>candidate,</b> and thus became the first post-amalgamation mayor of the city of Edmonton. During his term, he introduced a new hospital, improvements to the street rail system, and commissioning a report on the expansion of the city. Another election was held later that December, and he did not stand for re-election.|$|E
500|$|Antonio Cafiero, who {{had been}} elected {{governor}} of Buenos Aires Province, led the renewal of the PJ, and was considered their most likely candidate for the presidency. Menem, on the other hand, {{was seen as a}} populist leader. Using a big tent approach, he got support from several unrelated political figures. As a result, he defeated Cafiero in the primary elections. He sought alliances with Bunge and Born, union leaders, former members of Montoneros, and the AAA, people from the church, [...] "Carapintadas", etc. He promised a [...] "revolution of production" [...] and huge wage increases; but it was not clear exactly which policies he was proposing. The <b>rival</b> <b>candidate,</b> Eduardo Angeloz, tried to point out the mistakes made by Menem and Alfonsín. Jacques de Mahieu, a French ideologue of the Peronist movement (and former Vichy collaborator), was photographed campaigning for Menem.|$|E

500|$|Upon Óláfr's {{return the}} chronicle says that Rögnvaldr welcomed {{him back and}} had him marry Lauon, the {{daughter}} of a certain nobleman from Kintyre, who was also the sister of his own wife. The precise identification of the father-in-law of Óláfr and Rögnvaldr is uncertain, but he may have been a member of Clann Somairle; possibly Ragnall mac Somairle, or his son Ruaidrí, who are both styled Lord of Kintyre in documents contemporaneous to their reigns. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr then gave Lewis back to Óláfr, where the newly-weds proceeded to live until the arrival of Reginald, Bishop of the Isles (d. c. 1226), sometime later. According to the chronicle the bishop disapproved of Óláfr's marriage, as Óláfr had formerly had a concubine who was a cousin of Lauon. A synod was then assembled and the chronicle records that the marriage was nullified. Although at first glance the marriage appears to have been doomed, as it was deemed [...] "as being within prohibited degree of kinship", it may be that this was merely a convenient excuse, and that the contention between the half-brothers may have played a part in its demise. It is also possible that Bishop Reginald may have released Óláfr from an arranged marriage which had been forced upon him; the bishop and Óláfr appear to have been close, as the chronicle describes Bishop Reginald as a son of Óláfr's sister, and notes that Óláfr was glad at his coming to Lewis. Furthermore, it was Bishop Reginald who annulled the marriage which Rögnvaldr had arranged for Óláfr. In fact, when the previous Bishop of the Isles died in 1217, Bishop Reginald had vied with a <b>rival</b> <b>candidate</b> for the position—a certain Nicholas—and there is evidence to suggest that Reginald was supported by Óláfr, while Óláfr's half-brother Rögnvaldr supported the bid of Nicholas.|$|E
