50|$|Nonetheless, a few {{variations}} in the strict geometry of the garden à la française began to appear. Elaborate parterres of broderies, with their curves and counter-curves, were replaced by parterres of grass bordered with flowerbeds, which were easier to maintain. Circles became ovals, called <b>rotules,</b> with alleys radiating outward {{in the shape of}} an 'x', and irregular octagon shapes appeared. Gardens began to follow the natural landscape, rather than moving earth to shape the ground into artificial terraces.|$|E

Project Title : Upgrading of Suntec City Location : Suntec city, Singapore Owner : The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2197 Architect : Liu & Wo Architects Pte Ltd Year of {{construction}} : 2006 [...] In 2006, the old curtain wall was deemed to {{dark and the}} owners of requested for an upgrade into a more transparent and bright façade. The renovation was in conjunction to host the 2006 OPEC ministers meeting. [...] To accommodate this new requirement an upgraded design with point-fixed glass facade system of fish-bone mild steel layout truss was called for. Strudyna’s 1x19 tensile cable assembly was used to reinforce the vertical trusses and kept the truss design small and transparent. The new design of facade will provide more natural light inside the building and a more spacious look.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of gemmular architecture adaptive morpho-traits at family level is reported for Metaniidae togeth-er {{with the discovery}} and description of a new species from the River Mangoky (High Plateau), Madagascar. The new Malagasy species, ascribed to Metania for diagnostic traits of the skeleton and the gemmular architecture, differs {{from all the other}} known species of the genus in its unique combination of diagnostic traits. Metania madagascariensis sp. nov. is characterised by encrusting growth form, conulose surface, specialized ectosomal skeleton, alveolate-reticulate choano-somal skeleton, two types of megascleres as smooth oxeas (α) and acanthoxeas (β) ornamented with spines and/or tuber-cles, one type of microsclere as acanthoxeas with dense spines/tubercles bearing rosettes of microspines at tips; gemmules with or without cage of megascleres and frequently surrounded by microscleres; gemmular theca trilayered with pneumat-ic layer of fibrous spongin, boletiform (trumpet-like) gemmuloscleres with proximal true <b>rotule</b> large, smooth and with irregular blunt margins, and distal knob-like pseudorotule notably smaller, with a few hooks at the margins. M. madagas-cariensis belongs to the Afrotropical species group of Metania. Identification keys and an annotated checklist at global level are also provided together with a species-level discussion of Metania focusing on morphology, taxonomy, nomen-clature and biogeography...|$|R
