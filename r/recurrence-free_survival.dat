40|$|PURPOSE: Nonmuscle {{invasive}} bladder {{cancer is}} characterized by a high recurrence rate. New adjuvant treatments are needed to decrease this high number of recurrences. We present the results of more than 10 years of experience with chemohyperthermia in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using standardized medical record forms we prospectively collected patient and tumor characteristics of patients treated with chemohyperthermia between 2002 and 2013. Median followup was 75. 6 months. <b>Recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> was the primary objective. The secondary objective was to observe <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> differences in 1) the epirubicin group vs the mitomycin group and 2) the highly recurrent (greater than 2 recurrences in 24 months) nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer group vs the other groups. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer were included in study, including 20 (13 %) treated with epirubicin and 129 (81 %) previously treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin. One and 2 -year <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> was 60 % and 47 %, respectively. Muscle invasive progression was seen in 4 % of cases. Two-year <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> in the epirubicin and mitomycin groups was 55 % and 46 %, respectively (p = 0. 30). The highly recurrent nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer group had significant decreased <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> compared to other groups (p < 0. 01). Patients treated with 2 or fewer vs greater than 2 transurethral bladder tumor resections before chemohyperthermia had higher <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> (p = 0. 01). On multivariable analysis the highly recurrent cancer criteria remained independently associated with decreased <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> (HR 2. 40, 95 % CI 1. 30 - 4. 43, p = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Chemohyperthermia is an effective approach to nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer for which standard intravesical treatments fail. Patients with highly recurrent disease before chemohyperthermia have lower <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival.</b> Furthermore, <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> appears to improve with earlier chemohyperthermia.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prognostic factors for survival in patients treated surgically for transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT-TCC). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 87 patients (64 men and 23 women, mean age of 62. 2 years) with UUT-TCC who had undergone radical nephroureterectomy at our institution between June 1994 and June 2009. The median follow-up period was 32 months. The prognostic significance of various clinicopathological variables for <b>recurrence-free</b> and cancer-specific <b>survival</b> was analyzed by using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Of the total 87 patients, 21 patients (24. 1 %) developed local recurrence or distant metastasis and 16 patients (18. 4 %) died of disease during the follow-up period. The 5 -year <b>recurrence-free</b> and cancer-specific <b>survival</b> rates were 74. 6 % and 75. 2 %, respectively. In the univariate analysis, hydronephrosis, T stage, N stage, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were significant prognostic factors for <b>recurrence-free</b> and cancer-specific <b>survival.</b> In the multivariate analysis, T stage and LVI were independent prognostic factors for <b>recurrence-free</b> and cancer-specific <b>survival.</b> Conclusions: The T stage and LVI are independent prognostic factors for recurrencefree and cancer-specific survival in patients with UUT-TCC treated by radical nephroureterectomy. These findings would be helpful for guiding decisions about adjuvant therapies and the surveillance interval.

40|$|Introduction: Disease {{spectrum}} of upper tract transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in Indian patients is not known. Herein, we present data on clinical presentation, pathological characteristics, {{and the outcome}} of treatment of upper tract TCC. Materials and Methods: Clinicopathological data of patients who were diagnosed for upper tract TCC between January 2000 and January 2010 were collected from the hospital information system and case records. Preoperative diagnosis was based on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography of the whole abdomen and urine cytology. Cross tab and logistic regression analysis was done {{on the effect of}} various clinicopathological characteristics on the outcome and cancer-specific and recurrence survival were derived. Results: There were total 40 patients, 35 (87. 5 %) of them were male. The mean age was 62. 7 ± 7. 9 years. The most common symptom was gross hematuria present in 30 (75 %). Mean tumor size was 2. 8 ± 1. 2 cm. Median duration of follow up was 36 (12 to 100) months. Laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was done in 27 patients along with bladder cuff excision and seven patients underwent open surgery. Thirty two (88. 8 %) patients had invasive T stage and high-grade lesions were seen in 24 (66. 6 %). Lymphovascular invasion was found only in one case and necrosis in 30 (83. 3 %). Necrosis was found to be the poor prognostic factor. Five-year <b>recurrence-free</b> and cancer-specific <b>survivals</b> were 36. 33 % and 26 %, respectively.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{significance}} of bivariate cytokeratin and DNA flow cytometry for analysis of the biologic aggressiveness of resectable non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: In 92 patients who underwent curative operations, the DNA ploidy status and S-phase fractions of the cancer cell populations inside the tumors were analyzed by a cytokeratin gating technique with paraffin-embedded specimens and were correlated with the surgical results. Results: Ninety tumors yielded assessable DNA histograms. DNA diploidy was detected in 25 tumors with a mean S-phase fraction of 14. 3 % ± 4. 7 %, and DNA aneuploidy was detected in 65 tumors with a mean S-phase fraction of 15. 1 % ± 7. 1 %. The 5 -year overall and <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survivals</b> were 73. 3 % and 70. 3 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that only TNM staging was a prognostic factor after surgery. There was a negative correlation between the logarithms of S-phase fraction and the disease-free interval for 22 patients with proven recurrence (P =. 006). The tumors with high S-phase fractions recurred more rapidly than did those with low S-phase fractions. Conclusion: In a bivariate analysis of cytokeratin and DNA flow cytometry in resectable non-small cell lung cancer, the S-phase fraction appeared to be correlated with the disease-free interval. However, DNA ploidy and S-phase fraction were not predictive of either recurrence or survival after operation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of bone scan in detecting bone metastases in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Methods We retrospectively evaluated the radiographic and scintigraphic images of 360 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients between 1999 and 2008. Of these 360 patients, 288 patients received bone scan during pretreatment staging, and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of bone scan were determined. Of these 360 patients, surgery was performed in 161 patients including 119 patients with preoperative bone scan and 42 patients without preoperative bone scan. Among these 161 patients receiving surgery, 133 patients had stages II[*]+[*]III disease, including 99 patients with preoperative bone scan and 34 patients without preoperative bone scan. Bone <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> and overall survival were compared in all 161 patients and 133 stages II[*]+[*]III patients, respectively. Results The diagnostic performance for bone metastasis was as follows: sensitivity, 80 %; specificity, 90. 1 %; positive predictive value, 43. 5 %; and negative predictive value, 97. 9 %.

Patients were divided into 2 groups based on timing of reconstruction (immediate versus delayed). Univariate analyses were performed to assess distributions. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to estimate <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival.</b> Results:. Tumor specimen positive margins were comparable between immediate and delayed reconstruction groups (P = 0. 129). Univariate analysis demonstrated comparable local melanoma recurrence after immediate or delayed reconstruction (41. 4 % versus 53. 3 %; P = 0. 399). After adjusting for prognostic factors, multivariate analysis also failed to demonstrate an association between reconstruction timing and local <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> (P = 0. 167). Conclusions:. In this long-term study, {{we were not able to}} demonstrate an association between reconstruction timing and local <b>recurrence-free</b> <b>survival</b> after excision WLE of HNCMM, rendering immediate reconstruction a reliable approach. In addition, the presence of ulceration and a positive sentinel lymph node were positively associated with the risk of recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{beneficial}} effect of regional anesthesia on cancer related outcome in various solid tumors has been proposed. The data on prostate cancer is conflicting and reports on long-term cancer specific survival are lacking. Methods: In a retrospective, single-center study, outcomes of 148 consecutive patients with locally advanced prostate cancer pT 3 / 4 who underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) with general anesthesia combined with intra- and postoperative epidural analgesia (n= 67) or with postoperative ketorolac-morphine analgesia (n= 81) were reviewed. The median observation time was 14. 00 years (range 10. 87 - 17. 75 yrs). Biochemical recurrence (BCR) -free, local and distant recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models {{were used to}} analyze clinicopathologic variables associated with disease progression and death. Results: The survival estimates for BCR-free, local and distant <b>recurrence-free,</b> cancer-specific <b>survival</b> and overal...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} on the prognostic and predictive value of abnormal p 53 expression in colorectal cancer. The major downstream protein, p 21, a cell cycle inhibitor, is transcriptionally regulated by p 53. The prognostic impact of p 21 expression in colorectal carcinomas is still under debate. In this study, we investigated the expression of p 21 and p 53 in a prospective cohort of 116 sporadic colorectal carcinomas at UICCII/III stage. We observed an expression of p 21 in 26 % and p 53 in 63 % of the carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. Patients with p 21 -negative colorectal carcinomas had a significant better <b>recurrence-free</b> and overall <b>survival</b> than patients with p 21 -positive carcinomas (p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 005). Expression of p 53 was related to a better overall survival (p= 0. 048). The combination of p 21 -negative/p 53 -positive expression {{was significantly related to}} better <b>recurrence-free</b> and overall <b>survival</b> (p= 0. 007 and p= 0. 0001) and gained independent prognostic significance (HR: 3. 4, p= 0. 01). Moreover, patients with combined p 21 −/p 53 + expression had a remarkable benefit in overall survival after adjuvant chemotherapy as compared to the p 21 −/p 53 − subgroup (p= 0. 012). Our data suggest that the assessment of both p 53 and p 21 expression may provide prognostic information in colorectal cancer patients. This combination might be helpful to identify patients who could benefit from chemotherapy...|$|R
