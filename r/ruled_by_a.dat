5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{succession}} of seven kings. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, ruled in a tyrannical manner and, in 510 BC, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia, {{the wife of a}} senator named Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide because of the rape, and this led to a conspiracy which drove Tarquin from the city. With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive). While this story may be nothing more than a legend which later Romans created in order to explain their past, it is likely that Rome had been <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of kings, who probably were, as the legends suggest, overthrown quickly.|$|E
5|$|The first {{city had}} the {{characteristics}} of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, and {{seems to have been}} <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> council of elders, next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order to assert their political control. During the early Akkadian period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened and the number of Akkadian officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as no evidence for a king dating to that period exists.|$|E
5|$|According to this {{traditional}} account, Rome had been <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> succession of kings. The Romans {{believed that this}} era, that of the Roman kingdom, began in 753 BC and ended in 510 BC. After {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy and the establishment of the Republic, the people of Rome began electing two consuls each year. According to the consular fasti, a list of the consuls going back to the foundation of the Republic, the first consuls were chosen in 509 BC.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the word's origins in ancient Greece, the Greeks {{conceived}} it as <b>rule</b> <b>by</b> the best qualified citizens—and often contrasted it favourably with monarchy, <b>rule</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> individual. In later times, aristocracy was usually seen as <b>rule</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> privileged group, the aristocratic class, and was contrasted with democracy.|$|R

5|$|Altrincham {{became a}} Free Borough, a self-governing township, {{when it was}} granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de MasseyV. The charter allowed for the {{creation}} of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.|$|E
5|$|Between 1386 and 1572, the Polish-Lithuanian {{union was}} <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{succession}} of constitutional monarchs of the Jagiellonian dynasty. The political {{influence of the}} Jagiellonian kings gradually diminished during this period, while the landed nobility took over an ever-increasing role in central government and national affairs. The royal dynasty, however, had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellonian Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later stage, a Golden Age of Polish culture.|$|E
5|$|In 580, Hormizd IV {{abolished}} the Caucasian Iberian monarchy, and turned Iberia into a Persian province <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> marzpan (governor). During the 580s, the war continued inconclusively with victories on both sides. In 582, Maurice won a battle at Constantia over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general {{did not follow}} up his victory; he had to hurry to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions. Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate.|$|E

5|$|The Han {{campaigns against}} Minyue were {{a series of}} three Han {{military}} campaigns dispatched against the Minyue state. The first campaign was in response to Minyue's invasion of Eastern Ou in 138BC. In 135BC, a second campaign was sent to intervene in a war between Minyue and Nanyue. After the campaign, Minyue was partitioned into Minyue, <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Han proxy king, and Dongyue. Dongyue was defeated in a third military campaign in 111BC and the former Minyue territory was annexed by the Han Empire.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, {{there was a new}} level of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.|$|E

5|$|Charles counted his regnal {{years from}} this coronation, but Hungary had {{actually}} disintegrated into {{about a dozen}} independent provinces, each <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> powerful lord, or oligarch. Among them, Matthew Csák dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary (which now form the western territories of present-day Slovakia), Amadeus Aba controlled the northeastern lands, Ivan Kőszegi ruled Transdanubia, and Ladislaus Kán governed Transylvania. Most of those lords refused to accept Charles's rule and proposed the crown to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia's son and namesake, Wenceslaus, whose bride, Elisabeth, was AndrewIII's only daughter. Although Wenceslaus was crowned with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár, the legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because John Hont-Pázmány, Archbishop of Kalocsa, put the crown on Wenceslaus's head, although customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Different peoples {{inhabited}} the city, including the Halafians, Semites and the Hurrians. Tell Brak was a religious center from its earliest periods; its famous Eye Temple {{is unique in}} the Fertile Crescent, and its main deity, Belet-Nagar, was revered in the entire Khabur region, making the city a pilgrimage site. The culture of Tell Brak was defined by the different civilizations that inhabited it, and it was famous for its glyptic style, equids and glass. When independent, the city was <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> local assembly or by a monarch. Tell Brak was a trade center due to its location between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. It was excavated by Max Mallowan in 1937, then regularly by different teams between 1979 and 2011, when the work stopped due to the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} empire into four regions, each <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{separate}} emperor, the Tetrarchy. Confident that he fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome, he abdicated {{along with his}} co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire.|$|E

5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E
5|$|From 1603, {{when the}} Scottish monarch James VI {{inherited}} the English throne as James I, both the English and Scottish kingdoms were <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single sovereign. From 1649 to 1660, {{the tradition of}} monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England, which followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The Act of Settlement 1701 excluded Roman Catholics, or those who married Catholics, from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The British monarch became nominal head of the vast British Empire, which covered {{a quarter of the}} world's surface at its greatest extent in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-12th century Ireland was <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} local kings, {{although}} their authority was more limited {{than their counterparts in}} the rest of western Europe. Mainstream Europeans regarded the Irish as relatively barbarous and backward. In the 1160s King Diarmait Mac Murchada was deposed as King of Leinster by the High King of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair. Diarmait turned to Henry for assistance in 1167, and the English king agreed to allow Diarmait to recruit mercenaries within his empire. Diarmait put together a force of Anglo-Norman and Flemish mercenaries drawn from the Welsh Marches, including Richard de Clare. With his new supporters, he reclaimed Leinster but died shortly afterwards in 1171; de Clare then claimed Leinster for himself. The situation in Ireland was tense and the Anglo-Normans heavily outnumbered.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda {{had been}} <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Tutsi monarchy {{since at least}} the 18th century, with entrenched pro-Tutsi and anti-Hutu policies. Germany and Belgium {{successively}} controlled Rwanda through the early 20th century, with both European nations ruling through the kings and perpetuating a pro-Tutsi policy. After 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed, leading to the deterioration of relations between the groups. The Tutsi leadership agitated for speedy independence to cement their power, and the Hutu elite called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu (a stance increasingly supported by the Roman Catholic Church and the colonial government).|$|E

The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian-era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and plastered walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor. Evidence exists for the presence of Minoan Aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes {{on the walls of the}} palaces in Alalakh.|$|E
