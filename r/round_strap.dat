60|$|The man was {{too frightened}} to scream, but he {{struggled}} wildly, while Evan MacIan, whose long, lean hands were unusually powerful, tightened some old curtain cords <b>round</b> him, <b>strapped</b> a rope gag {{in his mouth and}} rolled him on his back on the floor.|$|R
60|$|He swung them <b>round</b> by the <b>straps</b> and {{let them}} go, and when the last splashed into a boggy patch {{on the other side}} Miss Jardine laughed.|$|R
60|$|Upon his portly {{figure in}} front he was {{supporting}} the big drum, which was securely <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> his shoulders with tarred cordages, the spoil of some fishing vessel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you seen}} a motley crowd making a disturbance?" [...] Grower said magisterially {{to one of}} these in a fustian jacket, who smoked a short pipe and wore <b>straps</b> <b>round</b> his knees.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now to horse, both of you," [...] {{he added}} gaily. [...] "Hastings, {{when you are}} ready, I will hand up the child to you. He will be quite safe on the pillion with a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> him and you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{fastened}} the <b>straps</b> <b>round</b> Dan's broad shoulders. His {{shirt was}} as wet {{as if he}} had fallen overboard. Maybe some of that wet was spray. His face was purple, his big arms bulging, and he whistled as he breathed.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Pollock was {{responsible}} for introducing the ref-cam in the Super Rugby. During the round 2 derby match between Queensland Reds and New South Wales Waratahs, Pollock has a cam <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> his head to show a different perspective to the game.|$|R
6000|$|In {{half an hour}} Powers returned. He {{was wearing}} now his hat and light overcoat, and carried on a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his neck a tin box with a white painted label, [...] "British Foreign Office. Confidential Despatches. This Side Up With Care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} into another man's house with a hurdy-gurdy," [...] said Lord Lundie, recoiling, as Giuseppe unshipped the working {{mechanism}} of the organ (it developed a hang-down leg) from its wheels, slipped a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his shoulders, and gave the handle a twist.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I was tryin' {{to learn}} how to swing <b>round</b> the ring, <b>strapped</b> to a rope, I should say that I got along first rate; but I don't know much about the horse, for I was only on his back a little while at a time." ...|$|R
60|$|Seeing him {{sleeping}} so peacefully, Harold {{passed a}} <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> him {{to prevent him}} falling from his seat. Then he could let his thoughts run more freely. Her safety was his immediate concern; again and again he thought over what he should say to Leonard to ensure his silence.|$|R
60|$|The safe was ajar, and Holmes {{standing}} in front of it was removing dossier after dossier, swiftly examining each, and then packing it neatly in Von Bork's valise. The German lay upon the sofa sleeping stertorously with a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his upper arms and another round his legs.|$|R
60|$|Arabella was {{preparing}} {{breakfast in the}} downstairs back room of this small, recently hired tenement of her father's. She put her head into the little pork-shop in front, and told Mr. Donn it was ready. Donn, endeavouring {{to look like a}} master pork-butcher, in a greasy blue blouse, and with a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his waist from which a steel dangled, came in promptly.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one {{childhood}} rhabdomyosarcomas {{were divided}} into three groups {{on the basis of}} cytologic composition. The tumors in group P consisted entirely of primitive mesenchymal cells, whereas those in groups M and W were characterized by the additional presence of numerous <b>round</b> rhabdomyoblasts and <b>strap</b> cells, respectively. The tumors were studied for the universal mesenchymal intermediate filament vimentin, and for the muscle-specific intermediate filament desmin. Vimentin positivity, which tended to be more prominent in primitive tumor cells, was found in all tumors, whereas desmin was found especially in <b>round</b> rhabdomyoblasts and <b>strap</b> cells. Desmin-positive primitive cells were found only in groups M and W, not in group P. It was concluded that the differentiation from primitive mesenchymal cells to morphologically recognizable myogenic tumor cells is accompanied by an increase in desmin positivity and, presumably, a decrease in vimentin positivity. Moreover, the observations suggest the existence of a group of "committed" cells that are morphologically primitive, but desmin-positive. These cells might {{play an important role in}} the observed further differentiation of rhabdomyosarcomas under chemotherapy...|$|R
6000|$|I like on Autumn evenings to ride out, [...] Without {{being forced}} to bid my groom be sure [...] My cloak is <b>round</b> his middle <b>strapped</b> about, [...] Because the skies are not the most secure; [...] I know too that, if stopped upon my route, [...] Where the green alleys windingly allure, [...] Reeling with grapes red wagons choke the way,-- [...] In England 'twould be dung, dust, or a dray.|$|R
60|$|When the Captain had wound a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> {{the closed}} kite, to {{restrain}} its volatile nature, he opened another large case which contained several reels of strong cord, somewhat resembling log-lines, {{but with this}} peculiarity, that, alongside of each thick cord there ran a thin red line of twine, connected with though not bound to the other by means of little loops or rings of twine fixed about six feet apart throughout its entire length.|$|R
60|$|He wore, {{hanging with}} a long <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his neck, a kind of scrip or wallet, in which to carry food. The widow set some bread and cheese before him, but he thanked her, and said that through the {{kindness}} of the charitable he had broken his fast once since morning, and was not hungry. When he had made her this reply, he opened his wallet, {{and took out a}} few pence, which was all it appeared to contain.|$|R
40|$|Cocktail {{ensemble}} of heavy black silk faille, consisting of: A) Dress. Long dress, sleeveless, narrow <b>straps,</b> <b>rounded</b> neckline, higher in front. Slightly raised waist. Left side zipper. Very full skirt gathered into waist. Designer's label at inside skirt side seam: "Traina-Norell / New York" B) Jacket. Waist length jacket with rounded collar, short, highly puffed "pumpkin" sleeves which gather into shoulders. Center front opening with four black covered buttons. Flares from waist. Designer's label at inside back collar: "Traina-Norell / New York...|$|R
60|$|The {{door was}} flung back till it kicked {{the wall and}} trembled {{from top to bottom}} with the blow. Mr. Oak {{appeared}} in the entry with a steaming face, hay-bands wound about his ankles to keep out the snow, a leather <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his waist outside the smock-frock, and looking altogether an epitome of the world's health and vigour. Four lambs hung in various embarrassing attitudes over his shoulders, and the dog George, whom Gabriel had contrived to fetch from Norcombe, stalked solemnly behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{exactly that}} sort of pinion," [...] said the Wheel, [...] "but a really ornate circle of toothed iron wheels. Absurd, of course, but gratifying. Mr. Mangles and an {{associate}} herald invested me with it personally--on my left rim--the side that you can't see from the mill. I hadn't meant {{to say anything about}} it--or the new steel <b>straps</b> <b>round</b> my axles--bright red, you know--to be worn on all occasions--but, without false modesty, I assure you that the recognition cheered me not a little." ...|$|R
60|$|The Sergeant, who has risen, {{comes to}} Naryshkin's rescue, and grasps Claire's hands, {{enabling}} Naryshkin to gag her again. By this time Edstaston and his captors are all rolling {{on the ground}} together. They get Edstaston {{on his back and}} fasten his wrists together behind his knees. Next they put a broad <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his ribs. Finally they pass a pole through this breast strap and through the waist strap and lift him by it, helplessly trussed up, to carry him of. Meanwhile he is by no means suffering in silence.|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} days before further tidings were {{obtained}} of Bruce. Archie {{did not leave}} his tent during this time, giving as a reason that he was afraid if he went out he should meet some of Lorne's men, who might take up the quarrel {{of the man who}} had been killed. At length, however, another traitor came in, and Pembroke and his party set out as before, Hector being this time muzzled by a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his jaw, which would not interfere with his scent, but would prevent him from widely opening his jaws.|$|R
60|$|Lucy lay {{perfectly}} still, for {{she knew}} she had been thrown near the spot where the gun lay. If she got her hands on that gun she would kill Joel. It would be the action of an instant. She watched Joel while he watched her. And she saw that he had his foot on the rope round Sage King's neck. The King never liked a rope. He was nervous. He tossed his head to get rid of it. Creech, watching Lucy all the while, reached for the rope, pulled the King closer and closer, and untied the knot. The King stood then, bridle down and quiet. Instead of a saddle he wore a blanket <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> him.|$|R
50|$|Pironkova {{entered the}} 2017 Wimbledon Championships next, drawing the former world no. 5 Sara Errani {{in the first}} round, a match that she {{eventually}} won comfortably in just over an hour, {{with the loss of}} just five games. Pironkova was dubbed as the darkhorse and one of most dangerous unseeded player in draw by WTA insider David Kane prior to the tournament, and her potential second round encounter with former world no. 1 Caroline Wozniacki was variously dubbed one of most anticipated matches in the early <b>rounds.</b> With heavy <b>strapping</b> on her left thigh, Pironkova lost a closely contested two set match against Wozniacki. The former played erratically, with both winners and unforced errors flowing from her racket incongruously.|$|R
50|$|Pottery {{made by the}} Caborn-Welborn {{women was}} built up from strips of clay, and then {{smoothed}} out by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area, where the potters wheel was unknown. Common vessel shapes include jars, bowls, pans, plates and funnels. Most jars tend to have rims with <b>rounded</b> necks and <b>strap</b> handles. The majority of the pottery found at Caborn-Welborn sites are of the kinds known as Mississippian Plain and Bell Plain, which are varieties very common to most Mississippian cultures throughout the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. It was buff colored, contains large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and is not as smooth and polished as other varieties.|$|R
60|$|When his baggage {{had been}} {{strapped}} on a pack-mule, he mounted and rode out of Villa Paz as if making for Valverde, {{but as soon}} as they had left the last of the houses behind he pulled up and quietly studied his guide. He was a sturdy, brown-faced peon, dressed in ragged white cotton, with raw-hide sandals and a colored blanket <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> his shoulders, but he looked trustworthy. Moreover, Cliffe thought his willingness to assist a foreigner who was leaving the President's house without an escort, which must have shown that he had lost the autocrat's favor, had some significance. It was unfortunate that he could not speak much Castilian, but he knew that money talks in a language that is generally understood.|$|R
60|$|Without {{replying}} Charl and his comrade Joe rose, {{and receiving}} a lantern from her went {{out at the}} back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly {{at the edge of the}} stream already mentioned. Beyond the stream was the open moor, from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces as they advanced. Taking up the board that had lain in readiness one of them lowered it across the water, and the instant its further end touched the ground footsteps entered upon it, and there appeared from the shade a stalwart man with <b>straps</b> <b>round</b> his knees, a double-barrelled gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him. They asked him if he had had much luck.|$|R
60|$|Mayne {{signed to}} the {{quartermaster}} {{in the pilot}} house and the bows swung round. Half an hour afterwards, he rang his telegraph and the clang of engines died away while the throb of the propeller stopped. In what seemed an unnatural silence, a few barefooted deck-hands began to move about, and one stood on the forecastle, where his dark figure cut against the shining sea. The rest went aft with a line the other held, and when Mayne raised his hand there was a splash as the deep-sea lead plunged. A man aft called the depth while he gathered up the line, and Mayne beckoned another, who climbed to a little platform outside the bridge and fastened a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his waist.|$|R
60|$|The summer {{dress of}} the Indian {{is almost entirely}} {{provided}} for him by the Hudson Bay Company. It consists chiefly of a blue or grey cloth, or else a blanket capote reaching below the knee, made much too loose for the figure, and <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> the waist with a scarlet or crimson worsted belt. A very coarse blue striped cotton shirt is all the underclothing they wear, holding trousers to be quite superfluous; in lieu of which they make leggins of various kinds of cloth, which reach from a few inches above the knee down to the ankle. These leggins are sometimes very tastefully decorated with bead-work, particularly those of the women, and are provided with flaps or wings on either side.|$|R
6000|$|As if {{that mental}} {{question}} had evoked the familiar phantom, Haldin stood suddenly before {{him in the}} room with an extraordinary completeness of detail. Though the short winter day had passed already into the sinister twilight of a land buried in snow, Razumov saw plainly the narrow leather <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> the Tcherkess coat. The illusion of that hateful presence was so perfect that he half expected it to ask, [...] "Is the outer door closed?" [...] He looked at it with hatred and contempt. Souls do not take a shape of clothing. Moreover, Haldin could not be dead yet. Razumov stepped forward menacingly; the vision vanished--and turning short on his heel he walked out of his room with infinite disdain.|$|R
6000|$|With {{those ideas}} of {{industry}} {{in his head}} {{the warmth of his}} room was agreeable and encouraging. [...] "I shall put in four hours of good work," [...] he thought. But no sooner had he closed the door than he was horribly startled. All black against the usual tall stove of white tiles gleaming in the dusk, stood a strange figure, wearing a skirted, close-fitting, brown cloth coat <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> the waist, in long boots, and with a little Astrakhan cap on its head. It loomed lithe and martial. Razumov was utterly confounded. It was only when the figure advancing two paces asked in an untroubled, grave voice if the outer door was closed that he regained his power of speech.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} Guy was ready to start. He could not help looking with disfavour at the greasy and stained garments, and he put them on with an {{expression}} of strong disgust. The two suits that he had taken off he made up into a bundle, placed the disguise he had brought with him with them, putting up separately that of which the count had spoken, and which was so ragged and dirty that he inwardly hoped he might never be obliged to assume it; then he went downstairs again. He had <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> his waist a heavy sword placed beside the clothes, and carried in his hand a short pike. Dame Margaret smiled when he entered, and Katarina laughed aloud at the expression of his face.|$|R
60|$|To {{describe}} {{my little}} caravan. Foremost struts Raghe, our Eesa guide, {{in all the}} bravery of Abbanship. He is bareheaded and clothed in Tobe and slippers: a long, heavy, horn-hilted dagger is <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> his waist, outside his dress; {{in his right hand}} he grasps a ponderous wire-bound spear, which he uses as a staff, and the left forearm supports a round targe of battered hide. Being a man of education, he bears on one shoulder a Musalla or prayer carpet of tanned leather, the article used throughout the Somali country; slung over the other is a Wesi or wicker bottle containing water for religious ablution. He is accompanied by some men who carry a little stock of town goods and drive a camel colt, which by the by they manage to lose before midnight.|$|R
60|$|Councillor Mikulin {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} slightly, and Razumov got up with an effort. There was nothing now to stay for in that room. Haldin had been hanged at four o'clock. There could be no doubt of that. He had, it seemed, entered upon his future existence, long boots, Astrakhan fur cap and all, down to the very leather <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> his waist. A flickering, vanishing sort of existence. It was not his soul, it was his mere phantom he had left behind on this earth--thought Razumov, smiling caustically to himself while he crossed the room, utterly forgetful of where he was and of Councillor Mikulin's existence. The official could have set a lot of bells ringing all over the building without leaving his chair. He let Razumov go quite {{up to the door}} before he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.25]stuck in the belt, and {{a mighty}} rosary, which on {{occasion}} {{might have been}} converted into a weapon of offence, completed my equipment. I must not omit to mention the proper method of carrying money, which in these lands should never be entrusted to box or bag. A common cotton purse secured in a breast pocket (for Egypt now abounds in that civilised animal, the pick-pocket!), contained silver pieces and small change.[FN#14] My gold, of which I carried twenty-five sovereigns, and papers, were committed to a substantial leathern belt of Maghrabi manufacture, made to be <b>strapped</b> <b>round</b> the waist under the dress. This is the Asiatic method of concealing valuables, and one more civilised than ours in the last century, when Roderic Random and his companion [...] "sewed their money between the lining and the waist-band of their breeches, except some loose silver for immediate ...|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, {{there is}} a form of {{glockenspiel}} called a bell lyre, bell lyra, or lyra-glockenspiel. The bell lyre {{is a form of}} glockenspiel commonly used in marching bands. It is played upright and has an extendable spike which is held on a strap. The player marches with the strap over his shoulder and plays the instrument upright with a beater. Another variation of the bell lyre exists which is held by a <b>strap</b> <b>round</b> the shoulders and back. This variation is played horizontally with two beaters as it {{does not need to be}} held upright. Since the middle of the 19th century this form of the instrument has also been used in military and civil bands in Germany, where it is called a Stahlspiel or Militär-Glockenspiel. The all-percussion Drum and lyre corps in the Philippines uses this as a main instrument.|$|R
