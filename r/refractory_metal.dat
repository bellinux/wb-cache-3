5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a <b>refractory</b> <b>metal.</b> It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> alloys of molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and {{tungsten}} {{have been}} applied to space nuclear power systems. These systems were designed to operate at temperatures from 1350 K to approximately 1900 K. An environment must not interact with the material in question. Liquid alkali metals as the heat transfer fluids are used {{as well as the}} ultra-high vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Molten salts can {{be highly}} {{corrosive}} and corrosivity increases with temperature. For the primary cooling loop, a material is needed that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures and intense radiation. Experiments show that Hastelloy-N and similar alloys are suited to these tasks at operating temperatures up to about 700°C. However, operating experience is limited. Still higher operating temperatures are desirable – at 850°C thermochemical production of hydrogen becomes possible. Materials for this temperature range have not been validated, though carbon composites, molybdenum alloys (e.g. TZM), carbides, and <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> based or ODS alloys might be feasible.|$|E
25|$|Creep {{resistance}} {{is a key}} property of the <b>refractory</b> <b>metals.</b> In metals, the starting of creep correlates with the melting point of the material; the creep in aluminium alloys starts at 200°C, while for <b>refractory</b> <b>metals</b> temperatures above 1500°C are necessary. This resistance against deformation at high temperatures makes the <b>refractory</b> <b>metals</b> suitable against strong forces at high temperature, for example in jet engines, or tools used during forging.|$|R
40|$|Advanced Rankine {{and other}} {{proposed}} space power systems utilize <b>refractory</b> <b>metals</b> {{in contact with}} both single-phase and two-phase alkali metals at elevated temperatures. A number of recent compatibility experiments are described which emphasize the excellent compatibility of <b>refractory</b> <b>metals</b> with the alkali metals, lithium, sodium, and potassium, {{under a variety of}} environmental conditions. The alkali metal compatibilities of tantalum-, columbium-, molybdenum-, and tungsten-base alloys are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Radioactive {{beams of}} {{specific}} isotopes {{are widely used}} {{in the fields of}} experimental physics, biology and materials science. The production and formation of these radioactive atoms into an ionic beam for study is an entire field of research carried out at many laboratories throughout the world. The first isotope separator was developed at the Copenhagen Cyclotron by Bohr and coworkers using the principle of electromagnetic separation. Today, there are many laboratories around the world that supply beams of radioactive ions for use. Arguably the principal Isotope Separator On Line (ISOL) is ISOLDE at CERN, which is a joint European facility spread across the Franco-Swiss border near the city of Geneva. This laboratory uses mainly proton spallation of uranium carbide targets to produce a wide range of radioactive fission fragments that are not found naturally on earth. During spallation (bombardment with high energy protons), a uranium carbide target is heated to several thousand degrees so that radioactive atoms produced in the nuclear reaction are released. Once out of the target, the vapour of radioactive atoms travels to an ionizer cavity. This ionizer cavity is a thin tube made of a <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> with a high work function allowing for collisions with the walls to liberate a single electron from a free atom (surface ionization effect). Once ionized, the radioactive species are accelerated by an electrostatic field and injected into an electromagnetic separator. As ions entering the separator are of approximately equal energy, those ions with a smaller mass will be deflected by the magnetic field by a greater amount than those with a heavier mass. This differing radius of curvature allows for isobaric purification to take place. Once purified isobarically, the ion beam is then sent to the individual experiments. In order to increase the purity of the isobaric beam, laser ionization can take place inside the ionizer cavity to selectively ionize a single element chain of interest. At CERN, this device is called the Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS). Currently over 60% of all experiments opt to use the RILIS to increase the purity of radioactive beams.|$|E
500|$|Rhenium ( [...] meaning: [...] "Rhine") was the last-discovered of the {{elements}} that have a stable isotope (other new elements discovered in nature since then, such as francium, are radioactive). The existence of a yet-undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been first predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev. Other calculated information was obtained by Henry Moseley in 1914. It is generally considered to have been discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg in Germany. In 1925 they {{reported that they had}} detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in gadolinite and molybdenite. In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of the element by processing 660kg of molybdenite. It was estimated in 1968 that 75% of the rhenium metal in the United States was used for research and the development of <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> alloys. It took several years from that point before the superalloys became widely used.|$|E
2500|$|Refractory metals {{are used}} in lighting, tools, lubricants, nuclear {{reaction}} control rods, as catalysts, and for their chemical or electrical properties. [...] Because of their high melting point, <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> components are never fabricated by casting. [...] The process of powder metallurgy is used.

2500|$|Rhenium is {{the most}} {{recently}} discovered <b>refractory</b> <b>metal.</b> [...] It is found in low concentrations with many other metals, in the ores of other refractory metals, platinum or copper ores. [...] It is useful as an alloy to other refractory metals, where it adds ductility and tensile strength. Rhenium alloys are being used in electronic components, gyroscopes and nuclear reactors. [...] Rhenium finds its most important use as a catalyst. [...] It {{is used as a}} catalyst in reactions such as alkylation, dealkylation, hydrogenation and oxidation. [...] However its rarity makes it the most expensive of the refractory metals.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she looked}} about the vessel. The deck, finely laid with narrow planks, was {{littered}} with odd spars, rusty chain, coal bags, and pieces of greasy machinery, as if repairs and refitting were going on. She was a very small, two-masted steamer, carrying some sail, for smoke-grimed canvas was furled along the booms, and Evelyn thought she had been built for a yacht. Her narrow beam, her graceful sweep of teakwood rail, and the long, tapering counter suggested speed. A low, lead-gray funnel stood just forward of the mainmast, and a teak house, rising three or four feet above the deck, occupied part of her length. The brass boss of the steering wheel bore the name Enchantress. The after end of the house, however, was built of iron, with raised lights in the top, and the hammering and the pointed remarks that came up indicated that somebody below was grappling with <b>refractory</b> <b>metal.</b> After one exclamation, Evelyn's companion walked to the skylights.|$|E

50|$|The heat {{produced}} by this torch {{is sufficient to}} weld tungsten (3422 °C), the most <b>refractory</b> <b>metal.</b> The presence of hydrogen also acts as a shielding gas, preventing oxidation and contamination by carbon, nitrogen or oxygen, which can severely damage the properties of many metals.

2500|$|Niobium {{is nearly}} always found {{together}} with tantalum, {{and was named}} after Niobe, {{the daughter of the}} mythical Greek king Tantalus for whom tantalum was named. [...] Niobium has many uses, some of which it shares with other <b>refractory</b> <b>metals.</b> [...] It is unique in that it can be worked through annealing to achieve a wide range of strength and elasticity, and is the least dense of the <b>refractory</b> <b>metals.</b> It can also be found in electrolytic capacitors and in the most practical superconducting alloys. [...] Niobium can be found in aircraft gas turbines, vacuum tubes and nuclear reactors.|$|R

50|$|Electromigration moving atoms out {{of active}} regions, causing dislocations and point defects acting as nonradiative {{recombination}} centers producing heat. This may occur with aluminium gates in MESFETs with RF signals, causing erratic drain current; electromigration {{in this case}} is called gate sinking. This issue does not occur with gold gates. With structures having aluminium over a <b>refractory</b> <b>metal</b> barrier, electromigration primarily affects aluminium but not the <b>refractory</b> <b>metal,</b> causing the structure's resistance to erratically increase. Displaced aluminium may cause shorts to neighbouring structures; 0.5-4% of copper in the aluminium increases electromigration resistance, the copper accumulating on the alloy grain boundaries and increasing the energy needed to dislodge atoms from them. Other than that, indium tin oxide and silver are subject to electromigration, causing leakage current and (in LEDs) nonradiative recombination along chip edges. In all cases, electromigration can cause changes in dimensions and parameters of the transistor gates and semiconductor junctions.|$|E
