40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the reproducibility and {{consistency of the}} new mydriasis-free electroretinogram (ERG) with a skin electrode (RETeval) device, to determine the normative values of parameters, and to clarify the usefulness of pupil records to colored-light stimulus. Methods. A total of 100 eyes of 50 healthy subjects (mean age, 21. 4 years) were enrolled. The diagnostic parameters obtained by the RETeval device were examined under the following conditions. The reproducibility was determined with the coefficient of variation (CV). The consistency was examined by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The mean value and the normal range were analyzed with a 95 % confidence interval as the normative values of parameters. The correlation of parameters to pupil <b>records</b> (<b>area</b> ratio, constriction ratio) and flicker ERG was also examined in the diabetic retinopathy assessment protocol. Results. From the CV {{for each of the}} two measurements, the amplitude has a low reproducibility compared with the implicit time. Generally good consistency was obtained with both ERG parameters (ICCs = 0. 48 – 0. 92). Moderate correlations were found for the white-, red-, and blue-light stimulus in the area ratio and the constriction ratio, respectively (r = 0. 44 – 0. 62; P = 0. 010 –< 0. 0001). No correlation was observed between pupil and flicker parameters (r = 0. 06 – 0. 34; P = 0. 646 – 0. 051). Conclusions. The RETeval device was suggested as a possible screening device to detect the visual afferent diseases by evaluating in combination with the ERG recording and the colored-light pupil response...|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} {{assessing}} communication challenges between clerks and deaf patients at Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital {{was conducted in}} 2010. The aim {{was to assess the}} existence of communication challenges, possible reasons and solutions to these. The literature reviewed identified a gap in the knowledge of communication between staff and deaf patients. A health systems’ study was conducted using a descriptive, cross sectional survey. The study population was made up of 33 clerks who worked at the registration and <b>records</b> <b>area</b> and deaf patients who stayed at Efata and received health services from the hospital. All clerks were interviewed and a random sample of 106 deaf patients was estimated using Epidat statistical software. Self administered questionnaires were used for data collection. Results confirmed the existence of communication challenges between the two groups. A majority of clerks were not trained in Sign Language. They used a combination of methods to communicate with deaf patients, and few clerks could use Sign Language. The patients also used a combination of methods due to the frustration of not having a common method of communication with clerks. The findings clearly showed that there are communication challenges between the two groups and Sign Language needed to be introduced to clerks in order to accommodate deaf patients. Further research may be done on all healthcare providers and to all deaf patients in the region served by Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, and this could {{have a positive impact on}} the quality of service offered by the hospital to the deaf community...|$|E
