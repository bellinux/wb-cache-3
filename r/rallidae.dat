5|$|<b>Rallidae</b> is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.|$|E

5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a relationship to the <b>Rallidae</b> has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities have historically been suggested for the dodo, including {{that it was a}} small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E

5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail (Atlantisia rogersi) {{is a small}} bird of {{the rail}} family, <b>Rallidae.</b> It is the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Endemic to Inaccessible Island in the Tristan Archipelago in the {{isolated}} south Atlantic, it is notable for being the smallest extant flightless bird in the world. The species was described by physician Percy Lowe in 1923 but had first come {{to the attention of}} scientists 50 years earlier. The Inaccessible Island rail's closest relatives are uncertain but may be crakes in the genus Laterallus.|$|E
5|$|The grey-necked wood rail or grey-cowled wood rail (Aramides cajaneus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family <b>Rallidae,</b> the rails. It lives {{primarily}} in the forests, mangroves, and swamps of Central and South America. Of the two subspecies, A. c. avicenniae is found in southeastern Brazil, while the nominate is found throughout {{the portion of the}} range not occupied by the other subspecies. The species as a whole is usually found at elevations from sea level to , although some have been found above that. This bird's large extent of occurrence along with its population is why it is considered to be least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In some places, it is occasionally hunted and kept for food.|$|E
25|$|The American coot {{was first}} {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. A {{member of the}} family <b>Rallidae,</b> it has three subspecies: Fulica americana alai, F. a. caribaea, and F. a. ardesiaca. These subspecies, however, are sometimes considered to be their own separate species. Including these 'subspecies', there are 11 members of the genus Fulica distributed across the globe.|$|E
25|$|The American coot (Fulica americana), {{also known}} as a mud hen, is a bird of the family <b>Rallidae.</b> Though {{commonly}} mistaken to be ducks, American coots belong to a distinct order. Unlike the webbed feet of ducks, coots have broad, lobed scales on their lower legs and toes that fold back with each step in order to facilitate walking on dry land. Coots live near water, typically inhabiting wetlands and open water bodies in North America. Groups of coots are called covers or rafts. The oldest known coot lived to be 22 years old.|$|E
25|$|The loon, {{the size}} of a large duck or small goose, resembles these birds in shape when swimming. Like ducks and geese but unlike coots (which are <b>Rallidae)</b> and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are {{connected}} by webbing. The bird may be confused with cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), which are not too distant relatives of divers and like them are heavy set birds whose bellies – unlike those of ducks and geese – are submerged when swimming. Flying loons resemble plump geese with seagulls' wings that are relatively small in proportion to the bulky body. The bird points its head slightly upwards during swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.|$|E
500|$|In 1875, A. Newton also {{identified}} {{a reference to}} the bird in the 1726 account of the French traveller Julien Tafforet, which had then recently been rediscovered. In 1879, more fossils, including skulls, were described by the zoologists Albert Günther and Edward Newton (brother of Alfred), who confirmed that the bird was a rail (<b>rallidae),</b> but also noted that some specimens had beaks as curved as that of the red rail. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that Leguat's description referred to wind-blown purple swamphens (Porphyrio), since the word grey is sometimes used synonymously with blue in old descriptions. This idea has not been accepted by other commentators. In 1999, the French palaeontologist Cécile Mourer-Chauviré and his colleagues pointed out that a carpometacarpus bone assigned to the Rodrigues rail and illustrated by Günther and A. Newton in 1879 does not belong to a rail, and therefore not this bird. More subfossils have since been discovered, including an associated but incomplete skeleton with a complete skull and jaws found in Caverne Poule Rouge in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of the Inaccessible Island rail in the larger rail family (<b>Rallidae)</b> {{has been a source}} of uncertainty. Lowe thought that its closest relatives may have been black crake of Africa, or perhaps an early offshoot of the genus Porphyrio (swamphens), a conclusion based mostly on similarities of plumage. He did concede that it was difficult to assign the rail to any relatives. American paleontologist Storrs Olson suggested [...] in 1973 that it was related to the [...] "Rallus assemblage", which included the genera Rallus and Hypotaenidia (now lumped with Gallirallus), based on the structure of the skeleton. In particular he suggested it was part of a pro-Rallus group that included the Indian Ocean genus Dryolimnas, and the Australasian Lewinia. Olson suggested the pro-Rallus rails have a relict distribution and would have been present in Africa and South America, from where the ancestors of the Inaccessible Island rail came from. The most recent study to include the genus, in 1998, compared the morphology of the rails and other Gruiformes and placed it in the crake clade, subtribe Crecina. Its exact position was uncertain but it appears to be basal within that clade, and perhaps the sister taxon to the genus Laterallus, a genus of small crakes found mostly in South America.|$|E
