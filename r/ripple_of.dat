5|$|When {{the news}} of the {{ordinance}} proposal was reported in December 1976, a small <b>ripple</b> <b>of</b> protest spread from local churches. Northwest Baptist Church announced it from the pulpit. The news worried one of the church members named Anita Bryant, who was a 36-year-old singer celebrity. Bryant began her career as a local child star on a television show in Oklahoma City and on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. Her young life was marked by frequent moves; her parents divorced each other twice, and she often lived in poverty conditions, but she became a born again Christian at eight years old, and counted her faith and her participation at church as the stabilizing influences in her life. As a child, she asked God to make her a star. She was, by her own admission, remarkably driven and ambitious. In her older teens she became a beauty pageant contestant, winning Miss Oklahoma and second runner-up as Miss America. In 1960, she married a Miami disc jockey named Bob Green and became a professional singer, finding some success with three gold records featuring popular, patriotic, and Gospel standards. She performed with the Bob Hope Christmas tour, entertaining troops serving overseas, and sang at President Lyndon Johnson's funeral in 1973. Since 1969 she had been employed regionally by the Florida Citrus Commission endorsing Florida orange juice in television commercials. She also advertised for Coca-Cola, Tupperware, Kraft Foods and Holiday Inn. Bryant's talent agent was married to Ruth Shack; Bryant had contributed $1,000 to her campaign.|$|E
25|$|Further {{innovations}} can {{be found}} in the detailing of surface textures, especially in the reflections and refractions. This is best seen in the fall of light on the armor in the Knights of Christ panel, and the <b>ripple</b> <b>of</b> the water in the Fountain of life in the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb. Yet although the work contains many individual innovations, it did not emerge spontaneously, but is rather part of a long tradition of oil painting and altarpiece design of the southern Netherlands. A great number of these works were destroyed during the iconoclasm of the mid 16th century, a period in which the Ghent Altarpiece was twice nearly destroyed; on 19 August 1566, and again in 1576 when a special guard was put on the work to protect it from rioters.|$|E

500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] is an uptempo R and Dance-pop {{song with}} {{elements}} of dancehall music. It is performed with a brightdance beat and a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song {{is set in}} common time, composed in the key of E major with the vocal elements spanning from the low note of C4 to the high note of D5. The band members' vocals in [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] were described as [...] "breathy". The song features fast snare drum sequences, choppy beats with hand-clappy percussion, cymbal crashes, and itchy hi-hats, creating a military sound reminiscent to a drumline of a marching band. The opening drum sequence is sampled from the drumline of [...] "Taps" [...] performed by the University of Michigan Marching Band. Synthesizer blips are also utilized in the song's melody. Along with those instruments, the complex backing track of the song uses various sound effects such as <b>ripple</b> <b>of</b> claps, stomps, thumps, snare rolls, and gasps.|$|E
500|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} {{under the}} influence of Agnes caused more than a <b>ripple</b> <b>of</b> scandal in the aristocratic circles of the Holy Roman Empire. [...] Descended as he was from the hereditary seneschals of Waldburg, Gebhard came from a line of stalwart Catholic defenders of what was considered the universal faith. One of his uncles was the bishop of Augsburg; his grandfather's brother had been a general in the German Peasants' War of 1525 and instrumental in the destruction of the German Peasant army. The family had been long-time supporters of Habsburg dynastic aspirations and policies, and key advisers for in the often-troubled Imperial relationships with the Swabian Imperial circle (Kreis). [...] Gebhard himself had been raised in a Catholic tradition, and strongly influenced by the Jesuits in his education. His career had been solely focused on obtaining a preferential position in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and his election as the archbishop of Cologne, in a close contest with the equally-qualified Wittelsbach candidate, attested not to the diligence and application of his personal faith, but his family's Imperial influence.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{was hired}} by the United States Bureau of the Mint as a Class D {{temporary}} clerk in 1904, when she was 38 years old, older than most new employees. She served in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Bureau of the Mint, where Mint Director George E. Roberts was impressed by her business experience and competence. [...] Initially having only temporary status, she was made a permanent employee in 1905, and was promoted again that year to Clerk Class I at a salary of $1,200. When Margaret Kelly was commissioned Examiner of the Bureau of the Mint in 1911, the <b>ripple</b> <b>of</b> promotions in her wake included O'Reilly, who became adjuster of accounts. [...] This made her in effect the chief clerk of the Mint Bureau, with responsibility for reviewing all contracts. According to Teva J. Scheer, biographer of Nellie Tayloe Ross (O'Reilly's final Mint Director before retirement) [...] "it must have required an almost unprecedented combination of drive and intelligence for [...] to have climbed so far up through the organization in her male-dominated work environment".|$|E

In 2008, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008. The singer has performed in charity reliefs like Sydney's Sound Relief concert. She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album. In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV. In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the United States, raising more than $750,000. In 2012, Swift supported Architecture for Humanity's Restore the Shore MTV telethon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In 2016, she made donations to the Louisiana flood relief and Dolly Parton Fire Fund.|$|E

Wellington then stood up in Copenhagen's stirrups, and waved his hat {{in the air to}} signal an advance of the Allied line just as the Prussians were overrunning the French positions to the east. What remained of the French army then abandoned the field in disorder. Wellington and Blücher met at the inn of La Belle Alliance, on the north-south road which bisected the battlefield, and it was agreed that the Prussians should pursue the retreating French army back to France. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815.|$|E
