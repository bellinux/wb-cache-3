Thus, <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression</b> problem is the one-dimensional stationary time series denoising problem in nature, and SSA algorithm is a prevalent algorithm when clustering subspace models are applied to time series datasets [7]. The aim of SSA is to obtain RFI clustering and 'wideband noise' clustering. It can be considered as three steps: 'embedding' step, 'spectral decomposition' step, and 're-embedding' step. Interestingly, these steps can be achieved through an analysis-synthesis-joint finite impulse response (FIR) filters group [8 – 10]. Based on this equivalence relationship, a special kind of filtering mechanism for <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression</b> can be established.|$|E

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) {{is becoming}} more and more frequently, which makes it an important issue in SAR imaging. RFI presented in synthetic aperture radar either on purpose or inadvertent will distort the useful SAR echoes, thus degrade the SAR image quality. To resolve this issue, a long time study was carried out to study the characteristic of the RFI through the RFI-affected spaceborne and airborne SAR data. Based on the narrow band nature of RFI, this paper proposes a new process which contains both RFI detection and <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression.</b> A useful subband spectral kurtosis detector is first used to detect RFI, and then its results are used for <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression.</b> The proposed process has two advantages: one is the economization on the compute time for unnecessary interference suppression when no RFI existed; the other is improving the performance of the suppression method with knowing the exact position where RFI is. Moreover, the previous <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression</b> method—subband spectral cancelation (SSC) is supplemented and perfected. The subband division step is also elaborated detail in this paper.

30|$|Therefore, {{it remains}} to be a hot {{research}} topic on <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression</b> for decades. The early methods are mainly based on coherent estimation and subtraction of RFIs [2]. Their performances heavily rely on the complicated data models and parameter estimation accuracy so that they are awkward and not robust. Other commonly used methods are notch filtering [3]. Their main drawback is degradation in the range domain of SAR imagery when multiple RFI sources are present. Then, more attractive methods are based on least mean square (LMS) adaptive filters [4]. However, they have a tradeoff between length of the filter and numerical sensitivity of adaptation. Afterwards, some researchers proposed subspace filters for estimating RFI signals with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure or Eigenvalue Decomposition (ED) [5, 6]. The performances of these methods are robust but the large computational burden limits their application in practice.|$|E

We consider a linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal, namely chirp signal, which is often used as SAR transmitting pulse [27]: secho = exp(-jπKt 2), -T/ 2 ≤ t ≤ T/ 2, where the pulse width T = 32 μs, bandwidth B = |K·T| is 9.6 MHz, the center frequency at zero and sampling frequencies is 39.6 NHz. All these parameters are typical for a SAR transmitting pulse, except the sampling frequency.

40|$|The growing {{level of}} radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) is a recognized problem for research in radio astronomy. This paper describes an intuitive but powerful RFI cancellation technique that is suitable for radio spectroscopy where time-averages are recorded. An RFI "reference signal," is constructed from the cross power spectrum of the signals from the two polarizations of a reference horn pointed at {{the source of the}} RFI signal. The RFI signal paths obey simple phase and amplitude closure relations, which allows computation of the RFI contamination in the astronomical data and the corrections to be applied to the astronomical spectra. Since the method is immune to the effects of multipath scattering in both the astronomy and reference signal channels, "clean copies" of the RFI signal are not required. The method could be generalized (1) to interferometer arrays, (2) to correct for scattered solar radiation that causes spectral "standing waves" in single-dish spectroscopy, and (3) to pulsar survey and timing applications where a digital correlator {{plays an important role in}} broadband pulse dedispersion.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{practical issues}} in Ultrawideband – Ultrawidebeam (UWB) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal processing and crucial applications developed on UWB SAR. In {{the context of}} this dissertation, UWB SAR refers to the SAR systems utilizing large fractional bandwidth signals and synthesizing long apertures associated with wide antenna beamwidths. On one hand, such specific systems give us opportunities to develop unique applications. One the other hand, signal processing for data collected by these systems is very challenging and therefore requires much effort due to their characteristics. In the signal processing part, the tools supporting the UWB SAR system design and evaluation are introduced.

Pre-processing, processing and post-processing for UWB SAR are also topics that will be examined in the signal processing part. The processing is here defined by SAR algorithms.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 79 - 82) By using State Variable Feedback from {{a multiple}} order output filter of a switchmode (Class "D???) power amplifier, advantages {{can be achieved}} over traditional approaches. The audio information in a Pulse Width Modulated output is recovered by an LC low pass filter. Design tradeoffs must be made between a) the bandwidth of this filter, b) the switching frequency, and c) the desired attentuation of the RFI consisting of the carrier fundamental, side bands, and harmonics. Given a required power bandwidth and level of <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression,</b> the choice of switching frequency and filter characteristics are left open. If a designer uses single loop feedback from the output, then this filter {{is limited to a}} second order low pass because of potential instability as the phase shift approaches 180 ??. If possible, a higher order filter would be desirable because of the additional suppression of a chosen switching frequency fundamental and its harmonics. As an alternative, a lower switching frequency could be chosen for a given level of RFI. A lower switching frequency has improved power efficiency due to less switching transition losses. The problem of excessive phase shift could be handled by using feedback only from the Pulse Width Modulated output, before it passes through the output filter. However, the fault of this technique is that any non-linearities or frequency response errors of the filter are not corrected by the feedback. State Variable feedback is a means of achieving stability while using a high order output filter and maintaining precise control over the characteristics of the filter. Optimal control parameters are calculated by matrix synthesis based on closed-loop frequency response...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{has many}} {{applications}} within ground image sensing and navigation. UltraWide Band(UWB) SAR operating at Ultra High Frequency /Very High Frequency(UHF/VHF) are usually a ffected by the Radio Frequency Interferences(RFI) from civilian communication bands which causes SIR(Signal to Interference Ratio) to go down. In response target detection is drastically aff ected in the system. Therefore, mitigation of the dominating energy from Narrow Band(NB) broadcast and mobile communication sources is highly required. Which eventually speaks out demand for suppression of these RFI's for e ective SAR operation with such co-existing sources of UWB. The accurate discrimination of target, from sources scattered around surrounding objects, is practical advantage of UWB SAR due to ne resolution in range and azimuth after pulse compression and SAR processing. But this advantage is weakened {{due to the}} RFI. Mitigating RFI is the main aim of this thesis. For this, we have applied an adaptive ltering technique using Adaptive Line Enhancement(ALE) implemented with the Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm. The capability of fast tracking time varying signal and noise statistics is better in RLS compared to other adaptive techniques like LMS, NLMS etc. Due {{to which it is}} preferred for suppressing the mobile communication signal which is mixed with the SAR signal, due to operating in the same frequency ranges. ALE uses delayed received signal to de-correlate the SAR signal in order to do interference suppression. Thus it is being used for separating the desired SAR pulses for image formation. The results show that RFI has been reduced strongly in simulation and acquired real data using ALE with RLS. <b>RFI</b> <b>suppression</b> done by using this method, is also analyzed by testing in real laboratory environment...|$|E
40|$|Radio Frequency Interference (<b>RFI)</b> <b>suppression</b> {{has been}} an {{essential}} technique in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. SAR is a technique for creating high resolution images of the earth’s surface. Over {{the area of the}} surface being observed, these images represent the backscattered microwave energy, which depends on the properties of the surface, such as its slope, roughness, textural in homogeneities and dielectric constant. The radar backscattering cross section also depends strongly on the existence of vegetation. These dependencies allow SAR imagery to be used in conjunction with models of the scattering mechanism to measure various characteristics of the earth’s surface, such as topography. An important characteristic of SAR is its day/night capability, which it possesses because it supplies its own illumination and receives the backscatter from it, as opposed to passive sensors which receive either the earth’s radiation or the reflected illumination from the sun. Furthermore, a SAR sensor has all-weather capability, because microwaves propagate through clouds and rain with only limited attenuation. These features, together with its fine two-dimensional resolution capability, have made SAR a valuable remote sensing tool for both military and civilian users. The VHF/UHF bands has been found to have significant advantages for air and ground survelliance application. However, {{from the point of view}} of SAR implementations, the VHF/UHF portion of the spectrum is already in heavy use by other services, such as television, mobile communications, radio and cellular phones. Even in remote locations the interference power often exceeds receiver noise by many dB, becoming the limiting factor on system sensitivity and severely degrading the image quality. Therefore it is important to investigate possible means of suppressing the interference in the received signal. MetaSensing B. V. asked the candidate to investigate this issue on P band data acquired by them with an airborne SAR system during an acquisition campaign in September 2013. In order to alleviate the problem of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), it is proposed in this thesis to use an Adaptive Line Enhancer(ALE) controlled by the Normalised Least Mean Squares (NLMS) algorithm to eliminate RFI. Experimental results demonstrate that the filter improves the image result. Results from application of this algorithm to real radar data aicted with interference are presented...|$|E
