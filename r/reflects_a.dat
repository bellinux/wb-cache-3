5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> long {{tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from {{as early as}} the third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E

50|$|In {{cognitive}} linguistic terms, force dynamic expressions <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> conceptual archetype {{because of}} their conceptual basality (Langacker 1999:24).

5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not}} have his own wounded love to display and {{therefore}} allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E
5|$|Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, {{who played}} Paul McCartney's fictional {{grandfather}} John McCartney, was already well-known to British audiences as co-star of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son. The recurring joke {{that he was}} so clean <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> play on his sitcom role, where he was always referred to as a dirty old man. In other roles, Norman Rossington played the Beatles' manager Norm, John Junkin played the group's road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti played the television director. Brian Epstein, the group's real manager, had an uncredited bit part.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught the Classics and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.|$|E

They were primarily farmers, but looms, combs, and other products evidence the existence of local workshops. Trading contacts between Gepidia and faraway regions is evidenced by finds of amber beads and brooches manufactured in the Crimea, Mazovia or Scandinavia.|$|E

The 2016 Defence White Paper included a commitment to further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> different kind of attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent {{as well as to}} alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> situation where resources are not specialised {{and can be}} substituted for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, Rome, and Etruria, {{the use and}} {{development}} of musical instruments stood {{in stark contrast to}} those cultures' achievements in architecture and sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures. Lyres were the principal instrument, as musicians used them to honor the gods. Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as aulos (reeds) or syrinx (flutes); Greek writing from that time <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> serious study of reed production and playing technique. Romans played reed instruments named tibia, featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes. Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the Orient, lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, and clappers, which were played primarily by women.|$|E

5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a {{decline in the number of}} beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Part of the canonization of the Zhou yi bound it {{to a set}} of ten commentaries {{called the}} Ten Wings.

The Zhou yi was written in Early Old Chinese, while the Ten Wings were written in a predecessor to Middle Chinese. The specific origins of the Ten Wings are still a complete mystery to academics. Regardless of their historical relation to the text, the philosophical depth of the Ten Wings made the I Ching a perfect fit to Han period Confucian scholarship. The inclusion of the Ten Wings <b>reflects</b> <b>a</b> widespread recognition in ancient China, found in the Zuo zhuan and other pre-Han texts, that the I Ching was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination.|$|E
