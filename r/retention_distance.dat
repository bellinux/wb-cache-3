40|$|Urbanisation has severe {{impacts on}} stream hydrology, biotic {{integrity}} and water quality. To date however, {{few studies have}} assessed the effects on ecosystem processes such as organic matter dynamics. Organic matter represents a vital basal heterotrophic energy pathway in aquatic ecosystems. Subsequently, organic matter availability and its processing have implications for energy transfer through microbial communities and higher trophic levels of lotic food webs. Riparian vegetation regulates the interface between terrestrial and aquatic environments and is frequently used to ameliorate the negative impacts of catchment land use change on lotic ecosystems. However the effectiveness of riparian vegetation in urban and suburban catchments, where the extent and connectivity are reduced and stormwater is piped directly to streams, remains poorly understood. Despite this, few studies have assessed the effects of coupled catchment scale urbanisation and reach scale riparian vegetation cover on organic matter inputs, processing or storage. I selected several small streams located in Victoria, Australia, which varied in catchment scale urbanisation and reach scale riparian vegetation cover. I investigated the sources of organic matter contributing to detrital pools and microbial respiration using elemental ratios and stable isotopes of C and N. Long-term coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) and small wood storage were determined using cores and direct counts respectively. Breakdown and retention of CPOM was assessed via the deployment of standardized cellulose substrates and release of marked Eucalyptus leaves, respectively. I also determined rates of whole-stream metabolism using the diurnal dissolved oxygen change technique. While catchment urbanisation had no clear effect on CPOM decomposition, <b>retention</b> <b>distances</b> or metabolic rates under base flow conditions, I did observe significant alterations to both the sources of organic matter dominating detrital pools and long-term CPOM and small wood storage. Urbanisation increased the contribution of labile autochthonous material to the suspended particulate organic matter detrital pool and significantly reduced long-term CPOM and small wood storage. Reach scale riparian vegetation cover at the extent observed, had no significant influence on organic matter sources, decomposition, <b>retention</b> <b>distances</b> or metabolism, but had a weak positive effect on terrestrial CPOM inputs, long-term CPOM storage and small wood abundance. The effects of catchment scale urbanisation on organic matter availability and lability were significantly stronger than those of reach scale riparian vegetation cover. While the lengths of riparian vegetation {{in the current study}} were constrained by historic clearing, my results demonstrate only weak effects at these commonly observed scales. While riparian vegetation provides critical organic matter inputs, these results showed a pervasive effect of urban catchment hydrology and associated alterations to the frequency and magnitude of high flows, nutrient concentrations and temperature on organic matter dynamics. This study has direct implications for the management of aquatic ecosystems in urban environments. My findings highlight the need for both catchment scale water sensitive urban design and the protection/restoration of riparian vegetation in order to maintain organic matter availability, lability and food web structure in these urban streams. However, this data also suggests that the restoration of riparian vegetation in the absence of catchment scale water sensitive urban design is unlikely to achieve this goal...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{globalization}} has spread invasive marine organisms, {{but it is}} not well understood why some species invade more readily than others. It is also poorly understood how species 2 ̆ 7 range limits are set generally, let alone how anthropogenic climate change may disrupt existing species boundaries. We find a quantitative relationship that determines if a coastal species with a benthic adult stage and planktonic larvae can be retained within its range and invade in the direction opposite that of the mean current experienced by the larvae (i. e. upstream). The derivation of the retention criterion extends prior riparian results to the coastal ocean by formulating the criterion as a function of observable oceanic parameters, focusing on species with obligate benthic adults and planktonic larvae, and quantifying the effects of iteroparity and longevity. By placing the solutions in a coastal context, the retention criterion isolates the role of 3 interacting factors that counteract downstream drift and set or advance the upstream edge of an oceanic species 2 ̆ 7 distribution. First, spawning over several seasons or years enhances retention by increasing the variation in the currents encountered by the larvae. Second, for a given population growth rate, species with a shorter pelagic period are better retained and more able to spread upstream. And third, prodigious larval production improves <b>retention.</b> Long <b>distance</b> downstream dispersal may thus be a byproduct of the many propagules often necessary to ensure local recruitment and persistence of a population in an advective environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} some data on student <b>retention</b> in <b>distance</b> {{education in the}} form of graduation rates at a sample of distance institutions. The paper suggests that there is a ‘distance education deficit’ with many distance institutions having less than one-quarter of the graduation rates of conventional institutions. It looks in some detail at the data for one well-known institution – the UK Open University – and surveys some of the reasons why such a deficit should occur and asks what the effects are on students, institutions and society as a whole. The paper suggests that one reason for the deficit is the ‘category error’ of confusing teaching with learning, and that institutions have focused too much on the provision of teaching materials, especially online, and too little on motivating students to learn. It maintains that there is accumulating evidence for the essentiality of proactive contact for overcoming dropout and the importance of making that contact motivational. The paper claims that such an approach is financially viable and can make surpluses for the institutions concerned if carefully designed. Finally, whilst briefly surveying some of the new developments in distance education {{in the form of}} Massive Online Open Courses, learning analytics, and the use of smartphones, this paper suggests more speculatively that rather than resources or organisation, the main barriers to increasing student success in distance education are institutional attitudes to student retention. ...|$|R

Qualitative data on technical ability were collected from 69 students who responded to the survey instrument on Survey Monkey. Quantitative data on retention, age, course delivery, and financial background on students who had graduated over the past 10 years were gathered from the offices of financial aid and the registrar. For quantitative data analysis, the influences of age and financial background on student retention were examined through multiple regression; the influence of course delivery on student retention was examined through 2 -tailed t tests for comparing the 2 population means.

In what he calls the ‘mystique of equality’, the concept of needs is linked to that of well-being, triggering the illusion that the increase in total amount of goods an individual can possess automatically translates into a levelling of society and in total well-being for all. According to Baudrillard, this approach does not take due account of the social logic of consumption, at which level the differentiation process for the <b>retention</b> of social <b>distances</b> is reiterated. Thus, according to Baudrillard, a mechanism that powers social differences survives through a consumerist ideology disguised as egalitarianism.

These include such types of technologies as developmental technologies, interactive technologies, technologies of information transfer, technologies of meaning-making initiation. The research of the attitude of distance learning educators to independent activity of students and the content of the academic courses were done at Moodle-based education programs.

40|$|As {{workplace}} demands change, a need {{has developed}} for alternatives to traditional education. With advancements in electronic telecommunication technologies, distance education {{has become a}} viable alternative to traditional classrooms for working professionals. Efficiency and cost effectiveness are driving many programs to place oncampus students and distance students in the same courses at the same time. This phenomenon has resulted in the placement of students with vastly different backgrounds, levels of expertise, and levels of motivation in the same classrooms. Often a professor will teach to one learning style, leaving some students in the dust, never to get on track. Without face-to-face contact with an instructor, this can leave distance education students feeling isolated and alone. There is a continuing need for the development of alternative instruments to assess self-directed learning (Brockett & Himestra, 1991). We must develop a means of determining an individual??s readiness for self-directed learning, as well as a device for measuring the efficiency of programs designed to foster the attitudes and skills which are involved in increased self-directedness in learning (Guglielmino, 1977). Self-directed learning readiness is important to a learner??s success in distance education programs. Inorder for an educator to tailor instruction to the unique attributes of each student, {{there is a need for}} an instrument that will identify the learner??s stage of self-directedness or degree of dependency and for an instrument that will determine the educator??s default teaching style at the beginning of a course.

The data will be analyzed and given to the instructor to give him/her an idea of the self-directed learning readiness level of students enrolled in the course.

Advisors: Rosemarie Park, Catherine Twohig. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 92 pages. As {{a result of}} the growth in distance education, and subsequently, the growth of distance learners, it is exceedingly important, and necessary, to find ways for the institution to retain these students by identifying their needs and implementing practices that facilitate persistence (Tinto, 2012). Research shows that engagement from the institution through student services advisement (Nichols, 2010) and orientations (Braxton, et al., 2014; Nash, 2005; Radwan & Leeds, 2009; Wojciechowski & Palmer, 2005) is some of the most effective ways in which to engage, and thereby retain, students and help them persist. The <b>retention</b> of adult <b>distance</b> learners is vital to any university that depends on this population for revenue; therefore, determining the ways in which engagement assists with distance learner persistence is important for perpetuation of the institution. This study aimed to identify which engagement initiatives and practices are expected, effective, and predictive for retaining nontraditional distance learners. Identifying effective practices can help practitioners determine the ways to translate current research into effective practice for that of adult distance learners. Failure to retain any student � traditional or nontraditional - has obvious consequences, many of which are detrimental to the institution, such as reputation, loss of revenue, and cost to continuously recruit new (or more) learners. Institutional, individual, and societal benefits confirm the importance of this topic.

The research questions for the study answered what individual characteristics of teachers impacted <b>retention,</b> how cultural <b>distance,</b> length of time it took to settle in, and school support affected retention, and what guided teachers to remain in their locations. The participants were 100 international teachers in ten schools across four countries. The teachers ranged from younger to older and from newly experienced to more seasoned international teachers who had been working in international schools for a long period of time. The researcher interviewed each teacher personally and used a grounded theory approach to the collection and analysis of data, coding data into themes related to the research questions. The results of the analysis suggested that the most important reasons for staying in an international school were for personal reasons, including for partners or family, age, quality of life, right ‘fit’, and level of happiness. The second most important reasons for staying in a job included professional reasons such as for the school’s philosophy, vision, administration, and for professional opportunities within the school. The third most important reason for remaining in a job was for the salary and benefits. International teachers who made an effort to get involved in their locations seemed to adjust better. The extent to which international adaptations were positive or negative varied depending on the country.

40|$|Postgraduate {{business}} students {{represent a}} {{significant source of}} enrolments and, hence, student-based income for Australian higher education providers. As recently as 2010, postgraduate enrolments in business courses accounted for around a third of all postgraduate enrolments in the Australian higher education sector, and nearly a tenth of all higher education enrolments overall. Moreover, a great many of these students, typically in an attempt to balance study with work, family and other extra-curricular activities, choose to undertake their studies by distance education. Indeed, one-fifth of all students enrolled in a course of study at an Australian higher education institution undertake at least some of their studies by distance education (Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [DEEWR], 2011). Fee-paying international students comprise a greater than average proportion of enrolments in business courses at Australian higher education institutions; around half in 2010, compared with just over a quarter of enrolments in all fields (DEEWR, 2011). This dependence on international student enrolments poses a threat to the providers of these courses, as international student demand for places in Australian higher education continues to wane {{as a result of the}} strong Australian dollar, changed student visa requirements, aggressive competition from the USA and UK higher education sectors, and recent negative publicity concerning the safety of onshore international students (Lane & Akerman, 2010). Therefore, maximising revenue from currently enrolled domestic and international students through improved retention strategies will be of increasing importance to providers of postgraduate business courses if they wish to remain financially viable in the immediate term, as fee-paying international students become increasingly hard to recruit. The logic of customer retention in the services sector - that it requires fewer resources to retain existing customers than to recruit new ones - applies as much to higher education as any commercial service (Bejou, 2005), yet the process of retaining existing students is less understood than the process of recruiting new students (Derby & Smith, 2004; Trotter & Cove, 2005). This is especially true for <b>distance</b> education student <b>retention,</b> in spite of the fact that this model typically experiences higher drop-out rates when compared with on-campus delivery (Tresman, 2002). In order to address this relative lack of information concerning the <b>retention</b> of <b>distance</b> education students in general, and postgraduate business distance education students in particular, this paper presents a range of strategies intended to improve the retention of students in this context. These strategies are based on the findings of an exploratory case study into the factors affecting the retention of postgraduate business distance education students at an Australian university where the majority of the student body undertake their studies by distance education. Readers with a stake in the provision of postgraduate business courses by distance education may use these strategies as a starting point for improving their student retention rates, or use them to validate their current approaches. In this paper, we first provide a brief overview of the literature addressing the factors which can potentially affect student retention. We then present an overview of the primary research on which this paper is based, including the qualitative methodology and a summary of the key findings. Next, a range of strategies designed to improve the retention of postgraduate business distance education students are discussed. Finally, limitations of this research are acknowledged, avenues for further research in this area are noted and conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of secondary education in Tanzania, {{as a result}} of the Secondary Education Development Programme (2004 - 2009), has brought about some philosophical and practical issues surrounding teacher preparation and recruitment. One such issue has been on how best and cost-effectively teachers could be prepared and retained in schools, at the period of high teacher demand. This study addresses issues related to learning how to teach and retention in teacher education programmes organised using the distance learning mode. The study attempted to explain the relationship between factors related to student teachers‘ background, teacher education institutions, and schools on the one hand; and retention on the other; among student teachers of the Licensed Teachers Programme (LTP) in Tanzania. Special interest was paid to the role of schools in supporting school-based student teachers. By using a mixed model approach to research, the study collected data from 221 respondents of a student questionnaire, followed four (4) case studies and maintained contact with 59 of the questionnaire respondents through short text messaging to explore student support and student persistence behaviour. Additional data were collected through interviews with LTP coordinators and through reviewing various programme documents. The data were then analysed in relation to student retention at the end of the first year of study. The study has established a gap in perceptions on school-based teacher education (SBTE) between the Government and teacher education institutions (TEI). While the Government has demonstrated SBTE in its teacher education programmes, TEIs have persisted in using the theory first, practice later approach. The limitations of the teaching practice assessment model of teacher preparation could be addressed by developing mentoring and collegial relationships at school level, which appear to be more promising in both learning to teach and student <b>retention.</b> Similarly, <b>distance</b> learning (DL) appears to have many infrastructural challenges such that students are most likely to lack some basic materials and equipment necessary for DL. There is a need to address issues such as timely distribution of study materials, more effective communication systems with DL students, more effective face-to-face sessions, more supportive regional study centres, and investment on accessible DL technologies. These issues have constantly featured in the student survey, case studies and SMS and emails. Students‘ appreciation of the DL mode is still low, thus affecting retention. The study has discovered various school-based support measures for distance learners, ranging from contextual and moral support, such as suitable school facilities and a welcoming school head and community; and teacher professional development such as teacher development meetings; to some iii specific support for DL studies, such as book donations, peer tutoring and assisted travel to study centres. The study discovered that student teachers were most likely to drop out of the programme when they lacked contextual and moral support. Other forms of support had less effect on retention. The study proposes a field-based model for teacher education that calls for a significant shift of policy and practice on teacher education. The new model requires a shift from the Teaching Practice model to school-based mentoring; as well as a greater investment in technology-based student support. Partnership between the central Government, teacher education institutions, local governments and schools is a key strategy in the new model. Partnership will particularly bridge the existing gap in practice between the Government and institutions of teacher education...|$|R

40|$|Objective of Research The {{interest}} in crop modelling started since the introduction and popularisation of computer technology, which facilitated the dynamic simulation of complex natural systems. In particular, crop growth and soil water balance models for irrigation scheduling are popular at locations where {{water is a}} limiting factor for crop production. In a Water Research Commission project, the soil water balance model (SWB) for irrigation scheduling under full and deficit irrigation was made available. The SWB model is a relatively simple generic crop growth model based on sound physical and physiological principles, (i. e. mechanistic) using daily climatic inputs for daily time-step calculations of the soil-plant-atmosphere water balance to estimate plant growth water use. The SWB model was primarily developed for predicting real-time soil water deficit of field crops with a one-dimensional canopy light interception and water redistribution procedure. Hedgerow tree crops are planted in widely spaced rows to allow access between trees to carry out necessary management practices (e. g. pest control and harvesting). Distribution of energy is not uniform in widely spaced crops. In addition, localised under tree irrigation is often used for tree crops to reduce system installation costs. This irrigation (micro- or drip) only wets a limited area under the canopy of the trees so that evaporation from the soil surface is also not uniform. One can expect root density to vary with depth {{as well as with}} distance between the rows so water uptake for transpiration will also vary in two dimensions. It is also essential {{to take into account the}} limited volume of soil wetted under micro-irrigation. If this is not done, the soil capacity will be incorrectly estimated with a standard one-dimensional approach, leading to undesirable over-irrigation in the wetted zone, as well as possible crop stress resulting from a too long an irrigation interval. In order to accurately estimate canopy growth, water balance and yield, it is therefore essential to model canopy radiant interception and soil water balance of hedgerow tree crops in two dimensions and on an hourly time step, based on sound physical principles. Lack of suitable user-friendly tools to mechanistically describe the two-dimensional energy and soil water balance of tree crops was identified. Due to the importance of fruit crops, on the export as well as local markets, as well as the encouraging results from the initial SWB model, it was decided to improve the SWB model by incorporating a two-dimensional system for use in hedgerow plantings. This thesis reports on the methodology developed to monitor the energy and soil moisture differences within various hedgerows through 24 hour cycles and the results obtained, as well as the subsequent use of the results to evaluate the 2 -dimensional water balance model. This research was an integral, but independent, part of a larger research thrust, i. e. the development of a two-dimensional fruit tree water balance model that can account for the unique fractional interception of solar radiation associated with hedgerow orchards as opposed to the horizontal planar interception encountered in agronomic crops. The primary objective of this thesis is not the actual programming and mathematical manipulations of the relevant algorithms but to create a reliable data base and then evaluate the model. The primary objective of this thesis was to evaluate the model for deciduous fruit trees using peaches as an example and evaluate the model for evergreen fruit trees using citrus as an example. Model description In the overall research thrust two types of model, both predicting crop water requirements on a daily time step, were developed for hedgerow tree crops and included in SWB: i) A mechanistic two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference, Richards’ equation based soil water balance model; and ii) An FAO-based crop factor model, with a quasi- 2 D cascading soil water balance model. For the sake of clarity and completeness, the principles of the models are presented in the thesis and are briefly described in this subsection. The first model calculates the two-dimensional energy interception for hedgerow fruit trees, based on solar and row orientation, tree size and shape, as well as leaf area density. The two-dimensional soil water redistribution is calculated with a finite difference solution. The two-dimensional energy interception model assumes leaves to be uniformly distributed within an ellipsoid truncated at its base, and radiation penetrating the canopy is attenuated according to Beer’s law. This geometry is very versatile as many different shapes can be generated. In order to determine the spatial distribution of soil irradiance across the tree row, the canopy path length through which the radiation must travel to reach a certain point on the soil surface is calculated. Radiation can penetrate neighbouring rows, so two rows on either side of the simulated row are considered. Beam or direct radiation and diffuse radiation for the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) and NIR (near-infrared radiation) wavebands are calculated separately, as they interact differently with the canopy. The ratio of actual measured to potential radiation is used to estimate the proportion of direct and diffuse radiation in these two spectral bands. The attenuation of beam radiation by the canopy is strongly dependent on zenith angle, and, for crops planted in rows, azimuth angle and row orientation will also be crucial. Elevation and azimuth angles are calculated from latitude, solar declination that depends on day of year, and time of day. Before the length of canopy through which radiation penetrates can be calculated, azimuth angle needs to be adjusted to take row orientation into account. Input data required to run the two-dimensional canopy interception model are: day of year (DOY), latitude, standard meridian, longitude, daily solar radiation, row width and orientation, canopy height and width, bare stem height and distance from the ground to the bottom of the canopy, extinction coefficient, absorptivity and leaf area density. In order to simulate two-dimensional water movement in the soil, a grid of nodes were established. This divides the soil up into a number of elements. The distances between nodes are selected so that model output can easily be compared to field measured values. Each element has its own physical properties, so this scheme allows variation in soil properties in two dimensions. Symmetry planes are assumed to occur mid-way between two rows on either side of the hedgerow and no water flux is allowed across these planes. The model redistributes water in the soil in two-dimensions using a finite difference solution to Richards’ continuity equation for water flow. The aim is to find the matric potentials, which will cause the mass balance error to be negligible. This is done using the Newton-Raphson procedure. Two lower boundary conditions can be chosen in the model: i) gravity drainage for well-drained soils, and ii) zero-flux lower boundary to simulate an impermeable layer. A precipitation or irrigation in mm is converted to a flux in kg m- 1 s- 1 by dividing the time step and multiplying by the horizontal distance over which the water is distributed. The infiltration does not have to be uniform over the surface. Non-uniform infiltration is especially important in very coarse soils where lateral redistribution is likely to be limited, or in the case of micro-irrigation. As with the infiltration flux, evaporation is multiplied by the horizontal distance over which it occurs in order to get an evaporative flux in kg m- 1 s- 1. Potential vapotranspiration (PET) is calculated from weather data using the Penman-Monteith equation and the maximum crop factor after rainfall occurs. PET is then partitioned at the soil surface into potential evaporation and potential transpiration depending on solar orientation, row direction and canopy size, shape and leaf area density. Crop water uptake (transpiration) can either be limited by atmospheric demand or soil-root water supply. Root densities at different soil depths are accounted for in the calculation of root water uptake. The user can specify root depth and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil. Required inputs for the two-dimensional soil water balance model are: starting and planting dates, altitude, rainfall and irrigation water amounts, as well as maximum and minimum daily temperature. Two points on the water retention function (usually field capacity and permanent wilting point), initial volumetric soil water content and bulk density are required for each soil layer. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity can also be entered as input for each soil layer, or calculated by the model using the water <b>retention</b> curve. Row <b>distance,</b> wetted diameter of micro-jets or drippers, fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil as well as distance of the nodes from the tree row are also required as input. The second, simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach, was developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with limited input data. This model includes a semi-empirical approach for partitioning of aboveground energy, a cascading soil water redistribution that separates the wetted and non-wetted portion of the ground, as well as prediction of crop yields. The FAO-based crop factor procedure was combined with the mechanistic SWB model, thereby still allowing evaporation and transpiration to be modelled separately as supply and demand limited processes. The crop factor model does not grow the canopy mechanistically and therefore the effect of water stress on canopy size is not simulated. The simpler crop factor model should, however, still perform satisfactorily if the estimated canopy cover closely resembles that found in the field. The|$|R
