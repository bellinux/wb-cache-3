25|$|Just after sunrise on the {{day after}} the Sabbath a number of women (Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James) come to anoint Jesus's body. They find the stone <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> and the tomb empty. Suddenly two men stand beside them. The men tell them Jesus is risen. The women tell the disciples, but the disciples do not believe them, except for Peter who runs to the tomb. Peter finds the grave-clothes in the empty tomb and goes away, wondering.|$|E
25|$|Launch {{facilities}} at both sites are similar. At the pad is a Mobile Service Tower (MST), which provides service {{access to the}} rocket and protection from the weather. There is a crane {{at the top of}} the MST, which allows the payload and GEM-60 solid motors to be attached to the vehicle. The MST is <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> from the rocket several hours before launch. At Vandenberg, the launch pad also has a Mobile Assembly Shelter (MAS), which completely encloses the vehicle; at CCAFS, the vehicle is partly exposed near its bottom.|$|E
25|$|Various {{tests are}} performed, {{and then the}} vehicle is rolled {{horizontally}} to the pad, where the Fixed Pad Erector (FPE) is used to raise the vehicle to the vertical position, inside the MST. At this time, the GEM-60 solid motors, if any are required, are rolled to the pad and attached to the vehicle. After further testing, the payload (which has already been enclosed in its fairing) is transported to the pad, hoisted into the MST by a crane, and attached to the vehicle. Finally, on launch day, the MST is <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> from the vehicle, and the vehicle is ready for launch.|$|E

25|$|While the Prussian Infantry {{in rear of}} Ligny were in {{movement}} {{for the purpose of}} relieving their comrades who were already giving way before this renewed attack, they suddenly perceived, on the French right of Ligny, a column issuing from under the heavy smoke that <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> from the well served batteries which had so unexpectedly opened upon them, and, which continued so fearfully to thin their ranks; and, as the mass rapidly advanced down the slope with the evident design of forcing a passage across the valley, they could not fail to distinguish both by its well sustained order and compactness, and by its dark waving surface of bearskins, that they had now to contend against the redoubted Imperial Guard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} the fourth, Mackey hit a one-out triple {{to right}} field. Judy Johnson {{followed}} with a long fly out to right, scoring Mackey and giving Hilldale a 2–1 lead. In the next inning, Hilldale added on. With two outs, Stephens grounded to short and beat out Moore's throw. He then stole second and advanced to third on a passed ball. Briggs singled to right, scoring Stephens. In the bottom of the seventh, Sweatt led off with a hit to right. After Duncan struck out, Drake hit a fly ball to center, which the wind caused George Johnson to misjudge; when it <b>rolled</b> <b>away,</b> Drake reached third with a triple, driving in Sweatt, and narrowing Hilldale's lead to 3–2.|$|E
25|$|In July 1993, Faldo won the Carroll's Irish Open for an {{unprecedented}} {{third time in}} a row. Starting his final round four shots behind José María Olazábal, Faldo's fourth round of 65 enabled him to tie over 72 holes with Olazábal. Faldo won the sudden death playoff at the first extra hole. Later that month, as defending Open champion, Faldo {{was involved in a}} memorable duel with rival Greg Norman in the Open Championship at Royal St George's Golf Club. Starting his final round one shot ahead of Norman, Faldo hit a tee shot on the par-3 11th which appeared to be heading for a hole in one, but the ball hit the cup and <b>rolled</b> <b>away.</b> Faldo played some excellent golf in his final round of 67, but he finished runner-up, two strokes behind Norman, who shot a spectacular final round of 64.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} plays of Rodriguez's career occurred late in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series. With one out and Derek Jeter on first base {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher's mound and the first base line. Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As the ball <b>rolled</b> <b>away,</b> Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo. However, the umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodriguez was out for interference. Jeter was sent back to first base, and his run was nullified. The Yankees would then lose the ALCS to the eventual World Series champion Red Sox after leading the series 3 games to none.|$|E
500|$|As {{the authors}} of the {{official}} history of the Welsh Rugby Union, David Smith and Gareth Williams, wrote of him: [...] "The clue to an understanding of his achieved style lies in what he could make others do to themselves. The kicking, whether spinning trajectories that <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> or precise chips or scudding grubbers, was a long-range control, but his running, deft, poised, a fragile illusion that one wrong instant could crack, yet rarely did, was the art of the fly-half at its most testing. He was the dragonfly on the anvil of destruction. John ran in another dimension of time and space. His opponents ran into the glass walls which covered his escape routes from their bewildered clutches. He left mouths, and back rows, agape." ...|$|E
500|$|Proceedings were {{suddenly}} {{interrupted by a}} loud shout, recorded by volunteers during the rehearsals, followed by drumming (the pre-recorded drumming amplified by 965 cast members drumming on inverted household buckets and bins), led by Evelyn Glennie. The three-tonne oak tree {{on top of the}} Glastonbury Tor lifted, and industrial workers emerged from both the Tor's brightly lit interior and the entrances to the stadium, to swell the cast to a total of 2,500 volunteers. So began what Boyle had called the [...] "biggest scene change in theatre history" [...] and something he had been advised against attempting. Underworld's [...] "And I Will Kiss" [...] began to play, as the cast <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> the grass and other rural props. [...] Seven smoking chimney stacks with accompanying steeplejacks rose from the ground, along with other industrial machinery: five beam engines, six looms, a crucible and a water wheel (one of the few items left from the rural scene). Boyle said that this section celebrated the [...] "tremendous potential" [...] afforded by the advancements of the Victorian era. [...] It also included a minute's silence in remembrance of the loss of life of both World Wars, featuring British 'Tommies' and shots of poppies, during which the names of the Accrington Pals were shown on the stadium screens. Unprompted, members of the audience stood in respect during this segment.|$|E

2500|$|Paul's views {{went against}} the {{thoughts}} of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which was {{what they wanted to}} avoid—given that for them the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit. At the same time, Paul believed that the newly resurrected body would be a heavenly body; immortal, glorified, powerful and spiritual in contrast to an earthly body, which is mortal, dishonored, weak and natural. According to theologian Peter Carnley, the resurrection of Jesus was different from the Resurrection of Lazarus as: [...] "In the case of Lazarus, the stone was <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> so that he could walk out... the raised Christ didn't have to have the stone <b>rolled</b> <b>away,</b> because he is transformed and can appear anywhere, at any time".|$|E
2500|$|Dale Martin {{contends that}} Paul's various {{disagreements}} with the Corinthians {{were the result}} of a fundamental conflict over the ideological construction of the human body (and hence the church as the body of Christ). According to Martin, most Corinthian Christians and Paul himself saw the body as an entity that could be permeated by different pollutions. Other members of the Corinthian church, however, viewed the body as hierarchical—as a microcosm of the universe—and were not particularly concerned about body boundaries. These differing views of the human body (and also of the church as the body of Christ) led to differing opinions on a variety of subjects—including the resurrection of the body. According to theologian Peter Carnley, the resurrection of Jesus was different from the Resurrection of Lazarus as: [...] "In the case of Lazarus, the stone was <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> so that he could walk out.... the raised Christ didn't have to have the stone <b>rolled</b> <b>away,</b> because he is transformed and can appear anywhere, at any time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early on the {{day after}} the Sabbath, before sunrise, Mary Magdalene visited the tomb and found the large stone had already been <b>rolled</b> <b>away.</b> She told Peter and [...] "the beloved disciple", who then ran to the tomb to only find empty the grave-clothes, then go home. They assume his body had been stolen. Mary wept, then sees two angels that speak to her, and then Jesus, whom she does not recognise.

2500|$|Some Western {{observers}} {{who attended the}} trials {{said that they were}} fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established.

The British lawyer and Member of Parliament D. N. Pritt, for example, wrote: [...] "Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties", but [...] "once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted".|$|E

And going near Jesus <b>rolled</b> <b>away</b> the stone from {{the door of the}} tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned {{to the other side of}} the Jordan.|$|E
