For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased <b>radiodensity</b> in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E

25|$|Though not {{the focus}} of the test, {{calcification}} within the artery walls, located in the outer edges of atheroma within the artery walls, is sometimes recognizable on fluoroscopy (without contrast injection) as radiodense halo rings partially encircling, and separated from the blood filled lumen by the interceding radiolucent atheroma tissue and endothelial lining. Calcification, even though usually present, is usually only visible when quite advanced and calcified sections of the artery wall happen to be viewed on end tangentially through multiple rings of calcification, so as to create enough <b>radiodensity</b> to be visible on fluoroscopy.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of radiographic examinations of pathological ocular material is stressed. Characteristic ocular <b>radiodensities</b> are observed with retinoblastomas, calcified cataracts, senile scleral plaques, intraocular ossification, {{and a variety}} of radiodense foreign bodies. Radiographs supplement other techniques for the documentation of ocular abnormalities and in certain instances may be the ideal method. They also permit the precise localisation of radiodense foreign bodies that need to be removed prior to the processing of tissue for microscopic examination. In certain situations valuable data can be obtained by x-ray examinations of embedded material. Retinoblastomas have an extremely high incidence of <b>radiodensities</b> with a characteristics appearance. This finding stresses the clinical {{importance of}} utilising and developing clinically applicable techniques for the detection of calcification in patients with suspected retinoblastomas...|$|R

25|$|Angiography, {{since the}} 1960s, {{has been the}} {{traditional}} way of evaluating for atheroma. However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood with the arterial lumen and never show atheroma; the wall of arteries, including atheroma with the arterial wall remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule is that with very advanced atheroma, with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of <b>radiodensity</b> {{can be seen in}} most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any contrast agent during angiograms.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, {{the price of}} copper rose {{to the point where}} the cent {{contained}} almost one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million of these pennies were struck and ready for public release before ultimately being rejected. The proposed aluminum pennies were rejected for two reasons: vending machine owners complained the coins would cause mechanical problems; and pediatricians and pediatric radiologists pointed out that the <b>radiodensity</b> of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue, and the coins would therefore be difficult to detect in X-ray imaging.

25|$|Attempts at {{repair of}} ischaemic-damaged bone will usual occur in 2 phases. First, when dead bone abuts live marrow, {{capillaries}} and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells grow into the dead marrow spaces, while macrophages degrade dead cellular and fat debris. Second, mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts or fibroblasts. Under favorable conditions, layers of new bone {{form on the}} surface of dead spongy trabeculae. If sufficiently thickened, these layers may decrease the <b>radiodensity</b> of the bone; therefore, the first radiographic evidence of previous osteonecrosis may be patchy sclerosis resulting from repair. Under unfavorable conditions repeated attempts at repair in ischaemic conditions can be seen histologically and are characterized by extensive delamination or microcracking along cement lines as well as the formation of excessive cement lines. Ultimate failure of repair mechanisms due to persistent and repeated ischaemic events is manifested as trabecular fractures that occur in the dead bone under functional load. Later followed by cracks and fissures leading to structural collapse of the area involved (osteocavitation).|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether very radiodense material within a sinonasal soft-tissue mass on CT can be differentiated as calcification, ossification, or residual bone. METHODS: We retrospec-tively described the <b>radiodensities</b> within 235 sinonasal soft-tissue masses as discrete, solitary or multiple, or as a diffuse process {{with either a}} well-defined or poorly defined margin. They were also classified as calcification, ossification, or residual bone. Findings were correlated with pathologic specimens. RESULTS: Residual bone was underdiagnosed; calcification was overdi-agnosed. A solitary discrete density was {{most likely to be}} calcification within an inflammatory mass. However, multiple discrete densities were as likely to be in a tumor as in an inflammatory lesion. If the process was diffuse with a well-defined margin, it was most likely to be a benign fibroosseous lesion. If the process was diffuse with a poorly defined margin, it was most likely to be a high-grade sarcoma. Densities within inverted papillomas were shown to be residual bone, not calcifications; densities within esthesioneuroblastomas were calcifications. CONCLUSION: <b>Radiodensities</b> may help in refining a CT diagnosis, but one may not know based on CT whether the density is a calcification, ossification, or residual bone...|$|R

25|$|For {{guidance}} regarding catheter positions {{during the}} examination, the physician mostly relies on detailed knowledge of internal anatomy, guide wire and catheter behavior and intermittently, briefly uses fluoroscopy {{and a low}} X-ray dose to visualize when needed. This is done without saving recordings of these brief looks. When the physician is ready to record diagnostic views, which are saved and can be more carefully scrutinized later, he activates the equipment to apply a significantly higher X-ray dose, termed cine, {{in order to create}} better quality motion picture images, having sharper <b>radiodensity</b> contrast, typically at 30 frames per second. The physician controls both the contrast injection, fluoroscopy and cine application timing so as to minimize the total amount of radiocontrast injected and times the X-Ray to the injection so as to minimize the total amount of X-ray used. Doses of radiocontrast agents and X-ray exposure times are routinely recorded in an effort to maximize safety.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to gain {{acceptance}} for the new composition, the Mint distributed approximately three dozen examples to {{various members of the}} House Banking and Currency Committee and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Nine congressmen and four senators received examples, along with some Treasury officials. Additional specimens were given out by then Mint Director Mary Brooks. Ultimately, the proposal was rejected in Congress, due mainly to the efforts of the copper-mining and vending machine industries, which felt the coins would cause mechanical problems. Opposition also came from pediatricians and pediatric radiologists who pointed out the <b>radiodensity</b> of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue, and therefore would be difficult to detect in X-ray imaging. In addition, the price of copper declined enough that making copper cents would again be economically viable, and conversely made hoarding pointless. The idea of changing the composition of the cent would not be explored again until the 1980s. In 1982, the composition of the coin was changed to the current 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper core alloy with a plating of pure copper, resulting in a 20% weight reduction.|$|E

This study assesses the prevalence of lipiodol retention after parotid sialography and determines if retention of lipiodol {{is related to the}} sialography technique or the underlying salivary gland pathology. Using the electronic hospital database (1996 - 2006), 66 out of 565 patients were identified who had additional maxillofacial radiographic examinations after the initial sialography. Additional radiographs up to October 2007 were included; these were orthopantomographic radiographs in all cases. In 28 patients (42 %) signs of lipiodol retention were observed (mean radiographic follow-up: 15 13 months). Retention was characterized by small radiopaque spots in the periphery of the gland. Lipiodol retention was predominantly associated with a fausse route (n = 8) or the presence of salivary gland disease (sialectasia; n = 17). In 9 patients with signs of lipiodol retention, a series of radiographs was available. Lipiodol <b>radiodensities</b> decreased in size during 28 months, and could disappear gradually (follow-up 14 - 57 months).

40|$|To {{address the}} {{question}} as to whether echocardiographic and/or microcomputed tomography (microCT) analysis can be utilized to assess the extent of Coxsackie B virus (CVB) induced myocarditis in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction in the mouse. Viral myocarditis is a significant clinical problem with associated inflammation of the myocardium and myocardial injury. Murine models of myocarditis are commonly used to study the pathophysiology of the disease, but methods for imaging the mouse myocardium have been limited to echocardiographic assessment of ventricular dysfunction and, to a lesser extent, MRI imaging. Using a murine model of myocarditis, we used both echocardiography and microCT to assess the extent of myocardial involvement in murine myocarditis using both wild-type mice and CVB cleavage-resistant dystrophin knock-in mice. Areas of increased echogenicity were only observed in the myocardium of Coxsackie B virus infected mice. These echocardiographic abnormalities correlated with the extent of von Kossa staining (a marker of membrane permeability), inflammation, and fibrosis. Given that calcium phosphate uptake as imaged by von Kossa staining might also be visualized using microCT, we utilized microCT imaging which allowed for high-resolution, 3 -dimensional images of <b>radiodensities</b> that likely represent calcium phosphate uptake. As with echocardiography, only mice infected with Coxsackie B virus displayed abnormal accumulation of calcium within individual myocytes indicating increased membrane permeability only upon exposure to virus.
