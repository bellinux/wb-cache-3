50|$|Mainsails on Bermuda rigs {{typically}} have paired grommets that secure the luff and leech to the boom, as the sail is lowered {{to reduce its}} area. These become the new tack and clew. A <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> typically runs through the reef point on the luff to quickly secure the new clew. The grommet that becomes the new tack is typically hooked onto the boom.

50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|E

50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> cutters), the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|E
40|$|Reefing {{lines are}} an {{essential}} feature to manage inflation loads. During each Engineering Development Unit (EDU) {{test of the}} Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS), a chase aircraft is staged to be level with the cluster of Main ringsail parachutes during the initial inflation and reefed stages. This allows for capturing high-quality still photographs of the reefed skirt, suspension line, and canopy geometry. The over-inflation angles are synchronized with measured loads data in order to compute the tension force in the <b>reefing</b> <b>line.</b> The traditional reefing tension equation assumes radial symmetry, but cluster effects cause the reefed skirt of each parachute to elongate to a more elliptical shape. This effect was considered in evaluating multiple parachutes to estimate the semi-major and semi-minor axes. Three flight tests are assessed, including one with a skipped first stage, which had peak <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> tension over three {{times higher than the}} nominal parachute disreef sequence...|$|E

Line tensions are calculated here for G- 12 and G- 11 canopies that were not only skirt-reefed, but also rigged for complete closure of their apex vent. Our derivations also yield interesting estimates of the worst possible line reefing tension ratio T/FD obtainable, namely 16. 2 % for long reefing lines and 22. 5 % for short ones. Finally, we present a simple approach for recasting line tensions, obtained via either calculations or wind tunnel measurements, in a way that takes into account the possible deceleration of parachute–payload systems...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{scenarios}} {{were identified}} in which the X- 37 approach and landing test vehicle (ALTV) catastrophically recontacts the B- 52 H carrier aircraft after separation. The most cost-effective recontact risk mitigation is the prelaunch deployment of a drogue parachute that is released after the X- 37 ALTV has safely cleared the B- 52 H. After release, a fully-inflated drogue parachute takes 30 min to reach ground and results in a large footprint that excessively restricts the days available for flight. To reduce the footprint, a passive collapse mechanism consisting of an elastic <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> attached to the parachute skirt was developed. At flight loads the elastic is stretched, allowing full parachute inflation. After release, drag loads drop dramatically and the elastic line contracts, reducing the frontal drag area. A 50 percent drag reduction results in an approximately 75 percent ground footprint reduction. Eleven individual parachute designs were evaluated at flight load dynamic pressures in the High Velocity Airflow System (HIVAS) at the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC), China Lake, California. Various options for the elastic reefing system were also evaluated at HIVAS. Two best parachute designs were selected from HIVAS to be carried forward to flight test. Detailed HIVAS test results are presented in this report...|$|E

40|$|The NASA Johnson Space Center's X- 38 program {{designed}} a new backup parachute system {{to recover the}} 25, 000 lb X- 38 prototype for the Crew Return Vehicle spacecraft. Due to weight and cost constraints, the main backup parachute design incorporated rapid and low cost fabrication techniques using off-the-shelf materials. Near the vent, the canopy was constructed of continuous ribbons, to provide more damage tolerance. The remainder of the canopy was a constructed with a continuous ringslot design. After cancellation of the X- 38 program, the parachute design was resized, built, and drop tested for Natick Soldiers Center's Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) program to deliver cargo loads up to 22, 000 lbs from altitudes as low as 500 feet above the ground. Drop tests {{results showed that the}} 500 -foot LVAD parachute deployment conditions cause severe skirt inversion and inflation problems for large parachutes. The bag strip occurred at a high angle of attack, causing skirt inversion before the parachute could inflate. The addition of a short <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> prevented the skirt inversion. Using a lower porosity in the vent area, than is normally used in large parachutes, improved inflation. The drop testing demonstrated that the parachute design could be refined to meet the requirements for the 500 -foot LVAD mission...|$|E

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{project is}} {{executing}} {{a program to}} qualify a parachute system for a next generation human spacecraft. Part of the qualification process involves predicting parachute riser tension during system descent with flight simulations. Human rating the CPAS hardware requires {{a high degree of}} confidence in the simulation models used to predict parachute loads. However, uncertainty exists in the heritage added mass models used for loads predictions {{due to a lack of}} supporting documentation and data. Even though CPAS anchors flight simulation loads predictions to flight tests, extrapolation of these models outside the test regime carries the risk of producing non-bounding loads. A set of equations based on empirically derived functions of skirt radius is recommended as the simplest and most viable method to test and derive an enhanced added mass model for an inflating parachute. This will increase confidence in the capability to predict parachute loads. The selected equations are based on those published in A Simplified Dynamic Model of Parachute Inflation by Dean Wolf. An Ames 80 x 120 wind tunnel test campaign is recommended to acquire the <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> tension and canopy photogrammetric data needed to quantify the terms in the Wolf equations and reduce uncertainties in parachute loads predictions. Once the campaign is completed, the Wolf equations can be used to predict loads in a typical CPAS Drogue Flight test.

40|$|A {{recently}} proposed hypothesis {{argued that}} morphologically and functionally similar macroalgae could be grouped {{to study the}} structure of macroalgal communities. It was argued that these functional groups {{can be used to}} predict changes to community composition that result from disturbance. This study examined whether the functional group model held in detecting changes in macroalgal community structure within one bioregion, by applying it to a habitat exposed to different levels of physical disturbance associated with wave exposure. Results obtained using a functional group approach were compared to those obtained using a species level approach. Three parallel <b>reef</b> <b>lines</b> in Marmion Lagoon, Western Australia, were chosen to represent three levels of exposure (high, intermediate and low) to wave-driven physical disturbance. Wave energy measurements taken simultaneously at each <b>reef</b> <b>line</b> confirmed that a gradient of physical disturbance existed. Community structure on each of the three <b>reef</b> <b>lines</b> was measured by determining the biomass and diversity of both functional groups and species at high, intermediate and low disturbance regimes. Comparisons between the two approaches were made using AN OVA of biomass data and derived diversity indices. Multivariate analysis techniques of ordination, Principal Axis Correlation (PCC) and ANOSIM (analysis of similarities) were used to detect patterns of assemblage change. The macroalgal assemblages within the target habitat were found to be highly variable, particularly within exposure levels, when examined at both the species and functional group levels. Overall, however, the functional group approach was less able to detect differences between levels of exposure. In conclusion, the use of the functional group approach is not recommended for communities displaying high spatial heterogeneity without further rigorous testing of the model. Use of the functional group approach resulted in considerable loss of information and did not account for physiological variations between all species in the one functional group. Furthermore, algal functional groups need to be more clearly defined to overcome problems of assigning species to groups that do not easily fit the model...|$|R

40|$|Kelps {{are highly}} {{productive}} seaweeds predominantly found in wave-exposed environments. Physical and biological {{processes such as}} sand abrasion, whiplash and grazing can wound kelp tissue, potentially weakening its ability to withstand wave forces. Despite the ecological importance of kelp tissue loss, few studies have quantified wounding patterns in kelps or how wounding might affect the biomechanical properties of kelps. We quantified the prevalence of wounds on 360 Ecklonia radiata kelps collected across 3 different <b>reef</b> <b>lines</b> (levels of wave exposure) in April (autumn), June (early winter), August (winter) and October (early spring) (i. e. before, during and after peak wave activity). Small holes in the centre of laterals dominated the wounds. Wounding pattern did not differ between <b>reef</b> <b>lines</b> but changed over time, with most in early winter and least in early spring (from 285 to 71 wounds kelp- 1). This pattern suggests that wounds accumulate over summer and that highly wounded parts of the frond (but not the entire kelp) break off when encountering the first storms. Biomechanical break-force tests assessed the effect of experimental wounds on the forces required to break kelp tissue. These tests showed that holes or horizontal cuts {{to the edge of}} the kelp frond dramatically reduced the strength, extensibility, toughness and stiffness of the tissue. We conclude that wounds are common in E. radiata and that the resulting loss of tissue integrity, caused by even small damages, can dramatically increase the susceptibility to breakage. Our findings may have important ecological implications; the peak in wounds in early winter is likely to increase fragmentation of the kelp, thereby reducing its size and hydrodynamic drag, and, paradoxically, reducing the risk of fatal dislodgment during severe winter storms...|$|R
