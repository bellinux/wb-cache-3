40|$|Learning {{computer}} science {{is no longer}} {{simply a matter of}} learning computer programming. Indeed, modern day computing jobs demand design, communication, and collaborative skills as well. In order to address this need and make computing education more engaging, motivating, and community-oriented, we have been exploring a “studio based ” approach in which students (a) construct computational solutions to problems that have many possible solution strategies, and then (b) present their solutions to their peers and instructors for feedback and discussion. In the fall of 2007, we implemented this approach in a pre-CS 1 course by requiring students to present their solutions to five course programming projects in face-to-face <b>review</b> <b>sessions.</b> Interview, and observational data collected in this course pointed out several practical and logistical problems surrounding the face-to-face <b>review</b> <b>sessions</b> that diminished their educational effectiveness. To address these problems, we describe the preliminary design of a novel asynchronous web-based project review system to support and augment face-to-face studiobased <b>review</b> <b>sessions.</b> This system, which is being iteratively designed and implemented in 2008, will provide a foundation for future empirical research into the effectiveness of studio-based approaches in computing education. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary results of comparing the design cognition of concept design review conversations of two product design disciplines: industrial design and mechanical engineering design. The comparison {{is based on}} a protocol analysis of two concept design review cases using the FBS ontologically-based coding scheme. Inter-disciplinary differences of concept design review were first examined in terms of each review session’s focus of cognitive effort expended on reasoning about design problem or design solution. Both <b>review</b> <b>sessions</b> were largely solution-focused, but the industrial design session is relatively more focused on reasoning about the design problem than the mechanical engineering design session. This matches previous findings from cognitive studies into designing processes. When examining the dynamic design cognition, the overall dynamic patterns of concept design <b>review</b> <b>sessions</b> were mainly consistent with the commonalities found in a variety of designing processes, using the measurement of cumulative occurrences of design issues. However, each individual review session’s cognitive focus on either reasoning about design problem or solution appeared as constant throughout the review conversations. This implies that concept design <b>review</b> <b>sessions</b> are different from designing sessions. Previous studies into designing processes showed that designers became less focused on the design problem and more engaged in the design solution as designing progressed...|$|R

50|$|A veto session, also {{referred}} to as a veto <b>review</b> <b>session</b> is a type of meeting held by state legislatures in the United States, used to reassess bills that have been vetoed by the governor of the state. State legislatures typically schedule the sessions in advance and only take up vetoed bills for discussion during the meetings. Veto sessions vary in length and time. The state legislature is in session for days. The duration if how many sessions depends on how many vetoed bills by the governor requires further study as well as how many of the vetoed bills the legislature wishes to discuss. State legislatures are no longer required if the representatives do not wish to overturn the vetoed bills. During veto sessions, discussions are conducted to sway the votes of members either in favor of or against the veto, after the discussions, members of the legislative body then vote and once the votes are tallied and a majority decision has been reached the Representatives may either vote to sustain or repeal the veto. When the final decision has been made the session adjourns.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different pathways for developing a life story book (LSB) for people with dementia. Method: Preliminary randomised control trial; 23 people with dementia in care homes (mean age 86) randomly assigned to receive either 12 individual life <b>review</b> <b>sessions</b> and co-creating a LSB or a personal LSB created by their relatives as a â��giftâ�� Results: No difference in quality of life (quality of lifeâ��Alzheimer's disease (QOLâ��AD)) was observed between the two groups, six weeks after having received the LSB (F(1, 20) = 0. 08, p = 0. 77). At this point, QOLâ��AD had improved for both groups, {{but there was a}} significant between-group difference at an intermediate assessment immediately after the life <b>review</b> <b>sessions</b> had been completed, before the LSBs were received (F(1, 20) = 5. 11, p = 0. 035), in favour of life review.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} quality of the Ph. D. {{research}} the Department introduced a special procedure for periodic evaluation: after a period of nine months the potential Ph. D. candidates are asked to present their research design, theoretical framework and methodological approach {{to the members of the}} Department and to an external review, drawn up by the professors of the Department and by external reviewer. Depending on the assessment of the review group, the candidates will have the opportunity to continue their research at the Department. In the mean time the (public) <b>review</b> <b>sessions</b> developed into an important element for the scientific debate of the Department. The sessions became a meeting point for the whole Department to discuss new research issues and new methodological approaches and to develop new research collaborations. In this framework the external members of the review group are playing an important role. Their critics form a mirror for the scientific standards of the Department as well as for the scientific (and social) relevancy of the research issues. With the publication of the this book we want to offer to a broader public the opportunity to deal with this debate. The different contributions are based on the papers the Ph.
