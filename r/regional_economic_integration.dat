The areas of co-operation include human resources development; recognition of professional qualifications; closer consultation on macroeconomic and financial policies; trade financing measures; enhanced infrastructure and communications connectivity; development of electronic transactions through e-ASEAN; integrating industries across the region to promote regional sourcing; and enhancing private sector involvement. Through the free movement of skilled labour, goods, services and investment, ASEAN will rise globally as one market with each member gaining from each other's strengths, thus increasing its competitiveness and opportunities for development.|$|E

40|$|Custom {{tariffs and}} the policy of custom tariffs have always been {{important}} instruments in the protection of domestic production from foreign competition, though the more in the past, the less in today's global economic environment. The idea of protectionism in international trade hasn't evaded the European Union either. The European Union has a common protectionist policy against countries that are not member to it. The agricultural production {{and the policy}} of administrative levies on the import of agricultural products pertain to the area that enjoys the highest degree of protection. The realization of such protectionist policy makes the international trade less free, while the free movement of goods is quintessential to the economic growth of the European Union, other <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>integrations,</b> individual countries and the society as such. The World Trade Organization, which imposes its own rules on the international trade, the creation of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> organizations in today's environment {{of international trade and}} free-trade agreements between individual states shrank to minimal the diapason of various protectionist measures and instruments. The decline of the idea of protectionism in international trade is evidenced by data on the share of the customs tariffs in the total fiscal revenues of the European Union and of the GDP of the member states. Namely, the fiscal impact of custom tariffs for some years shows a descending tendency, above all due to the process of globalization in foreign trade and liberalization at the scale of global economy. The European Union will be able to facilitate the development of the <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>integrations</b> only through the liberalization of foreign trade, because the idea of protectionism in international trade doesn't have perspectives on the long run...|$|R

Small states, as the subjects of research work, have been chosen precisely because of their size, here defined by quantitative criteria, but taking into account that relational criteria are very important for their positioning in international relations, such as greater exposure to external influences and their dependence on membership in <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> organizations and <b>integrations.</b> The GDP of small states, in an attempt to answer the hypothesis, was followed for a period of twenty years.

The findings obtained through the statistical data of the countries included in the region concerning the causes of inefficiency can be listed as inadequacy in converging with the rules of market economy and in adapting to the world economy, differences in macroeconomic structures (national income and income distribution, industrialization, national and foreign direct investments, foreign trade capacity and balance of payments), regional conflicts of interest and claim of power, lack of common goals, geographical position, and the contradictions created by being member to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and to regional integrations...|$|R

The objectives of this study are to evaluate factors affecting the export flows and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of trade enhancing and resisting factors used by exporting countries on world trade. The gravity model has been used to evaluate bilateral trade flows of 93 commodity-level trade flows over 1996 to 2001 between pairs of countries. Our results show that North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is more effective in increasing export flows than European Union (EU), and the effects of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>integrations</b> are more effective for agricultural commodities than non-agricultural commodities. international trade; gravity model; North American Free Trade Agreement; European Union; <b>regional</b> economics; <b>economic</b> integration; trade flows; export flows; exports; agricultural commodities. ...|$|R
