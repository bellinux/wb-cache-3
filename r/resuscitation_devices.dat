50|$|A {{resuscitator}} is {{a device}} using positive pressure to inflate the lungs of an unconscious {{person who is}} not breathing, {{in order to keep}} them oxygenated and alive. There are three basic types: a manual version (also known as a bag valve mask) consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the Expired Air or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an oxygen powered resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All <b>resuscitation</b> <b>devices</b> should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, {{more than}} 10, 000 {{different}} types of medical devices {{can be found in}} hospitals. This way, medical electrical equipment is being employed {{in a wide variety of}} fields in medical sciences with different physiological effects and measurements. Hospitals and medical centers must ensure that their critical medical devices are safe, accurate, reliable and operational at the required level of performance. Defibrillators are critical <b>resuscitation</b> <b>devices.</b> The use of reliable defibirillators has led to more effective treatments and improved patient safety through better control and management of complications during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Materials and Methods: The metrological reliability of twenty frequent use, manual defibrillators in use ten hospitals (4 private and 6 public) in one of the provinces of Iran according to international and national standards was evaluated. Results: Quantitative analysis of control and instrument accuracy showed the amount of the obtained results in many units are critical which had less value over the standard limitations especially in devices with poor battery. For the accuracy of delivered energy analysis, only twelve units delivered acceptable output values and the precision in the output energy measurements especialy in weak battry condition, after activation of discharge alarm, were low. Conclusion: Obtained results indicate a need for new and severe regulations on periodic performance verifications and medical equipment quality control program especially for high risk instruments. It is also necessary to provide training courses on the fundumentals of operation and performane parameters for medical staff in the field of meterology in medicine and how one can get good accuracy results especially in high risk medical devices...|$|E
40|$|Background. This study {{compared}} {{outcomes of}} abdominal lifting and compression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ALP-CPR) with standard CPR (STD-CPR). Materials and Methods. Patients with cardiac arrest seen from April to December 2014 were randomized to receive standard CPR or ALP-CPR performed {{with a novel}} abdominal lifting/compression device. The primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Results. Patients were randomized to receive ALP-CPR (n= 40) and STD-CPR (n= 43), and the groups had similar baseline characteristics. After CPR, 9 (22. 5 %) and 7 (16. 3 %) patients in the ALP-CPR and STD-CPR groups, respectively, obtained ROSC. At 60 minutes after ROSC, 7 (77. 8 %) and 2 (28. 6 %) patients, respectively, in the ALP-CPR and STD-CPR groups survived (P= 0. 049).

40|$|Intermittent {{positive}} pressure ventilation (IPPV) using {{a manual}} ventilation device {{is one of}} the most commonly performed interventions in neonatal medicine. Applied peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) and tidal volumes (TV) are highly variable, bearing the risk of ventilator induced lung injury. Additionally, positive end-expiratory pressure was shown to be lung protective. The aim was to assess the combined influence of operator and device specific influences on respiratory parameters in order to guarantee a lung protective management. We used simulated resuscitation scenario using a neonatal manikin approximating a 1 -kg preterm infant. A respiratory function monitor was fitted at the interface between mannequin and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>device</b> to: 1) measure PIP and TV application using a self-inflating bag compared to a T-piece device 2) to compare the influence of operator skills assessed by a questionnaire to applied PIP and TV, and 3) to assess the ability to consistently generate PEEP in self-inflating bags compared to T-piece-devices. Using the self-inflating bag PIP and TV were significantly higher compared to the T-piece device: median PIP was 25. 6 cmH 2 O vs. 19. 7 cmH 2 O (p< 0. 001); median TV was 5. 1 vs. 3. 6 ml (p< 0. 001). Using a self-inflating bag PIP and TV were highly dependent on operator specific skills. In contrast PIP and TV application did not depend on operator specific skills using a T-piece-device. Using the self-inflating bag PEEP was significantly lower compared to the T-piece device: mean PEEP was 2. 95 vs. 5. 59 cmH 2 O. When using self-inflating bags excessive high PIP and TV were recorded, while PEEP levels do not reach the requirements. Operator training level and device-specific experience had a significant impact on PIP and VT provision when using SI-bags for manual ventilation, but not in T-piece devices. Use of T-piece devices guarantees reliable and constant Vt and PIP provision, irrespective of individual, operator dependent variables...|$|R
40|$|Design has {{a social}} agenda. It {{is clear that}} we have the {{responsibility}} to help those who are in need, but it is also vital to redefine what meaningful prosperity is for us. Most of the designers dedicate their time and energy to developing products and systems solely for the wealthy 10 % of the world’s population. Nothing less than a paradigm shift is required for design to include the other 90 %. What we need more than ever is design inspired by commonality not by difference. There is no reason why designers cannot design for the underserved population while tending the needs of our own communities. Design can create opportunities for bridging markets and creating unexpected partnerships that will result in shared investments, capital, and benefits. According to the World Health Organization, nearly one million babies die each year due to birth difficulties. With proper training and equipment, many of newborn fatalities due to breathing complications could be avoided. Neonatal resuscitation is commenced to assist the newborn’s first breath. However, {{because of the lack of}} proper training, expensive equipment and under staffing, hospitals and communities in developing countries struggle to perform effective resuscitation. Meanwhile, in developed countries, home birth scenarios require midwives to be fully prepared with standard resuscitation equipment. There is a demand for a low-cost, highly portable and reliable <b>resuscitation</b> <b>device</b> globally. This research project applied user-centred design principles to enhance the experience and effectiveness of neonatal resuscitation for inexperienced rescuers in both the developing and developed world context. The practice acts as a tool to explore the notion of using Third World constraints as innovation drivers for the whole World. Designing for the Third world often means a ruthless pursue of affordability, accessibility and reliability. Products and systems must be low cost, low maintenance, intuitive to use and highly reliable to meet users’ needs.

The CPR RsQ Assist Device (CPR RAD) {{is a new}} cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> <b>device</b> for chest compression. It is operated manually {{but it does not}} pull up on the chest on the up stroke. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the CPR RAD with standard manual compression in terms of chest compression quality in a manikin model. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to either the device or manual chest compression group. Each participant performed a maximum of 4 minutes of hands-only compression with or without the device. During chest compression, the following quality parameters from the manikin were recorded: compression rate, compression depth, and correctness of hand position. Results: Duration of chest compression was significantly higher in device users compared with manual compression (223. 93 ± 36. 53 vs 179. 67 ± 50. 81 seconds; P< 0. 001). The mean compression depth did not differ in a statistically significant way between manual compression and device at 2 minutes (56. 42 ± 6. 42 vs 54. 25 ± 5. 32; P= 0. 052). During the first and second minutes, compression rate was higher in cases of standard compression (133. 21 ± 15. 95 vs 108 ± 9. 45; P< 0. 001 and 127. 41 ± 27. 77 vs 108. 5 ± 9. 93; P< 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of participants who employed compression that was too shallow or exhibited incorrect hand position. Conclusion: The CPR RAD is more effective in chest compression compared with manual chest compression, as using the device led to better results in terms of fatigue reduction and correct compression rate than standard manual compression.

Quality of CPR, Return Of Spontaneous Circulation, Survival) ”. Methods Databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library (including Cochrane database for systematic reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), Embase, and AHA EndNote Master Library were systematically searched. Further references were gathered from cross-references from articles and reviews as well as forward search using SCOPUS and Google scholar. The inclusion criteria for this review included manikin and human studies of adult cardiac arrest and anti-arrhythmic agents, peer-review. Excluded were review articles, case series and case reports. Results Out of 88 articles identified, only 10 studies met the inclusion criteria for further review. Of these 10 articles, 1 was Level of Evidence (LOE) 1, 4 LOE 2, 3 LOE 3, 0 LOE 4, 2 LOE 5. 4 studies evaluated the quality of CPR in terms of compression adequacy while the remaining six studies evaluated on clinical outcomes in terms of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission, survival to discharge and Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC). 7 studies were supporting the clinical question, 1 neutral and 2 opposing.

Airway Devices are not yet available for them. In this prospective study 141 laypersons without any medical experience were instructed to use four different supraglottic airway devices in a simulation model after a short training session. They performed an insertion and ventilation with each device to achieve a sufficient tidal volume. The time required, the number of experimental approaches until the first sufficient ventilation, the achieved tidal volume and the order of device using were identified. Finally, the study participants were asked about their personal favorite device, their opinion concerning the just-tested method of airwaymanagement and other similar issues of cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation.</b> The <b>devices</b> tested were a Laryngeal Mask Airway, a Cobra PLA, a LMA Fastrach and a Laryngeal Tube. A key finding was, that each study participant was able to perform a succesfull insertion and a sufficient ventilation after a short three-minute introduction – most of them even on the first attempt. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} and the personal opinion of study participants after the simulation showed the clear superiority of the LMA Fastrach. Furthermore, 90 percent of the laypersons participated explained to support this method of airwaymanagement, 86 percent affirmed to reduce their own inhibitions as compared to mouth-to-mouth-ventilationin the case of emergency. 67 percent felt to be able of this method only after this short trainig. These results show the necessity of a reform of Basic Life Support: A standardized integration of supraglottic airway devices into Basic Life Support – in particular the LMA Fastrach – constitutes a scientific and favorable progress in pre-clinical emergency medicine.

Whether effective continuous feedback could also be given verbally by a second rescuer ("human feedback") has not been investigated yet. We, therefore, compared the effect of human feedback to a CPR feedback device. METHODS In an open, prospective, randomised, controlled trial, we compared CPR performance of three groups of medical students in a two-rescuer scenario. Group "sCPR" was taught standard BLS without continuous feedback, serving as control. Group "mfCPR" was taught BLS with mechanical audio-visual feedback (HeartStart MRx with Q-CPR-Technology™). Group "hfCPR" was taught standard BLS with human feedback. Afterwards, 326 medical students performed two-rescuer BLS on a manikin for 8  min. CPR quality parameters, such as "effective compression ratio" (ECR: compressions with correct hand position, depth and complete decompression multiplied by flow-time fraction), and other compression, ventilation and time-related parameters were assessed for all groups. RESULTS ECR was comparable between the hfCPR and the mfCPR group (0. 33 vs. 0. 35, p[*]=[*] 0. 435).

40|$|Background. Cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR) {{feedback}} <b>devices</b> {{are being}} increasingly used. However, current accelerometer-based devices overestimate chest displacement when CPR is performed on soft surfaces, which {{may lead to}} insufficient compression depth. Aim. To assess {{the performance of a}} new algorithm for measuring compression depth and rate based on two accelerometers in a simulated resuscitation scenario. Materials and Methods. Compressions were provided to a manikin on two mattresses, foam and sprung, with and without a backboard. One accelerometer was placed on the chest and the second at the manikin’s back. Chest displacement and mattress displacement were calculated from the spectral analysis of the corresponding acceleration every 2 seconds and subtracted to compute the actual sternal-spinal displacement. Compression rate was obtained from the chest acceleration. Results. Median unsigned error in depth was 2. 1 [*]mm (4. 4 %). Error was 2. 4 [*]mm in the foam and 1. 7 [*]mm in the sprung mattress (p< 0. 001). Error was 3. 1 / 2. 0 [*]mm and 1. 8 / 1. 6 [*]mm with/without backboard for foam and sprung, respectively (p< 0. 001). Median error in rate was 0. 9 [*]cpm (1. 0 %), with no significant differences between test conditions. Conclusion.
