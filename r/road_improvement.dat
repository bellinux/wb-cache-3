Increased traffic in recent years, encouraged by retail development, has resulted in very congested main roads {{for most of the}} day. This situation is linked to the town's geography, with river valleys and railway lines impeding <b>road</b> <b>improvement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not {{withdraw}} to North Vietnam {{during the rainy}} season. Previously during the conflict, air mobility by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with an advantage over the road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. This advantage was {{now going to be}} overcome by <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> and the prepositioning of supplies which allowed the communists to maintain year-round use of their lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|The SJTA {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a major <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> project that would link the Atlantic City International Airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with an overpass above Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass {{at the end of}} Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township.|$|E

From Lower Hutt it was completed to Petone (1905), Rocky Point (1906), Paparangi Point (1907), Ngauranga (1908), Kaiwharawhara (1909), and Wellington in 1911.|$|E

These solutions would be very expensive and could only be justified if they were comprehensively planned, including social as well as traffic needs.

In 1897, the Jamaica Plain Carnival Association formed to manage and promote the 4th of July parade, contests and fireworks. Two years later, the Jamaica Plain Businessmen's Association formed to promote commercial development. Within three years, prominent community members were {{invited to join the}} newly named Jamaica Plain Citizen's Association. The new group worked to encourage <b>road</b> <b>improvement,</b> playgrounds, lectures, schools, and other community amenities. In 1897, the Tuesday Club formed for women (who were not admitted to the other groups), and still exists at the Loring Greenough house.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} eighteenth century the crown devoted some {{resources}} to the study and remedy the problem of poor roads.

The Spanish crown finally decided that <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> was {{in the interests of the}} state for military purposes, as well as for fomenting commerce, agriculture, and industry, but the lack of state involvement in the development of physical infrastructure was to have lasting effects constraining development until the late nineteenth century. Despite some improvements, the roads still made transit difficult, particularly for heavy military equipment.|$|E
25|$|Graves in {{the central}} section of the {{cemetery}} were sporadically discovered between 1839 and 1964, as a road was built and enlarged {{through the middle of}} it. The likely first discovery of skeletons at the site was in 1839, when the Sevenoaks Turnpike Road was diverted, which would have entailed digging at the site; no burials were recorded, although an oral tradition of skeletons and weapons being discovered survived through to the 1930s, when it was recorded by Gordon Ward. In June 1956 the A26 underwent roadworks, resulting in the discovery of 13 further graves. In 1956 and 1958, the Otford Historical Society began an excavation nearby, in the hope of discovering more of the cemetery, but they missed the burial area, discovering nothing. In August 1959, another <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> revealed 3 further graves {{on the west side of}} the bank, while in November 1959 and January 1960, schoolboys digging into the chalk uncovered two more. A further grave was discovered around 1963 by workmen building a small reservoir; this burial was not recorded.|$|E

Instead Avinor recommends improving the road to Alta airport ( [...] driving distance). Such a <b>road</b> <b>improvement,</b> costing 440 M kr, is now scheduled for 2014-2016.|$|E
500|$|The road has {{suffered}} from traffic congestion since the mid 19th century. Various <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> schemes have taken place since then, including a major reconstruction programme in the early 1960s that transformed the road into a three-lane dual carriageway by removing a [...] section of Hyde Park. Improved crossings for cyclists appeared in the early 21st century. Despite the changes, property prices along the road are still {{among the highest in}} London. Its prestigious status has been commemorated by being the second-most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E
500|$|Traffic {{declined}} as {{the railway}} companies neglected the canal, and {{were down to}} 18,802 tons in 1905, on which the tolls amounted to £242 and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1936, formally closing the canal, though {{there had been no}} boat traffic since 1929. The closure act stipulated that water levels should be maintained at [...] to support agricultural needs. This effectively guaranteed the continued existence of the canal channel, but structures such as locks and bridges deteriorated, and in the 1950s 46 of the 69 bridges over the canal were lowered as part of <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> schemes. Although the low bridges act as barriers to navigation, large parts of the canal are still in water.|$|E

In 1935 it was chosen as a property for the British version of Monopoly. [...] The building was sold to the London County Council in 1959 to be demolished as part of plans for <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> works that did not take place. It was returned to private ownership, renovated from 1979 and reopened in 1982 as the Angel Corner House. It is currently used as offices and a branch of the Co-operative Bank, and is a grade II listed building. In 1998 a new pub called the Angel, operated by J D Wetherspoon, opened at an adjacent premises.|$|E
500|$|Saskatchewan Highway 641 is {{a highway}} in the {{province}} of Saskatchewan, Canada, beginning at Highway 39 near Rouleau, and traveling north ending at Highway 15 at Semans. [...] The highway intersects the Trans Canada Highway, Saskatchewan Highway 1 south of Pense and east of Belle Plaine, Highway 20 at Lumsden, and Highway 22 at Earl Grey. [...] Local Improvement Districts were the precursors of rural municipalities which initially established and maintained roads in their area. Early settlers helped to construct and maintain the route and would get paid <b>road</b> <b>improvement</b> wages from the local rural municipality. [...] The [...] concurrency between Highway 20 and Highway 641 was constructed in 1927 following the removal of the Canadian National Railway line between Lumsden and Craven.

500|$|The {{first major}} {{rerouting}} of SR40 occurred between 1963 and 1966 when the highway {{was moved to}} its present alignment between the Charlton–Camden county line and Kingsland. By 1982, the highway had been expanded to a divided highway around its interchange with I-95 and to a four-lane undivided highway from there to St. Marys. The divided highway section was extended west toward downtown Kingsland in 1984. SR40's interchange with St. Marys Road was built and the highway was expanded to a divided highway from Kings Bay Road to SR40 Spur by 1986. The {{entire length of the}} highway was designated a Governor's <b>Road</b> <b>Improvement</b> Program (GRIP) corridor in 1989. GDOT plans to expand the entire highway west of I-95 to a four-lane divided highway. The first new section of the highway to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway was the [...] stretch west of the Charlton–Camden county line, which was completed in 2004.|$|E
