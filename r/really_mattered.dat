5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only <b>really</b> <b>mattered</b> in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{second early}} stone design, {{emerging}} from the 12th century onwards, was the shell keep, a donjon annulaire in French, which involved replacing the wooden keep on a motte, or the palisade on a ringwork, with a circular stone wall. Shell keeps were sometimes further protected by an additional low protective wall, called a chemise, around their base. Buildings could then be built around {{the inside of the}} shell, producing a small inner courtyard at the centre. The style was particularly popular in south-east England and across Normandy, although less so elsewhere. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development, as is the later Launceston Castle; prominent Normandy and Low Country equivalents include Gisors and the Burcht van Leiden – these castles were amongst the most powerful fortifications of the period. Although the circular design held military advantages over one with square corners, as noted above these <b>really</b> <b>mattered</b> from only the end of the 12th century onwards; the major reason for adopting a shell keep design, in the 12th century at least, was the circular design of the original earthworks exploited to support the keep; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that found at Windsor Castle.|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} day, 4th Parachute Brigade's lift of ninety-two C-47s (for the paratroops), forty-nine Horsa and nine Hamilcar gliders (for the artillery, {{vehicles}} and crews), {{were scheduled to}} arrive furthest away from Arnhem on Ginkel Heath drop zone 'Y', {{as early as possible}} on Monday 18September 1944. [...] The brigade's objective was to capture the high ground north-west of Arnhem. In their last briefing before departure, Brigadier Hackett dismissed all officers except for the battalion commanders and the brigade staff and told them;"They could forget what they had been told. Being put down where we were, with surprise gone and the opposition alerted, and given the German capability for a swift and violent response to any threat to what <b>really</b> <b>mattered,</b> they could expect their hardest fighting and worst casualties, not in defence of the final perimeter, but in trying to get there." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that <b>really</b> <b>mattered</b> to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Ryelandt wrote a {{great deal}} of vocal music, his ideal was {{absolute}} music. But there was an ideal beyond that. For Ryelandt, music was a religious vocation. The following words from the preface to his Notices sur mes oeuvres sum up what <b>really</b> <b>mattered</b> to him: “I think … I can say that I have not been a useless servant of art. I have done what I could. The future will decide if anything of this work will survive me to the greater glory of God.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Economist Paul Krugman argues {{against the}} notion that {{protectionism}} caused the Great Depression."Where protectionism <b>really</b> <b>mattered</b> was in preventing a recovery in trade when production recovered". He cites a report by Barry Eichengreen and Douglas Irwin: Figure 1 in that report shows trade and production dropping together from 1929 to 1932, but production increasing faster than trade from 1932 to 1937. [...] The authors argue that adherence to the gold standard forced many countries to resort to tariffs, when instead they should have devalued their currencies.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, Philip Hope-Wallace of The Guardian {{spoke of}} [...] "the animation, command and sheer genius for keeping things {{up to the}} mark of this most devoted servant of the tradition." [...] Of a 1964 {{performance}} of Iolanthe at New York City Center, the New York Herald Tribune reported, [...] "The carrot thatch we have loved all these years has now burnished to a silver gold alloy {{but it could have}} been dark green for all we cared. [...] What <b>really</b> <b>mattered</b> was that [...] was there ... and that the Company was in superb condition, the best that it has been in for years." [...] The New York Times concurred, [...] "Isidore Godfrey, happily a fixture in the pit, leads the overture with a respect and affection for its delicacies and that is the fashion in which he orders the musical side of the entire performance." [...] "If ever a knighthood were deserved in the cause of true musical devotion, it is here", wrote the critic Ivan March in The Great Records. [...] In 2007 The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music praised him as [...] "inimitable".|$|E
2500|$|In early 2016, it was {{announced}} that Khan is moving up two weight divisions to middleweight, to fight Saul [...] "Canelo" [...] Álvarez (46-1-1, 32 KOs) for his lineal, Ring and WBC world middleweight championship titles. The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV. Golden Boy Promotions expected the fight to bring in 2 million PPV buys. Canelo was likely to be getting a career payday against Khan because this is a fight that will almost surely bring in more PPV buys on HBO than Canelo's last fight against Miguel Cotto last November. That fight brought in 900,000 PPV buys on HBO. Khan eventually lost to Álvarez by way of knockout in Round 6. Although many believe Khan was ahead on points including ESPN, two of the ringside judges had Canelo ahead after five round (49-46 & 48-47), the third judge had Khan ahead (48-47). With the scorecards heading towards a split decision halfway through the fight, Khan admitted, [...] "it may have been a blessing being knocked out in the 6th round, rather than an upset loss on the scorecards after 12 rounds. According to CompuBox, Alvarez landed 64 of 170 (38 percent) and Khan landed 48 of 166 punches (29 percent), though only one of their shots <b>really</b> <b>mattered.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Princess chose her {{dressing}} style based {{on both the}} Royal Family's demands and popular modern styles in Britain, and developed her personal trend of fashion. While on diplomatic trips, her numerous clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries' costumes, and while off-duty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers. [...] "She was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted, {{it was something that}} <b>really</b> <b>mattered</b> to her," [...] stated Anna Harvey, a former editor of Vogue and the Princess's fashion mentor. David Sassoon, one of the designers who worked with Diana, believed that she had [...] "broken the rules" [...] with trying new styles. Diana chose not to practice some of the royal methods for clothing including putting aside the tradition of wearing gloves as she believed it would prevent direct connection with the people she met, such as those affected by serious diseases like AIDS patients. She used to wear certain types of ensembles and clothes at charity events which would also match the mentality of the people she would meet, for instance wearing colourful dresses and [...] "jangling jewels" [...] so she could easily play with children at hospitals. According to Donatella Versace who had closely worked with the Princess alongside her brother, Diana's interest and sense of curiosity in fashion grew significantly after her separation from Charles. Versace also points out that [...] " [...] think that anyone, before or after her, has done for fashion what Diana did." ...|$|E
