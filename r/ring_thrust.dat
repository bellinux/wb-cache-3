The article suggests way to continue the author’s research in the field of fan-in-fin system aerodynamics. It also offers a method of aerodynamic characteristics of “fan-in-fin” (fenestron) system with cylindrical diffuser of limited length in flow regime under zero angle of attack calculation.

Momentum drag is high enough, this fact leads to back deviation of total aerodynamic force system. This angle increases with increase of the diffuser length and at medium speed it can reach 30 °.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{thruster}} technology offers promising low speed maneuvering capabilities for underwater vehicles. Similar to the natural locomotion of squid and jellyfish the thruster successively forces fluid jets {{in and out of}} a small internal cavity. We investigate several properties of squid and jellyfish locomotion to drive the thruster design including actuation of nozzle geometry and vortex <b>ring</b> <b>thrust</b> augmentation. The thrusters are compact with no extruding components to negatively impact the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s drag. These devices have thrust rise-times orders of magnitude faster than those reported for typical propeller thrusters, making them an attractive option for high accuracy underwater vehicle maneuvering. The dynamics of starting jet circulation, impulse, and kinetic energy are derived in terms of kinematics at the entrance boundary of a semi-infinite domain, specifically identifying the effect of a non-parallel incoming flow. A model for pressure at the nozzle is derived without the typical reliance on a predetermined potential function, making it a powerful tool for modeling any jet flow. Jets are created from multiple nozzle configurations to validate these models, and velocity and vorticity fields are determined using DPIV techniques. A converging starting jet resulted in circulation 90 - 100...|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{cryogenic}} pumps {{used for}} propellant loading at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and other NASA Centers have a bellows mechanical seal and oil bath ball bearings, {{both of which}} can be problematic and require high maintenance. Because of the extremely low temperatures, the mechanical seals are made of special materials and design, have wearing surfaces, are subject to improper installation, and commonly are a potential leak path. The ball bearings are non-precision bearings [ABEC- 1 (Annular Bearing Engineering Council) ] and are lubricated using LOX compatible oil. This oil is compatible with the propellant to prevent explosions, but does not have good lubricating properties. Due to the poor lubricity, it has been a goal of the KSC cryogenics community for the last 15 years to develop a magnetically coupled pump, which would eliminate these two potential issues. A number of projects have been attempted, but none of the pumps was a success. An off-the-shelf magnetically coupled pump (typically used with corrosive fluids) was procured that has been used for hypergolic service at KSC. The KSC Cryogenics Test Lab (CTL) operated the pump in cryogenic LN 2 as received to determine a baseline for modifications required. The pump bushing, bearings, and <b>thrust</b> <b>rings</b> failed, and the pump would not flow liquid (this is a typical failure mode that was experienced in the previous attempts). Using the knowledge gained over the years designing and building cryogenic pumps, the CTL determined alternative materials that would be suitable for use under the pump design conditions. The CTL procured alternative materials for the bearings (bronze, aluminum bronze, and glass filled PTFE) and machined new bearing bushings, sleeves, and <b>thrust</b> <b>rings.</b> The designed clearances among the bushings, sleeves, <b>thrust</b> <b>rings,</b> case, and case cover were altered once again using experience gained from previous cryogenic pump rebuilds and designs. The alternative material parts were assembled into the pump, and the pump was successfully operated meeting all expected operating parameters. Unique pump sub-assembly parts were designed and manufactured by the CTL using specialized materials determined to be superior for cryogenic thermal applications under the pump design conditions. This work is a proof-of-concept/proof-of-operation of the pump only. Other known internal design modifications to the pump should be accomplished for the long-term use of the pump. An upscaled version of this pump, which is under development and testing at the CTL, can be used either for current or future vehicle loading or for vehicle replenishment.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} of using synthetic jet actuators for the propulsion of small underwater vehicles. This work {{was inspired by the}} widespread use of pusatile jet propulsion by sea creatures such as squid, salp, and jellyfish. The jets created by these animals utilize vortex <b>rings</b> for <b>thrust</b> production. A method for creating similar vortex ring-based jets is the use of synthetic, or zero net mass flux, jets. These jets, which form a jet structure through the alternating sucking and blowing of fluid through a single orifice, have previously been investigated for the utility in air flow control. The design, construction, and testing of aquatic synthetic jet prototypes is presented. Force measurement and flow visualization experiments are performed on these jets to gain an understanding of the forces and flow structures produced. The flow visualizations confirm the outflow vortex ring observations reported previously in the literature and present the first images of vortex ring formation inside the synthetic jet chamber. A new phenomenon, that of self-induced coflow upstream of the jet orifice, is discussed. The force measurements present confirmation that a net thrust is produced by the jets and give insight to the relationship between jet forcing parameters (such as frequency) and the resulting thrust. An automated genetic algorithmic approach to optimizing the thrust for a given jet geometry is also presented and tested. Using the results of these experiments I propose a model for synthetic jet thrust. This model asserts that there are three force producing components to the flow: orifice inflow, orifice outflow, and a self-induced coflow. The contribution of each of these components is derived and compared with experimental results. Included {{at the end of this}} thesis is a preliminary study into possible vehicle architecture for the utilization of synthetic jet thrusters...|$|R
5000|$|Titan I {{also was}} the first true {{multi-stage}} (two or more stages) design. The Atlas missile had all three of its main rocket engines ignited at launch (two were jettisoned during flight) due to concerns about igniting rocket engines at high altitude and maintaining combustion stability. Martin, in part, {{was selected as the}} contractor because it had [...] "recognized the 'magnitude of the altitude of the altitude start problem' for the second stage and had a good suggestion for solving it." [...] Titan I's second-stage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude, after separation from the first stage booster. The first stage, besides including heavy fuel tanks and engines, also had launch interface equipment and the launch pad <b>thrust</b> <b>ring</b> with it. When the first stage had finished consuming its propellant, it dropped away, thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle. Titan I’s ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage meant that Titan I had a much greater total range (and a greater range per pound of second-stage fuel) than Atlas, even if the total fuel load of Atlas had been greater.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{application}} of a ring cowl to an airplane with an air-cooled engine increases the maximum L/D and the high speed to an appreciable extent, the performance in climb and ceiling is not increased as much as one would expect without analyzing the conditions. When a ring cowl is installed on an airplane, the propeller is set at a higher pitch to allow the engine to turn its rated r. p. m. at the increased high speed. V/nD is increased and the propeller efficiency at high speed is increased slightly. The ratio of r. p. m. at climbing speed, V(sub c), to the r. p. m. at maximum speed, V (sub m) is dependent upon the ratio of V(sub c) to V(sub m). The increase in V(sub c) for all airplane with ring cowl i s not as great as the increase in V(sub m), so that the ratio V(sub c) /V(sub m) is less than for the airplane without ring. Consequently the r. p. m. and full throttle thrust power available are less at V(sub c) for the airplane with ring cowl and in spite of the increase in L/D due to the installation of the <b>ring,</b> the excess <b>thrust</b> power available for climbing is not appreciably changed.

40|$|Abstract—We {{explored}} simple geologic {{strength and}} material response models {{to determine which}} {{have the capability to}} simulate impact-induced faulting, complicated ejecta patterns and complex crater shapes. This led us to develop models for material damage, dilatancy, and inhomogeneous materials (mixtures). We found that a strength degradation (damage) model was necessary to produce faulting in homogeneous materials. Both normal and <b>thrust</b> <b>ring</b> faults may occur and extend relatively deeply into the planet during the transient cavity radial expansion. The maximum depth of fault development is about the depth of maximum penetration by the projectile. Dilatancy in geologic materials may reduce the final bulk density compared to the pristine state because of irreversible fracturing. When we include the effects of dilatancy, the radial position of faulting is displaced because of greater upward motions. In addition, the late time crater profile is shallower and the expression of features such as central peaks and rings may be more pronounced. Both damage and rock-ice mixtures effect the distribution of ejecta. The excavation flow field within the heavily damaged region is similar to flow fields in Mohr-Coulomb materials with no zero-pressure strength. In the outer, less damaged zone within the excavation cavity, the material trajectories collapse back into the crater. This effect creates a zone of reduced ejecta emplacement {{near the edge of the}} final crater. In the case of rock-ice mixtures, energy is preferentially deposited in the more compressible volatile component and the ejecta pattern is dependent upon the location of shock-induced phase changes in the volatile material...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an impulse framework for analyzing the hydrodynamic forces on bodies in flow. This general theoretical framework is widely applicable, {{and it is}} used to address the hydrodynamics of fish propulsion, water entry of spheres, and the offdesign performance of marine propellers. These seemingly-unrelated physics problems share a key common thread: The forces on these fish, spheres, and propellers can be modeled as the sum of the reaction to the rate of change of (1) the pressure impulse required to set up the potential flow about the body, and (2) the vortex impulse required to create the vortical structures {{in the wake of the}} body. Fish generate propulsive forces by creating and manipulating large-scale vortical structures using their body and tail. High-speed particle image velocimetry experiments show that a fish generates two vortex rings during a C-turn maneuver and that the change in momentum of the fish balances the change in pressure impulse plus the vortex impulse of these rings. When a sphere plunges into a basin of water and creates a sub-surface air cavity in place of a vortical wake, the vortex impulse is zero, and the force on the sphere is given by the pressure impulse component. Using data from high-speed imaging experiments, a semi-empirical numerical simulation is developed herein; this numerical model shows how the presence of the cavity alters the unsteady pressure force on the sphere and modulates the dynamics of the impact event. During steady propeller operation, the pressure impulse is constant, and the loads on the propeller are given by the vortex impulse component. To analyze these loads, a computational design and analysis tool is presented; this code suite is based on propeller lifting line theory, which is shown to be a special case of the general impulse framework of this thesis. A marine propeller is designed, built, and tested over a range of off-design operating conditions. Experimental results match the predicted performance curve for this propeller, which provides important validation data for the numerical method presented herein. 3 Bringing this thesis full circle, the unsteady startup of the propellor is addressed, which is analogous to the impulsive maneuvering of the swimming fish. As in the fish maneuvering problem, the propellor generates a ring-like vortical wake, and it is shown herein how the vortex impulse of these <b>rings</b> provides <b>thrust</b> for the propellor. With the perspective of the impulse framework developed in this thesis, the results of these tandem experimental investigations and numerical simulations provide deeper insight into classical fluid-dynamics theory and modern experimental hydrodynamics. by Brenden P.

If you want to understand, by a rough but correct description, what a coral polype is: all who have been to the sea-side know, or at least have heard of, sea-anemones.

40|$|A {{helicopter}} rotor in {{descent flight}} encounters its own wake, {{resulting in a}} doughnut-shaped ring around the rotor disk, known as the Vortex Ring State (VRS). Flight in VRS condition can be dangerous as it may cause uncommanded drop in descent rate, loss of control effectiveness, power settling, excessive thrust and torque fluctuations, and vibration. As simple momentum theory is no longer valid for a rotor in VRS, modeling of rotor inflow in VRS continues to challenge researchers, especially for flight simulation applications. In this dissertation, a simplified inflow model, called the ring vortex model, is developed for a helicopter rotor operating in descent condition. By creating a series of vortex rings near the rotor disk, the ring vortex model addresses the strong flow interaction between the rotor wake and the surrounding airflow in descent flight. In addition, the total mass flow parameter in the existing inflow models is augmented to create a steady state transition between the helicopter and the windmill branches. With the ring vortex model, rotor inflow can now be adequately predicted {{over a wide range}} of descent rates. Validations of the ring vortex model for helicopter rotors are conducted extensively in axial and inclined descent. Effects from blade taper, blade twist, and rotor thrust are also investigated with further application of the finite-state inflow model. The ring vortex model is applied to a single main-rotor helicopter. The main effort is to establish VRS boundary based on heave stability criterion. In addition, two important phenomena observed in the descent flight tests are addressed in the dynamic simulation, including uncommanded drop in descent rate and loss of collective control effectiveness. The ring vortex model is further applied to a side-by-side rotor configuration. Lateral thrust asymmetry on the side-by-side rotor configuration can be reproduced through uneven distribution of vortex rings at the two rotors. Two important issues are investigated, including the impact of vortex <b>rings</b> on lateral <b>thrust</b> deficit and on lateral AFCS limit. Ph. D.
