There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, the increasingly rare <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|Nestling {{birds are}} common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees {{rather than on}} the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from perch to perch and {{scanning}} surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in <b>riparian</b> <b>forest</b> strips and green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. This may be due to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this work}} were to {{describe}} the conservation status of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> located in a mountain subtropical basin of Tucumán province, Argentina, and assess how the quality of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> is related with altitude, plant species richness, proportion of exotic species, and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in adjacent rivers. Composition and species richness of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> were studied at 16 sites located along an altitudinal gradient and TSS was determined from water samples collected in each site. In order to evaluate conservation status of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests,</b> we calculated an index of Quality of Yungas <b>Riparian</b> <b>Forests</b> (QBRy). We recorded 90 plant species at all sites, from which 77 % were native. QBRy index was mainly associated with altitude and varied from <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> with good preservation or slightly disturbed to those with extreme degradation. At lower altitude, forests were more disturbed, more invaded by exotic plant species, and closer to urban and cropped areas. QBRy was not correlated with species richness or TSS. Like other <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> of Argentina, plant species invasion increased their degradation; therefore, future studies should focus on native <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> conservation and on the management of invasive plant species, which affect their quality...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000230033300002 International audienceWe {{compared}} {{the structure of}} 12 Central African primate communities, 6 in <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> and 6 in adjacent terra firma forests and discussed the implications for primate conservation. The communities in <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> included on average 1. 5 times more primate species than those in terra firma forests {{due to the fact}} that <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> shelter 4 specialist species and 6 - 7 generalist species. The results differ from findings in Amazonia where <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> consistently have fewer primate species than terra firma forests accommodate. This may be partly explained by the water level amplitude in Amazonian <b>riparian</b> <b>forests,</b> which deterred the radiation of semiterrestrial species. In Africa, most riparian-specialist primates are terrestrially-adapted and have access to an enlarged food niche. In terms of African primate conservation, we recommend protecting <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> and adjacent terra firma forests so that most of the lowland forest diversity is captured. The linear shape of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> (which allows gene flow over long distance) and their persistence in anthropic landscape (because they represent lands of lesser value for agriculture and logging than mainland forests) predispose them to act as biodiversity sanctuaries...|$|R

The {{published}} {{version is}} copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be}} found here: [URL] settlement and organized fire suppression have been associated with structural and compositional changes in many upland forests of the western United States, but {{little is known about the}} impacts on <b>riparian</b> <b>forests,</b> portions of the landscape protected for habitat and water quality. In this study, we used dendro-ecological methods to characterize the pre-settlement disturbance and tree recruitment processes of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> in the Rogue River basin of southwestern Oregon and to identify changes to the forest structure and composition post-settlement. Our results suggest <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> in our study area developed with frequent disturbance by fire and that Euro-American land management shifted these forests onto a new successional trajectory. Our findings indicate the current hands-off management regime for <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> under the Northwest Forest Plan will continue along this altered trajectory and have ecologically undesirable consequences. We suggest that the restoration of pre-settlement forest dynamics in fire-prone forests of southwestern Oregon will be most effective where it includes density reductions in overstory trees and prescribed fire in both upland and <b>riparian</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Riparian</b> <b>forests</b> {{are often}} small in area, but are of extreme {{ecological}} and economic value for local people. The interest of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> lies in their resources: basically fertile and moist soils, water, wood and {{non-timber forest products}} that are utilised by neighbouring populations to satisfy their basic needs and as source of income. Their abusive overuse is widespread and growing in Benin. As a result rich biological resources, especially plant species, are disappearing {{before they can be}} inventoried and assessed. Most recent management plans for protected areas barely consider the conservation of <b>riparian</b> <b>forests.</b> The forest law in Benin recognises their uniqueness, but several problems arise in the implementation of the rules in these particular areas. The most common and widespread tree species in <b>riparian</b> <b>forests</b> in Benin are Pterocarpus santalinoides, Cola laurifolia, Syzygium guineense, Berlinia grandiflora, Elaeis guineensis, Manilkara multinervis, Xylopia parviflora, Dialium guineense, Diospyros mespiliformis and Parinari congensis. Waterways and their forested banks are rich in birdlife, and serve as a focal point for primates and animals of many kinds. Site-specific studies at ground level are essential to assess riparian systems because their narrow linear shapes generally require data on plant community structure, floristic composition and animal presence. Details of vegetation layers under the dominant trees cannot yet be detected by remotely sensed data.
