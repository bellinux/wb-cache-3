40|$|Induced {{hydraulic}} {{fracture of}} strata during roof bolt installation is a potentially prevalent, but masked phenomenon within the underground coal industry. Previously reported resin testing programs (McTyre et al., 2014) {{examined the relationship}} between resin mixing effectiveness and varying bore hole diameter. The methodology employed within this earlier test program facilitated a further critical area of research – the measurement of back pressures generated within the bore hole during standard rock bolt installation practices. Experimental data has indicated that fluid resin can be pressurised to levels where it exceeds the compressive strength of the strata, inducing hydraulic fracture within the immediate area of the bolting horizon. The routine cycle of roof bolting serves to propagate this effect, progressively fracturing and delaminating the roof during mine advancement. This masked phenomenon can lead to a perception of difficult ground conditions - mining efficiencies and costs are therefore affected, with increased need for additional support subsequently required to re-stabilise the inadvertently damaged roof. Further analysis of the parameters associated with <b>resin</b> <b>bolt</b> installation has now been conducted, assisting in the development of an empirical relationship between bore hole pressure, bore hole diameter and bolt insertion times. This relationship has been analysed for 15 : 1 ratio resins and 2 : 1 ratio resins, within 28 mm and 30 mm boreholes. Further to this, load transfer performance has been comparatively assessed for both 28 mm and 30 mm boreholes, suggesting that for 2 : 1 resins, acceptable resin mixing and load transfer can be obtained within a 30 mm bore hole. The combination of 2 : 1 resins, utilised within a 30 mm bore hole, may well provide the optimal solution {{to reduce the risk of}} hydraulic fracture in weaker strata during <b>resin</b> <b>bolt</b> installation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} the roadway {{supporting}} not only depends on the supporting force itself, but also depends on the surrounding rock, quantity of supporting placement, time and quality of setting up, and contacting points and surface in the surrounding rock. The classification, nature and failure mechanism of the surrounding rock are analyzed,the author propose a new hanging and assembled supporting structure of the underground tunnel, and also analyzes its working mechanism and the reliability. This structure takes use of the interaction and common loading mechanism of the surrounding rock; it also offers a certain shrinkage value to achieve effective supporting effect. With pre-strength mortar bolt, <b>resin</b> <b>bolt</b> or advancing bolt together, we can more effectively prevent the surrounding rock loose to ensure the timeliness and effectiveness of the rock support...|$|E

To study these problems, the Bureau of Mines designed a test plan to (1) obtain baseline information on several resin cartridges and (2) investigate the variables involved in the installation of a <b>resin</b> <b>bolt.</b> Three brands of resin representative of the industry in January 1983 were selected for cartridge evaluation. The installation variables selected for study were the method of installation, the hole depth, and the hole annulus. These variables were studied by installing a series of bolts in concrete blocks using different values for each variable.

40|$|Full-column {{anchored}} <b>resin</b> <b>bolts</b> {{were first}} used in underground mines in 1972. These bolts appear to improve support in many roof bolt applications, {{as indicated by}} the use of about 30 million <b>resin</b> <b>bolts</b> in 1980. In the mid- 1970 's, Bureau of Mines in-vestigators began looking for a substitute for resin because of its short supply and rapidly increasing price. The investigators selected accelerated gypsum plaster (CaSO. 271 / 2 H 20), which becomes gypsum (CaSO. 27 2 H 20) when mixed with water. Gypsum makes an effective alternate grout material because it hardens quickly, is readily available, and is inexpensive in comparison with other cementitious materials. The Bureau received a patent (U. s. patent 4, 096, 944) for a system combining water capsules (wax-encapsulated water) with plaster into cartridges resembling resin cartridges. This report presents the results of tests conducted by the Bureau on the plaster, the water capsules, and their combined use in cartridges. The tests were designed to determine how the gypsum-plaster water capsule bolting system performs and what happens in the hole while the bolt is being inserted through the cartridge. The test results indicate that water capsule plaster cartridges are a workable alternative to resin cartridges under normal or dry conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of rock load from the strata and its distribution over the underground mine workings is of prime importance. In Indian coalmines, CMRI- RMR and NGI-Q Systems are mostly used for formulating design {{of support in}} rock engineering. Support systems are also designed {{with the help of}} numerical modeling. The working has been modeled by writing a program code in FLAC 5. 0. The modeling is done for driving of galleries (development) to form three pillars. The vertical stress contours indicated a maximum stress of about 2. 5 Mpa on pillars for the depth of 53 m with a gallery width of 4. 8 m and pillar size of 25 m. Rock load on the basis of RMR for the development gallery is 2. 4 t/m 2.

No of bolts in a row is 3 is for galleries of 4. 5 m width and area of 4. 5 m x 1. 5 m. This support system has a safety factor of 2, which is adequate. Rock load on the basis of RMR for the junction is 3. 17 t/m 2. support system consisting of <b>Resin</b> <b>bolt</b> with bolt spacing of 1. 5 m, row spacing of 1. 5 m, has a support capacity of 7. 4 t/m 2 No of bolts in a row is 3, No of row 3, is proposed to support junction of 4. 5 m x 4. 5 m area which gives a safety factor of 2. 33. It shows the junction is well supported & there is no fear of roof fall, so support is adequate. For depillaring workings, Rock load on the basis of Q is 6. 19 t/m 2 for Slice, and 7. 79 t/m 2 for goaf edges. Support system consisting of one chock and 3 steel prop is designed. Goaf edge support is designed with skin to skin chock with a spacing of 1. 2 with corner props. The support system for the slice consists of 2 props with spacing of 1. 2 m having a support capacity of 10 t/m 2. The support system gives a factor of safety of 1. 61 for slices and safety factor of 1. 23 for goaf edge. Support system can be included in the numerical model for better understanding of the stability of the workings with supports of different types and capacities. These approaches can be followed for many mines and the performance of the support system can be monitored with load cells, and the models can be calibrated accordingly.

30|$|The fully grouted <b>resin</b> <b>bolts</b> {{with high}} {{strength}} and stiffness (AT bolts) are {{most widely used}} in Australian coal mines. The diameter of AT bolts is 22  mm, and the lengths of bolts in roof and in sides are usually 2.4 and 1.8  m, respectively. In general, AT bolts are used with W-shaped straps and steel wire meshes. To {{meet the requirements of}} greatly deformed roadways, rock bolts with higher strength were developed, and the yield strength of rebar is 770  MPa with a yield load of 260  kN and a broken load more than 300  kN. Many kinds of flexible bolts and cables were also developed. The flexible bolts are made of high strength steel strand with a diameter of 23.5  mm, a broken load of 580  kN, and a length of 6 – 8  m. It deserves to be specially reported that three kinds of self-boring rock bolts anchored by injection resin were developed in Australia, including general self-boring bolts anchored by injection <b>resin,</b> retractable self-boring <b>bolts,</b> and pretensioned self-boring bolts (Gray et al. 2010), which have provided an effective approach to reinforcing soft and broken rocks.|$|R
40|$|<b>Resin</b> <b>bolt</b> parameters, such as back {{pressure}} and gloving, and {{their effect on}} ground support system performance, {{remains one of the}} fundamental areas of rockbolt research. The majority of previous studies into resin bolting parameters have utilised various methodologies to investigate the effect of a singular parameter. Unfortunately, due to the variability in methodologies and the relatively narrow field of study of each research project, a holistic conclusion into the exact science behind various results is unable to be drawn. It is the focus of this research project to conduct a detailed and consistent testing program, which attempts to simulate real world conditions as closely as possible, in order to provide the industry with engineered roof bolting solutions to specific underground roof properties. Recently published studies have implemented steel piping as a simulated borehole and have reported relatively high back-pressure measurements. As part of this project, testing conducted both underground and in a cement block, have recorded back-pressures in the range of 4 - 10 MPa, which are substantially lower than previous tests conducted in steel piping. Rockbolts installed in an underground coal mine using a continuous miner have been over-cored, the core has been cut into 100 mm lengths and each sample has been push tested. After push testing, the samples from the top 300 mm of each bolt were inspected for gloving. Almost all of the recovered rockbolts experienced some degree of gloving within the top 300 mm of its length. The average severity of gloving within these specimens was found to be relatively minor. It was found that gloving can reduce load transfer by 4 - 6 kN per 10 % of gloved surface area...|$|E

Numerical and empirical models were also used for modification of existing support system leading to formulation of guidelines for the Strata Management. For the geomining conditions of R- 6 mine, maximum of 16 mm roof convergence was observed during widening of galleries. Conventional support system of cement grouted roof bolts of 1. 5 m length, 22 mm diameter at a spacing of 1. 5 m between rows and 4 bolts in a row. With this conventional support system, widening of galleries up to 6 m has shown no considerable convergence but greater than 6 m wide galleries has resulted in the formation of undulated roof and floor conditions. Based on field observations including convergence of development and depillaring galleries and numerical modeling studies, the support system was modified with resin bolting so as to provide safer working conditions. The modified support system has 1. 8 m long <b>resin</b> <b>bolt</b> for split galleries, 2. 4 m long resin bolts for original gallery and point-anchored rebar at 1. 5 m center-to-center spacing for the roof conditions of NCPH mine.

Although this work is based on studies carried out for the geomining conditions of the NCPH Colliery; R- 6 Mine, it is believed that the findings can be applied to other shallow depth coal mines in similar geological conditions. A significant improvement in safety, productivity, and economy was observed at the NCPH Colliery R- 6 Mine by adopting many of the recommendations, and strata management guidelines developed through this work...|$|E
40|$|The Fully Encapsulated <b>Resin</b> <b>Bolt</b> (FERB) {{is widely}} {{utilised}} for strata control and ground support in civil and mining applications worldwide, with approximately 6 million installed per annum by the Australian coal mining industry. Independent studies {{have concluded that}} 30 - 35 % of these rockbolts, which represents an annual expenditure of $ 40 million, are ineffective. The anchorage and failure mechanisms of FERB are yet to be quantified, and support systems are designed primarily from empirical rather than scientific methods. There are no standardised methods of assessing FERB components, installation techniques and support behaviour. The majority of research into FERB support systems remains commercial intellectual property, with little information released into the public domain. This thesis investigated several variables of FERB support systems, and also examined differences between field and laboratory pull-out test load distributions. This research was conducted in two phases, with Phase 1 seeking standardised methodology and repeatability in results, while Phase 2 further refined Phase 1 methods and extended the range of tests. The results in both phases were encouraging, with reasonable repeatability attained in all testing series. The findings included: 	Annulus Thickness: There was little change in load capacity with small annulus thickness, however the maximum peak load (MPL) significantly reduced once annulus thickness exceeded 4 mm. 	Resin Installation Spin Time: Underspinning of cartridge resin {{was found to have}} an insignificant effect on rockbolt load/deformation characteristics. Overspinning, however, led to a dramatic reduction in anchorage performance with a lessening in both MPL and stiffness 	Rockbolt Load Transfer: The magnitude of an applied load reduced to zero {{along the length of the}} rockbolt, being greatest nearest the rock free surface (the point of load application). An exponential reduction was found when tested in the manner of laboratory tests, with the loading jack reacting against the free surface. This reduction was linear when the load was applied as in the field, with no load placed on the free surface This basic investigation into FERB support systems has validated many empirical understandings of rockbolts, while highlighting the need for further testing into several key areas...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a case study conducted in a two-entry gateroad in a coal mine where excessive roof deformation and bolt loading resulted in failure of many roof supports. The instruments consisted of 16 fully grouted, strain-gaged <b>resin</b> <b>bolts,</b> load cells on both full and partially grouted cable bolts, and vertical deflection multipoint extensometers. These instruments were installed on-cycle to measure loading on bolts in an existing support pattern and to determine if cable bolts could be used to improve roof stability. Results showed significant amounts of movement within the bolted zone. In some cases, these movements were enough to load the supports past their ultimate strength. Geology appeared to be a significant factor in localized roof degradation; that is, a very weak rock layer in the immediate roof overlain by a very strong rock layer contributed to the development of shear planes. Only one instrumented bolt had a maximum strain of less than 2, 000 microstrain, which was the yield point of the steel. The average maximum strain on all bolts was 20, 000 microstrain. However, electrical continuity to many gages was lost and a pattern was noted that would indicate possible bolt failure.

40|$|Originating from South African practices, spin {{to stall}} bolting systems {{have seen an}} {{increasing}} focus within Australian coal mining operations over recent years. The primary driver for spin to stall applications {{is the goal of}} improved bolting cycle times, with a secondary benefit being simplified installation practices for roof bolting operators. These outcomes are seen as one part of a broader opportunity to improve overall underground mining efficiencies and extraction rates. Spin to stall bolting methods represent a divergence from long standing resin installation practices, with the resin ‘hold’ or ‘curing’ time being eliminated from the installation cycle. The bolt can therefore be spun continuously under thrust through the length of the resin cartridge, with rotation continuing until the resin polymer matrix cures and hardens, the bolt torque drive releases, the nut is advanced on the thread and the bolt is ultimately pre-tensioned until rotational stall of the drill rig motor occurs. However, concerns remain that as the resin cures under polymerisation, significant loading is immediately placed onto the resin matrix before the polymer chains have fully formed, with the subsequent risk of damage to the interfaces between the <b>bolt,</b> <b>resin</b> and borehole – ultimately weakening bolt load transfer into the strata. The divergence from standard <b>resin</b> <b>bolting</b> practices has also led to changes in product validation methods, with validation practices being created specifically for spin to stall testing. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the technical parameters that govern spin to stall installations, as well as an assessment of validation techniques, including the inherent difficulties associated with underground testing. The arising question is whether current validation practices actually address all aspects of bolt performance, with some areas for concern being potentially masked regarding bolt load transfer. Finally, this paper offers potential improvements for spin to stall validation methods, in an attempt to further progress this area of work within the industry...|$|R
40|$|The The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) is {{continuing}} to investigate the behavior of fully grouted roof bolts in the weak roof rock of the Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). This paper describes the results of three studies: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 A series of 24 pull tests of bolts installed fully grouted and overcored to leave 12 inches of grouted bolt. The tests compared the pull-out performance of offset-head roof bolts with that of standard 5 / 8 -inch bolts; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 A second series of 24 tests that compared the pull-out loads obtained by bolts installed with 1 ft of resin (a Short Encapsulation Pull Test or SEPT) to that of fully grouted bolts overcored to leave only 12 inches of grouted bolt, and; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 An investigation into the pressures generated during the installation of fully grouted resin bolts. All of the bolts installed and pulled were overcored and removed from the roof after the pull tests to allow inspection of the resin. The first study {{found that there was}} no significant difference in pullout load between the offset-head bolts and the standard bolts. The second study, comparing the SEPT bolts and the partially-overcored fully grouted bolts, indicated that SEPT can significantly underestimate bolt anchorage grip factor, suggesting that the SEPT is a conservative measure of actual bolt performance. Significant loss of resin to cracks in the roof was observed in the bolts overcored in the SRCM. The third study explored one possible explanation for the resin loss, high pressures generated during bolt installation. These tests employed bolts installed in strain gauged steel tubes. The results confirmed that significant pressures (greater than 4, 000 psi) can be generated during bolt installation. The results of the pressure tests, combined with the observations of resin loss in bolts installed in the SRCM, suggest that under some circumstances resin loss and under-encapsulation could take place and lead to degraded bolt performance. Glove fingering was observed in all recovered bolts to various degrees. The limited comparative data suggested that the effect of glove fingering ranged from slight to moderate. Complete mixing of the resin was observed on all of the 40 bolts recovered (28 fully grouted and 12 SEPT). Australian and U. S. resins were compared and the Australian resins were observed to have much smaller catalyst compartment areas and lower resin viscosities. These differences are suggested as potential explanations for occasional resin mixing problems noted in Australian <b>resin</b> <b>bolt</b> installations...|$|E

Slip in joints is a major issue in bridge engineering, which has to be controlled if the structural scheme is to perform satisfactorily over its service life. The transfer of connection force in FRP joints, by way of frictional force, say by using High Strength Friction Grip (HSFG) bolts, cannot be relied upon [1], because steel bolting is known to lose its pre-tension with time due to the viscoelastic properties of the FRP. The aim of our preliminary study is to offer a potential solution to developing a suitable slip resistant connection.

Around 68 million rock bolts are installed annually in coal mines in the USA (Tadolini and Mazzoni, 2006), of which 68 % of primary supports in coal mines are fully grouted <b>resin</b> rebar <b>bolts.</b> A fully grouted rock bolt {{is one that is}} fixed inside the drill hole by means grout, and is fully encapsulated throughout the length of the bolt. Production in underground coal mines is achieved by the combined processes of excavation and ground support, carried out in a cycle. Primary support is that which is installed on cycle during production. Secondary support is that which is installed in addition to primary support, i. e., out of the cycle, and typically in intersections where the effective span is much larger making extra support both appropriate and necessary. Although safe and effective, there is still considerable opportunity to improve the performance of fully grouted resin rebar. The objective of this thesis is to measure and study key installation parameters of fully grouted <b>resin</b> <b>bolts</b> to optimize their performance. This will be accomplished by conducting a series of lab tests, developing a new small-scale test method, performing in situ tests, and numerical modeling. With a research collaboration between the Department of Mining and Mineral Resources Engineering at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC) and Orica Americas funded by the Illinois Coal Research Institute (ICCI), almost two hundred pull tests (ASTM F 432) were conducted mainly at the Orica North American Innovation and Technology Center in Bowerston OH, but also at two underground coal mines in the Illinois Basin. Laboratory testing consisted of rock bolt pull tests in a basically homogenous and isotropic material (concrete block) and hardness tests by modifying a drill press by varying key installation parameters. In situ testing consisted of rock bolt pull tests to at two different mines (Mines A and B). These were analyzed and optimized to better understand the performance of grouted rock bolts. Pull tests were conducted at SIUC’s Coal Research Center high-bay laboratory in Carterville, IL to investigate the effect of glove fingering when installing # 5 and # 6 rebar. Finally, a series of tests were performed to study the behavior of axial load shedding (creep) with time in grouted, tensioned rock bolts using U-cells (Mitri, 2012) and conventional load cells followed by a basic numerical modelling on the pull test. It was found that spin time and rotational speed play significant role to obtain a more effective fully grouted rebar system. An eccentric action was added to the wrench used for installing the bolts had no significant impact on the pull out load at in situ conditions but showed increase in the pull out load, when the installation procedure was altered. Resin hardness can be used as parameter to predict the pull out load of fully grouted rock bolt system and a significant creep was observed in the fully grouted tensioned rock bolts...|$|R

Results have shown that gloving and un-mixing is a systematic and widespread pheno mena, occurring across the range of <b>resin</b> and/or <b>bolt</b> manufacturers, and in a variety of roof types. Gloving was found in bolts installed using either hand held pneumatic or continuous miner mounted hydraulic bolting rigs, under run of mine (ROM) condition s by operators, and under controlled manufactures “best practice ” conditions. The mechanisms involved have been confirmed as being the development of a pressure front as the <b>bolt</b> encounters the <b>resin</b> cartridge and is spun up the hole, which in turn, leads to over-pressurisation and radial expansion of the resin cartridge. The result is an increase in the diameter of the plastic cartridge. Allowing th...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{the common}} method of {{laboratory}} testing of bolt for load transfer capacity determination is by short encapsulation push testing. Some concerns are {{raised about the}} validity of the test methodology, as the method does not reflect on the actual load transfer characteristics of bolt in real field situation. Thus, laboratory testes were carried out to examine the load transfer mechanisms of bolts in both the push and pull conditions. Tests were conducted by shearing a short <b>resin</b> encapsulated <b>bolt</b> out of a cylindrical steel sleeve. Three types of bolts with different surface profile configurations were tested. The study was complemented with numerical simulation of the test methods. Irrespective of bolt type the average shear load and shear stress values were found to be greater in push test, and the displacement at peak shear load was greater in pull test. The average shear stiffuess values were greater in push test. The numerical simulation of the bolts provided a clear understanding of the stresses and strains generated by different bolt profiles during both the pull and pull testing process, thus allowing a better appreciation of the load transfer mechanism process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} to evaluate the load transfer capacity of different <b>resin</b> anchored rock <b>bolts.</b> With {{an increasing number of}} rock bolts currently being introduced into the Australian market for use in a variety of ground conditions, a new technique to determine bolt load transfer capacity is necessary. The assessment of the performance bolt with regard to load transfer mechanisms is conducted in the laboratory under Constant Normal Stiffness (CNS) conditions. This method of testing is considered as being a realistic way of evaluating bolt surface roughness as the tests are carried out under different confining pressures thus accommodating the changes in ground conditions such as high horizontal stress while allowing for surface dilations due to rubbing of rough surfaces against each other...|$|R
40|$|The <b>resin</b> {{anchored}} rock <b>bolt</b> is {{used extensively}} in the mining industry to stabilize the roof and prevent it from collapsing. However, there are different defects associated with a <b>resin</b> anchored rock <b>bolt.</b> Examples are partially encapsulated bolts, over-spinned bolts and corroded bolts. These defects reduce {{the integrity of the}} roof, and thereby {{have an effect on the}} safety and productivity of the mines. The integrity of the rock bolts is a critical issue for the mining industry because of its influence on the safety of mining operations. Different research groups around the world have addressed the problem of determining rock bolt integrity. The most promising technique found in the literature study was based on guided ultrasonic waves (Beard and Lowe, 2003). This study extended the previous work by Beard and Lowe (2003) using guided ultrasonic waves, to investigate damage in more realistic embedded bolts which deviate from pure cylinders. The fundamental L(0, 1) mode in its lower frequency range, as suggested by Beard and Lowe was utilized. This was done through the use of finite element model simulations of various defect scenarios, which were compared to experimental measurements on bolts. Defects like loss of resin encapsulation, voids and local corrosion cracks were addressed. The time traces of the different finite element defect scenarios could be directly compared to experimental time traces which distinguish this study from the analytical approach. Some finite element modelling issues were investigated and it was found that the time step is critical if an implicit solver is used, whereas for an explicit solver the element size is critical if accurate answers are needed. Furthermore it was also apparent that the boundary of the mortar has an influence on the results. The method used in the study was to move the boundaries far enough to prevent interference. This however increases the model size and thereby the computer resources required. Axisymmetric defects were modelled using axisymmetric finite elements to reduce the problem size. These models gave results comparable to the measured bolts. Three-dimensional finite element models seemed to be promising for simulating non-axisymmetric defects. It was found that it is not possible to solve large three-dimensional models without energy absorbing boundaries. Axisymmetrical and three dimensional finite element models of a partially encapsulated bolt and a bolt with a local corrosion crack were built. It was possible to detect simulated local corrosion cracks with the finite element models. Clear reflections for the crack in the bolt could be seen. If the <b>bolt,</b> <b>resin</b> and rock are cracked, different reflections will be detected. These different reflections complicated the interpretation of the results. Once the integrity of models such as these has been established, the models could in principle be used to train neural networks for use in commercial equipment. The present study was limited to lower frequencies because of computer resource limitations. Basic principles and modelling issues could however be addressed and it may be expected that these principles could soon be extended to higher frequencies with a new generation of computers.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of bolting {{standards}} for strata reinforcement in the Australian mines, though individual mines or companies have their in house practices, there remains a visible vacuum in assessing credibly the various properties of chemical resins and cementitious grouts. Currently, all methods used in evaluating the mechanical properties of both chemical <b>resins</b> and other <b>bolting</b> reinforcement grouts are dependent on the American, British and South African standards and accordingly there is no uniform and unified methodology of testing. A simplified approach has been discussed to enable mine operators and other interested parties to determine various pertinent properties of chemical resins and grouts in the bolting system only and this paper describes the various methods used to test a set of resin properties. A special Resin Mixing Container (RMC) was developed to permit multiple resin samples to be cast with consistent resin / grout quality. Various conclusions were drawn from the study enabling a better understanding between suppliers and end users...|$|R
40|$|<b>Resin</b> {{anchored}} roof <b>bolts</b> are {{the basis}} for the primary roof support system of every underground coal mine in Australia. However, the negative influences of uncured resin and resin loss due to installation pressure are common problems despite more than 30 years of product development. The current study details a surface testing method that installs a commonly used roof bolt into lengths of PVC pipe. Results were gathered in two ways, instrumentation measured bolt displacement and rotation speed and back-pressure during installation. The PVC was then cut open to assess the quality of the resin anchor. Comparative testing was undertaken on two resin cartridges commonly used in Australia: 2 : 1 mastic-to-catalyst resin and 15 : 1 mastic-to-catalyst resin. The tests were performed in 28 mm and 30 mm internal diameter PVC pipes to simulate a range of underground roof conditions. Data analysis shows the influence of borehole diameter, mastic-to-catalyst ratio and insertion pressure development on resin anchor reliability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to assess {{potential}} alternative epoxy <b>resins</b> in injected <b>bolted</b> shear connections for a civil engineering application. Research {{has focused on the}} application of injection <b>bolts</b> with various <b>resins</b> in a double lap shear connection. In current practice only one resin is allowed to be used due to regulation by RWS. This is RenGel SW 404 /HY 2404 resin [1]. To assess possible alternatives different products have been selected that have potential for use in this application. To verify their performance, short duration double lap shear tests have been performed in the Stevin Laboratory. The curing temperature of the resin was varied in testing to assess the influence this has on performance, and gain further insight in the importance of material properties of <b>resins</b> for injection <b>bolts.</b> Secondly the stress distribution of the resin layer has been investigated by developing an analytical model using 1 dimensional Timoshenko beam theory. This model was calibrated using results from lab tests and verified against FEM results and other experiments. From this research, it is concluded that only Edilon Dex R 2 K resin is a possible alternative resin. The injection procedure is simplified with this product but it suffers from large scatter in results in this research. The found characteristic short term strength is 156 MPa when cured at 16 degrees Celsius. Curing temperature had no influence for RenGel SW 404 /HY 2404 between 8 and 24 degrees. Dex R 2 K did have a positive dependency in this range. Lastly the research into the effect of bolt length shows a trend that the connection capacity remains the same or increases slightly for L/D ratios above 3. From this research, it is recommended to gain further insight in the mechanical behavior of injection bolt connections through FEM analysis. Furthermore, development of alternative washer designs and research into optimized injection procedures are recommended. Lastly the occurrence of air inclusions in the resin layer as noticed in this research is something to be investigated in future research.

40|$|Roofbolts – cable bolts – support {{stiffness}} – rock confinement Roof bolting {{technology in}} Australian coal mines has advanced considerably during the 40 years since introduction. However, there is constant {{need for more}} efficient strata control in mining {{in order to improve}} safety, maximise productivity and decrease costs. Therefore, the changes introduced to roofbolting technology are being assessed and the directions for further future development are discussed. The main area where the majority of improvements have taken place is in the stiffness of the support. The gradual increase of the support stiffness has been achieved mainly by the introduction of chemical anchors and full encapsulation of bolts, higher grades of steel with more efficient deformations and the introduction of cable <b>bolts</b> and <b>resin</b> grouted strand <b>bolts.</b> Another important development occurred in the area of direct application of confinement to the rock mass by applying high support pre-tension. All the changes introduced to roof bolting technology which have resulted in better rock reinforcement are analysed and the directions for further future development are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{test results}} {{to evaluate the}} slip and fatigue performance of <b>Resin</b> Injected <b>Bolted</b> Joints (RIBJs) for pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) material. The objective of the test series {{is to provide a}} robust method of connection for structural engineering that is both fatigue and slip resistant. Forty-six joints (using 23 specimens) were subjected to either static or combined static/cyclic loading at ambient room temperature. Ten specimens (five batches of two) had bolted connections without injected resin and were included to provide baseline static joint strengths. Sikadur®- 30 and RenGel®-SW 404 were the two cold-curing epoxy based resins used to fabricate the 13 RIBJ specimens. Testing was conducted with double lap-shear joints in accordance with modified guidance from Annex G and Annex K in standard BS EN 1090 - 2 : 2008. The specimen’s geometry was established using this British Standard and an American Society of Civil Engineers pre-standard for pultruded thin-walled structures. Rectangular plates for the lap joints were cut from either a wide flange section of size 254 × 254 × 9. 53 mm or a flat sheet of 6. 35 mm thickness. Bolting was with either M 16 or M 20 steel threaded bolts of Grade 8. 8. Sixteen specimens, for eight batches of two specimens were failed in a short duration for static strength. Four RIBJ specimens had static load cycling to an assumed service load level. Three specimens out of 23 were subjected to staged static and cyclic fatigue loadings to determine stiffness changes, life-time ‘slip’ load and residual joint strength. The reported results are evaluated for slip and fatigue performance and the main finding is that resin injection shows much promise as a mechanical method of connection in pultruded FRP structures...|$|R
