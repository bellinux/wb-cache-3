25|$|Historically, {{navigation}} by loxodrome or <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> {{refers to}} a path of constant bearing; the resulting path is a logarithmic spiral, similar in shape to the transformations of the complex plane that a loxodromic Möbius transformation makes.

25|$|In recent years, Muslims from North America {{have used}} two rules to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} Qiblah. According to spherical calculations, a Muslim praying from Anchorage, Alaska would pray almost due north if determining the Qiblah. However, when one looks at the world on most Mercator map projections, Mecca appears to be southwest of Anchorage. The shortest <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> (line of constant bearing) from most points in North America to Mecca will point toward the southeast, but the distance to Mecca along this route on the actual surface of the earth is longer than the great circle route.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} {{regarding}} how one measures direction for this purpose. Some say one should face the direction {{which would be}} the shortest distance to Jerusalem, i.e. the arc of a great circle, as defined in elliptic geometry. Thus in New York one would face north-northeast. Others say one should face the direction along a <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> path to Jerusalem, which would not require an alteration of compass direction. This would be represented by a straight line on a Mercator projection, which would be east-southeast from New York. In practice, many individuals in the Western Hemisphere simply face due east, regardless of location. In the presence of an ark that does not face Jerusalem, one should pray toward the ark instead.|$|E

500|$|In March 1932, the {{arrangements}} for flying between Lympne and Croydon in poor visibility were altered. If the cloudbase {{was less than}} [...] above sea level, or the visibility was less than , aircraft were prohibited from using the Croydon–Caterham–Penshurst–Lympne route, but were to use either the Croydon–Merstham–Edenbridge or Croydon–Chelsfield–Shoreham–Otford–Wrotham route. Alternatively a <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> course could be flown on the Croydon–Chelsfield–Lympne route. Aircraft not fitted with radios had to notify the officer in charge at their departure airport as to which route they intended to take before departure. Royal Air Force aircraft would avoid these routes as far as practicable in conditions of poor visibility. On 25 August the Folkestone Trophy Race was held at Lympne and was won by a Comper Swift. In November, {{it was reported that}} new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15-cm waveband at 2,000 Megahertz. The new radios were to be used for the announcement of the departure of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The new equipment was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933.|$|E
500|$|As the Chronologia {{was going}} to press in 1569, Mercator also {{published}} {{what was to become}} his most famous map: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata (A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation). As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the Age of Discovery the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a <b>rhumb</b> <b>line)</b> did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator's solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars [...] suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by Pedro Nunes. The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the Mercator Projection became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. At a later stage this mariner's map became a general purpose map of the world although its distortion at high latitudes was abundantly evident. Usage other than for marine charts is now deprecated and more suitable projections are available.|$|E

50|$|Meridians of {{longitude}} and parallels of latitude provide {{special cases}} of the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line,</b> where their angles of intersection are respectively 0° and 90°. On a north-south passage the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> course coincides with a great circle, as it does on an east-west passage along the equator.|$|E

When limited to small seas, planispheres {{approximately}} follow both <b>rhumb</b> <b>lines</b> and great circles. But on big oceans they do not follow either of them, due to the imprecision of the map making of that time, corresponding more or less accurately to <b>rhumb</b> <b>lines</b> only in the Mediterranean portolan charts and deviating greatly in the Texeira planisfere (among others).|$|R
5000|$|In cartography, the loximuthal {{projection}} is a {{map projection}} introduced by Karl Siemon in 1935, and independently by Waldo R. Tobler, who named it.

50|$|Early navigators in {{the time}} before the {{invention}} of the marine chronometer used <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> courses on long ocean passages, because the ship's latitude could be established accurately by sightings of the Sun or stars but there was no accurate way to determine the longitude. The ship would sail north or south until the latitude of the destination was reached, and the ship would then sail east or west along the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> (actually a parallel, which is a special case of the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line),</b> maintaining a constant latitude and recording regular estimates of the distance sailed until evidence of land was sighted.|$|E
