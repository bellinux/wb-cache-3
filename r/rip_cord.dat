5|$|Naval mine: The Huolongjing {{military}} manuscript {{written by}} Ming dynasty military writer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) also describes naval mines used at sea or on rivers and lakes; made of wrought iron and enclosed in an ox bladder, {{it was a}} timed device in that a burning joss sticks floating above the mine determined when the fuse was to be ignited; the text explicitly mentions that without air and doused in water the fuse would not burn, so the fuse was protected by a long waterproof tube made out of goat's intestine; a later model shown in Ming Chinese scientist and encyclopedist Song Yingxing's (1587–1666) encyclopedia of 1637 shows the ox bladder replaced with a lacquered leather bag while the mine is ignited by a <b>rip</b> <b>cord</b> pulled from the shore to rotate a flint-and-steel firing mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The 14th century Huolongjing {{was also}} one of the first Chinese texts to {{carefully}} describe to the use of explosive land mines, which had been used by the late Song Chinese against the Mongols in 1277, and employed by the Yuan dynasty afterwards. The innovation of the detonated land mine was accredited to one Luo Qianxia in the campaign of defense against the Mongol invasion by Kublai Khan, Later Chinese texts revealed that the Chinese land mine employed either a <b>rip</b> <b>cord</b> or a motion booby trap of a pin releasing falling weights that rotated a steel flint wheel, which in turn created sparks that ignited the train of fuses for the land mines. Furthermore, the Song employed the earliest known gunpowder-propelled rockets in warfare during the late 13th century, its earliest form being the archaic Fire Arrow. When the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng fell to the Jurchens in 1126, it was written by Xia Shaozeng that 20,000 fire arrows were handed over to the Jurchens in their conquest. An even earlier Chinese text of the Wujing Zongyao ("Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques"), written in 1044 by the Song scholars Zeng Kongliang and Yang Weide, described the use of three spring or triple bow arcuballista that fired arrow bolts holding gunpowder packets near the head of the arrow. Going back yet even farther, the Wu Li Xiao Shi (1630, second edition 1664) of Fang Yizhi stated that fire arrows were presented to Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960–976) in 960.|$|E
25|$|There {{were strong}} gales {{at the end}} of September 1918 causing {{difficulties}} landing the airships returning to the base. The extreme conditions resulted in four of the airships having to be 'ripped' once they had been maneuvered into the shelter of the hangars.

Pied Piper was also a childhood friend of Wally West. He arrives at Wally's lair and discovers that Wally has been killed by Citizen Cold. Pied Piper takes Wally's place in uncovering evidence of Citizen Cold's true identity. Pied Piper runs in through the sewers and intends to rescue Iris West from the Rogues but was apparently killed by Citizen Cold's exploding ice sculpture. He was later revealed to have survived, and revealed to Iris that Citizen Cold had killed her nephew. After threatening to reveal Citizen Cold's true, criminal identity, Pied Piper was briefly attacked by Citizen Cold, who was then frozen by Iris as payback for what he did to Wally.|$|R

She left Fiddler in 1971 to play the leading role of Cookie Kovac in the off-Broadway nudie musical Stag Movie. Barbeau, as Cookie Kovac, and Brad Sullivan, as <b>Rip</b> <b>Cord,</b> were [...] "quite jolly and deserve to be congratulated {{on the lack of}} embarrassment they show when, on occasion, they have to wander around stark naked.

50|$|On the ship, the {{survivors}} discover metal beneath Reed's skin, {{causing him to}} begin questioning his existence. Ross reveals that Reed is {{actually one of the}} first TR-5s, planted in the community with Ross as his handler. Reed's memories are all implants based on Ross's own memories. Bronson (Dustin Harnish) becomes paranoid and believes the other survivors are also androids, but Chloe (Lauren Walsh) dispels him by revealing she is pregnant. At the space station, the group battles the TR-4s en masse, resulting in Bronson's death and Tiffany (Lucinda Rogers) becoming separated from the others. Ross attempts to shut down the TR-4s but the control console fights back, repeatedly locking him out. Suddenly, the TR-4s all shut down, and Ross ominously realizes their power is being funneled to a much worse problem - the giant TR-5 that caused the rebellion in the first place. The massive robot appears and kills Ross with a blade mounted in its arm after shrugging off his EMP weapon, then attacks Chloe. Reed appears and baits the TR-5 into an airlock, and Chloe ejects both it and Reed into outer space. The TR-4s come back to life despite Tiffany hitting the shutdown switch, but when she <b>rips</b> the <b>cords</b> from the control box, they all die simultaneously. Chloe, Tiffany, Tanner (Mark Hengst), Laura (Krystle Connor) and Chloe's unborn child are left as the only survivors, possibly of all humanity.|$|R
40|$|Upregulation of the receptor-interacting protein 3 {{expression}} and involvement in neural {{tissue damage}} after spinal cord injury in mice Haruo Kanno*, Hiroshi Ozawa, Satoshi Tateda, Kenichiro Yahata and Eiji Itoi Background: Necroptosis is a newly identified type of {{programmed cell death}} that differs from apoptosis. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} necroptosis is involved in multiple pathologies of various human diseases. Receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP 3) is known to be a critical regulator of necroptosis. This study investigated alterations in the RIP 3 expression and the involvement in neural tissue damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Results: Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the RIP 3 expression was significantly increased in the lesion site after spinal cord hemisection. The increased expression of RIP 3 started at 24 h, peaked at 3 days and lasted for at least 21 days after hemisection. The RIP 3 expression was observed in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Western blot analysis also demonstrated the RIP 3 protein expression significantly upregulated in the injured spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>RIP</b> 3 staining using propidium iodide (PI) -labeled sections showed most of the PI-labeled cells were observed as RIP 3 -positive. Double staining of TUNEL and RIP 3 demonstrated that TUNEL-positive cells exhibiting shrunken o...|$|R
50|$|Norma Davis, 86, {{is thought}} to be Gray’s first victim; {{because of the lack of}} evidence, however, Gray was never convicted of killing her. Norma was the {{mother-in-law}} of the woman (Jeri Davis) who married Dana's father in 1988. Jeri's first husband, Bill Davis, was Norma's son. Bill died in the early 1980s, and his widow eventually married Dana's father Russell Armbrust. Jeri continued to care for her elderly mother-in-law, even after she remarried. Dana knew Norma very well. On February 16, 1994, Norma Davis had been dead for two days when she was found by her neighbor, Alice Williams. Davis had a wood handled utility knife sticking out of her neck, and a fillet knife sticking out of her chest. Other than a broken fingernail, she had no other marks. A bloodied afghan lay at her feet. Detectives learned that there was no forced entry into the house. Detectives were informed that she always kept her door locked unless she was expecting a visitor. Williams stated she could not remember Davis mentioning she was expecting company. Detectives found a Nike shoe print pointed toward the kitchen. They also found Davis’ $148 Social Security check. On the first floor of Davis’ condo, a smear of blood was found on an armchair. A <b>ripped</b> out phone <b>cord</b> was also found.|$|R

5000|$|Ruf! Mich! An! {{is set in}} Berlin {{at the end of}} the 1990s. The protagonist, Paprika, is a {{self-described}} sociophobe who lives in an [...] "anonymous" [...] apartment building in Daimler City on Potsdamer Platz that is [...] "wall-to-wall autistics", celebrates her birthday with the one person with whom she is close - herself - and operates a successful advertising agency almost entirely by means of SMS exchanges with her assistant. She is characterized by [...] "exaggerated techno-consumerism": she constantly channel surfs, conducts business in the bathtub and on the toilet using a headset, orders in almost all her food, buys ten jars of asparagus just because she finds a parking spot in front of the grocery store, then gives them to a panhandler, fantasizes about running barefoot through chocolate truffles, orders them delivered, then says she does not recall ordering them because she has [...] "short-term memory loss due to excessive cellphone use". She shoots her expensive widescreen TV through the screen in a fit of pique and complains that [...] "the world is unfair" [...] because her TV is wrecked but Roger Willemsen is still alive. One of the two men with whom she associates, Dietrich, a bartender whose prime motive appears to be finding [...] "something fuckable", describes her as [...] "a consumer cripple with an amputated soul", which she admits to with pride. The other, Robert, is a concertmaster who can only get excited at the thought of long-dead film divas of yesteryear. Paprika's most characteristic sexual activity is masturbating to the late program on Arte; the first edition of the novel reputedly fell open at this scene. However, one day when she calls information, the operator gives her his own phone number. She enters an anonymous sado-masochistic sexual liaison with him recalling that in Laclos' Les Liaisons dangereuses: he calls himself Valmont. He summons her by SMS and abuses her, until suddenly he does not, and she falls apart from thwarted addiction, throwing her cellphone into the toilet, <b>ripping</b> the phone <b>cord</b> out of the wall, and drinking Laphroaig from the bottle. Instead of Valmont, an East German bumpkin, Maik, appears on her doorstep, so she shoots him and dumps his body in front of his own door for his wife, Mandy.|$|R
