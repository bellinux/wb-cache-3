5|$|During their sojourn at Nassau, the Fly arrived. Her captain {{reported}} that she and the Hornet had fouled their <b>riggings</b> together and that Hornet suffered significant damage as a consequence. On March 17, the fleet sailed for Block Island Channel off Newport, Rhode Island, with Browne and other officials as prisoners. The return voyage was uneventful until the fleet reached the waters of Long Island. On April 4, they encountered and captured HMS Hawk, {{and the next day}} captured the Bolton, which was laden with stores that included more armaments and powder. The fleet finally met resistance on April 6, when it encountered the HMS Glasgow, a sixth-rate ship. In the ensuing action, the outnumbered Glasgow managed to escape capture, severely damaging the Cabot in the process, wounding her captain, Hopkins' son John Burroughs Hopkins, and killing or wounding eleven others.|$|E
5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying <b>riggings</b> were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
5|$|Here Sheng Ruozi {{quotes a}} written {{selection}} about windmills from the 'Placid Retired Scholar', who is actually Yelü Chucai (1190–1244), a prominent Jin and Yuan statesman (after the Jin fell in 1234 to the Mongols). The passage refers to Yelü's journey to Turkestan (modern Xinjiang) in 1219, and Hechong Fu is actually Samarkand (in modern Uzbekistan). Afterwards, the Chinese applied the 'fore-and-aft' sail <b>riggings</b> of typical Chinese junk ships to horizontal windmills. These windmills {{were used to}} operate the square-pallet chain pumps used in Chinese irrigation since the ancient Han dynasty. Windmills of this nature were still in use during modern times in Tianjin and along the Yangtze River. The first European to view Chinese windmills was Jan Nieuhoff, who spotted them in Jiangsu while traveling along the Grand Canal in 1656, {{as part of the}} Dutch embassy to Beijing. The first European windmills written of were those of Dean Herbert of East Anglia in 1191, who competed with the mills of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds.|$|E

25|$|He was the PDP {{candidate}} for Borno North in the April 2007 Senate elections, but {{withdrew from the}} race some few days to elections in protest of the massive <b>riggings</b> by the ruling ANPP that characterized the preceding Governatorial elections. The senate seat was later declared won by the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP) Maina Maaji Lawan.|$|E
25|$|Brest’s {{history has}} always {{been linked to the}} sea: the Académie de Marine (Naval Academy) was founded in 1752 in this city. The {{aircraft}} carrier Charles de Gaulle was built there. Every four years, Brest hosts the international festival of the sea, boats and sailors: it is a meeting of old <b>riggings</b> from around the world (Les Tonnerres de Brest).|$|E
25|$|Marines would mainly {{participate}} in the naval battles of the war, fighting ship-to-ship, such as the Battle of Valcour Island and famed Battle of Flamborough Head. Marksmen would perch in the upper <b>riggings</b> and masts of the ship to fire on enemy sailors from above. However, unlike British Marines, the Continental Marines would take the then-unorthodox missions of landing parties and other services ashore. For example, Marines would support batteries ashore at the Siege of Charleston {{in the spring of}} 1780.|$|E
500|$|Around noon the frigates Sphinx, Syren, and Actaeon {{were sent}} on a {{roundabout}} route, avoiding some shoals, {{to take a}} position from which they could enfilade the fort's main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort. However, all three ships grounded on an uncharted sandbar, and the <b>riggings</b> of Actaeon and Sphinx became entangled in the process. The British managed to refloat Sphinx and Syren, but Acteon remained grounded, having moved too far onto the submerged sandbar. Consequently, none of these ships reached its intended position, a piece of good fortune not lost on Colonel Moultrie: [...] "Had these three ships effected their purpose, they would have enfiladed us in such a manner, as to have driven us from our guns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both captains {{accused the}} other of having fled. Irby stated that Aréthuse [...] "bore up, having the {{advantage}} of being able to do so, leaving us in an ungovernable state"; while Bouvet wrote [...] "At eleven o'clock, firing ceased on both sides; we were no longer in range; and the enemy, putting on all sail, surrendered the battlefield to us". Another view is that the ships, their <b>riggings</b> both damaged, simply drifted away from each other under the effect of the cannonade.|$|E
2500|$|George Bales, a {{stage hand}} at Fox Theater gave Jerry Garcia Heil's phone number, and Heil remembers Garcia calling to say [...] "Hey man, I heard {{you have a}} really big PA." [...] Heil had been toying and {{tinkering}} with the large speakers that the Fox had replaced months earlier with a new system. [...] Heil, {{one of the two}} organists at the Mighty Wurlitzer in the Fox (dating back to 1956) was given their old speakers which Heil built into his new sound system using the massive Altec Lansing A-4 speaker cabinets. Heil replaced the 15-inch speakers with JBL D140s, and added an array of four radial horns and ring tweeters all driven by McIntosh amplifiers. He has stated [...] "That made a huge difference. It was like a big 'hi-fi' system. Except for Bill Hanley of Hanley Sound (Medford, MA) no one was putting radial horns into PA systems; they were just doing speakers in columns, like the Vocalmaster. The horns are what give the system intelligibility — you can actually understand the lyrics." [...] His stack <b>riggings</b> resulted in an unusual frequency range from below 200Hz to well over 15kHz.|$|E
60|$|O'er bush, o'er bank, o'er ditch, o'er stark, She flang amang them a', man; The butter-box got many knocks, Their <b>riggings</b> {{paid for}} a' then.

60|$|I {{rushed back}} to my guns, for the wind was rapidly {{swinging}} {{the stern of the}} Serapis to our own bow, now bringing her starboard batteries into play. Barely had we time to light our snatches and send our broadside into her at three fathoms before the huge vessels came crunching together, the disordered <b>riggings</b> locking, and both pointed northward to a leeward tide in a death embrace. The chance had not been given him to shift his crews or to fling open his starboard gun-ports.|$|E
60|$|Two {{men were}} {{prepared}} to run up on the fore-yard at the word. Both of these, {{one of whom was}} Mr. Leach, carried three small balls of marline, to the end of each of which was attached a cod-hook, the barb being filed off in order to prevent its being caught. By means of these hooks the balls were fastened to the jackets of the adventurers. Two others stood ready {{at the foot of the}} main and mizzen <b>riggings.</b> By the gun lay Paul and three men; while several of the passengers, and a few of the best shots among the crew, were stationed on the forecastle, armed with muskets and fowling-pieces.|$|E
60|$|We rigged {{lines on}} either side between the main and mizzen <b>riggings.</b> To these we laced the big deck awning, {{hoisting}} it up aft with a sailing pennant so that any rain it might collect would run forward where it could be caught. Here and there squalls passed across the circle of the sea. All day we watched them, now to port or starboard, and again ahead or astern. But never one came near enough to wet us. In the afternoon a big one bore down upon us. It spread out across the ocean as it approached, and we could see it emptying countless thousands of gallons into the salt sea. Extra {{attention was paid to}} the awning and then we waited. Warren, Martin, and Hermann made a vivid picture. Grouped together, holding on to the rigging, swaying to the roll, they were gazing intently at the squall. Strain, anxiety, and yearning were in every posture of their bodies. Beside them was the dry and empty awning. But they seemed to grow limp and to droop as the squall broke in half, one part passing on ahead, the other drawing astern and going to leeward.|$|E
60|$|All the {{thirteen}} squadrons of cavalry remained three days at Wad Hamed. After the fatigues {{of the march}} we were glad {{to have an opportunity}} of looking about, of visiting regiments known in other circumstances, and of writing a few letters. This last was the most important, for it was now known that after leaving Wad Hamed there would be no post or communication with Cairo and Europe until the action had been fought and all was over. The halt was welcome for another reason. The camp itself was well worth looking at. It lay lengthways along the river-bank, and was nearly two miles from end to end. The Nile secured it from attack towards the east. On the western and southern sides were strong lines of thorn bushes, staked down and forming a zeriba; and the north face was protected by a deep artificial watercourse which allowed the waters of the river to make a considerable inundation. From the bank of this work the whole camp could be seen. Far away to the southward the white tents of the British division; a little nearer rows and rows of grass huts and blanket shelters, the bivouacs of the Egyptian and Soudanese brigades; the Sirdar's large white tent, with the red flag of Egypt flying from a high staff, on a small eminence; and to the right the grove of palm-trees in which the officers of the Egyptian cavalry had established themselves. The whole riverside was filled by a forest of masts. Crowds of gyassas, barges, and steamers were moored closely together; and while looking at the furled sails, the tangled <b>riggings,</b> and the tall funnels it was easy for the spectator to imagine that this was the docks of some populous city in a well-developed and civilised land.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the four}} row galleys, only three were built: Whiting, Shark, and Crane, which were {{outfitted}} with sloop <b>riggings,</b> {{were ready for}} service in July 1776.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{dorsal fin}} {{of a white}} shark contain dermal fibers that work [...] "like <b>riggings</b> that {{stabilize}} a ship's mast", and stiffen dynamically as the shark swims faster to control roll and yaw.|$|E

50|$|Nock also {{designs and}} build {{all his own}} stunts and <b>riggings.</b> In March 2007, the New York Times {{presented}} a two-page, full-color feature on Nock's Double Wheel of Steel, which was a completely new, one-of-a-kind stunt performed for Ringling's Bellobration.|$|E
50|$|His grandson, Omar, {{served in}} the Aziz {{ministry}} as a Finance Minister in 2000s but joined the PML(N) in 2010; he was declared ineligible for general election held in 2013 due to the allegations proved for vote <b>riggings.</b> His grandson, Yousaf, is a party worker of PTI.|$|E
50|$|He {{presented}} his diplomatic credentials to Juan Carlos I in Barcelona but his tenureship remained until 13 April 1977 when he resigned in {{protest against the}} allegations of <b>riggings</b> during the general elections held in 1977. He immediately appealed and called for Pakistani military to forcefully removed Prime Minister Bhutto.|$|E
50|$|Mediator {{sustained}} {{only seven}} casualties in her crew but was cut {{up in the}} <b>riggings</b> in masts which had {{been the target of}} the French and American ships.

50|$|After being {{closed for}} 18 months to remodel, the theatre re-opened in February 2007 for the {{production}} Anything Goes. Renovations preserved the original terrazzo tile floor in the lobby.

50|$|By 1850, North Carolina's {{pine forests}} were {{producing}} {{one-third of the}} world's supply of naval stores.

50|$|W. S. Sims {{departed}} Mayport on 30 March, {{bound for}} Lisbon, Portugal, and a six and one-half month Mediterranean deployment. A severe storm with 20- to 30 ft seas, encountered en route, damaged the main mast {{to the point}} where it had to be supported by <b>riggings</b> of mooring lines. As a result, the ship arrived in Rota rather than Lisbon and remained there from 12 April to 13 May undergoing repairs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wreck of}} the O.J. Walker lies {{in the waters of}} Burlington Bay, outside the Burlington Breakwater. It is the only known sailing {{schooner}} wreck which includes elements of the masts and spars, giving crucial insight into the <b>riggings</b> of these vessels, which were built in large numbers in the mid-19th century. [...] The wreck site is now one of Vermont's underwater historic sites, and is accessible to licensed divers; registration is required.|$|E
50|$|While {{the ships}} {{from both sides}} joined into the battle the already very mild winds kept getting calmer. As the winds {{becalmed}} it became impossible for ships to maintain their positions by sails due to the currents in the sea which forced both sides to use longboats both to move and steer their ships in the respective battlelines. Swedes further concentrated their fire on the masts and <b>riggings</b> of the Russian {{in order to further}} impede them.|$|E
