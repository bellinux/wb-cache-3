40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} whether viral infection {{acts as a}} trigger factor {{for the development of}} dilated cardiomyopathy in genetically predisposed individuals with a family history of disease.  SETTING—Patients attending the cardiomyopathy unit in a cardiac tertiary referral centre.  DESIGN—Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) was used to determine whether enteroviral, adenoviral, or cytomegaloviral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> were detectable in the myocardium of 19  asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy; all these relatives had echocardiographic abnormalities thought to represent early disease. Explanted hearts from patients with end stage dilated cardiomyopathy were also studied and were compared with 25  controls (ischaemic heart disease (21), valvar heart disease (2), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1), restrictive cardiomyopathy (1)). Myocardial tissue from two fatal cases of culture positive coxsackie myocarditis was used as a positive control.  RESULTS—No viral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> was detected in any group other than in those with myocarditis. Spiking of random wells with purified <b>recombinant</b> viral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> confirmed the sensitivity and reproducibility of the assays.  CONCLUSIONS—Myocardial viral infection is not detectable in relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who are suspected of having early disease.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{biological}} techniques {{become more}} and more popular, as they are applied to many kinds of applications, authentication protocols, biochemistry, and cryptography. One of the most interesting biology techniques is deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> and using it in such domains. Hiding secret data in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> becomes an important and interesting research topic. Some researchers hide the secret data in transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments where it doesn't mention to modify the original sequence, but others hide data in non-transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> non-translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments. Unfortunately, these schemes either alter the functionalities or modify the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequences. As a result, how to embed the secret data into the deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence without altering the functionalities and to have the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence be able to be retrieved is worthy of investigating. This paper applies reversible information hiding scheme on deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence by using the reversible contrast mapping technique. The reversible property makes the secret data hidden in anywhere in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> without altering the functionalities because the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> sequence can be recovered exactly in our scheme...|$|R
