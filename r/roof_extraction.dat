40|$|High {{accuracy}} building <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> from LiDAR data {{is the key}} {{to build}} topological relationship of building roofs and reconstruct buildings. Aiming at the poor adaptation and low extraction precision of existing <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> methods for complex building, an accurate and automatic building <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> method using neighborhood information of point clouds is proposed. Point clouds features are calculated by principle component analysis, and reliable seed points are selected after feature histogram construction. Initial roof surfaces are extracted quickly and precisely by the proposed local normal vector distribution density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (LNVD-DBSCAN). Roof competition problem is solved effectively by the poll model based on neighborhood information. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extract building roofs automatically and precisely, and has preferable adaptation to buildings with different complexity, which is able to provide reliable roof information for building reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{we present}} a method for {{estimating}} the introduction potential of photovoltaic power generation systems (PV systems) in urban areas. Most PV systems are installed on building roofs as roofing systems in urban areas. Therefore, by using the information about roofs obtained from aerial photographs taken from an airplane, we can estimate the introduction potential of PV systems {{in an area of}} interest. The introduction potential of PV systems is basically estimated according to the total area of roofs. In order to obtain the information about roofs, the recognition and extraction of roof from aerial image is a necessary process. In this study, automatic approach for house <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> based on characteristics of surface features is proposed. An experiment of <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> is carried out and the result of our extraction method is compared with the manually extracted roofs to conduct an accuracy assessment.

We introduce the usage of cycle graphs for the best use of topological information. Ridge-lines and step-edges are basically extracted to recognise correct topological relationships among the roof faces. Inner roof corners are geometrically fitted based on the closed cycle graphs. Outer boundary is reconstructed using the same concept but with the outer most cycle graph. In here, union of the sub cycles is taken. Intermediate line segments (outer bounds) are intersected to reconstruct the roof eave lines. Two test areas with two different point densities are tested with the developed approach.

40|$|Effective {{building}} {{detection and}} roof reconstruction has an influential demand over the remote sensing research community. In this paper, {{we present a}} new automatic LiDAR point cloud segmentation method using suitable seed points for building detection and <b>roof</b> plane <b>extraction.</b> Firstly, the LiDAR point cloud is separated into "ground" and "non-ground" points based on the analysis of DEM with a height threshold. Each of the non-ground point is marked as coplanar or non-coplanar based on a coplanarity analysis. Commencing from the maximum LiDAR point height towards the minimum, all the LiDAR points on each height level are extracted and separated into several groups based on 2 D distance. From each group, lines are extracted and a coplanar point which is the nearest to the midpoint of each line is considered as a seed point. This seed point and its neighbouring points are utilised to generate the plane equation. The plane is grown in a region growing fashion until no new points can be added. A robust rule-based tree removal method is applied subsequently to remove planar segments on trees. Four different rules are applied in this method. Finally, the boundary of each object is extracted from the segmented LiDAR point cloud. The method is evaluated with six different data sets consisting hilly and densely vegetated areas. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed method offers a high building detection and <b>roof</b> plane <b>extraction</b> rates while compared to a recently proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Approximation of the {{geometric}} features {{is an essential}} step in point cloud segmentation and surface reconstruction. Often, the planar surfaces are estimated using principal component analysis (PCA), which is sensitive to noise and smooths the sharp features.

This article presents a point cloud segmentation method for building detection and <b>roof</b> plane <b>extraction.</b> It uses PCA for saliency feature estimation including surface curvature and point normal. However, the point normals around the anisotropic surfaces are approximated using a consistent isotropic sub-neighbourhood by Low-Rank Subspace with prior Knowledge (LRSCPK).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for automation in <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> from two solved aerial images. The approach assumes that roofs are composed of several spatial polygons, {{and that they can}} be obtained by extracting all or even only some of them if the model is known. In view of this assumption, innovative algorithms for semi-automatic spatial polygon extraction were developed. These algorithms are based on a 2 D approach to solving the 3 D reality. Based on these algorithms, an interactive and semi-automatic modelbased approach for automation in <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> was developed. The approach is composed of two phases: manual (interactive) and automatic. In the manual (interactive) phase, the operator needs to choose an Expanded Parameterized Model (EPM) from a knowledge base and select one pre-prepared Interactive Option for Extraction (IOE) of the roof. Then, the operator needs to point according to the guidelines of the chosen option in the left image space. In the automatic phase, the selected spatial polygons are extracted, the parameters of the selected model are calculated and the roof is reconstructed. The approach was examined and the results we obtained had standard accuracy. It appears that the approach can be implemented on many types of roofs and under diverse photographic conditions.

40|$|One {{common and}} {{important}} task in urban modeling is {{the extraction of}} 3 D building geometry. Detecting and describing rooftops is a key step. We propose a building roof detection and description method using airborne LiDAR data and orthorectified aerial imagery.

We use LiDAR to separate the building roof and its other significant features from other objects in the scene and estimate the strict outlines of these features. Imagery is processed using a robust segmentation and edge detection method to generate an edge map of the roof and then used to help refine the outlines obtained from LiDAR data. We will illustrate our approach by extracting several roof boundaries in the downtown region of Rochester, NY that exhibit simple and complex outlines.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data segmentation method for automatic building detection and <b>roof</b> plane <b>extraction.</b> First, {{it uses a}} height threshold, based on the digital elevation model (DEM), to divide the LiDAR point cloud into ‘ground’ and ‘non-ground’ points. The ‘non-ground’ LiDAR points are classified as coplanar and non-coplanar based on a coplanarity analysis. Then, starting from the maximum LiDAR height, and decreasing the height at each iteration, it looks for points to form planar roof segments. At each height level, it clusters the points based on the 2 D Euclidean distance for each cluster {{in order to find}} straight lines. The coplanar point nearest to the middle of each line is selected as a seed point and the plane is grown in a region growing fashion until no new points can be added. Finally, a rule-based procedure is followed to remove planar segments on trees. Experimental results on seven data sets indicate that the proposed method offers high building detection and <b>roof</b> plane <b>extraction</b> rates when compared to existing promising methods. Next, an automatic 3 D building roof reconstruction method is proposed based on the outcome of the proposed segmentation method. The method commences with the building boundary points to extract the 3 D internal and external corner points on each building. Then, it connects these points to get a 3 D roof model of a building. To generate a complete 3 D view of a building, the ground heights of the external corner points are considered from the DEM to generate the floor of a building. By connecting the external corner points of ground and non-ground heights, the approximated building walls are generated. The method is examined with three different data sets consisting of several types of complex roof structures. Experimental results show that the proposed reconstruction method improves the correctness and reduces the over and under-segmented roof planes when compared to existing methods.

40|$|Methodologies for {{automatic}} building <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> {{are important}} {{in the context of}} spatial information acquisition for geographical information systems (GIS). Thus, this work proposes a methodology for roof contour extraction from laser scanning data by Markov Random Field model. The methodology is based on extraction of high regions (buildings, trees etc.) from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from laser scanning data, and building roof contour extraction. The high object polygons are extracted by using vectorization and polygonization techniques. The building roof contours are identified among all high objects extracted previously. Taking into account some roof properties and some feature measurements (e. g., area, rectangularity, and angles between principal axes of objects), an energy function was developed based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The solution of this function is a polygon set corresponding to building roof contours and is found by using a minimization technique, like the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. The data area consists of a regular grid obtained by interpoling a laser scanning data set from Curitiba/PR city. The test area with different object configuration complexities was tested. Experiments carried out with laser scanning data's DEM showed that the methodology allows discriminating the urban objects in the scene properly. Pages: 5023 - 503...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{developed}} a new building extraction system applied on high resolution remote sensing imagery based on multi-scale object oriented classification and probabilistic Hough transform. This {{can be divided into}} two different phases: building <b>roof</b> <b>extraction,</b> and shape reconfiguration. For the first phase, the multispectral and panchromatic high resolution satellite imageries are firstly fused for spatial resolution improvement and color information enhancement. The multi-resolution image segmentation is applied on the fused image, resulting {{in the formation of the}} different level of polygon primitives at different space scale, providing different view of the scene at different resolution. In addition to the spectral information, the tone, texture, shape, context information is evaluated in an object oriented manner. The classification is based on a fuzzy rule decision tree classifier. By fuzzy evaluating of the shape, texture, context and spectral information, building roofs are extracted by reconstruction and classification from an appropriate space scale of roof polygon primitives. For the shape reconfiguration phase, we adopt the probabilistic Hough transform to delineate the roof dominant line which shows the major orientation of the specific building roof. According to the dominant line, a building squaring algorithm is applied based on rectilinear fitting of the building boundary. It is shown by our experiment that most rectangular building roofs can be correctly detected, extracted and reconfigured, demonstrating the potential application of the method...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} algorithms for semi-automatic 3 D spatial polygon extraction {{from a pair}} {{of colored}} aerial images with a known external model solution. The algorithm consists of several consecutive stages: initial pointing by a human operator which defines the algorithm as semi-automatic, extraction of a bounding polygon in the left image space, calculation of the estimated height and transformation to the right image space, extraction of a bounding polygon in the right image space and an iterative process which matches both polygons and extracts the spatial polygon. This algorithm is based on a 2 D approach to solving the 3 D reality and can be employed in many feature extraction situations. In this study, the algorithm is used for the spatial extraction of roofs and is presented in a semi-automatic interactive non model-based approach. In the proposed method, the operator needs to point at every distinct planar part of the roof in the left image space (2 D). For each pointing, a specific roof plane is automatically extracted. The intersection of these planes provides us with the detailed roof structure. To examine the algorithm efficiency, a semi-automatic system for <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> was developed.

This paper proposes a new method for automatic segmentation of raw LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data. Using the ground height from a DEM (digital elevation model), the raw LIDAR points are separated into two groups. The first group contains the ground points that form a “building mask”. The second group contains non-ground points that are clustered using the building mask. A cluster of points usually represents an individual building or tree. During segmentation, the planar roof segments are extracted from each cluster of points and refined using rules, such as the coplanarity of points and their locality. Planes on trees are removed using information, such as area and point height difference. Experimental results on nine areas of six different data sets show that the proposed method can successfully remove vegetation and, so, offers a high success rate for building detection (about 90 % correctness and completeness) and <b>roof</b> plane <b>extraction</b> (about 80 % correctness and completeness), when LIDAR point density is as low as four points/m 2.

It is fast method for sampling the earth surface with a high density and high point accuracy. In this paper a procedure for building detection and <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> from the DSM is presented. The procedure starts by re-sampling elevation as obtained by laser scanning into regular grid. The core {{part of the building}} detection is based on a morphological filter for distinguishing between terrain and non-terrain segments. The non-terrain segments are classified into building or vegetation. Aiming at a vector representation of buildings the roof faces are obtained by further segmentation of the building segments into sub-segments. The 3 D geometrical properties of each face are obtained based on plane fitting using least squares adjustment. The reconstruction part of the procedure is based on the adjacency among the roof faces. Primitive extraction and face intersections are used for roof reconstruction. Prior knowledge about the buildings and terrain is needed for both the detection and extraction processes. The procedure is developed to work for all terrain types and for many building/roof types. The laser data used in this research have an average density of 2 - 3 points per square meter and 0. 10 m standard deviation of the elevation values. The procedure shows promising results for building detection. The reconstruction part shows promising results for some roof faces, obtaining high planimetric and height accuracy.

Firstly, a DSM {{is generated by}} using the Delaunay triangulation technique, which produces a model organized as a Triangulated Irregular Network. Then, a connected component analysis conjugated with a thresholding procedure {{is applied to the}} DSM, in order to separate building roofs from other regions in the DSM. The connected component analysis allows the faces of a triangulation to be labeled according to well-defined adjacency and similarity criteria and, so, to define a set of equivalency classes (in this case described by sets of faces from the triangulation), which correspond to different regions in the DSM. Finally, the approximate building roof contours are extracted by finding the edges of the triangulation defined by the intersection between the extreme faces that describe the roof region and the ones correspondent to the building walls.

Point cloud density, complex roof profiles, and occlusion add another layer of complexity which often encounter in practice. In this article, we present a new technique that provides a better interpolation of roof regions where multiple surfaces intersect creating non-manifold points. As a result, these geometric features are preserved to achieve automated identification and segmentation of the roof planes from unstructured laser data. The proposed technique has been tested using the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing benchmark and three Australian datasets, which differ in terrain, point density, building sizes, and vegetation.

Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data with increasing point density and accuracy {{has been recognized}} as a valuable source for automated 3 D building reconstruction. While considerable achievements {{have been made in}} <b>roof</b> <b>extraction,</b> limited research has been carried out in modelling and reconstruction of walls, which constitute important components of a full building model. Low point density and irregular point distribution of LIDAR observations on vertical walls render this task complex. This paper develops a novel approach for wall reconstruction from airborne LIDAR data. The developed method commences with point cloud segmentation using a region growing approach. Seed points for planar segments are selected through principle component analysis, and points in the neighbourhood are collected and examined to form planar segments. Afterwards, segment-based classification is performed to identify roofs, walls and planar ground surfaces. For walls with sparse LIDAR observations, a search is conducted in the neighbourhood of each individual roof segment to collect wall points, and the walls are then reconstructed using geometrical and topological constraints. Finally, walls which were not illuminated by the LIDAR sensor are determined via both reconstructed roof data and neighbouring walls. This leads to the generation of topologically consistent and geometrically accurate and complete 3 D building models. Experiments have been conducted in two test sites in the Netherlands and Australia to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that planar segments can be reliably extracted in the two reported test sites, which have different point density, and the building walls can be correctly reconstructed if the walls are illuminated by the LIDAR sensor...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} availability of low-cost digital cameras with small or medium sized sensors, {{more and more}} airborne images are available with high resolution, which enhances the possibility in establishing three dimensional models for urban areas. The high accuracy of representation of buildings in urban areas is required for asset valuation or disaster recovery. Many automatic methods for modeling and reconstruction are applied to aerial images together with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. If LiDAR data are not provided, manual steps must be applied, which results in semi-automated technique. The automated extraction of 3 D urban models can be aided by the automatic extraction of dense point clouds. The more dense the point clouds, the easier the modeling and the higher the accuracy. Also oblique aerial imagery provides more facade information than nadir images, such as building height and texture. So a method for automatic dense point cloud extraction from oblique images is desired. In this thesis, a modified workflow for the automated extraction of dense point clouds from oblique images is proposed and tested. The result reveals that this modified workflow works well and a very dense point cloud can be extracted from only two oblique images with slightly higher accuracy in flat areas than the one extracted by the original workflow. The original workflow was established by previous research at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for point cloud extraction from nadir images. For oblique images, a first modification is proposed in the feature detection part by replacing the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm with the Affine Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (ASIFT) algorithm. After that, in order to realize a very dense point cloud, the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm is implemented in the second modification to compute the disparity map from a stereo image pair, which can then be used to reproject pixels back to a point cloud. A noise removal step is added in the third modification. The point cloud from the modified workflow is much denser compared to the result from the original workflow. An accuracy assessment {{is made in the}} end to evaluate the point cloud extracted from the modified workflow. From the two flat areas, subsets of points are selected from both original and modified workflow, and then planes are fitted to them, respectively. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the points to the fitted plane is compared. The point subsets from the modified workflow have slightly lower MSEs than the ones from the original workflow, respectively. This suggests a much more dense and more accurate point cloud can lead to clear roof borders for <b>roof</b> <b>extraction</b> and improve the possibility of 3 D feature detection for 3 D point cloud registration...|$|E

In this study, based on a sparse airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud (0. 8 points/m 2) obtained from open source databases, a building reconstruction pipeline for CAD building models was developed. The pipeline includes voxel-based <b>roof</b> patch segmentation, <b>extraction</b> of the key-points representing the roof patch outline, step edge identification and adjustment, and CAD building model generation. The advantages of our method lie in generating CAD building models without the step of enforcing the edges to be parallel or building regularization. Furthermore, {{although it has been}} challenging to use sparse datasets for 3 D building reconstruction, our result demonstrates the great potential in such applications. In this paper, we also investigated the applicability of open {{geospatial data}}sets for 3 D road detection and reconstruction. Road central lines were acquired from an open source 2 D topographic database. ALS data were utilized to obtain the height and width of the road. A constrained search method (CSM) was developed for road width detection. The CSM method was conducted by splitting a given road into patches according to height and direction criteria. The road edges were detected patch by patch. The road width was determined by the average distance from the edge points to the central line. As a result, 3 D roads were reconstructed from ALS and a topographic database...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{paradigms}} of laser scanning and aerophotogrammetry {{in the context}} of building extraction and briefly discusses two <b>roof</b> building contour <b>extraction</b> methodologies. The assets and drawbacks of both data capturing system have been reported several times. In general, empirical and theoretical studies have confirmed that laser scanning methodologies are more suitable in deriving building heights and in extracting planar roof faces and ridges of the roof, whereas the aerophotogrammetry are more suitable in extracting building roof outlines. The first roof contour methodology is based on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which is generated through the regularization of an available laser point cloud. First, in order to detect aboveground objects, the DEM is segmented through a recursive splitting technique and a Bayesian merging technique. The aboveground object polygons are extracted by using vectorization and polygonization techniques. Finally, the building roof contours are identified among all aboveground objects extracted previously, taking into account roof features and a Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The second methodology addresses the geometric refinement of laser-derived 3 D roof contours by using high-resolution aerial images and a MRF model. First, 3 D roof contours are projected onto the image-space. Then, the projected contours and the straight lines extracted from the image are used to establish an MRF description. The solution of the associate energy function provides groupings of straight lines representing roof building contours, which are topologically reconstructed based on the topology of the projected contours. Examples of applications are provided for both approaches. Pages: 5015 - 502...|$|R
40|$|Buildings are {{commonly}} acknowledged {{as the most}} prominent objects in the generation of a 3 D virtual model of our environment. Determining their exact locations, spatial extents, patterns, or detailed geometric structures is often required {{in a range of}} applications, such as urban modeling, city planning, or virtual reality. Land surveying and photogrammetry have been the conventional approaches for this purpose; however, both are very labor-intensive and time-consuming processes. Since the late 19902 ̆ 7 s, new data sources, such as high-resolution images and airborne laser scanning datasets, became available that required the development of more advanced algorithms. These new approaches continue to be studied as new sensor technology with higher resolution and accuracy are developed. Chief among the current day technology is Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), which has been successfully used for this field of study over the past two decades. While most existing approaches show promising results toward automatic generation of 3 D building models, a number of issues remain to be addressed. The main objective of this research was to reconstruct 3 D building models from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To achieve this objective, we proposed a complete framework for this process, including LiDAR filtering, building <b>extraction,</b> <b>roof</b> plane segmentation, and 3 D reconstruction. The raw LiDAR points were first separated into two groups (i. e., the ground and non-ground points), referred to as 2 ̆ 2 LiDAR filtering 2 ̆ 2 step. The non-ground points were eliminated by the adaptive morphological filtering based on the curvatures and elevation difference, and the non-ground points were further processed to generate 3 D buildings. Buildings at the complexity level of LOD 1 were generated only from the building footprints, for which building boundary detection and regularization were studied. Buildings with higher levels of details can be reconstructed by extracting the individual roof planes and combining them based on their spatial adjacency. This thesis treated this task as a two-step task: segmentation and reconstruction. Segmentation finds the planar roof patches, while reconstruction further determines their adjacency and integrity. The roof plane segmentation was approached by the method of multiphase and multichannel level set. The segmentation outcome included the segmented points of individual roof planes as well as a labeled image. The roof vertices thereafter were determined by intersecting adjacent roof segments and then connected based on their topological relations inferred from the labeled image. Finally, we evaluated the proposed approach with three different LiDAR data sets. ...|$|R
