50|$|Conceptually, hypnotizability {{has always}} been defined as the {{increase}} in suggestibility produced by hypnosis.

But, the selfish mobile nodes present in an ad hoc environment refuse to forward neighbouring nodes’ packet for conserving its own energy. This intentional selfish behaviour drastically reduces the degree of cooperation maintained between the mobile nodes. Hence, a need arises for devising an effective mechanism which incorporates both energy efficiency and reputation into account for mitigating selfish behaviour in MANETs. In this paper, we propose an Exponential <b>Reliability</b> <b>Coefficient</b> based reputation Mechanism (ERCRM) which isolates the selfish nodes from the routing path based on Exponential <b>Reliability</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (ExRC). This <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficient</b> manipulated through exponential failure rate based on moving average method highlights the most recent past behaviour of the mobile nodes for quantifying its genuineness. From the simulation results, it is evident that, the proposed ERCRM approach outperforms the existing Packet Conservation Monitoring Algorithm (PCMA) and Spilt Half <b>Reliability</b> <b>Coefficient</b> based Mathematical Model (SHRCM) in terms of performance evaluation metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, total overhead and control overhead. Further, this ERCRM mechanism has a successful rate of 28 % in isolating the selfish nodes from the routing path. Furthermore, it also aids in framing the exponential threshold point of detection as 0. 4, where a maximum number of selfish nodes are identified when compared to the existing models available in the literature...|$|R

The PDP-12 was equipped with a Teletype Model 33 and was interfaced with an oscilloscope so that, during PPVT testing, the status readout of the item number and correctness of response of the last item completed to administer the PPVT could be determined.|$|E
5000|$|Reliability in {{statistics}} and psychometrics is the overall consistency of a measure. A measure {{is said to}} have a high reliability if it produces similar results under consistent conditions. [...] "It is the characteristic of a set of test scores that relates to the amount of random error from the measurement process that might be embedded in the scores. Scores that are highly reliable are accurate, reproducible, and consistent from one testing occasion to another. That is, if the testing process were repeated with a group of test takers, essentially the same results would be obtained. Various kinds of <b>reliability</b> <b>coefficients,</b> with values ranging between 0.00 (much error) and 1.00 (no error), are usually used to indicate the amount of error in the scores." [...] For example, measurements of people's height and weight are often extremely reliable.|$|E
