40|$|Cellular {{operators}} are increasingly turning towards renewable energy (RE) {{as an alternative}} to using traditional electricity in order to reduce operational expenditure and carbon footprint. Due to the randomness in both RE generation and mobile traffic at each base station (BS), a surplus or shortfall of energy may occur at any given time. To increase energy selfreliance and minimize the network’s energy cost, the operator needs to efficiently exploit the RE generated across all BSs. In this paper, a hybrid energy sharing framework for cellular network is proposed, where a combination of physical power lines and energy trading with other BSs using smart grid is used. Algorithms for physical power lines deployment between BSs, based on average and complete statistics of the net <b>RE</b> <b>available,</b> are developed. Afterwards, an energy management framework is formulated to optimally determine the quantities of electricity and RE to be procured and exchanged among BSs, respectively, while considering battery capacities and real-time energy pricing. Three cases are investigated where RE generation is unknown, perfectly known, and partially known ahead of time. Results investigate the time varying energy management of BSs and demonstrate considerable reduction in average energy cost thanks to the hybrid energy sharing scheme...|$|E

40|$|An {{immunosensor}} for {{the detection}} of the African Swine Fever (ASF) disease in infected pigs is presented. A sensitive, direct immunoassay for measurements in diluted pig sera was established using the virus protein 73 (VP 73) as a highly specific receptor layer for a mass sensitive piezoelectric quartz crystal. The fundamental sensor effect of this transducer is based on the linear dependence of the resonance frequency of an oscillating quartz crystal upon the binding of mass on the coated surface during the measurement. A quartz crystal which is coated with VP 73 is an highly specific sensor and allows to detect the ASF-antibodies in the sample through mass accumulation {{on the surface of the}} quartz crystal. An appropriate immobilization technique for VP 73 was established and a suitable carrier buffer for the flow injection analysis system was developed during this study. Regeneration of the receptor layer is possible for about ten times. With this quartz crystal microbalance, results we <b>re</b> <b>available</b> within a few minutes and with a selectivity comparable to a licensed microtiterplate ELISA.

40|$|Simultaneous {{acquisition}} of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance (EIS-EQCM) data in cyclic electrode potential scans {{was used to}} characterize nonstationary underpotential deposition (UPD) of atomic layers of Ag on Au and Cu on Pt. Both EIS and EQCM data sets complemented {{each other in the}} elucidation of interface models and the investigation of different aspects of the interfacial dynamics. EIS-EQCM provided an opportunity to monitor coadsorption and competitive adsorption of anions during the Ag and Cu UPD using (i) the electrode mass change, (ii) adsorption capacitances, and (iii) double-layer capacitances. Kinetic information is available in the EIS-EQCM through the charge transfer resistances and apparent rate coefficients. The latter expresses the rate of UPD into the partially covered electrode surface. The apparent rate coefficients for the Ag UPD were determined to vary from 0. 15 to 0. 45 cm/s which is between the standard constant rates k(o) of Ag bulk deposition on Ag reported previously for different Ag surfaces. Cu UPD on Pt and Ag UPD on Au contributed differently into a resonance resistance Delta <b>R(E)</b> <b>available</b> from the EQCM data sets. Spontaneous surface alloying between Ag and Au during the Ag UPD continuously increased the Delta R, while the Cu overlayer formation on Pt as well as experiments without Ag+ and Cu 2 + in the solution did not change this parameter significantly.

Therefore, we generated several data sets to illustrate the problem and demonstrate {{the performance of the}} proposed solution procedure. One of these data sets (referred to as Problem- 1) is provided in detail in Appendix 1. In this data set, we considered a system composed of 20 resource elements and 22 machine tools. Table 8 shows four different cases in which each of 20 <b>REs</b> is <b>available</b> on one or more machines.

The average number of machines per RE in these four cases is 4.55, 2.65, 1.5, and 1.1, respectively.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of {{variable}} faint optical sources discovered by comparing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) catalogs. We use SDSS measurements to photometrically recalibrate several publicly available POSS catalogs; a piecewise recalibration in 100 arcmin 2 patches generally results in an improvement of photometric accuracy (rms) by nearly a factor of two, compared to the original data. The POSS I magnitudes can be improved to 0. 15 mag accuracy, and POSS II magnitudes to 0 ̃. 10 mag accuracy. We use the recalibrated catalogs for the 2, 000 deg 2 of sky in the SDSS Data Release 1 to construct a catalog of 60, 000 sources variable on time scales 10 - 50 years. A series of statistical tests based on the morphology of SDSS color-color diagrams, as well as visual comparison of images and comparison with repeated SDSS observations, demonstrate the robustness of the selection methods. We quantify the distribution of variable sources in the SDSS color-color diagrams, and the variability characteristics of quasars. We detect a turn-over in quasar structure function {{which suggests that the}} characteristic time scale for quasar variability is of the order one year. The long-term (> 1 year) quasar variability decreases with luminosity and rest-frame wavelength similarly to the short-term (< 1 year) behavior. We also demonstrate that candidate RR Lyrae stars trace the same halo structures, such as the Sgr dwarf tidal stream, that were discovered using repeated SDSS observations. We utilize the POSS-SDSS selected candidates to constrain the halo structure in the parts of sky for which repeated SDSS observations do not exist.

How the architecture fulfills the three requirements of strategic reasoning transparency, consistency and modularity is illustrated in a use case of a business simulation game for supply chain management education. ...|$|R

Such peaks are signposted by massive high-redshift radio galaxies. Here we report deep submillimetre mapping of seven high-redshift radio galaxies and their environments. These data confirm not only the presence of spatially extended massive star-formation activity in the radio galaxies themselves, but also in companion objects previously undetected at any wavelength. The prevalence, orientation, and inferred masses of these submillimetre companion galaxies suggest that we are witnessing the synchronous formation of the most luminous elliptical galaxies found today at the centres of rich galaxy clusters.

To better account for the animal examples introduced by Clare Palmer, I suggested to bring another layer to the non-identity cases and consider harms on the population level where appropriate.
