5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E

She was a younger sister of Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia and an elder sister of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. All sisters were falsely <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> survived the assassination {{and dozens of}} imposters claimed to be surviving Romanovs. Author Michael Occleshaw speculated that a woman named Larissa Tudor might have been Tatiana; however, all of the Romanovs, including Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia, {{were killed by the}} Bolshevik.|$|E
5|$|In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an {{unmarried}} planter's daughter {{in her early}} 30s, claimed that Sharp {{was the father of}} her illegitimate child; Sharp denied her claim. The stillborn child was <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> dark skin, and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition to losing the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola {{where his father}} had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it {{as likely to have}} been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.|$|E

Na Hoon-a, a successful trot singer with a career spanning over 40 years, was falsely <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>had</b> been castrated by yakuza, because he {{was having an affair}} with the mistress of a gang boss. The mistress was wildly guessed at, with the names of actresses Kim Hye-soo and Kim Sun-a thrown around (both issued official denials). Na ended up holding a press conference in which he almost stripped in order <b>to</b> prove the <b>rumor</b> was untrue, and demanded that the media apologize to the two actresses.|$|R

5|$|Class distinction, however, became linked as {{the fashion}} of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were {{simultaneously}} considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen.

5|$|From {{the area}} of Daugavpils she entered Lithuania, where in April 1831 her unit is <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seized the town of Zarasai, {{although}} the historians are not sure this event really occurred.

She then returned to Samogitia and headed for Panevėžys, where on 30 April she joined forces with the unit commanded by Karol Załuski. On May 4, she fought at the battle of Prastavoniai; shortly afterwards, with Konstanty Parczewski, she fought at Maišiagala. On 5 May, she witnessed General Dezydery Chłapowski entering the area with a large force and taking command over all units fighting in the former Grand Duchy.|$|E
5000|$|As {{duchess of}} Parma, Élisabeth {{actively}} involved in state affairs; Philip never negotiated any business without consulting her, and she in turn never made a decision without considering the view of France and her French advisers. Most of the officials of the court and government were French, and French was the language spoken at court, even by Philip, while she herself demonstratively promoted French influence in the duchy. The French influence in Parma was not popular in the Duchy, opposition among the Italian public raged against both the French and Spanish rulers. In 1750, Elisabeth's lady-in-waiting Madame de Leydc was claimed by a <b>rumor</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poisoned France's Chief Minister at Parma, supposedly for being French. The financial stress of the duchy was extensive, however, which created a problem.|$|R

Even though the style of their correspondence during Angelica's 14-year residence in Europe was flirtatious, modern historians like Chernow and Fielding agree that despite contemporary gossip there is no conclusive evidence that Hamilton's relationship with Angelica was ever physical or went beyond a strong affinity between in-laws. Hamilton also maintained a correspondence with Elizabeth's younger sister Margarita, nicknamed Peggy, who was the recipient of his first letters praising her sister Elizabeth {{at the time of his}} courtship in early 1780.|$|E

Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the Ways and Means Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; {{it was the only time}} in his career that he solely managed a bill. His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.|$|E
50|$|The medieval annals give no {{information}} about the later years of the marital life of David and Esukan, but mention that, when David died (in 1270), rumors held Esukan responsible for poisoning her husband as a revenge {{for the death of}} Basil.

5|$|Piso was <b>rumored</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant {{to hear the case}} himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep anger toward Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|E

The two teams squared off at WrestleMania XX in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a lingerie match.
