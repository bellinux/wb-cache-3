Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play.

5|$|Nonetheless, the force's {{reputation}} {{suffered from}} the controversy and complaints persisted that the force was oversized, excessively funded and staffed by political appointees. By the 1890s, a political consensus had emerged in Ottawa that the western provinces should become autonomous and take up <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> policing; it was therefore time {{to plan for the}} closure of the force, which originally had only been intended to be a temporary organisation. The force was reduced to 850 men in 1893, and to 750 by 1898. The Conservative government stood for reelection in 1896 with plans to further reduce the size of the force, reportedly to 500 men, but lost to the Liberal party, led by Wilfrid Laurier. The new Prime Minister had stood for election on a platform of increasing the rights of the provinces to carry out law enforcement. He produced plans to halve the size of the mounted police as a first step towards eliminating the force, and proposed to establish a new militia regiment in the North-West Territories to fulfil any legacy military requirements.|$|E

However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for people that would stay outdoors for eight hours a day.

25|$|By 1855 New South Wales {{had been}} granted {{responsible}} self-government and increasingly took responsibility for its own affairs. The colony remained within, and was fiercely loyal to, the British Empire, and while the Colonial Office continued to determine foreign policy, the decision was taken in London that the Australian colonies would need to start taking <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> defence. In 1860, as British Army units were being sent to New Zealand, New South Wales attempted to raise a volunteer force of 1,700 men. This number was almost achieved with 1,644 volunteers enlisting, who were formed into one troop of mounted rifles, three batteries of artillery, and 20 companies of infantry. To encourage enlistments, land grants were offered in 1867. It was not considered a success. In 1868, these were later organised into a battalion and regimental structure. The Volunteer Sydney Rifle Corps ceased to exist, being subsumed into the 20 company-strong 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers.

Despite sweeping foreign policy initiatives, the Soviets maintain a significant military capability. Even as {{the likelihood of}} the Soviet threat diminishes, low-intensity type conflict threaten U. S. regional interests. Additionally, changing regional perceptions are undermining traditional U. S. security arrangements. Rising Asian nationalism questions the need for forward deployment of U. S. forces within regional states. A policy of forward presence via maritime assets is the solution. U. S. naval assets would allow for a reasonable power projection capability in time of crisis, yet would meet fiscal constraints during peacetime through a scaling down of deployed assets. Other U. S. forces will maintain their ability to meet regional responsibilities through training exercises with regional forces and a build-up of the U. S. sealift capability. Now is the time to encourage regional states to assume greater <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> defense. A regional maritime organization must be developed to maintain open trade routes. With a focused mandate, such an organization would not threaten individual national sovereignties and would promote regional cooperation and stability. An expansion of the U. S.

Omine found it [...] "kinda weird" [...] that the people did not take <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> health, and joked that, in the future, people might sue food companies for [...] "making them fat", which eventually became the episode's plot.
