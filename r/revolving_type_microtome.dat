50|$|The {{revolving}} part of alternators {{can be the}} armature or the magnetic field. The <b>revolving</b> armature <b>type</b> has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The <b>revolving</b> armature <b>type</b> is not often used. The <b>revolving</b> field <b>type</b> has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the slip ring connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip ring connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts; manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.|$|R

The model of learning by elimination is compared to standard models of learning from examples. In some cases, the models coincide, and in others they differ. We especially show that our model is universal in that any learning problem solvable in a standard model can also be solved by elimination learning in a wide class of natural search [...] ...|$|R

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: An alternator is a machine, {{having a}} field and an armature, which generates an alternating current. The field may be either stationary or revolving, though usually of the <b>revolving</b> <b>type.</b> Nearly all the alternators {{of the present}} time are of the revolving field and stationary armature type, as it avoids the collection of high tension currents through brushes, since the armature may be permanently connected up, and only low tension direct -current need be fed through the rings to the field. Other advantages are, increased room for armature insulation, and, in polyphasers, the necessity for only two instead of three or more slip-rings. The revolving armature is still used to some extent on small machines of low voltage capacity. The alternaing current is produced by passing a coil of wire first over a north pole and then over a south pole, so that a current is first generated {{in one direction and}} then in the other, in the inductors. The current changes direction in the coil every time that it passes under a pole of the opposite polarity. At a point between the two poles, in passing from one to the other, the coil passes for a very small increment of time over a space in which there are no lines of force being cut {{and at the same time}} there is no current or E. M. F. generatedin the coil. At this point the E. M. F. generated is of minimum value or zero; but as soon as the coil begins to enter the field of the next pole, the E. M. F. begins to increase in the opposite direction until the point under the center of the pole piece or field of greatest density is reached, when the E. M. F. reaches its maximum value and again begins to decrease to zero, after which it again rises and falls in the opposite direction. When a current...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Global impact {{assessment}} of unilateral climate policies is commonly based on multi-sector, multi-region {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) models that are calibrated to consistent accounts of production, consumption, and bilateral trade flows. However, global economic databases such as GTAP treat energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries rather in aggregate, thereby missing poten-tially important details on the heterogeneity of these sectors. In this paper, we elaborate on the avail-ability of data resources and methodological issues in disaggregating energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors that receive larger attention in the public policy debate on unilateral emission regula-tion: non-ferrous metals, iron and steel and non-metallic minerals. Our sensitivity analysis <b>revolves</b> around three <b>types</b> of unobserved heterogeneity at the sub-sectoral level: trade elasticities, energy consumption and technology specifications. Drawing on the example of border tax adjustments, we find that for all given technology specifications and variation in energy shares, the biggest differences emerge from variations in Armington elasticities. Even moderate changes in Armington elasticities can alter the magnitude and {{the sign of the}} effects at the sectoral level. The implications of sub-sectoral disaggregation are not as pronounced for macroeconomic indicators and leakage as for sectoral indi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Physicians {{who serve}} as public health specialists at public health centers and health {{departments}} in local or central government have significant roles {{because of their}} public health expertise. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the retention and career paths of such specialists in Japan. Method We analyzed the data of seven consecutive surveys, spanning 1994 to 2006. We first analyzed the 2006 survey data by sex, age group, and facility type. We then examined the changes over time in the proportion of physicians working in public health administration agencies. We also examined the distribution of the facility types and specialties in which physicians worked both before beginning and after leaving their jobs. These analyses were performed by using physician registration numbers to cross-link data from two consecutive surveys. Results The proportion of physicians working in public health administration agencies was 0. 7 % in 2006. The actual numbers for each survey ranged between 1, 800 and 1, 900. The overall rate remaining in public health administration agencies during the two-year survey interval was 72. 8 % for 1994 - 1996. The ratio declined to 67. 2 % for 2004 - 2006. Among younger physicians with 1 - 10 years of experience, the retention rate showed a sharp decline, dropping from 72. 6 % to 50. 0 %. Many of these physicians came from or left for a hospital position, with the proportion entering academic hospital institutions increasing in recent years. In many cases, physicians left or entered internal medicine clinical practices. Conclusion At present in Japan, the number of physicians who leave and the number who begin a position are almost the same; thus, some of the problems associated with physicians leaving are yet to become apparent. However, the fact that the retention period is shortening for younger physicians may represent a future problem for ensuring the quality of physicians in public health administration agencies. Possible strategies include: increasing the number of physicians entering positions; reducing the number leaving positions; and creating a system where physicians can easily reenter positions after leaving while also establishing a <b>revolving</b> door <b>type</b> of career development system, involving both public health departments and hospital clinical departments. </p...|$|R

(The word [...] "seems" [...] is used {{because much of}} this subject matter is inconclusively verifiable, due to {{the high level of}} secrecy that exists among the great powers with regard to the details of space sensing systems.) The first application is the continuing development of [...] "spy" [...] or reconnaissance satellites which began in the Cold War era, but has progressed significantly since that time. Spy satellites perform a variety of missions such as high resolution photography (IMINT), communications eavesdropping (SIGINT), and covert communications (HUMINT). These tasks are performed on a regular basis both during peacetime and war operations. Satellites are also used by the nuclear states to provide early warning of missile launches, locate nuclear detonations, and detect preparations for otherwise clandestine or surprise nuclear tests (at least those tests or preparations carried out above-ground); this was the case when, in 1998, India and Pakistan both conducted a series of nuclear tests; in addition, a nuclear-detection satellite of the Vela type was also reported to have detected a nuclear detonation in the Indian Ocean in 1978 that was believed to be a South African nuclear test in what was famously called the Vela Incident.
