As a result, in summer-peaking electricity systems, such as California and most of the U. S., power from PVs is produced disproportionately at times when the value of electricity is high. Thus, a valuation of solar PV electricity production that uses only the average wholesale cost of electricity will tend to undervalue the power. Yet, that is what happens by default in many installations because solar PVs are generally located at the end-user’s premises and those end-users are often billed on a flat per kilowatt-hour rate that does not reflect time-varying valuation.

"Efficient" is defined as maximizing the quality of the military HHG move for a given cost, or minimizing the cost of performance of the move <b>at</b> <b>a</b> stated level of quality. Recent modification tot the HHG carrier suspension procedure, a negative incentive, were found to have reduced the effectiveness of this important traffic management tool. This paper concludes that a positive incentive provision must be included to improve the efficiency of the program. Two proposed alternative methods of achieving this objective were included. One, the Option Plan, would allow military personnel the option of arranging for and paying for their own move, and being <b>reimbursed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> fixed percent of entitlement. The other, the Bonus Plan, would provide bonus tonnage as a reward to carriers whose past performance was superior. Criteria were developed to measure and compare these alternatives against the existing method. The criteria were expressed in terms of benefits and costs. Two simple models were constructed and tested with simulated data. Due to inability to quantify certain costs in the Option Plan model, it is considered incomplete and inconclusive and is recommended for further study. The Bonus Plan model, on the other hand, results in the conclusion that implementation of this plan would improve the efficiency of the program by increasing the quality of carrier performance at no increase in cost.

Sponsorship: EU (project FAIR-CT 96 - 1832) / Milk Development Council/MAFF (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) Silages prepared from pure stands of ryegrass, alfalfa, white clover, and red clover over two successive year were offered to lactating dairy cows in two feeding experiments. Proportional mixtures of all cuts prepared in a yr were used {{to ensure that the}} forage treatments were representative of the crop. Additional treatments involved mixtures of grass silage with either white clover silage or red clover silage (50 / 50, on a DM basis). Silages were prepared in round bales, using a biological inoculant additive, and wilting for up to 48 h. Although the legumes were less suited to silage-making than grass, because of their higher buffering capacity and lower water-soluble carbohydrate content, all silages were well-fermented. A standard concentrate was offered <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat-rate</b> (8 kg/d in yr 1, and 4 or 8 kg/d in yr 2). All of the legume silages led to higher DM intake and milk yields than for the grass silage, with little effect on milk composition. Intake and production responses to legumes were similar at the two levels of concentrate feeding and with forage mixtures they were intermediate to those for the separate forages. An additional benefit of the clover silages, particularly red clover silage, was the increase in levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly;-linolenic acid, in milk. Legume silages also led to a lower palmitic acid percentage in milk. The efficiency of conversion of feed N into milk N declined with increasing levels of legume silage. White clover silage led to a higher N-use efficiency when the effect of N intake level is taken into account. Key Words: silage ? clover ? alfalfa ? milk production ? fatty acidPeer reviewe...|$|R

Quality assessments and reports of patient satisfaction, produced by the Ministry of Health since 2008, as well as national registries and reports, provided the data for this review. Indicators of HD services in all continental facilities show positive results that have successively improved along the period of 2009 – 2011, in spite of an average annual growth of 3 % of the population under HD treatment. Mortality rates for HD patients were 12. 7 %, 12 %, and 11 %, respectively in 2009, 2010, and 2011; annual hospitalization rates were 4. 9 %, 3. 8 %, and 4. 4 % for the same years; key performance indicators showed averages above the reference values such as hemoglobin, serum phosphorus, eKt/V, water quality, number of days of hospitalization per patient per year, and number of weekly dialysis sessions.

Solifenacin is a new antimuscarinic with selectivity for the bladder and it demonstrated good effectiveness, safety and tolerability. Scope {{of the present study}} is to investigate the pharmacoeconomic performance of the treatment with solifenacin, when compared to tolterodine and placebo, in Italian patients with OAB. The economic evaluation is performed with a simulation model, based on a Markov chain. The time horizon of the simulation is 52 weeks, with a 1 -week cycle. The model simulates the outcomes and costs of the treatment with solifenacin (5 mg/die), tolterodine ER (4 mg/die) and no treatment in a cohort representative of the Italian population with OAB (estimated in about 1, 400 thousands patients). The cost analysis is conducted mainly in the perspective of the patient, since drugs for the treatment of OAB are currently not included in the Italian reimbursement list. The results show that both treatments produce significative improvements in symptoms and quality of life, with an increase in costs of about 540 - 640 Euro/year with solifenacin and of 680 - 780 Euro/year with tolterodine. In the cost-utility analysis, solifenacin dominates tolterodine since it results more effective and less costly, and its cost cost-utility ratio with respect to no treatment is in the range 7, 600 - 18, 600 Euro/QALY. In the subgroup of patients incontinent at baseline and who best respond to the therapy (responders), the increase in costs with solifenacin results of about 100 - 400 Euro/year and the cost-utility ratio is 600 - 4, 200 Euro/QALY. A supplementary scenario has been elaborated to explore the consequences of a hypothetical reimbursement decision by the Italian NHS. In this scenario, the NHS cost perspective is considered and the antimuscarinic drugs are assumed to be <b>reimbursed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> half of the current retail price only to incontinent and responder OAB patients.

40|$|Maternal {{health care}} is an {{important}} issue. In order for the population to be healthy, {{it is essential that}} children are well nourished and health from the moment of their conception. Unfortunately, in many countries – especially developing countries – the emphasis is directed away from health care, and the concept of health care in pregnancy is nearly non-existent. This occurs for a variety of reasons; cultural biases against medical involvement in health, biases against women, financial barriers and infrastructural barriers. One of the problems is that governments in developing countries often do not have money to invest in improving the medical health care system, or to provide the necessary care for their populations. The private sector in developing countries has an as yet undefined role in providing health care to the masses. Frequently, the private sector is purely occupied with providing health care to households who can afford to pay, which leaves a large section of the population dependent on health care provided by the public sector. One of the options which has recently arisen has been to involve the private sector in the provision of health care to the underprivileged, using subsidies from the public sector. These are known as Public-Private Partnerships. Voucher schemes are a form of Public-Private Partnership which specify exactly the sort of services which are included. Voucher schemes involve the distribution of vouchers to eligible individuals, subsidised partially or wholly by the Government, who can then redeem the vouchers <b>at</b> <b>a</b> specific private facility of their choice, conditional {{to the fact that the}} private facility has agreed to participate in the scheme. The private facility then provides the services that have been agreed upon to the voucher-holder, free of charge, but withhold the vouchers to hand back to the Government, in order to be <b>reimbursed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> previously agreed-upon rate. The city of Lucknow, in Uttar Pradesh, has recently introduced the Sambhav Voucher Scheme, using similar reasoning. The Scheme itself is well thought-out, but the reality is somewhat different than the initial hopes for the project were. While the Scheme has excellent potential, there are certain improvements which are required, particularly in implementation.
