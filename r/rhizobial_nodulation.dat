40|$|Legumes enter nodule symbioses with nitrogen-fixing {{bacteria}} (rhizobia), whereas most flowering plants establish symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Once first steps of symbiosis are initiated, nodule formation and mycorrhization in legumes is negatively {{controlled by a}} shoot-derived inhibitor (SDI), a phenomenon termed autoregulation. According to current views, autoregulation of nodulation and mycorrhization in legumes is regulated in a similar way. CLE peptides induced in response to <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> signals (Nod factors) have been proposed to represent the ascending long-distance signals to the shoot. Although not proven yet, these CLE peptides are likely perceived by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) autoregulation receptor kinases in the shoot. Autoregulation of mycorrhization in non-legumes is reminiscent to the phenomenon of “systemic acquired resistance” in plant-pathogen interactions...|$|E
30|$|A {{previous}} {{study showed that}} endocytosis {{played a role in}} symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia (Wang et al. 2015). A complex molecular mechanism was required for the establishment of symbiotic relationships between legumes and rhizobia. Legume roots released flavonoids, which triggered synthesis and secretion of <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> factors. These nodulation factors were recognized by legume roots and activated a symbiosis signaling pathway. The legumes allowed the rhizobia to enter root hairs and pass through plant-derived infection threads. Finally, rhizobia were released from infection threads (IT) to symbiosomes of infected cells within the root nodule. A previous study suggested that the nodulation factor signaling pathway might proceed through an endocytosis process (Timmers et al. 1998). Another study found that the Medicago flotillin-like proteins, lipid raft-associated integral membrane proteins involved in endocytosis, were crucial for infection thread initiation and nodule development (Haney and Long 2010).|$|E

Most plant species cannot utilize atmospheric nitrogen directly and thus require nitrogenous compounds, such as nitrate and ammonium (Crawford 1995).

Bacterial Nod factors (NFs) and plant regulatory pathways modulating NF signalling control <b>rhizobial</b> infections and <b>nodulation</b> efficiency. Here {{we show that}} gibberellin (GA) signalling mediated by DELLA proteins inhibits rhizobial infections and controls the NF induction of the infection marker ENOD 11 in Medicago truncatula.

We show using heterologous systems that DELLA proteins can interact with the nodulation signalling pathway 2 (NSP 2) and nuclear factor-YA 1 (NF-YA 1) transcription factors that are essential for the activation of NF responses. Furthermore, MtDELLA 1 can bind the ERN 1 (ERF required for nodulation 1) promoter and positively transactivate its expression. Overall, we propose that GA-dependent action of DELLA proteins may directly regulate the NSP 1 /NSP 2 and NF-YA 1 activation of ERN 1 transcription to regulate rhizobial infections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In split-root {{systems of}} alfalfa (Medi-cago sativa L.), already {{existing}} nodules or arbuscular mycorrhizal roots suppress further establishment of symbiosis in other root parts, a phenomenon named autoregulation. Roots trea-ted with <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> signals (Nod factors) induce a similar systemic suppression of symbiosis. In order {{to test the}} hypothesis that flavonoids play a role in this systemic suppression, split-root systems of alfalfa plants were inocu-lated {{on one side of the}} split-root system with Sinorhizobium meliloti or Glomus mosseae or were treated with Nod factor. HPLC-analysis of alfalfa root extracts from both sides of the split-root system revealed a persistent local and systemic accumulation pattern of some flavonoids associated with the different treatments. The two flavonoids, formononetin and ononin, could be identified to be similarily altered after rhizobial or mycorrhizal inoculation or when treated with Nod factor. Exogenous application of formo-nonetin and ononin partially restored nodulation and mycorrhization pointing towards the involvement of these two secondary compounds in the autoregulation of both symbioses...|$|E
40|$|Soybean (Glycine max) {{is a major}} crop plant {{important}} for food supply and animal feed.

The effects of three AMF {{species on the}} mycorrhizal root colonization, <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation,</b> plant growth and phosphorus useefficiency were compared in the bean recombinant inbred line (RIL) 147 after transfer from initial sand culture.

40|$|Summary. Concentration {{and time}} course {{dependence}} of two structurally related plant flavonoids naringenin and quercetin on the nodABC gene transcriptional activity (as reporter gene nodC-lacZ activity) in Rh. leguminiosarum bv. vicae strain D 923 and respective growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixing responses of plant host (garden pea) to inoculation with pre-induced strains were studied. Naringenin {{was more effective}} as a common nod genes inducer with maximum activity obtained at 0. 5 µÌ, while quercetin showed lower activity at a concentration of 15 µÌ. According to the results quercetin was the better common nod genes-suppressor of Rh. leguminosarum bv viciae D 293 growth. Incubation of germinating pea seeds with flavonoids–preactivated inocula (applied in effective concentrations), resulted in changed nodulation and nitrogen fixing patterns of plants after 35 days of growth.

30|$|Another {{factor that}} {{influences}} the nodulation in legumes {{is the source}} of carbon and energy which increases the population of N-fixing bacteria (Hill and Patriquin 1996). In our studies, fruit and vegetable compost was used as it is easily mineralized thereby, increasing the availability of C and energy to diazotrophic bacteria. Similarly, any biotic or abiotic stress also induces ethylene production (Shaharoona et al. 2006), including <b>rhizobial</b> infection during <b>nodulation</b> (Suganuma et al. 1995), which may ultimately reduce root growth (van Workum et al. 1995). The application of microbes with ACC-deaminase activity in growth medium help in reducing this ethylene stress. In the present study, addition of phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) contained both ACC- and P-solubilizing activities; the former activity might have caused a reduction in ethylene levels and the P-solubilizing activity increased P availability which helped to increase nodulation (Table  2, 3 and 4). Moreover, the compost material {{used in the present study}} supplied micro- as well as macro nutrients which promoted better root growth and nodulation (Cheuk et al. 2003; Ahmad et al. 2008 a, b). Other researchers have also reported similar results (Shaharoona et al. 2006, 2007; Ditta et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{influence}} of various soil factors on the legume–Rhizobium symbiotic relationship. Abiotic factors such as extremes in soil pH (highly acidic or alkaline soils), salinity, tillage, high soil temperature and chemical residues, {{all of which can}} occur in crop and pasture systems in southern Australia, generally reduce populations of Rhizobium in the soil. Naturally occurring Rhizobium populations, although often found in high numbers, are generally poor in their ability to fix nitrogen and can compete strongly with introduced Rhizobium inoculant. The introduction of new legume genera as a continuing and essential part of change in farming systems usually requires the need to identify new and specific inoculant Rhizobium strains not found in the soil, but necessary for optimum nitrogen fixation. It is therefore necessary to characterise the specific requirements or limitations in the soil for establishing Rhizobium populations to ensure optimal nitrogen fixation following inoculation of legumes. The ability of the introduced Rhizobium to form effective nodules is rarely linked to a single soil attribute; therefore the study of rhizobial ecology requires an understanding of many soil and environmental factors. This paper reviews current knowledge of {{the influence of}} soil factors on <b>rhizobial</b> survival, the <b>nodulation</b> process, and nitrogen fixation by legumes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> (Nod) factors {{activate}} both nodule morphogenesis and {{infection thread}} development during legume nodulation. Nod factors induce two different calcium responses: intra-nuclear calcium oscillations and a calcium influx {{at the root}} hair tip. Calcium oscillations activate nodule development; we wanted to test if the calcium influx is associated with infection. Sinorhizobium meliloti nodL and nodF mutations additively reduce infection of Medicago truncatula. Nod-factors made by the nodL mutant lack an acetyl group; mutation of nodF causes the nitrogen (N) -linked C 16 : 2 acyl chain {{to be replaced by}} C 18 : 1. We tested whether these Nod-factors differentially induced calcium influx and calcium spiking. The absence of the NodL-determined acetyl group greatly reduced the induction of calcium influx without affecting calcium spiking. The calcium influx was even further reduced if the N-linked C 16 : 2 acyl group was replaced by C 18 : 1. These additive effects on calcium influx correlate with the additive effects of mutations in nodF and nodL on legume infection. Infection thread development is inhibited by ethylene, which also inhibited Nod-factor-induced calcium influx. We conclude that Nod-factor perception differentially activates the two developmental pathways required for nodulation and that activation of the pathway involving the calcium influx is important for efficient infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{products}} of the <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> genes {{are involved in the}} biosynthesis of lipochitin oligosaccharides (LCOs), which are host-specific signal molecules required for nodule formation. The presence of an O-acetyl group on C- 6 of the nonreducing N-acetylglucosamine residue of LCOs is due to the enzymatic activity of NodL. Here we show that transfer of the nodL gene into four rhizobial species that all normally produce LCOs that are not modified on C- 6 of the nonreducing terminal residue results in production of LCOs, the majority of which have an acetyl residue substituted on C- 6. Surprisingly, in transconjugant strains of Mesorhizobium loti, Rhizobium etli, and Rhizobium tropici carrying nodL, such acetylation of LCOs prevents the endogenous nodS-dependent transfer of the N-methyl group that is found as a substituent of the acylated nitrogen atom. To study this interference between nodL and nodS, we have cloned the nodS gene of M. loti and used its product in in vitro experiments in combination with purified NodL protein. It has previously been shown that a chitooligosaccharide N deacetylated on the nonreducing terminus (the so-called NodBC metabolite) is the preferred substrate for NodS as well as for NodL. Here we show that the NodBC metabolite, acetylated by NodL, is not used by the NodS protein as a substrate while the NodL protein can acetylate the NodBC metabolite that has been methylated by NodS...|$|E
40|$|The {{symbiotic}} association between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively known as rhizobia {{results in the}} formation of a unique plant root organ called the nodule. This process is initiated following the perception of <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> factors by the host plant. Nod factor (NF) -stimulated plant responses, including nodulation-specific gene expression, is mediated by the NF signaling pathway. Plant mutants in this pathway are unable to nodulate. We describe here the cloning and characterization of two mutant alleles of the Medicago truncatula ortholog of the Lotus japonicus and pea (Pisum sativum) NIN gene. The Mtnin mutants undergo excessive root hair curling but are impaired in infection and fail to form nodules following inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti. Our investigation of early NF-induced gene expression using the reporter fusion ENOD 11 ::GUS in the Mtnin- 1 mutant demonstrates that MtNIN is not essential for early NF signaling but may negatively regulate the spatial pattern of ENOD 11 expression. It was recently shown that an autoactive form of a nodulation-specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is sufficient to induce nodule organogenesis in the absence of rhizobia. We show here that MtNIN is essential for autoactive calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-induced nodule organogenesis. The non-nodulating hcl mutant has a similar phenotype to Mtnin, but we demonstrate that HCL is not required in this process. Based on our data, we suggest that MtNIN functions downstream of the early NF signaling pathway to coordinate and regulate the correct temporal and spatial formation of root nodules...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} plant {{receptor}} kinases working with nonreceptor kinases in het-eromeric complexes {{has emerged in}} oth-er systems. The kinases in the het-eromeric complexes can both be receptor kinases. For example, the BRI 1 leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase detects the plant hormone brassinosteroid (11). Recently, an activation-tagging screen (12) and a yeast two-hybrid analysis (13) in Arabidopsis identified the receptor ki-nase BAK 1 as a BRI 1 -interacting pro-tein. Genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that the formation of BRI 1 -BAK 1 heterodimers is required for brassinosteroid signaling (12, 13). Another example {{is provided by the}} NFR 1 and NFR 5 LysM receptor kinases identified in a screen for legume mu-tants with defects in <b>rhizobial</b> symbiosis and <b>nodulation</b> (14). To recognize Nod factors, NFR 1 is proposed to form a het-erodimer with NFR 5, which is missing the activation loop in the kinase domain (14). The Murase et al. work presents a new scenario in which receptor kinases cooperate with plasma membrane–local-ized RLCKs. Perhaps this will become a common theme in plant receptor kinase signaling and certainly would account for the large number of RLCKs and RLKs found in plant genomes (8).

40|$|Nitrogen is an {{essential}} nutrient for plant growth. In the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, root nodules are the sites of bacterial nitrogen fixation, in which atmospheric nitrogen is converted into a form that plants can utilize. While recent studies suggested an important role for the soybean (Glycine max) ecto-apyrase GS 52 in rhizobial root hair infection and root nodule formation, precisely how this protein impacts the nodulation process remains undetermined. In this study, the biochemical characteristics of the GS 52 enzyme were investigated. Computer modeling of the GS 52 apyrase structure identified key amino acid residues important for catalytic activity, which were subsequently mutagenized. Although the GS 52 enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity, its activity on pyrimidine nucleotides and diphosphate nucleotides {{was significantly higher than}} on ATP. This result was corroborated by structural modeling of GS 52, which predicted a low specificity for the adenine base within the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme. The wild-type enzyme and its inactive mutant forms were expressed in soybean roots in order to evaluate the importance of GS 52 enzymatic activity for nodulation. The results indicated a clear correlation between GS 52 enzymatic activity and nodule number. Altogether, our study indicates that the catalytic activity of the GS 52 apyrase, likely acting on extracellular nucleotides, is critical for <b>rhizobial</b> infection and <b>nodulation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rhizobia are soil {{bacteria}} {{able to fix}} atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with leguminous plants. In response to a signal cascade coded by genes of both symbiotic partners, a specific plant organ, the nodule, is formed. <b>Rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> (nod) genes trigger nodule formation through the synthesis of Nod factors, a family of chitolipooligo-saccharides that are specifically recognized by the host plant at the first stages of the nodulation process. Here, we present the organization and sequence of the common nod genes from Rhizobium galegae, a symbiotic member of the Rhizobiaceae. This species has an intriguing phylogenetic position, being symbiotic among pathogenic agro-bacteria, which induce tumors instead of nodules in plant shoots or roots. This apparent incongruence raises special interest in {{the origin of the}} symbiotic apparatus of R. galegae. Our analysis of DNA sequence data indicated that the organization of the common nod gene region of R. galegae was similar to that of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum, with nodIJ downstream of nodABC and the regulatory nodD gene closely linked to the common nod operon. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses of the nod gene sequences showed a close relationship especially between the common nodA sequences of R. galegae, S. meliloti, and R. leguminosarum biovars viciae and trifolii. This relationship in structure and sequence contrasts with the phylogeny based on 16 S rRNA, which groups R. galegae close to agrobacteria and separate from most other rhizobia. The topology of the nodA tree was {{similar to that of the}} corresponding host plant tree. Taken together, these observations indicate that lateral nod gene transfer occurred from fast-growing rhizobia toward agrobacteria, after which the symbiotic apparatus evolved under host plant constraint...|$|E
40|$|Isoflavonoid signal {{molecules}} from soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) {{seed and}} root exudate induce the transcription of nodulation (nod) genes in Bradyrhizobium japonicum. In this study, a new compound with symbiotic activity was isolated from soybean root exudate. The isolated 2 ', 4 ', 4 -trihydroxychalcone (isoliquir-itigenin) {{is characterized by}} its strong inducing activity for the nod genes of B. japonicum. These genes are already induced at concentrations 1 order of magnitude below those required of the previously described isoflavonoid inducers genistein and daidzein. Isoliquiritigenin is also a potent inducer of glyceollin resistance in B. japonicum, which renders this bacterium insensitive to potentially bactericidal concentrations of glyceollin, the phytoalexin of G. max. No chemotactic effect of isoliquiritigenin was observed. The highly efficient induction of nod genes and glyceollin resistance by isoliquiritigenin suggests the ecological significance of this compound, {{although it is not}} a major flavonoid constituent of the soybean root exudate in quantitative terms. The interaction between legumes and bacteria of the genera Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium results in the forma-tion of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. One early event in this interaction is the induction of <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> genes (nod genes), which is mediated via the nodD gene product (for a review, see references 14 and 17). As a result of the nod gene induction, a nodulation factor (Nod factor) is produced by the bacterial symbiont, which in turn elicits root hair deformation, cortical cell devision, and nodule formation by the legume (32). Besides the well-characterized flavonoid inducers in all rhizobial systems (for a review, see references 17 and 29), further inducing compounds not belonging to this class of phenolic compounds have been identified by recent work; e. g., for Bradyrhizobium japoni-cum, a broad spectrum of diverse inducers was character...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: More than 80 % of all {{terrestrial}} plant species establish an arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis with Glomeromycota fungi. This plant-microbe interaction primarily improves phosphate uptake, but also supports nitrogen, mineral, and water aquisition. During the pre-contact stage, the AM symbiosis is controled by {{an exchange of}} diffusible factors from either partner. Amongst others, fungal signals were identified as a mix of sulfated and non-sulfated lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs), being structurally related to <b>rhizobial</b> <b>nodulation</b> (Nod) -factor LCOs that in legumes induce the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. LCO signals are transduced via a common symbiotic signaling pathway (CSSP) that activates a group of GRAS transcription factors (TFs). Using complex gene expression fingerprints as molecular phenotypes, this study primarily intended {{to shed light on}} the importance of the GRAS TFs NSP 1 and RAM 1 for LCO-activated gene expression during pre-symbiotic signaling. RESULTS: We investigated the genome-wide transcriptional responses in 5 days old primary roots of the Medicago truncatula wild type and four symbiotic mutants to a 6 h challenge with LCO signals supplied at 10 (- 7 /- 8) M. We were able to show that during the pre-symbiotic stage, sulfated Myc-, non-sulfated Myc-, and Nod-LCO-activated gene expression almost exclusively depends on the LysM receptor kinase NFP and is largely controled by the CSSP, although responses independent of this pathway exist. Our results show that downstream of the CSSP, gene expression activation by Myc-LCOs supplied at 10 (- 7 /- 8) M strictly required both the GRAS transcription factors RAM 1 and NSP 1, whereas those genes either co- or specifically activated by Nod-LCOs displayed a preferential NSP 1 -dependency. RAM 1, a central regulator of root colonization by AM fungi, controled genes activated by non-sulfated Myc-LCOs during the pre-symbiotic stage that are also up-regulated in areas with early physical contact, e. g. hyphopodia and infecting hyphae; linking responses to externally applied LCOs with early root colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Since both RAM 1 and NSP 1 were essential for the pre-symbiotic transcriptional reprogramming by Myc-LCOs, we propose that downstream of the CSSP, these GRAS transcription factors act synergistically in the transduction of those diffusible signals that pre-announce the presence of symbiotic fungi.

In this work, several MAPKs were detected by immunobloting in roots and nodules of Lupinus albus produced by inoculation with Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lupinus). In vitro kinase assays showed that inoculation of seedling roots with B. sp. (Lupinus) activates salt stressinducible and stress-activated MAPKs after 5 min of incubation. By contrast, inoculation with dead B. sp. (Lupinus) or the heterologous bacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti did not induce salt stress-inducible and stress-activated MAPK activities. In vivo experiments showed that inoculation with B. sp. (Lupinus) induced the activation of MAPKs in roots.

Methods: A greenhouse experiment was performed to evaluate the effect of 11 <b>rhizobial</b> strains on <b>nodulation</b> and growth of three S. Senegal provenances in two field soils, differing in nutrient status and indigenous rhizobia. After 4 months, plants were harvested for determination of nodulation, shoot and root dryweight. Results: Nodulation and growth of S. Senegal varied in relation to rhizobial strain, provenance, soil type, and their interactions. Generally, nodulation was higher in Dahra than Goudiry soils, while Makueni provenance was the most compatible host. Inoculation had a significant effect on all parameters measured in Dahra field soil. By contrast, inoculation had a significant effect on height (shoot length), and shoot, root and total dry matter but not on nodulation. In the two field soils, seed provenance effect was significant for all parameters measured. The interaction between inoculation and provenance showed a significant effect on all parameters measured except nodule number in Dahra field soil while in Goudiry, the interaction had a significant effect on seedling height and shoot, root, and total dry matter but this effect was not significant with nodulation parameters. Conclusions: S. Senegal is variable in its response to inoculation, it is therefore advantageous to select and match effective rhizobia-provenance symbionts for each site. ...|$|R

On top of this, it was also observed a slight reduction of NN and NDW due to inoculation {{as compared to the}} uninoculated treatment (Fig.  1 a, b). Similar result was previously observed by Msumali and Kipe-Nolt, [36], when indigenous rhizobia may have been more potent than inoculated Rhizobium strain. On the other hand, for soil having high rhizobial population, the 20  kg N ha− 1 treatment alone gave the highest NN, although without significant difference from that obtained with either Rhizobium inoculation alone or 40  kg N ha− 1 alone or inoculation applied with 20  kg N ha− 1. Moreover, the highest NDW were obtained from Rhizobium inoculation applied either alone or in combination with 20  kg N ha− 1. In general, it was observed a slight increment of NN and a remarkable improvement of NDW due to inoculation, as compared to the uninoculated treatments with corresponding rates of N (Fig.  1 a, b). Similar to this finding, a significant improvement of nodulation due to inoculation in soil with > 1000 rhizobial population was observed by Hungria et al. [17]. Inoculation together with a 20  kg N ha− 1 treatment resulted in the highest NDW at soil with low and high rhizobial population. While the 20  kg N ha− 1 treatment alone gave the highest NDW in soil with medium rhizobial population. The highest NN produced in soil with low, medium and high rhizobial population were 161.67, 146.67 and 206.00, respectively. These various NN in different soil types could be attributed to different number of rhizobia present in these three soil types. Similarly, Patrick and Lowther [37] found that the size of <b>rhizobial</b> population affects <b>nodulation.</b> Previous work confirmed that the largest the soil native rhizobial population, the greater is the nodulation [38].

There was substantial specificity within the African clovers for effective <b>nodulation.</b> <b>Rhizobial</b> strains from the South American perennial T. polymorphum or from the African clovers were unable to nodulate subterranean clover effectively. Also, 7 of the 17 strains from these regions were unable to form nodules with the less promiscuous Mediterranean annual clovers, T. glanduliferum and T. isthmocarpum. Fifty-three of about 400 cross-inoculation treatments examined, which included annual and perennial clovers, were incapable of forming nodules, while only 65 formed effective nodules. There are 2 barriers to effective nodulation: a ‘geographic’ barrier representing the broad centres of clover diversity, across which few host-strain combinations were effective; and, within each region, a significant ‘phenological’ barrier between annual and perennial species. Clovers and their rhizobia from within the Euro–Mediterranean region of diversity were more able to cross the phenological barrier than genotypes from the other regions. It appears that only the relatively promiscuous clovers, whether annual or perennial, have been commercialised to date. The data indicate that, for perennial clovers, it will be a substantial challenge to develop inocula that do not adversely affect N 2 fixation by subterranean clover and other annual clovers available commercially, especially if the perennial clovers were originally from Africa or America. Some future strategies for development of inoculants for clovers are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{nitrogen}} (N) fixing legumes and mycorrhizal inoculants {{have the potential}} to reduce the effects of limiting soil N and phosphorus (P) levels in agricultural soils. In New Zealand, lucerne is used for direct grazing and hay making and it is recommended that rhizobia (Ensifer meliloti) and P be added to this crop for maximum production. The specific objectives of this thesis were to test under different soil N and P availability: 1) The effectiveness of Ensifer meliloti rhizobial inoculum and four strains of Rhizobium sp. isolated from lucerne in New Zealand on growth of lucerne. 2) The effectiveness of commercial vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizas on growth of lucerne. 3) The interaction between rhizobial and mycorrhizal inoculant on growth of lucerne. In pots, Ensifer meliloti increased, but Rhizobium sp. isolated from New Zealand soils decreased, lucerne total plant dry matter. It seems likely that under field conditions, competition between Ensifer meliloti in the inoculum and less effective indigenous soil <b>rhizobial</b> strains for <b>nodulation</b> can reduce the efficiency of the inoculum. Addition of N and P with Ensifer meliloti both increased lucerne total plant dry matter but shoot crude protein, dry matter digestibility and metabolisable energy were not affected. Plants relying solely on N 2 fixation had around 90 % total dry matter of plants on optimum soil N indicating that there is little benefits of adding N to lucerne if it is adequately nodulated. Addition of P is required in low P soils to achieve high production.   Under field conditions, addition of mycorrhizal inoculum or 16 kg P/ha gave similar increased dry matter yield but addition of rhizobial inoculant did not affect yield. It seems likely that there were already high populations of rhizobia in the soil before rhizobial inoculation as plants sampled from uninoculated plots showed substantial nodulation. Thus, the effect of additional rhizobia was negated. Overall, similar yield increases of lucerne with mycorrhizas and added 16 kg P/ha is an important finding. The potential of mycorrhizas as a mechanism to reduce P inputs into lucerne crops warrants further testing under different soils and agricultural systems in New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Lotononis s. l. is a legume clade {{within the}} Crotalarieae tribe, with a {{centre of origin}} in South Africa. After taxonomic revision, the three genera Listia, Leobordea and Lotononis s. str. are now recognised. The N 2 -fixing {{symbiosis}} between Listia bainesii and pigmented Methylobacterium rhizobia {{is known to be}} highly specific, while a recent study has shown that Listia angolensis is effectively nodulated by a novel lineage of root nodule bacteria. The symbiotic relationships of Lotononis s. l. species outside the Listia genus have not yet been examined. The work presented in this thesis sought to determine the identity of rhizobia isolated from Listia, Leobordea and Lotononis s. str. hosts, to examine the phylogeny of their nodA genes and to quantify the nodulation and N 2 fixation capabilities of Lotononis s. l. - associated rhizobia on eight taxonomically diverse Lotononis s. l. hosts. Additionally, this research sought to examine the processes of infection and nodule initiation in L. angolensis and L. bainesii and to validly name and characterise the novel L. angolensis rhizobia. Amplification and sequencing of nearly full length fragments of the 16 S rRNA gene showed that the rhizobia isolated from nodules of Lotononis s. l. species were phylogenetically diverse. Strains isolated from Leobordea and Lotononis s. str. hosts were most closely related to Bradyrhizobium spp., Ensifer meliloti, Mesorhizobium tianshanense and Methylobacterium nodulans. The Listia angolensis microsymbionts, together with closely related Lupinus texensis rhizobia, were identified as novel species of the Alphaproteobacterial genus Microvirga. The xiii phylogeny of the nodA genes correlated more with the rhizobial 16 S rRNA genes than with the taxonomy of the host plants. The nodulation and effectiveness trials confirmed the symbiotic specificity of the genus Listia. L. bainesii nodulated only with the representative pigmented Methylobacterium strain WSM 2598. As measured by plant shoot dry weight, this symbiosis was highly effective. L. angolensis was effectively nodulated only by Microvirga rhizobia, but formed ineffective nodules with the pigmented Methylobacterium and M. nodulans strains. WSM 2598 was effective only on Listia species (other than L. angolensis). In contrast, the Microvirga strain WSM 3557 was partially effective on some Leobordea and Lotononis s. str. species. No clear pattern of symbiotic association was seen in the Leobordea and Lotononis s. str. hosts. Nodulation in these species was usually promiscuous and often ineffective for N 2 fixation. The nodules formed on Listia species were lupinoid, whereas the nodules of Leobordea and Lotononis s. str. species were indeterminate. Micrographs of all sectioned nodules, whether lupinoid or indeterminate, showed a mass of central, uniformly infected tissue, with no uninfected interstitial cells. <b>Rhizobial</b> infection and <b>nodulation</b> in L. angolensis and L. bainesii did not appear to involve root hair curling or the development of infection threads. Nodule organogenesis followed a process similar to that observed in Lupinus species, with nodule primordia developing in the outer cortex. The polyphasic characterisation of the Microvirga rhizobia associated with Listia angolensis and Lupinus texensis resulted in the description of three new rhizobial species: Microvirga lotononidis, M. zambiensis and M. lupini. Microvirga species possess several phenotypic properties that are unusual in rhizobia, including the ability to grow at relatively elevated temperatures and the presence of pigmentation in most strains. The rhizobial Microvirga strains WSM 3557 T and Lut 6 T have been included in the Genomic Encyclopedia for Bacteria and Archaea Root Nodule Bacteria (GEBA-RNB) sequencing project (Kyrpides & Reeve, collaborative CSI project ([URL] and should provide new insights into the evolution of and genomic architecture required for rhizobial symbionts...|$|R
