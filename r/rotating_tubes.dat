40|$|The {{technique}} of Abrams and Sollner for {{the preparation of}} electropositive dried protamine collodion membranes has been improved. Porous collodion membranes cast {{on the outside of}} <b>rotating</b> <b>tubes</b> are treated for 48 hours with a solution of 2 per cent protamine sulfate buffered at pH 11. After being washed thoroughly the membranes are dried in air for several hours, soaked in water for several hours, and removed from the tubes. Further drying in air but without support shrinks the membranes slightly. The resulting membranes are designated "permselective" or "megapermselective" protamine collodion membranes. These membranes regularly give characteristic concentration potentials of – 52 to – 53 mv. and (in 0. 1 M KCl) resistance of 0. 5 to 15 ohms per membrane of 50 cm. 2 area. This resistance is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the conventional dyestuff- and alkaloid-impregnated positive membranes. The megapermselective protamine collodion membranes can be kept either dry or in water for prolonged periods without detectable deterioration. They are quite smooth, have a regular shape, and stand considerable handling without breakage. The megapermselective protamine collodion membranes are the electropositive analogues of the electronegative megapermselective collodion membranes described by Carr and Sollner...|$|E

Avalanches provide a mechanism for the stretching and folding needed to mix granular solids. However, unlike fluids, when particles dissimilar in size, density, or shape flow, they can spontaneously demix or segregate. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we track the transport of granular solids in a slowly <b>rotating</b> <b>tube</b> both with and without segregation effects. Compared with experiments in a 2 -dimensional rotating disk partially filled with colored particles, the mixing kinematics and the granular pattern formation in a tube are changed by an axial flow instability.

However, few data are available regarding interfacial tension between polymers due to experimental difficulties. Two devices, one based on the pendant drop method and another based on the spinning drop method, were constructed in this work to conduct an experimental study of interfacial tension between polymers. With both instruments, it was possible to view the drop in real time and to calculate the interfacial tension on-line. The following aspects were considered: special syringe design, the necking and capillary effects, in the pendant drop method, and sealing of the <b>rotating</b> <b>tubes</b> and density measurement in the spinning drop method. The two devices were shown to be reliable and complementary. A method to infer interfacial tension from transient measurements was suggested. Interfacial tension was measured for different polymer pairs. The effects of temperature, molecular weight, bimodal blending and molecular weight distribution were evaluated. The effect of adding compatibilizers was also studied. Surface analysis of the interfaces was performed using E. S. CA. to explain the experimental results. The experimental results were compared with the predictions of lattice theories and the square gradient theory. A strategy to evaluate the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter between polymers was developed. When this strategy was employed, theoretical predictions and experimental data showed good agreement for the influence of temperature and molecular weight on interfacial tension.

The tremendous growth of this country has created serious waste treatment problems, which pose a serious threat to our water resources and our health.

In many cases the solution to disposal is combined industrial and municipal waste treatment. In some instances, the effect of an industrial waste on standard sewage treatment facilities is not known. Such a waste is produced in the manufacture and use of "ammonium perchlorate. " Ammonium perchlorate is an important oxidizer used in the manufacture of rocket propellants in the missile industry.

To date, automated ways to induce activity have been predominantly described in rodent models. To study the impact of activity on behavior and survival in adult Drosophila melanogaster, we aimed to develop a <b>rotating</b> <b>tube</b> device “swing boat” which is capable of monitoring activity and sleep patterns as well as survival rates of flies. For {{the purpose of a}} first application, we tested our device on a transgenic fly model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Activity of flies was recorded in a climate chamber using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) System connected to data acquisition software. Locomotor activity was induced by a <b>rotating</b> <b>tube</b> device “swing boat” by repetitively tilting the tubes for 30 min per day. A non-exercising group of flies was used as control and activity and sleep patterns were obtained. The GAL 4 -/UAS system was used to drive pan-neuronal expression of human Aβ 42 in flies. Immunohistochemical stainings for Aβ 42 were performed on paraffin sections of adult fly brains. Daily rotation of the fly tubes evoked a pronounced peak of activity during the 30 min exercise period. Pan-neuronal expression of human Aβ 42 in flies caused abnormalities in locomotor activity, reduction of life span and elevated sleep fragmentation in comparison to wild type flies. Furthermore, the formation of amyloid accumulations was observed in the adult fly brain. Gently induced activity over 12 days did not evoke prominent effects in wild type flies but resulted in prolongation of median survival time by 7 days (32. 6 %) in Aβ 42 -expressing flies. Additionally, restoration of abnormally decreased night time sleep (10 %) and reduced sleep fragmentation (28 %) were observed compared to non-exercising Aβ 42 -expressing flies. On a structural level no prominent effects regarding prevalence of amyloid aggregations and Aβ 42 RNA expression were detected following activity induction.

Consequently, even if a <b>tube</b> <b>rotating</b> around a parallel axis is heated with high heat flux whose level causes a laminarizing flow in the stationary tube case, both the turbulent kinetic energy and the temperature variance remain over the pipe cross section, resulting in the suppression of an attenuation in heat transfer performance.

The water and foulants are obtained from various natural and process sources and have irregular fluid properties. The fouling eventually obstructs flow on {{the shell side}} of the heat exchanger {{to such an extent}} that the tube bundles have to be replaced every nine months. Sasol requested that certain aspects of this issue be addressed. To better understand the problem, the effects of various tube and baffle configurations on the sedimentation rate in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger were numerically investigated. Single-segmental, double-segmental and disc-and-doughnut baffle configurations, in combination with square and <b>rotated</b> triangular <b>tube</b> configurations, were simulated by using the CFD software package, STAR-CCM+. In total, six configurations were investigated. The solution methodology was divided into two parts. Firstly, steady-state solutions of the six configurations were used to identify the best performing model in terms of large areas with high velocity flow. The results identified both single-segmental baffle configurations to have the best performance. Secondly, transient multiphase simulations were conducted to investigate the sedimentation characteristics of the two single-segmental baffle configurations. It was established that the current state of available technology cannot adequately solve the detailed simulations in a reasonable amount of time and results could only be obtained for a time period of a few seconds. By simulating the flow fields for various geometries in steady-state conditions, many of the observations and findings of literature were verified. The single-segmental baffle configurations have higher pressure drops than double-segmental and disc-and-doughnut configurations. In similar fashion, the <b>rotated</b> triangular <b>tube</b> configuration has a higher pressure drop than the square arrangement. The single-segmental configurations have on average higher flow velocities and reduced cross-flow mass flow fractions. It was concluded from this study that the single-segmental baffle with <b>rotated</b> triangular <b>tube</b> configuration had the best steady-state performance. Some results were extracted from the transient multiphase simulations. The transient multiphase flow simulation of the single-segmental baffle configurations showed larger concentrations of stagnant sediment for the <b>rotated</b> triangular <b>tube</b> configuration versus larger concentrations of suspended/flowing sediment in the square tube configuration. This result was offset by the observation that the downstream movement of sediment was quicker for the <b>rotated</b> triangular <b>tube</b> configuration.
