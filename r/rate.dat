5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest <b>rate</b> parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest <b>rate</b> parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward <b>rate</b> is an unbiased predictor of the future spot <b>rate.</b> This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest <b>rate</b> parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest <b>rate</b> parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest <b>rate</b> parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange <b>rate.</b> This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a model of}} a <b>rating</b> agency with multiple clients, in which each client has a separate market that forms a belief {{about the quality of the}} client after the agency issues a <b>rating.</b> When the clients are <b>rated</b> separately (individual <b>rating),</b> the credibility of a good <b>rating</b> in an inflationary equilibrium of the signaling game is limited by the incentive of the agency to exaggerate the quality of the client. In centralized <b>rating,</b> the agency <b>rates</b> all clients together and shares the <b>rating</b> information among all markets. This allows the agency to coordinate the ratings and achieve a higher average level of credibility for its good ratings than in individual <b>rating.</b> In decentralized <b>rating,</b> the ratings are again shared among all markets, but each client is <b>rated</b> by a self-interested rater of the agency with no access to the quality information of other clients. When the underlying qualities of the clients are correlated, decentralized <b>rating</b> leads to a smaller degree of <b>rating</b> inflation and hence a greater level of credibility than in individual <b>rating.</b> Comparing centralized <b>rating</b> with decentralized <b>rating,</b> we find that centralized <b>rating</b> dominates decentralized <b>rating</b> for the agency when the underlying qualities are weakly correlated, but the reverse holds when the qualities are strongly correlated.

5|$|Interest <b>rate</b> parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest <b>rate</b> parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest <b>rate</b> parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest <b>rate,</b> exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest <b>rate,</b> due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest <b>rate</b> parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest <b>rate</b> parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest <b>rate</b> parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange <b>rate</b> risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange <b>rate</b> and the future spot exchange <b>rate.</b>|$|E
