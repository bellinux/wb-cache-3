40|$|Connexin 37 (Cx 37), profoundly {{suppresses}} {{the growth}} of rat insulinoma (Rin) cells and requires a functional channel. To determine if the CT is necessary for Cx 37 -mediated growth suppression, a series of deletions and mutations affecting the availability of putative phosphorylation sites {{in the region of}} 273 - 333 of Cx 37 were generated. Truncation at P 273 alleviated the growth suppressive effect of Cx 37 while <b>retaining</b> <b>channel</b> functionality. Interestingly, substate behavior is lost in iRin 37 - 273 tr. Based on the observation of run-down behavior in Cx 37 -wt channels consistent with dialysis of PKC, TPA and BIM treatment of Cx 37 - wt channels revealed that PKC activation generates a higher incidence of high conductance channels whereas BIM treatment results in the converse. Exploiting this observation, a S-Ax 3 mutation targeting known MAPK and PKC sites aligned from Cx 43, was generated. However, channels are able to reside in the sub-conductance state and cells are anti-proliferative. Four additional serine to alanine mutations at putative phosphorylation sites (> 90 %) were made to generate an S 7 A mutation and did not dispel the growth suppressive effect of Cx 37. A phosphomimetic S 7 D mutation appears to induce cell death. Based on these data, it appears that substate behavior regulated by the CT is indicative growth suppression by Cx 37...|$|E

40|$|Background. Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} {{frequent}} primary malignant bone cancer. The natural history of osteosarcoma is sill mostly unknown and genetic complexity is a hallmark of high grade osteosarcoma so that, currently, no ideal target has been identified. Several efforts are thus in progress to identify new biomarkers as possible targets of efficacious therapies, especially in counteracting pathologic bone remodelling and alleviating associated pain. The P 2 X 7 receptor (P 2 X 7 R), a receptor for extracellular ATP widely distributed in human tissues, has recently {{been shown to have}} a central role in carcinogenesis, as it enhances in vivo tumor cell growth and cancer-associated angiogenesis (Adinolfi E et al, Cancer Res. 2012) as well as in vitro cancer cell invasiveness (Adinolfi E et al, FASEB J. 2010). P 2 X 7 R activity is tightly regulated by extracellular ATP. Indeed, low ATP levels induce the ion channel formation, whereas higher concentrations (nM) provoke opening of a pore permeable to high molecular mass molecules. Among the nine different naturally occurring splice variants known, P 2 X 7 RA is thefull-length and full-functioning isoform, whereas P 2 X 7 RB is a shorter isoform which lacks the pore forming ability while <b>retaining</b> <b>channel</b> properties. Co-expression of the A and B isoforms in HEK 293 cells has been demonstrated to potentiate receptor functions (Adinolfi E et al, FASEB J. 2010). P 2 X 7 Rrelated intracellular signalling includes various events such as activation of NFATc 1 and PKC/MAPK pathways, as well as activation of PI 3 K/Akt signalling (Amoroso F et al, Cell Death Dis, 2012; Grol MW et al, Am J Physiol, 2012). Aim of the study. Investigate the role of A and B isoforms of the P 2 X 7 R in intracellular signaling linked to receptor activation in Te 85 human osteosarcoma cells. Methods. Te 85 osteosarcoma cells, which lack endogenous P 2 X 7 R expression, were transfected with P 2 X 7 RA and P 2 X 7 RB, separate or in combination. Proliferation was assessed as a kinetic up to 72 hours in serum starvation conditions. Intracellular calcium levels following stimulation with P 2 X 7 R agonists were measured by fluorimetry. NFATc 1 levels were assessed by ELISA on nuclear extracts. Total and phosporylated Akt were detected by WB. Results and conclusion. P 2 X 7 R expression conferred a proliferative advantage in absence of serum as shown by increased cell growth rate of all Te 85 transfectants compared to Te 85 wt. All transfected clones showed increased Ca 2 + mobilization, the highest response found in Te 85 co-transfected with both P 2 X 7 RA and B. Nuclear levels of NFATc 1 were increased in all transfectants. Finally, higher Akt phosphorylation levels were found in Te 85 -P 2 X 7 RA clones. In conclusion, P 2 X 7 R expression in osteosarcoma cells induce augmented proliferation and activation of specific intracellular signalling pathways susceptible of targeting for cancer therap...|$|E
40|$|The {{premise of}} this paper is {{investigation}} into retailer-driven agri-food supply channels. Food sector dominant UK multiple retailers have in recent years invested in close Category Management (CM) based supply channel relationships with key/ preferred suppliers (Hingley, 2004; Hingley, Lindgreen and Casswell, 2006; Sodano and Hingley, 2007). Category Management allows a nominated supplier to take greater responsibility for the entire supply chain of a given product category and aims to maximise sales and profitability through an end consumer orientation (Jarvis and Woolven, 1999) and this became universally employed by retailers in recent years (Hingley, 2005 a). However, critics such as Dapiran and Hogarth-Scott (2003) contend that the development of CM has not necessarily increased co-operation in supply chains and that it can be used by retailers to actually reinforce power and control. Some suppliers are reported as being concerned that risk is put on to the supplier and away from the retailer (Allen 2001; Hingley, 2005 a; 2005 b). Duffy et al (2003) concur, and state that CM in food supply chains has led retailers to a preference for larger suppliers who dominate a product category. UK retailers have been happy to go down the CM route as by doing so they have off-loaded a good deal of responsibility onto category lead suppliers, whilst <b>retaining</b> <b>channel</b> control (Hingley, 2005 b). Most of these retailers have developed a 'super middleman' hub of CM suppliers, based on suppliers’ undertaking centralised activities (taking lead on volume, quality and technical, innovation etc) on behalf of their retailer (Hingley, 2005 a). This has built a (not necessarily mutual) reliance and enhanced the role of key CM partner suppliers. However, despite the benefits of CM, its infrastructure has a good deal of central control cost and overhead. The core {{purpose of this study is}} to establish whether CM has run its course and perhaps circumstances are again evolving towards a leaner, and more direct sourcing philosophy; where stripped-down suppliers can gain a direct route to multiple retailers? The context for this premise is derived from ongoing price pressures in the channel management of what are essentially low value fresh commodities. Such pressure on cost/ price may lead retailers to develop a slimmed down and more direct supply route for many fresh products. In addition to this, supplier criticism and discussion of the more negative aspects of the approach has led retailers to reappraise the future of CM. Further, perhaps retailers no longer require such a close 'relationship' with suppliers (given that the supplier quality/ integrity issues and protocols that initiated such an approach are well established and can be covered by freelance outsourced agents) ? For the purpose {{of this paper}}, the investigation is preliminary and qualitative, based on depth interviews with members of a fresh produce supplier/ intermediary (sourcing produce widely from around Europe). To follow, further empirical studies will be undertaken using a larger number of semi-structured interviews with key multiple retailer fresh produce Category Managers and CM suppliers in the UK. retail supply networks, category management, innovation, fresh produce, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Industrial Organization,...|$|E

40|$|P 2 X 7 is a bifunctional {{receptor}} (P 2 X 7 R) for extracellular ATP that, {{depending on}} the level of activation, forms a cation-selective channel or a large conductance nonselective pore. The P 2 X 7 R has a strong proapoptotic activity but can also support growth. Here, we describe the mechanism involved in growth stimulation. Transfection of P 2 X 7 R increases resting mitochondrial potential (� � mt), basal mitochondrial Ca 2 � ([Ca 2 �] mt), intracellular ATP content, and confers ability to grow in the absence of serum. These changes require a full pore-forming function, because they are abolished in cells transfected with a mutated P 2 X 7 R that <b>retains</b> <b>channel</b> activity but cannot form the nonselective pore, and depend on an autocrine/paracrine tonic stimulation by secreted ATP. On the other hand, sustained stimulation of P 2 X 7 R causes a � � mt drop, a large increase in [Ca 2 �] mt, mitochondrial fragmentation, and cell death.
