5|$|The {{surge of}} air travellers, catalyzed by {{low-cost}} carriers {{and the rise}} of air-transport demands among Indonesia's <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> has put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities, such as the construction of Medan's brand-new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and accident-prone Polonia Airport. Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport, replacing the old Selaparang Airport in Lombok; and Minangkabau Airport, replacing the old Tabing Airport in Padang. Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Juanda Airport in Surabaya, and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar. There are plans to build a second Bali airport in Kubu Tambahan near Singaraja, northern Bali, a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the crowded and overwhelmed Adisutjipto Airport, and Kertajati Airport in Kertajati, Majalengka, to replace Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon. To improve transportation interconnectivity, the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers. Currently, only Kuala Namu and Adisutjipto airports have a railway connection to the city center, while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno–Hatta and Minangkabau airports.|$|E

25|$|The North Vietnamese {{population}} {{was similar to}} the North Korean population in that foreign broadcasting or publications was prohibited in the country. In contrast, the South Vietnamese population saw a <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> that became increasingly Westernized, maintaining some of the French cultural and social trends of the colonial period and increasingly becoming influenced by American cultural trends as well.|$|E
50|$|Germany's expansionism {{would lead}} to the Tirpitz Plan, {{implemented}} by Admiral von Tirpitz, who would also champion the various Fleet Acts starting in 1898, thus engaging in an arms race with Britain. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly three-fifths the size of the Royal Navy). According to von Tirpitz, this aggressive naval policy was supported by the National Liberal Party rather than by the conservatives, implying that imperialism was supported by the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{greatest}} {{success of}} the Reformers was the Reform Act 1832, which provided the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> with more political power in urban areas, while lessening the representation of areas of England undisturbed by the Industrial Revolution. [...] Despite determined resistance from the House of Lords to the Bill, this Act gave more parliamentary power to the liberals, while reducing the political force of the working class, leaving them detached from {{the main body of}} <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> support on which they had relied. Having achieved the Reform Act of 1832, the Radical alliance was broken until the Liberal-Labour alliance of the Edwardian period.|$|R

25|$|In {{the history}} of the art of the Chinese empire, jade has had a special significance, {{comparable}} with that of gold and diamonds in the West. Jade was used for the finest objects and cult figures, and for grave furnishings for high-ranking members of the imperial family. Due to that significance and the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in China, today the finest jade when found in nuggets of “mutton fat” jade – so-named for its marbled white consistency – can sell for $3,000 an ounce, a tenfold increase from a decade ago.|$|E
25|$|Under Queen Victoria's rule, England {{enjoyed a}} period of {{economic}} growth along with technological advancement. Mass production of sewing machines in the 1850s {{as well as the}} advent of synthetic dyes introduced major changes in fashion. Clothing could be made quicker and more cheaply. Advancement in printing and proliferation of fashion magazines allowed the masses to participate in the evolving trends of high fashion, opening the market of mass consumption and advertising. By 1905, clothing was increasingly factory made and often sold in large, fixed-price department stores, spurring a new age of consumerism with the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> who benefited from the industrial revolution.|$|E
500|$|Davidson's {{principal}} theatrical genre {{was that}} of the [...] "drawing-room entertainer"; Cullen describes this kind of performance as [...] "n answer to the demand of a <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> which was neither cultured nor resourceful, but which wanted desperately to be diverted". Within a few months of leaving Whitgift in 1894, Davidson appeared on the London stage, at Steinway Hall in Lower Seymour Street, performing a comic routine. He was reasonably successful and {{in the next few years}} found provincial engagements with Masonic lodges, literary societies and similar social organisations. Cullen suggests that his greatest triumph was as a comic actor in a touring production of Brandon Thomas's popular farce Charley's Aunt. Davidson played the part of Lord Fancourt Babberley, who masquerades as the rich aunt of a fellow-Oxford undergraduate—a frenetic role for which Cullen believes Davidson was eminently suitable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relatively}} {{free flow of}} information transcends borders and induced a sharp rise in Renaissance literacy, learning and education; the circulation of (revolutionary) ideas among the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> but also the peasants, threatens the traditional power monopoly of the ruling nobility and is a key factor in the rapid spread of the Protestant Reformation. The dawn of the Gutenberg Galaxy, the era of mass communication, is instrumental in fostering the gradual democratization of knowledge which sees for the first time modern media phenomena such as the press or bestsellers emerging. [...] The prized incunables, which are testimony to the aesthetic taste and high proficient competence of Renaissance book printers, are one lasting legacy of the 15th century.|$|R

2500|$|In late 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century Paris, wealth was growing rapidly, {{and it became}} {{increasingly}} concentrated. [...] Paris from 1872 to 1927 was a [...] "rentier society". Rentiers (that is, people who relied primarily on inherited wealth) made up about 10% of the population, but owned 70% of aggregate wealth; they spent heavily on luxuries as their income from capital assets could sustain a living standard far beyond what labor income alone would permit. [...] Paris became world-famous for making consumerism a social priority and economic force, especially through its grand department stores and upscale arcades filled with luxury shops. These were [...] "dream machines" [...] that set the world standard for consumption of fine products by the upper classes {{as well as the}} <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Aristide Boucicaut, the son of a small clothing-shop owner, became partner in a variety store called Le Bon Marché in Paris in 1848. He became owner in 1852 and transformed it into the first modern department store in Paris with high-volume buying, low profit margins, seasonal sales, discounts, advertising, a mail-order catalog, and entertainment and prizes for customers, spouses and children.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{evolution}} of the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in Ecuador during the commodities boom (2005 - 2015). Using the definition of <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> proposed by López-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2014), we document an impressive <b>rise</b> of the <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> which doubled in this period and peaked at 37. 4 % of the population in 2015. A factor that has {{played an important role in}} this social change is the reduction in inequality although growth is responsible for over three-quarters of the <b>rise</b> of the <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Based on an analysis of the macroeconomic and labour conditionsassociated with {{the evolution of}} the <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> we argue that the recent slowdown in growth and reduction in inequality following the end of the commodities boom poses a risk for the size of the <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> This is a serious challenge for policy makers...|$|R

2500|$|The 2011 protests {{were the}} biggest in Russia since the 1990s, and {{surprised}} many with their scale. According to Victor Shenderovich, an opposition political commentator for radio station Ekho Moskvy, [...] "This is political, not economic. The coal miners came out {{because they were not}} paid. The people coming onto the streets of Moscow are very well off. These are people protesting because they were humiliated. They were not asked. They were just told, 'Putin is coming back.'" [...] According to Thomas L. Friedman, the New York Times columnist this humiliation of the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> is the common ground the Russian movement shares with the Arab Spring. According to the New York Times, another [...] "explanation is the high level of public corruption , which threatens new personal wealth. A second is a phenomenon seen in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's Chile, that economic growth can inadvertently undermine autocratic rule by creating an urban professional class that clamors for new political rights." [...] An additional explanation is that [...] "Putin's unilateral announcement in September that he would run again for the presidency, in effect swapping places with Mr. Medvedev" [...] contributed greatly, something some [...] "Russians now snidely refer to [...] as [...] "rokirovka" [...] – the Russian word for castling in chess".|$|E
2500|$|Europe was racked by {{two decades}} of war {{revolving}} around France's efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty. War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the Battle of Valmy (1792). The German lands saw armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation (albeit on a far lower scale than the Thirty Years' War, almost two centuries before), but also bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people. Prussia and Austria ended their failed wars with France but (with Russia) partitioned Poland among themselves in 1793 and 1795. The French {{took control of the}} Rhineland, imposed French-style reforms, abolished feudalism, established constitutions, promoted freedom of religion, emancipated Jews, opened the bureaucracy to ordinary citizens of talent, and forced the nobility to share power with the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Napoleon created the Kingdom of Westphalia (1807–1813) as a model state. These reforms proved largely permanent and modernized the western parts of Germany. When the French tried to impose the French language, German opposition grew in intensity. A Second Coalition of Britain, Russia, and Austria then attacked France but failed. Napoleon established direct or indirect control over most of western Europe, including the German states apart from Prussia and Austria. The old Holy Roman Empire {{was little more than a}} farce; Napoleon simply abolished it in 1806 while forming new countries under his control. In Germany Napoleon set up the [...] "Confederation of the Rhine," [...] comprising most of the German states except Prussia and Austria.|$|E

50|$|Gilpin wrote prolifically on {{the merits}} of touring the {{countryside}} of England. The naturally morose, craggy, pastoral, and untouched landscape of northern England and Scotland was a suitable endeavor for the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> and Gilpin thought it almost patriotic to travel the homeland instead of the historically elite tour of the great European cities. One of the major commonalities of the picturesque style movement is the role of travel and its integration in designing one’s home to enhance one's political and social standing. A simple description of the picturesque is the visual qualities of Nature suitable for a picture. However, Lockean philosophy had freed Nature from the ideal forms of allegory and classical pursuits, essentially embracing the imperfections in both landscapes and plants. In this way the idea progressed beyond the study of great landscape painters like Claude Deruet and Nicolas Poussin into experimentation with creating episodic, evocative, and contemplative landscapes in which elements were combined for their total effect as an individual picture.|$|R

40|$|Crises create {{opportunities}} to set long‐range {{goals for the}} future. A key question is that of urban mobility {{in a world in}} which the great majority of the world’s population will soon live in cities of over a million inhabitants, many of them in metropolitan conurbations. Broadly speaking, there are two possible alternatives: one, the US system of mobility centred on private, petrol‐driven cars can be ecologically modernized and expanded to embrace the globe by switching to electric‐powered cars; or, two, public transport can be ecologized and made more flexible. For historical reasons the factors determining which of these alternatives will be chosen are very different and path‐ dependent. Whereas rapid transit systems have largely disappeared from many US metropolises, European metropolises are characterized by mixed systems. In many metropolises of the southern hemisphere the car‐based mobility of the <b>rising</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> coexists with the exclusion of large sections of the city‐dwelling poor from urban mobility. Long‐term experiments with a free‐of‐charge public transport system could act as a global model...|$|R
