When this fact was pointed out to him, he yielded at once, though with a heavy heart, his eyes looking longingly towards the ring as we retreated out of the booth. We were scarcely clear of the place, when we heard [...] "God save the Queen," [...] played by the equestrian band, the signal that all was over. Our companion entertained us with scraps of the dialogue on our way home--precious crumbs of wit which he had brought away from that feast. He laughed over them again as we walked under the stars. He has them now, and takes them out of the pocket of his memory, and crunches a bit, and relishes it with a sentimental tenderness, too, for he is, no doubt, back at school by this time; the holidays are over; and Doctor Birch's young friends have reassembled.|$|E

These declarations were accepted by the court as anecdotal.

Koolaburra also quoted the New York City published Oxford English Dictionary definition of [...] "Ugg"; however, this was rejected after Deckers petitioned the Dictionary to change the definition of [...] "Ugg" [...] from [...] "a kind of soft sheepskin boot" [...] to a definition that included UGG's trademark, which the OED agreed to do. Koolaburra then argued that the UGG trademark was invalid as Brian Smith had fraudulently registered the name by giving false <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term was not generic, arguing that [...] "as an Australian citizen, Smith knew {{of the fact that the}} term Ugg was a generic term". This was rejected by the court as fraud requires an applicant to [...] "knowingly" [...] make the false representations, ruling that such belief was subjective, and finding that even if Smith knew the term was generic in Australia, he may have [...] "honestly held a good faith belief" [...] that it was not generic in the United States.|$|E
50|$|During his trial, {{prosecutors}} identified Hill as the ringleader {{in three}} interlocking mortgage fraud schemes built on metro-Atlanta real estate sales that, between 2001 and 2003, bilked lenders {{out of more}} than $40 million. According to the evidence at trial, Hill was the owner and operator of “We Build Atlanta, Inc.,” “The Estate Firm, Inc.,” “Estate Artistians ofGeorgia, Inc.,” “Estates Atlanta, Inc.,” and numerous other Georgia corporations. Hill controlled the affairs of each such corporation. Hill held himself out to be a real estate developer, and either individually or through {{one or more of the}} corporations he controlled, purchased and sold numerous residential properties in the Atlanta area. Hill oversaw the conspiracy, loan fraud, wire and mail fraud and money laundering activity related to mortgages obtained in the sale of over 50 homes and over 250 condominiums in eight Atlanta-area condominium complexes. These properties were all owned at one timeby one of the Hill entities. Each property was sold at an inflated price to a “straw purchaser” who applied for a mortgage loan based upon the inflated price. The straw purchasers who participated in these mortgage flips were paid a kick-back out of the excess loan proceeds for the use of their name and credit. The victim-lenders granted the loans based upon numerous falserepresentations and documents regarding the credit qualifications of the straw purchaser, as well as false <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> straw purchaser had paid a down payment, would reside in the home, and would be responsible for the loan payment. In addition, the lenders were induced to make the loans based on fraudulently inflated appraisals. Some of the properties were “flipped” more than one time.|$|E
