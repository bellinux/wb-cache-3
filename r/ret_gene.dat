Patients were selected from the medical records of hypertension centers. After exclusion of syndromic patients, 45 patients with familial (F+, n= 3) and sporadic (F-, n= 42) cases of isolated PHEO/PGL were considered. They included 35 patients with PHEO, 7 with PGL, and 3 with head/neck PGL (hnPGL). Three patients with PHEO (2 F-, 1 F+) presented VHL mutations (P 86 A, G 93 C, and R 167 W), six with PGL (4 F-, 2 F+) were positive for SDH or VHL mutations (SDHB R 230 G in two patients, SDHB S 8 F, R 46 Q, R 90 Q, and VHL P 81 L in one subject each), and one with hnPGL carried the SDHD 348 - 351 delGACT mutation. We have also detected missense (SDHB S 163 P, SDHD H 50 R and G 12 S), synonymous (SDHB A 6 A, SDHD S 68 S), and intronic mutations that have been considered nonpathological polymorphic variants. No mutation was found in SDHC or <b>RET</b> <b>genes.</b> Our data indicate that germline mutations of VHL and SDH subunits are not infrequent in familial {{as well as in}} sporadic cases of nonsyndromic PHEO/PGL (overall, 12 of 45 probands, 22 %).

However, the risk for achondroplasia is still considered clinically negligible.

Capitalizing on these findings, heterozygous germline mutations in the human homologue, CDKN 1 B, were searched for and identified in patients with multiple endocrine tumors. As a consequence of this discovery, a novel human MEN syndrome, named MEN 4, was recognized, which is caused by mutations in p 27. Altogether, these studies identified Cdkn 1 b/CDKN 1 B as a novel tumor susceptibility gene for multiple endocrine tumors in both rats and humans.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in genes {{encoding}} succinate dehydrogenase and its anchoring subunits (SDH genes) are at {{the origin}} of hereditary head and neck paraganglioma (PGL) and a subset of apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. METHODS: We describe a family including three patients harbouring bilateral head and neck PGL diagnosed before 25 years of age. Multiple hypervascular hepatic lesions were subsequently discovered in two of them. In both, liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PGL. In addition, in one patient, MRI disclosed multiple target-like lesions of the spine, highly suggestive of metastatic PGL. Family history was compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance with possible maternal imprinting. RESULTS: Combined single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis followed by sequencing did not show any mutation of the coding parts of SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, <b>RET</b> or VHL <b>genes.</b> Screening of copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity in the three affected family members showed no deletion or amplification of the SDH, <b>RET</b> and VHL <b>genes.</b> Furthermore, succinate dehydrogenase activity measured in a liver PGL sample was not significantly decreased in the affected patient as compared with controls, underscoring {{the exclusion of the}} SDH genes. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported family of hereditary head and neck PGL with metastatic dissemination in the liver and the spine.
