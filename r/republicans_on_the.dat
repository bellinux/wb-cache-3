5|$|His {{political}} reputation {{rose with}} his professional plaudits. Hayes declined the Republican nomination for a judgeship in 1856. Two years later, some Republicans proposed Hayes {{to fill a}} vacancy {{on the bench and}} he considered accepting the appointment until the office of city solicitor also became vacant. The city council elected Hayes as city solicitor to fill the vacancy, and he won a full two-year term from the voters in April 1859 with a larger majority than other <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ticket.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was {{due in part to}} conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and {{that he was one of}} only two <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, {{and told him that}} if he was forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to either of the two men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.|$|E

25|$|Huntington's {{city council}} members are elected to {{four-year}} terms {{at the same}} time as the mayor. There are eleven members of the council, nine of whom represent single-member districts, while the other two are elected at large. The city council has the authority to draft and debate ordinances and can override a mayoral veto with a two-thirds majority. There are currently nine Democrats and two <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city council.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater's poor showing {{pulled down}} many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who {{endorsed}} Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, {{along with many}} promising young <b>Republicans.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives {{to move up the}} ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary—they were back by 1966—Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the New Deal Coalition.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{students}} at UC Berkeley are {{generally considered to}} be less politically active than their predecessors, and far more liberal than the surrounding city of Berkeley. In a poll conducted in 2005, 51% of Berkeley freshmen considered themselves liberal, 37% considered themselves moderate, and 12% identified as conservative. 43.8% have no religious preference compared to a national average of 17.6%. In 1982, 20.8% identified as conservative, 32.9% identified as liberals, and 46.4% identified as moderate. Although Republicans are in the minority, the Berkeley College Republicans is the largest political organization on campus. Democrats outnumber <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> faculty by a ratio of nine to one, leading to some conservative student criticism of the faculty for teaching with a liberal bias.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{there was}} much {{confusion}} among <b>republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground; Martin McGuinness for example, joined the Official IRA in 1970, unaware {{that there had been}} a split and only later joined the Provisionals. The Provisionals eventually extended their armed campaign from defence of Catholic areas. Despite the reluctance of Cathal Goulding and the OIRA leadership, their volunteers on the ground were inevitably drawn into the violence. The Official IRA's first major confrontation with the British Army came in the Falls Curfew of July 1970, when over 3,000 British soldiers raided the Lower Falls area for arms, leading to three days of gun battles. The Official IRA lost a large amount of weaponry, and their members on the ground blamed the Provisionals for starting the firing and then leaving them alone to face the British. The bad feeling left by this and other incidents led to a feud between the two IRAs in 1970, with several shootings carried out by either side. The two IRA factions arranged a truce between them after the OIRA killing of Provisional activist, and Belfast brigade D-Company commander, Charlie Hughes (a cousin of the well-known Provisional Brendan Hughes).|$|E

He proposed {{the establishment of a}} Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct in July 1964 and was named to that committee in July 1965. Also in 1965, he was chosen advisor to the United States delegation to the Manila Conference that established the Asian Development Bank.|$|E

500|$|Kantrowitz deemed Tillman [...] "the Senate's wild man", {{who applied}} the same {{techniques}} of accusation and insinuation that had {{served him well}} in South Carolina. In 1897, Tillman accused the Republicans, [...] "I certainly {{do not want to}} attack any member of the committee who does not deserve to be attacked [...] nobody denies that there have been rooms occupied for two months by the <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Senate Finance Committee at the Arlington Hotel... in easy reach of the sugar trust". Simkins, though, opined that Tillman's speeches in the Senate were only inflammatory because of his injection of personalities, and if that is disregarded, his speeches, when read, come across as well-reasoned and even conservative.|$|E
500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|Berkeley gained {{worldwide}} {{reputation for}} student activism in the 1960s with the Free Speech Movement of 1964 {{and opposition to}} the Vietnam War. In the highly publicized People's Park protest in 1969, students and the school conflicted over use of a plot of land; the National Guard was called in and violence erupted. Then governor of California Ronald Reagan called the Berkeley campus [...] "a haven for communist sympathizers, protesters, and sex deviants". Modern students at Berkeley are less politically active, with {{a greater percentage of}} moderates and conservatives.

He built the stronger coalition, holding together conservative and moderate Republicans, and War Democrats, against the Radicals who wanted to deny him renomination in 1864. When the war was ending Lincoln planned to reintegrate the white South into the union as soon as possible by offering generous peace terms, [...] "with malice toward none, with charity toward all". But when Lincoln was assassinated, the Radicals gained the upper hand and imposed much harsher terms than those Lincoln had wished.|$|E
2500|$|The Republicans {{who could}} not escape Málaga were either shot or imprisoned. After the fall of Malaga, the Nationalists {{executed}} 4,000 Republicans only in the city itself.

The Nationalists {{caught up with the}} fleeing <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to Almería and shot the men, but let the women continue so as to put the burden of feeding them on the Republican government. Paul Preston said: [...] "The crowds of refugees who blocked the road out of Malaga had been in an inferno. They were shelled from the sea, bombed from the air and then machine-gunned. The scale of the repression inside the fallen city explained why they were ready to run the gauntlet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Governor Patton re{{appointed}} Baker to the Council on Postsecondary Education in 2001 and Democratic Governor Steve Beshear {{appointed him}} again on December 28, 2007. The appointment was not {{confirmed by the}} Kentucky General Assembly, however, which cited a statute requiring the Council's makeup of Democrats and Republicans to reflect the parties' proportion of voter registrations. Baker's appointment would have created an over-representation of <b>Republicans</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Council. Further, Council members were limited by statute to two terms, although Beshear said his understanding was that partial terms would not count against the limit. Because of these issues, Baker resigned from the Council on February 26, 2008, saying [...] "I hope it doesn't conclude my public service, but it severs all connection to state government at the present." [...] During the 2008 presidential election, he was a presidential elector for Republican candidate John McCain.|$|E
