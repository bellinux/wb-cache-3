5000|$|Pars triangularis {{has been}} shown to have a role in {{cognitive}} control of memory. There are more ways than one to <b>remember</b> <b>something.</b> When a person remembers, (s)he retrieves information from storage in a memory center of the brain. This information may be the muscle contraction sequence for shoe-tying, the face of a loved one, or anything in between. When someone <b>remembers</b> <b>something</b> automatically, without concentrating on it and without trying, it is called [...] "bottom-up" [...] processing. But sometimes, people really have to struggle to <b>remember</b> <b>something.</b> A student taking a test and trying to remember the answer to a question is concentrating their attention on retrieving the memory. The student is exhibiting cognitive control over their memory. This type of processing is directed, in part, by the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Pars triangularis is found in this region.|$|R
