5|$|Many riders used normal <b>road</b> <b>race</b> bikes {{for this}} stage, as {{the course is}} highly {{atypical}} for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. Most of those riders altered their <b>road</b> <b>race</b> bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E
