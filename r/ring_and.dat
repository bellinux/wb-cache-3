5|$|In the {{following}} match, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) defended their WWF Tag Team Championship against The Mega-Maniacs (Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake). Beefcake wore a protective titanium facemask {{because of his}} injured face, and Hulk Hogan came to the ring with a black eye, which led the announcers to speculate about the cause. Money Inc. gained the early advantage, but DiBiase soon injured himself by hitting Beefcake's mask. Hogan and Beefcake brawled with their enemies and controlled the match until Money Inc. was counted out. Referee Earl Hebner announced, however, that he would strip them of their title {{if they did not}} return to the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> continue the match. DiBiase returned to the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> rendered Hogan unconscious with the Million Dollar Dream chokehold. Beefcake attacked DiBiase by applying a sleeper hold and then turned his attention to Schyster, but DiBiase hit him in the back with Schyster's briefcase. Money Inc. attacked Beefcake and removed his facemask, but Beefcake fought back and applied a sleeper hold to Schyster. The referee was accidentally knocked unconscious, and Hogan recovered and attacked both members of Money Inc. with Beefcake's facemask. He tried to make the cover for a pinfall, but the referee still unconscious. Manager Jimmy Hart turned his jacket inside-out to reveal a striped referee jacket; he made the three-count and declared The Mega-Maniacs the winners of the match. Referee Danny Davis came to the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> disqualified Hogan for using the facemask as a weapon. Money Inc. won the match and retained their championship, but The Mega-Maniacs threw them out of the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> opened Schyster's briefcase to reveal stacks of cash.

5|$|With about 10seconds left in {{the tenth}} round, Judah hit Mayweather with a low blow and {{followed}} it with a right hand {{to the back of}} Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period. Mayweather's uncle and trainer, Roger Mayweather, climbed into the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> approached Judah. Yoel Judah entered the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers and police officers rushed into the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight.

5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero.
