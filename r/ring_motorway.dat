50|$|Arturo Merino Benitez {{is about}} 17 km by car from Santiago's city center. The airport is {{well served by}} the 6-lane {{expressway}} Costanera Norte (Exit # 31), which crosses through the city from West to East bordering the Mapocho river, while it is also well connected to the West, North and North-East of Santiago by the Vespucio Norte Express <b>Ring</b> <b>motorway</b> (Exit # 18).|$|E
50|$|Nantes Atlantique Airport {{is located}} {{just outside the}} Périphérique de Nantes, the city's {{peripheral}} <b>ring</b> <b>motorway,</b> {{to which it is}} linked by a short access road. All the major roads and motorways to and from the city of Nantes intersect the 'périphérique'. Several car parks, both in the open and under cover, are located in the terminal area, with each car park having its own tariff.|$|E
50|$|Denmark has a well covered {{motorway}} system today, {{which has been}} difficult to build due to the county's geography with many islands. The longest bridges are the Great Belt and the Øresund bridges to Skåne (Scania) in southern Sweden. Both are motorways with dual electrical train tracks added. A motorway tunnel across the Fehmarn Belt toGermany is planned. Around Copenhagen, two <b>ring</b> <b>motorways</b> have been built. Even roads with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day have been built in the most northern part of Jutland. This was done to assure that all ferry traffic is directed to the {{motorway system}} as soon as possible.|$|R
50|$|The A64 is a {{major road}} in North and West Yorkshire, England, which links Leeds, York and Scarborough. The A64 starts as the A64(M) <b>ring</b> road <b>motorway</b> in Leeds, then towards York it becomes a {{high-quality}} dual carriageway until it is east of York, where it becomes a single carriageway {{for most of its}} route to Scarborough.|$|R

5000|$|The Liefkenshoektunnel is a {{toll tunnel}} between Antwerp and Beveren under the River Schelde. The tunnel is a {{continuation}} of Highway R2, the <b>ring</b> <b>motorway</b> surrounding the city and harbour of Antwerp. In 2010 the tunnel was used by 6,373,894 vehicles. Positioned between the Beverentunnel and the Tijsmanstunnel, the Liefkenshoektunnel is the second of three sequential road tunnels running under the river and port installations.|$|E
50|$|The Greater Ring or Intermediate Ring in Brussels, Belgium (French: Moyenne Ceinture, Dutch: Middenring) {{is a set}} {{of roads}} {{in the shape of a}} ring, {{intermediate}} between the small ring and the main Brussels <b>ring</b> <b>motorway.</b> The greater part of this set of roads is numbered R21 and is about 30 km long, compared to 8 km for the small ring and 80 km for the main ring.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} big scheme was {{improvement}} of the M30. This road is the inner <b>ring</b> <b>motorway</b> of Madrid. Significant portions of M30 run underground and its urban motorway tunnels have sections of more than 6 km in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction. Between the south entry of the Avenida de Portugal tunnel and the north exit of the M-30 south by-pass there are close to 10 km of continuous tunnels. M40 is a <b>ring</b> <b>motorway</b> which borders Madrid at a mean distance of 10.07 km {{and it has a}} total length of 63.3 km. M45 is a partial ring around the city serving the metropolitan area of Madrid. It was built to help alleviate the congestion of the M40 from the southern to the north-eastern, runs between the M40 and the M50 where the two ring motorways are more separated. M50 is the outer of the Madrid orbital motorways and has a total length of 85 km. It services mainly the metropolitan area at a mean distance of 13.5 km.|$|E
5000|$|In {{around the}} year 2000, the M60 Manchester <b>ring</b> road <b>motorway</b> was completed, cutting through littlemoss, to which {{a fair amount of}} grazing land and some {{properties}} were lost, including the 'Army Camp' which had been converted into stables and horse grazing. The 'back to front houses' and a post office were also demolished at this time, amongst other buildings.|$|R
40|$|We {{monitored}} {{trace metals}} and nitrogen using naturally growing moss Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. in urban and peri-urban {{forests of the}} City Municipality of Ljubljana. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the differences in atmospheric deposition of trace metals and nitrogen between urban and peri-urban forests. Samples were collected at a total of 44 sites in urban forests (forests within the <b>motorway</b> <b>ring</b> road) and peri-urban forests (forests outside the <b>motorway</b> <b>ring</b> road). Mosses collected in urban forests showed increased trace metal concentrations compared to samples collected from peri-urban forests. Higher values were significant for As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and V. Within the <b>motorway</b> <b>ring</b> road, the notable differences in element concentrations between the two urban forests were significant for Cr, Ni and Mo. Factor analysis showed three groups of elements, highlighting the contribution of traffic emissions, individual heating appliances and the resuspension of contaminated soils and dust as the main sources of trace elements in urban forests...|$|R
5000|$|The Flehe Bridge, is {{a single}} tower cable stayed bridge located in Düsseldorf, over the Rhine. It connects the A 46 {{motorway}} from the left bank of the Rhine (Neuss, Aachen, Heinsberg district, the Netherlands) with the Bergisches Land on the right bank (Wuppertal, Solingen, Hagen) and the south of Düsseldorf. It forms {{at the same time}} the southern part of the <b>ring</b> of <b>motorways</b> around Düsseldorf. It includes a pedestrian and cyclist strip.|$|R

50|$|First {{informal}} {{plans of}} a motorway (called firstly in Czech autostráda or dálková silnice) in Czechoslovakia {{date back to}} 1935 and was to link Prague through Slovakia with Czechoslovak easternmost territory of Carpathian Ruthenia (nowadays Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukraine) being Velykyy Bychkiv (Velký Bočkov in Czech) its end on the Czechoslovak - Romanian border. The definitive route, including a Prague <b>ring</b> <b>motorway,</b> was approved shortly after the Munich Agreement on 4 November 1938 for a planned speed limit of 120 km/h.|$|E
50|$|Munich Airport is {{accessible}} via nearby Motorway A 92, which connects to motorway A9 (towards Nuremberg) and Munich's <b>ring</b> <b>motorway</b> A99. Bavarian State Road St. 2584 connects A 92's exit 6 (Flughafen München) - an incomplete interchange {{that can only}} be used by traffic to and from the west - to the terminals. Access from the east is possible via exit 8 (Freising Ost) and Bavarian State Road St. 2580, which connects to St. 2584 in the east of the airport.|$|E
5000|$|Rue Emile Pathé/Emile Pathéstraat in Forest/Vorst, Brussels (...) , was {{originally}} intended {{to be part of}} the southern arc of the R0 Brussels <b>motorway</b> <b>ring,</b> which was never built owing to opposition from local residents. It now functions mostly as a car park.|$|R
50|$|Pozuelo {{has become}} a low-density {{residential}} area during recent decades, as new residential developments have spread over formerly agricultural lands. New transportation infrastructure is approved by the local government. Notable infrastructure developments include the M-40 (the second, counting outwards, of Madrid's <b>ring</b> <b>motorways)</b> and the new 'Metro Ligero' (light rail) line ML2 of the Madrid metro system, which was built in summer 2007 to connect Pozuelo with the Aluche district {{in the city of}} Madrid. Two stations also serve Pozuelo: 'Pozuelo' and 'El Barrial-Centro Commercial Pozuelo' of the Madrid area local train system, the 'Cercanias'. Road access is also provided by the A6 and the M503, with the Madrid orbital M40 running to the west. Pozuelo {{has one of the highest}} average per capita incomes in Madrid. According to a report by the Institute of Statistics of the Comunidad de Madrid, Pozuelo's average income level ranks highest, by a notable margin, amongst the municipalities of the Region of Madrid. The standard of living in most of its neighborhoods is high, although some old town-center areas, where a growing economic immigrant population has moved in, are excluded from such wealth.|$|R
25|$|From Junction 32, the {{motorway}} passes Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Wakefield, {{reaching the}} original {{end of the}} motorway at (the original) Junction 44 {{to the east of}} Leeds. There were plans to route the M1 from just south of Junction 42 where it interchanges with the M62, round the west of Leeds to the A1 at Dishforth; the chosen route passes to the east of Leeds. With the M62 and M621, the M1 forms a <b>ring</b> of <b>motorways</b> around the south of Leeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{landscape}} {{is very well}} served by communications. A cardioid <b>ring</b> <b>motorway</b> runs around the Leipzig-Halle conurbation, the so-called Central German Loop (Mitteldeutsche Schleife). Leipzig/Halle Airport is an important transport hub in the eastern German states. Railway lines and Bundesstraßen (federal roads) run in all directions of the compass, linking the Leipzig Bay with {{other parts of the}} country. Only inland shipping has no direct access to this region, although work on the unfinished Elster-Saale Canal began in the mid 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} roads are the B 5 federal highway from Berlin via Nauen towards Hamburg, {{from which the}} B 188 to Rathenow branches. North-south routes are the B 102 from Brandenburg via Rathenow to Rhinow and, in the east, the Berlin <b>ring</b> <b>motorway,</b> the A 10. From Spandau, two railway lines carry high-speed trains through the Havelland. These are the Berlin-Hamburg line via Nauen and the Lehrte Railway via Rathenow. In the west the Brandenburg Städtebahn links Brandenburg and Rathenow. In the east the Berlin outer ring grazes the region.|$|E
50|$|The European route E73 {{is a part}} of the International E-road network, 702 km long, {{connecting}} parts of Hungary and Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Adriatic Sea coast near the port of Ploče. The route is a Class A intermediate north-south road, consisting of 275 km of motorways, and a substantial proportion of two-lane roads with at-grade intersections. The E73 starts at the Budapest <b>ring</b> <b>motorway,</b> providing connection to the Hungarian motorway network, as well as the European routes E60, E71 and E75, at an interchange with the M6 motorway taking the E73 route south, past Dunaújváros and Szekszárd towards Bóly, where the motorway (as of August 2011) terminates, and the E73 switches to routes 57 and then 56 past Mohács to Udvar/Duboševica border crossing where the route crosses to Croatia. The Hungarian section of the E73 is 196 km long, and all but the last 20 km has been upgraded to the motorway standards. The final section of the motorway to the Croatian border is planned to extend to a new border crossing at Ivándárda.|$|E
50|$|The M0 {{motorway}} is a ringroad around Budapest, {{the capital}} of Hungary. The <b>ring</b> presently connects <b>motorways</b> M1, M7, M6, M5, M4, M3, M2, connecting currently to Highway 11. The whole length of the motorway is planned at about 108 km. About 78 km have been completed as of 2013.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{motorways}} {{pass through}} the downtown {{and other parts of}} the city in tunnels. The construction of the roads is partially supported through a toll <b>ring.</b> The major <b>motorways</b> through Oslo are European Route E6 and E18. There are three beltways, the innermost which are streets and the outermost, Ring 3 which is an expressway.|$|R
50|$|The Bucharest Motorway Ring Road (Autostrada Centura Bucureşti), termed A0, is {{a planned}} <b>motorway</b> <b>ring</b> road {{around the city}} of Bucharest, the capital of Romania. It is split into two sections: the South Ring Road Motorway and the North Ring Road Motorway. It will have a total {{distance}} of 100 km {{and will be a}} motorway connection between the existing A1, A2 and A3 motorways.|$|R
5000|$|The Kennedytunnel is an {{important}} road, rail and bicycle tunnel {{to the south of}} Antwerp, Belgium under the Scheldt river. The road tunnel forms a part of Highway R1, the not yet completed inner <b>ring</b> <b>motorway</b> surrounding the city. Opened to road traffic on 31 May 1969, and to rail traffic on 1 February 1970, the tunnel was named after John F. Kennedy, the thirty-fifth President of the United States. Plans for this tunnel dated from the fifties. Between 1945 and 1960 the volume of traffic going through the Waaslandtunnel had quintupled, so {{by the end of the}} fifties this tunnel had to accommodate more than 38.000 vehicles a day. Because of the resulting daily congestion on both sides of the river crossing, the construction of a second crossing was deemed a necessity. In 1958 the layout for the E3 was established, and an invitation to tender was issued for a bridge or a tunnel. In 1963, Minister Georges Bohy, following the advice of his technical experts, decided in favour of a tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The northernmost {{section of}} the E71 in Hungary connects the border {{crossing}} with Slovakia at Tornyosnémeti, and Miskolc. It is signposted as route 3, and this section is a two-lane road with at-grade intersections. The Tornyosnémeti - Miskolc section is concurrent with the European route E79. At Miskolc, the E71 switches to the M30 motorway which takes it to Emőd, where the E71 switches to the M3 motorway and turns west towards Budapest. The M3 carries the E71 route to Gödöllő, where the E71 switches to the M31 motorway. The M31 in turn takes the E71 to the Budapest <b>ring</b> <b>motorway</b> signposted as M0 motorway, where the E71 is concurrent with the European routes E60 and E75. The M0 motorway carries the E71 (along with the E60 and E75) around Budapest to its western outskirts. The final leg of the E71 route in Hungary is the M7 motorway between Érd just {{to the west of}} Budapest, via Székesfehérvár and Nagykanizsa to the Letenye border crossing to Croatia. South of Nagykanizsa, the E71 is concurrent with the European route E65. The Hungarian {{section of the}} E71 is 495 km long.|$|E
50|$|It was {{established}} on 30 January 2013, from territories which previously had been frazioni (hamlets) of {{the communes of}} Caselle Torinese, Borgaro Torinese, Settimo Torinese and Leini.Permanent settlements in Mappano depicted this area as the swamp of Caselle because of the properties of its soils. In the fifteenth century, Antonio de Amapano (from whom possibly originates the name) began to reclaim the territory, constructing farms in which rice was cultivated. In the sixteenth century, further intervention was undertaken {{with the creation of}} a net of irrigation canals. During the nineteenth century, the presence of drainage channels and large open spaces in the area attracted many families of washers, an activity that characterises the suburbs of Turin. The first church in Mappano was built in 1850. The settlement, in that period, consisted of a group of farms scattered along the road between Turin and Leinì that did not expand significantly during the boom after the Second World War. In the 1970s, the Turin metropolitan area experienced a rapid increase in the population in the belt formed by the municipalities of the metropolitan area most distant from the centre of Turin. In a good geographical location, not far from the main city and close to major axes and connection points (the Turin-Milan motorway, the <b>ring</b> <b>motorway,</b> and the airport), the ‘mappanese’ territory developed during the 1980s in a fairly concentrated way around a traditional core.|$|E
50|$|The E54 {{runs along}} the {{southwest}} section of the Middle Ring between the A 96 and the A 995. This section of the route is also particularly affected by long-distance traffic, because neither the <b>motorway</b> <b>ring</b> of the A 99 in the south-west of Munich is closed nor the originally planned Outer Ring has been realized here, meaning the long-distance traffic has {{to go into the}} city.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the automatic control of motorway traffic flows utilising ramp metering, i. e. traffic {{lights on the}} on-ramp entrances. A multivariable ramp metering system is developed, based on the nonminimal state space (NMSS) approach to control system design using adaptive proportional-integral-plus, linear quadratic (PIP–LQ) optimal controllers. The controller is evaluated on a nonlinear statistical traffic model (STM) simulation of the Amsterdam <b>motorway</b> <b>ring</b> road near the Coen Tunnel...|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} located {{just inside the}} city's M50 <b>motorway</b> <b>ring</b> road, bordered to the west by the large suburb of Blanchardstown, to the east by the Phoenix Park, to the north by Dunsink and to the south by the village of Chapelizod above the Liffey valley. The R147 Navan Road also serves the area. The Royal Canal and the Dublin-Sligo railway line pass through the area from east to west.|$|R
