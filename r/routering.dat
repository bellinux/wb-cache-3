40|$|Introduction The chaos network <b>router</b> is a {{high-performance}} chip used for interprocessor communication. Every processor has a <b>router</b> {{that is used}} for communicating with other processors. When a processor needs to send data to another, it breaks it up into messages and injects them into its <b>router.</b> The <b>router</b> will then send the messages to other <b>routers.</b> The messages flow through various <b>routers</b> until they reach their destination, where they are ejected to the target processor. It is the routers' responsibility to ensure that messages are delivered to their target processors. The chaos <b>router</b> creates a network with a mesh topology. The edges of the mesh are wrapped around to form a torus. Figure 1 shows part of a network with a sample message route.

50|$|The {{protocol}} achieves this by {{creation of}} virtual <b>routers,</b> which are an abstract representation of multiple <b>routers,</b> i.e. master and backup <b>routers,</b> {{acting as a}} group. The default gateway of a participating host is assigned to the virtual <b>router</b> instead of a physical <b>router.</b> If the physical <b>router</b> that is routing packets {{on behalf of the}} virtual <b>router</b> fails, another physical <b>router</b> is selected to automatically replace it. The physical <b>router</b> that is forwarding packets at any given time is called the master <b>router.</b>|$|R

Given the complexity of the CNC tool path for getting wavy shapes of Art Nouveau decorations, the choice of processing parameters for each processed species of wood requires a laborious research work to correlate these parameters. Two Art Nouveau ornaments are proposed for the investigation. They are CNC routered using two types of cutting tools. The processed parameters namely the spindle speed, feed speed and depth of cut were the three variables of the machining process for the three species of wood, which were combined so, to provide good surface finish as a quality attribute. There were totally forty six variants of combining the processing parameter which were applied for CNC <b>routering</b> the samples made of the three species of wood. At the end, an optimum combination of the processed parameters is recommended for each species of wood...|$|E
50|$|The <b>router</b> {{which first}} prefixes the MPLS header to a packet is called an ingress <b>router.</b> The last <b>router</b> in an LSP, which pops the label from the packet, is called an egress <b>router.</b> <b>Routers</b> in between, which need only swap labels, are called transit <b>routers</b> or label switch <b>routers</b> (LSRs).|$|R
50|$|In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), a P <b>Router</b> or Provider <b>Router</b> is a Label Switch <b>Router</b> (LSR) that {{functions}} as a transit <b>router</b> of the core network. The P <b>Router</b> is typically connected {{to one or more}} PE <b>Routers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An egress <b>router</b> is a Label Switch <b>Router</b> {{that is an}} {{end point}} (drain) for a given Label Switched Path (LSP). An egress <b>router</b> may be an ingress <b>router</b> or an {{intermediate}} <b>router</b> for any other LSP(s). Hence the role of egress and ingress <b>routers</b> is LSP specific. Usually, the MPLS label is attached with an IP packet at the ingress <b>router</b> and removed at the egress <b>router,</b> whereas label swapping is performed on the intermediate <b>routers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{familiar}} type of <b>routers</b> are home and small office <b>routers</b> that simply pass IP packets between the home {{computers and the}} Internet. An example of a <b>router</b> would be the owner's cable or DSL <b>router,</b> which connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP). More sophisticated <b>routers,</b> such as enterprise <b>routers,</b> connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful core <b>routers</b> that forward data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet backbone. Though <b>routers</b> are typically dedicated hardware devices, software-based <b>routers</b> also exist.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>router</b> styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the <b>routers</b> for different wood works, as Plunge <b>Routers,</b> Fixed Base Wood <b>Routers,</b> Combo <b>Routers,</b> Variable speed <b>Routers,</b> Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood <b>Routers.</b> Nowadays, most better quality <b>routers</b> have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the <b>router</b> can also be used as a fixed base <b>router.</b> Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for <b>routers</b> with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power <b>router</b> and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For <b>routers</b> with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger <b>router</b> cutters can usually only be used in a <b>router</b> that is mounted in a <b>router</b> table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|R
40|$|Designing and {{architecture}} of Trust model in WSN {{is now a}} days research challenge. Trust is important in wireless networks because collaboration and cooperation among nodes and critical towards achieving the systemâ€™s goals, such as routing reliability. IP-spoofing attacks remain {{one of the most}} damaging attacks in which a <b>router</b> replaces the original source IP-address by a new one. This paper present a novel approach using Entropy inference model that evaluates the trustworthiness of an access <b>router</b> and distributed <b>router</b> with regards to forwarding packets. The trust values for the Group <b>router</b> is computed by a judge <b>router</b> that samples all traffic being forwarded by the access <b>router.</b> The trust values for the access <b>router</b> and distributed <b>router</b> are computed by distributed <b>router</b> and ingress/egress <b>router</b> respectively.

50|$|<b>Router</b> Solicitation (Type 133): Hosts inquire with <b>Router</b> Solicitation {{messages}} to locate <b>routers</b> on an attached link. <b>Routers</b> which forward packets not addressed to them generate <b>Router</b> Advertisements immediately upon receipt of this message {{rather than at}} their next scheduled time.|$|R

40|$|How to optimally {{allocate}} redundant <b>routers</b> {{for high}} availability (HA) networks {{is a crucial}} task. In this paper, a 5 -tuple availability function A (N, M,,,) is proposed to determine the minimum required number of standby <b>routers</b> to meet the desired availability () of an HA <b>router,</b> where N and M are the numbers of active <b>routers</b> and standby <b>routers,</b> respectively, and,, and are a single <b>routerâ€™s</b> failure rate, repair rate, and failure detection and recovery rate, respectively. We have derived the availability function, and analytical {{results show that the}} failure detection and recovery rate () is a key parameter for reducing the minimum required number of standby <b>routers</b> of an HA <b>router.</b> Thus, we also propose a High Availability Management (HAM) middleware, which was designed based on an open architecture specification, called OpenAIS, to achieve the goal of reducing takeover delay (1 /) by stateful backup. We have implemented an HA Open Shortest Path First (HA-OSPF) <b>router,</b> which consists of two active <b>routers</b> and one standby <b>router,</b> to illustrate the proposed HA <b>router.</b> Experimental results show that the takeover delays of the proposed HA-OSPF <b>router</b> were reduced by 6, 37. 3, and 98. 6 % compared with those of the industry standard approaches, the Cisco-ASR 1000 series <b>router,</b> the Juniper MX series <b>router,</b> and the Virtual <b>Router</b> Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) <b>router,</b> respectively. In addition, in contract to the industry <b>routers,</b> the proposed HA <b>router,</b> which was designed based on an open architecture specification, is more cost-effective, and its redundancy model can be more flexibly adjusted.

30|$|In {{the paper}} [42, 43], the {{previous}} access <b>router</b> will cache incoming Interests once the mobile host is moving.
