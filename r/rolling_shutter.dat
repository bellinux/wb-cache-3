2500|$|In general, HDSLRs use {{the full}} imager area to capture HD video, {{though not all}} pixels (causing video {{artifacts}} to some degree). [...] Compared with the much smaller image sensors found in the typical camcorder, the HDSLR's much larger sensor yields distinctly different image characteristics. [...] HDSLRs can achieve much shallower depth of field and superior low-light performance. [...] However, the low ratio of active pixels (to total pixels) is more susceptible to aliasing artifacts (such as moire patterns) in scenes with particular textures, and CMOS <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter</b> {{tends to be more}} severe. [...] Furthermore, due to the DSLR's optical construction, HDSLRs typically lack one or more video functions found on standard dedicated camcorders, such as autofocus while shooting, powered zoom, and an electronic viewfinder/preview. [...] These and other handling limitations prevent the HDSLR from being operated as a simple point-and-shoot camcorder, instead demanding some level of planning and skill for location shooting.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} a <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter</b> can prove {{difficult}} for visual effects filming. The process of matchmoving establishes perspective in a scene based on a single point in time, however this is difficult with a <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter</b> that provides multiple points in time within the same frame. Final results depend on the readout speed of the sensor {{and the nature of}} the scene being filmed; as a rule of thumb, higher end cinema cameras will have faster readout speeds and therefore milder <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter</b> artifacts than low end cameras.|$|E

50|$|If objects {{within the}} scene are in motion {{relative}} to the imaging system, the resulting motion blur will result in lower spatial resolution. Short integration times will minimize the blur, but integration times are limited by sensor sensitivity. Furthermore, motion between frames in motion pictures will impact digital movie compression schemes (e.g. MPEG-1, MPEG-2). Finally, there are sampling schemes that require real or apparent motion inside the camera (scanning mirrors, <b>rolling</b> <b>shutters)</b> that may result in incorrect rendering of image motion. Therefore, sensor sensitivity and other time-related factors will have {{a direct impact on}} spatial resolution.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Sleep-wake {{disturbances}} {{are common}} in hospitalised patients but few studies have assessed them systematically. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess sleep quality in a group of medical inpatients, in relation to environmental factors, and the switch to daylight saving time. Methods. Between March and April 2013, 132 consecutive inpatients were screened and 99 (76 ± 11 yrs; hospitalization: 8 ± 7 days) enrolled. They slept in double or quadruple rooms, facing South/South-East, and were qualified as sleeping near/far from the window. They underwent daily sleep assessment by standard questionnaires/diaries. Illuminance was measured by a luxmeter at each patient’s eye-level, four times per day. Noise was measured at the same times by a phonometer. Information was recorded on room lighting, position of the <b>rolling</b> <b>shutters</b> and number/type of extra people in the room. Results. Compliance with sleep-wake assessment was poor, with a range of completion of 2 - 59 %, depending on the questionnaires. Reported sleep quality was sufficient and sleep timing dictated by hospital routine; 33 % of the patients reported one/more sleepless nights. Illuminance was generally low, and <b>rolling</b> <b>shutters</b> half way down for most of the 24 hours. Patients who slept near the window were exposed to more light in the morning (i. e. 222 ± 72 vs. 174 ± 85 lux, p< 0. 05 before the switch; 198 ± 72 vs. 141 ± 137 lux, p< 0. 01 after the switch) and tended to slept better (7. 3 ± 1. 8 vs. 5. 8 ± 2. 4 on a 1 - 10 scale, before the switch, p< 0. 05; 7. 7 ± 2. 3 vs. 6. 6 ± 1. 8, n. s. after the switch). Noise levels were higher than recommended for care units but substantially comparable across times/room types. No significant differences were observed in sleep parameters before/after the switch. Conclusions. Medical wards appear to be noisy environments, in which limited attention is paid to light/dark hygiene. An association was observed between sleep quality and bed position/light exposure, which is worthy of further study...|$|R
40|$|To {{support the}} {{development}} of any system that includes the generation and evaluation of camcorder copies, {{as well as to}} provide a common benchmark for robustness against camcorder copies, we present a tool to simulate digital video re-acquisition using a digital video camera. By resampling each video frame, we simulate the typical artifacts occurring in a camcorder copy: geometric modifications (aspect ratio changes, cropping, perspective and lens distortion), temporal sampling artifacts (due to different frame rates, <b>shutter</b> speeds, <b>rolling</b> <b>shutters,</b> or playback), spatial and color subsampling (rescaling, filtering, Bayer color filter array), and processing steps (automatic gain control, automatic white balance). We also support the simulation of camera movement (e. g., a hand-held camera) and background insertion. Furthermore, we allow for an easy setup and calibration of all the simulated artifacts, using sample/reference pairs of images and videos. Specifically temporal subsampling effects are analyzed in detail to create realistic frame blending artifacts in the simulated copies. We carefully evaluated our entire camcorder simulation system and found that the models we developed describe and match the real artifacts quite well...|$|R

40|$|Structured light range sensors, {{such as the}} Microsoft Kinect, have {{recently}} become popular as perception devices for computer vision and robotic systems. These sensors use CMOS imaging chips with electronic <b>rolling</b> <b>shutters</b> (ERS). When using such a sensor on a moving platform, both the image, and the depth map, will exhibit geometric distor-tions. We introduce an algorithm that can suppress such distortions, by rectifying the 3 D point clouds from the range sensor. This is done by first estimating the time continu-ous 3 D camera trajectory, and then transforming the 3 D points to where they would have been, if the camera had been stationary. To ensure that image and range data are synchronous, the camera trajectory is computed from KLT tracks on the structured-light frames, after suppressing the structured-light pattern. We evaluate our rectification, by measuring angles between the visible sides of a cube, be-fore and after rectification. We also measure how much bet-ter the 3 D point clouds can be aligned after rectification. The obtained improvement is also related to the actual ro-tational velocity, measured using a MEMS gyroscope. 1...|$|R
40|$|The façade is {{the visible}} {{part of a}} building, and {{generally}} consists of various different constructive systems. The sound reduction index of the closing elements for the openings on a room’s façade is a determining factor in the sound insulation from airborne noise inside the space. Windows are the transparent part of the façade, and to improve their thermal behaviour and control solar radiation, they are often fitted {{with a series of}} external and internal protections such as shutters, slats and blinds. This work contains a summary of studies carried out using field measurements of airborne sound insulation on façades in rooms, in application of the standard UNE-EN ISO 140 - 5 : 1999. In all the rooms the windows were fitted with <b>shutter</b> boxes and <b>rolling</b> <b>shutters,</b> and the acoustic tests were made with the shutter in two positions (extended and fully retracted). The results were analysed considering the window opening system (openable or sliding) and the type of glass pane (monolithic or insulating glass unit, IGU). In the case of sliding windows, the airborne sound insulation of façades is greater when the shutter is extended than when it is retracted, and this should be taken into account when applying the aforementioned standard...|$|R

50|$|As {{with other}} DSLRs, the D90's CMOS sensor captures video frames using a <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter,</b> which may cause skewing {{artifacts}} during rapid camera or subject motion.

50|$|Many {{photographic}} devices use {{a form of}} strip photography due {{to the use of}} a <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter</b> {{for engineering}} reasons, and exhibit similar effects. This is common both on cheaper cameras with an electronic shutter (more sophisticated electronic shutters are global, not rolling), as well as cameras with mechanical focal-plane shutters.|$|E
50|$|Focal-plane {{shutters}} {{may also}} produce image distortion of very fast moving objects or when panned rapidly, {{as described in}} the <b>Rolling</b> <b>shutter</b> article. A large relative difference between a slow wipe speed and a narrow curtain slit results in cartoonish distortion, because one side of the frame is exposed at a noticeably later instant than the other and the object's interim movement is imaged.|$|E
50|$|In Germany {{and other}} parts of Europe, <b>rolling</b> {{exterior}} <b>shutters</b> on tracks have become ubiquitous, although they lack the decorative value of traditional shutters. When open, these type shutters roll up into boxes concealed in the thickness of the wall above the window. They are typically raised and lowered manually, such as by a rolling pull made of flat nylon cord, but they can be equipped with electric operating mechanisms. These shutters allow some light in the room when not fully lowered, but wholly block light when completely closed. Variations include frame extensions that allow the closed shutter to swing out like an awning or Bermuda shutter.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{presenting}} preliminary results from 4 T technology based CMOS image sensors with global shutter, i. e. all pixels {{in the active}} array integrate light simultaneously. The global shutter operation mode is particularly important for high-speed video applications, where the more commonly implemented <b>rolling</b> line <b>shutter</b> creates motion blur. Our chips were fabricated using a 0. 18 micron 4 T, CIS technology with pinned photodiode and transfer gate. Different from conventional 3 T type CMOS image sensors with global shutter pixel, in these 4 T technology based global shutter pixels, the charge is transferred, not just sampled, onto the sense node. This translates into very high sensitivity and low readout noise at low power. For an imager with 7 transistors per pixel that is operated in global shutter, “Integrate While Read ” mode, we measure an input referred noise of 10 electrons. The extinction ratio at full well signal charge is ~ 97. 7 %. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "rolling shutter" [...] can {{be either}} {{mechanical}} or electronic. The advantage of this method is that the image sensor can continue to gather photons during the acquisition process, thus effectively increasing sensitivity. It is found on many digital still and video cameras using CMOS sensors. The effect is most noticeable when imaging extreme conditions of motion or the fast flashing of light. While some CMOS sensors use a global shutter, the majority found in the consumer market use a <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Badger {{was born}} in 1806 to a {{shipbuilding}} family on Badger's Island in the harbor of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and worked in a blacksmith's shop in Portsmouth until he set up in Woburn, Massachusetts, as a maker of saws. Following a fire, he invested his savings in a foundry and rolling mill in Boston, where he was very successful. As a [...] "black and white smith", he was admitted in 1837 {{as a member of}} the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association. He was described as a [...] "housesmith" [...] in Boston, Massachusetts, when he set up a storefront of cast-iron columns and lintels in 1842, with the provision in the contract that if the untried new material were to prove unsuccessful he would substitute the usual granite piers. Later he claimed grandly that he was [...] "the first person who practically used Iron for the building material of an exterior", though the historian of cast-iron architecture in America, Margot Gayle, observes [...] "the claim clearly cannot stand scrutiny". Badger acquired the patent of Arthur L. Johnson of Baltimore for <b>rolling</b> iron shopfront <b>shutters,</b> which he made ubiquitous as [...] "Badger fronts". In 1846 he moved to New York, where his Boston partner Charles Reed soon joined him. An early handbill shows Badger's early four-storey brick factory at 44 Duane Street, New York, as it was shortly after 1848. His later foundry occupied the whole block in the East Village from 13th to 14th Streets and Avenues B to C.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rolling</b> <b>shutter</b> is {{a method}} of image capture in which a still picture (in a still camera) or each frame of a video (in a video camera) is {{captured}} not by taking {{a snapshot of the}} entire scene at single instant in time but rather by scanning across the scene rapidly, either vertically or horizontally. In other words, not all parts of the image of the scene are recorded at exactly the same instant. (Though, during playback, the entire image of the scene is displayed at once, as if it represents a single instant in time.) This produces predictable distortions of fast-moving objects or rapid flashes of light. This is in contrast with [...] "global shutter" [...] in which the entire frame is captured at the same instant.|$|E
50|$|Another type is the roll-up or <b>rolling</b> <b>shutter,</b> {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} slats that form a curtain with both sides of the curtain being inserted into guide rails. The curtain is then rolled onto an axle which is covered by a housing. Rolling shutters can be operated manually by gear, by pull strap or can be motorized independently or in conjunction with a manual override. Motorized shutters can be operated by either a switch or remote and can be controlled either individually or in groups. On loss of power caused by hurricanes, motorized shutters must be operated manually, requiring either access to the motor (which can be difficult) or a pre-installed manual override. Most often, a manual override is operated using a gear. When deployed, all hurricane shutters require special techniques for firefighters {{to gain access to the}} interior of a structure.|$|E
