40|$|Mating of {{the cattle}} tick Boophilus microplus is {{mediated}} by chemical stimuli on the cuticle of females. Males are arrested on the dorsum of females attached to the host, frequently sample the substrate, <b>and</b> then <b>tip-over</b> to the ventrally located gonopore. These behaviours are also observed in vitro when males are placed on a small glass bead treated with a female extract. Time spent <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> by male ticks on dummies is used in an assay to test the behavioural significance of fractions of the extract. TLC separation yields one apolar fraction that arrests males, though much less so than the whole extract, but lost tip-over behaviour. This apolar fraction contains a series of cholesteryl esters that, when tested individually, show no arrestment activity at levels present in the extract but, when combined, are as active as the fraction. When a small silica column is used for fractionation, all biological activity is reproduced after recombining the fractions. In addition to the early eluting apolar fraction containing cholesteryl esters, a set of highly active more polar fractions is isolated. Electrophysiological recordings from gustatory sensilla on the pedipalps of male B. microplus, which are regularly brought {{into contact with the}} cuticle of the female during mating, provide evidence for receptors in two of them responding to the whole extract and to the behaviourally active polar fractions. Mating behaviour involving arrestment <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> is clearly initiated by a mixture of chemical stimuli, <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> behaviour is associated with the more polar material...|$|R

40|$|Autonomous {{motion of}} {{vehicles}} requires an operational space control approach which {{is able to}} generate and correct the trajectory of the vehicle {{in order to avoid}} collisions with unexpected obstacles and takes into account the contact forces between the wheels and the ground such that the slippage <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> of the vehicle can be avoided. A dynamic model of the autonomous vehicle is required for such a control approach in order to verify continuously wheel-terrain contact stability. For achieving autonomy, the dynamics based control approach is formulated for a three-wheeled vehicle with front wheel driving and steering. Exact input-output linearization of the vehicle dynamics facilitates the design of the operational space control and permits the enhancement of the autonomy of the vehicle. However, the sufficient smoothness condition for applying feedback linearization has to be continuously observed and this requires the avoidance of actuators torque saturation, wheel-ground longitudinal and lateral slippage <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> of the vehicle for motion on horizontal plane as well as inclined surfaces. In this thesis, first is presented a complete three dimensional kinematic and dynamic model of a three-wheeled autonomous vehicle built in our laboratory. Newtonian dynamics was used for developing the dynamic model of the autonomous vehicle. It continues with the path planning algorithm using the Timoshenko's 4 th order differential slender beam equation and the analysis of the two part control scheme. The control scheme contains an external loop for a linear controller, a path planner in operational space, and an inner loop exact input-output linearization controller in curvilinear space (s-delta). A dynamic model based predictive control is proposed for avoidance of the violation of the smoothness condition for exact linearization, {{while at the same time}} conserving path planning results by modifying the input commands...|$|R

40|$|A mobile {{manipulator}} is {{a robotic}} system {{consisting of a}} robotic manipulator mounted onto a mobile base. This greatly extends the workspace of the robotic manipulator and allows it to perform more tasks. However, combining both systems increases {{the complexity of the}} control task as well as introducing additional controller tasks such as coordination of motion, where executing the task can involve using both the mobile base and manipulator, and cooperation of task, where many tasks can be executed at once. In this thesis a controller for a mobile manipulator is developed from smaller, simple controller blocks, allowing the controller to be ﬂexible, easy to understand, and straightforward to implement using well-known embedded software implementation approaches. A behaviour-based approach was used to build the individual controllers, and a hierarchical structure was used to organise the individual controllers to provide cooperation between them and coordinated motion. The task assigned to the controller was to reach a series of waypoints in a large workspace, while satisfying performance metrics of manipulability <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> sta- bility. The operation of the controller was tested in simulation using 100 randomly generated scenarios consisting of ﬁve randomly generated waypoints in each. Using default thresholds for manipulability <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> stability, the controller was success- fully able to complete all scenarios. Further simulations were then performed testing the eﬀects of varying the thresholds of the performance metrics to explore the tradeoﬀs involved in diﬀerent parameter choices. The controller was successful in a majority of these scenarios, with only a few failing due to extreme threshold choices. The reasons for these failures, and the corresponding lessons for robot designers are discussed. Finally, to demonstrate the modularity of the controller, an obstacle avoidance con- troller was added and simulation results showed the controller was capable of avoiding obstacles while still performing the same tasks that were used in previous tests. Successful simulation results of the controller across a range of performance metrics shows that the combination of a behaviour based and hierarchical approach to mobile manipulator control is not only capable of producing a functional controller, but also one that is more modular and easier to understand than the monolithic controllers developed by other researchers...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} two aesthetic {{criteria for}} the visualization of rooted trees: inclusion <b>and</b> <b>tip-over.</b> Finding the minimum area layout according to either of these two standards is an NP-hard task, even when we restrict ourselves to binary trees.

This result applies to any tree for <b>tip-over</b> layouts <b>and</b> to bounded degree trees {{in the case of}} the inclusion convention. We also prove that such restriction is necessary since, for unbounded degree trees, the inclusion problem is strongly NP-hard. Hence, neither a fully polynomial time approximation scheme nor a pseudopolynomial time algorithm exists, unless P = NP. Our technique, combined with the parallel algorithm by Metaxas et al. [Comput. Geom. 9 (1998) 145 – 158], also yields an NC fully parallel approximation scheme. This latter result holds for inclusion of binary trees and for the slicing floorplanning problem.

Automatic optimal biped walking as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program Aurelien Ibanez, Philippe Bidaud, and Vincent Padois Abstract This paper proposes an original Model Predictive Control approach to the walking control for humanoid robots, which allows to generate stable walking motions without the prior definition of footsteps positions and instants. Both the in-stant and amplitude {{of the changes in}} the supporting surface are part of the walking motion generation problem, and are described by a set of highly-constrained inte-ger and real variables. Combined with the center of mass trajectory of the robot, this description leads to the formulation of a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program in a Model predictive framework aiming at reaching high-level objectives, such as ve-locity tracking <b>and</b> <b>tip-over</b> risk minimization.

We used spectroscopic techniques {{on the basis}} of continuum emission and line en-fission from highly excited levels due to EIR and Langmuir probes. The dependence of the plasma parameters on the neutral pressure in a pure helium plasma and in a helium-hydrogen mixture shows clearly that recombination is caused by different processes in the two cases. In a pure helium plasma a <b>roll-over</b> <b>and</b> a following decrease of the electron density as well as a monotonic decrease of the electron temperature down to 0. 1 eV were observed when increasing the helium pressure.

Secondly, taking the accident delay time as the observation cycle, {{the maximum number of}} the vehicles through the accident road per unit time was considered as its capacity.
