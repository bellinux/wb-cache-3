5|$|However, the <b>retreat</b> went awry. The Allied contingents in {{the centre}} missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} <b>retreat,</b> had not even begun to <b>retreat</b> by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the <b>retreat</b> and if possible join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} {{fire from the}} Israelis inside the bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli tank fire and aerial bombardment, was finally overwhelmed by the Israeli reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening fire on the main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to <b>retreat</b> through the marshes.

5|$|The last phase: With the <b>retreat</b> of the Byzantine left center, {{a general}} Byzantine <b>retreat</b> started. Khalid took his cavalry north {{to block the}} {{northern}} route of escape.

Dharar had already captured the bridge as part of Khalid's plan the night before. A unit of 500 mounted troops had been sent to block this passageway.

40|$|The pale chanting-goshawk (Melierax canorus) {{incorporates}} silk nests (hereafter ‘retreats’) of {{the social}} spider Stegodyphus dumicola (Araneae: Eresidae) {{in the construction of}} the nest-lining of their own nests. This study investigates whether pale chanting-goshawks in the Little Karoo, South Africa, show a preference for spider <b>retreats</b> as nest-lining and how this preference impacts on the abundance and distribution of Stegodyphus <b>retreats</b> within chanting- goshawk territories. In spite of an average 37 <b>retreats</b> per 2. 2 km 2 pale chanting-goshawk territory, the birds selected few spider <b>retreats</b> (18 % of those provided during experimental manipulations). The highest proportion of spider <b>retreats</b> (38 %) were found within 223 m of chanting-goshawk nests, probably being moved there over time by nesting birds. Given a choice between sheepskin, active spider <b>retreats,</b> cushion stuffing and cotton waste, the birds preferred sheepskin (53 % by volume) although sheep are not farmed in the study area. These findings demonstrate that the pale chanting-goshawks were searching for soft insulating material to line the nest rather than spider <b>retreats</b> per se. Although spider <b>retreats</b> were used less often than other man-introduced materials, e. g. cattle dung and fabric, it is still not known how the availability of these alternative materials influence long-term trends in the use of Stegodyphus <b>retreats</b> by these birds. </strong...|$|R

5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to <b>retreat</b> and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The <b>retreat</b> was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a <b>retreat</b> initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On {{the first night of}} the <b>retreat,</b> the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of the}} march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the <b>retreat</b> to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|Amompharetus: The {{leader of}} a {{battalion}} of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time <b>retreat</b> towards Plataea before the battle, since doing so would be shameful for a Spartan. Herodotus has an angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon {{the rest of the}} Spartan army finally began to <b>retreat,</b> leaving Amompharetus' division behind. Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans. However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.|$|E

At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals.

Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the <b>retreat,</b> and some drowned in the process.
