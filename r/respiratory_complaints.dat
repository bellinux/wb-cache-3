40|$|Respiratory {{health effects}} of ambient air {{pollution}} were studied in 605 school children 9 to 13 years in Eskisehir, Turkey.

Self-reported <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>complaints</b> (having cold, complaints of throat, runny nose and shortness of breath/wheezing) in the last 7 days and {{on the day of}} testing were also recorded. As acute health outcomes were investigated, weekly average ambient concentrations of ozone (O- 3), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) were determined by passive sampling in the school playgrounds simultaneously with the health survey. Effects of air pollution on <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>complaints</b> and exhaled NO/lung function were estimated by multivariate logistic regression and multivariate linear mixed effects models, respectively. Upper <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>complaints</b> were significantly (p = 0. 05). Lung function was not associated with upper <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>complaints</b> and FEN levels.

40|$|AbstractSeventy-seven {{patients}} with morbid obesity, {{body mass index}} (BMI) 40 – 69 · 9 kg m− 2, who were candidates for gastroplasty, were studied in our laboratory {{as part of a}} pre-operative survey.

A group of 28 lean subjects (BMI 20 – 29 · 8 kg m− 2) who were candidates for abdominal surgery, without any <b>respiratory</b> <b>complaint,</b> were included as controls. For each patient a pulmonary function test was performed, measuring slow vital capacity with expiratory residual volume (ERV), forced vital capacity (flow/volume) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV). In obese patients the MVV is reduced as BMI increases. This results in the reduction of expiratory flows and volumes. Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) is reduced in proportion to the FVC reduction and is related to MVV. It is suggested that the main consequence of the burden of the chest wall by increased adipose mass is a reduction in its compliance, making inspiration increasingly difficult, and resulting in lower static volumes and flows...|$|R
40|$|Serious {{exposure}} to the herbicide paraquat usually results in death, either due to gastrointestinal caustic lesions, shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome or related to the progressive development of pulmonary fibrosis associated with refractory hypoxemia. We report a case of suicidal paraquat ingestion in a 59 -year-old man. Most of the indicators of poor prognosis were encountered in this patient. Treatment consisted of early digestive decontamination and hemodialysis, followed by antioxidant therapy, including the administration of deferoxamine (100 mg/kg in 24 h) and a continuous infusion of acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg/d during 3 weeks). The patient only developed a nonoliguric acute renal failure, a mild alteration of liver tests, and an impairment of CO transfer factor without any <b>respiratory</b> <b>complaint.</b> Renal and hepatic disturbances completely resolved within 1 month, whereas CO transfer factor remained altered 14 months later. This observation suggests that early administration of an antioxidant therapy, including deferoxamine and acetylcysteine could be usefully associated with measures that prevent digestive absorption or enhance elimination to limit systemic toxicity in potentially fatal paraquat poisoning.

40|$|Objectives: One of {{the common}} causes of {{morbidity}} in patients with RA is pulmonary involvement. Some {{studies have shown that}} the possible abnormal results of pulmonary function tests in rheumatoid disease are higher than usual. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of spirometric abnormalities in patients with RA. Materials & Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 99 patients with RA who referred to a rheumatology clinic in Qazvin, northwest Iran. Sixty five age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited as well. History taking, physical examination, laboratory tests and spirometry were performed for the participants. RA severity was assessed according to Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28). The data were processed using SPSS software version 16. Chi square and student's t test and multiple logistic regressions were used as appropriated. Results: The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 46 (± 10. 5) years. The mean (±SD) duration of disease was 4. 8 (± 5. 4) years, and the mean (±SD) DAS 28 was 2. 5 (± 1. 1). Dyspnea was the most common <b>respiratory</b> <b>complaint</b> (6. 1 %).

40|$|AbstractCough is a {{protective}} reflex and defence mechanism in healthy individuals, which helps clear excessive secretions and foreign {{material from the}} lungs. Cough often presents as {{the first and most}} persistent symptom of many respiratory diseases and some non-respiratory disorders, but can also be idiopathic, and is a common <b>respiratory</b> <b>complaint</b> for which medical attention is sought. Chronic cough of various aetiologies is a regular presentation to specialist respiratory clinics, and is reported as a troublesome symptom by a significant proportion of the population. Despite this, the treatment options for cough are limited. The lack of effective anti-tussives likely stems from our incomplete understanding of how the tussive reflex is mediated. However, research over the last decade has begun to shed some light on the mechanisms which provoke cough, and may ultimately provide us with better anti-tussive therapies. This review will focus on the in vitro and in vivo models that are currently used to further our understanding of the sensory innervation of the respiratory tract, and how these nerves are involved in controlling the cough response. Central to this are the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels, a family of polymodal receptors that can be activated by such diverse stimuli as chemicals, temperature, osmotic stress, and mechanical perturbation. These ion channels are thought to be molecular pain integrators and targets for novel analgesic agents for the treatment of various pain disorders but some are also being developed as anti-tussives...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent upper <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>complaints</b> are a {{prevalent}} {{disorder in}} young children. In this clinical trial {{it has been}} hypothesised that a daily intake of 200 ml full fat milk or full fat yoghurt and the use of butter results in a reduction of upper airway complaints. This {{is based on the assumption}} that milk fat contains substances that help restore the fatty acid balance. On top of that, there could possibly be a positive effect of the vitamins A, C and E. Therefore, in this study we investigated the following question: Could the use of full fat dairy products reduce recurrent upper <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>complaints</b> in children? An intervention group and a control group were used. The study has a pre-test post-test design. The outcomes are: fever, colds, wheezing, rasping and coughing. Also the Body Mass Index was determined at the start and at the end of the research period. In the intervention group this research shows a significant reduction of the mean number of days with complaints per month. For example, the number of days rasping per month was reduced from 16. 3 (SEM = 1. 5) to 6. 0 (SEM = 1. 0) days per month (p < 0. 000). The results of the control group though, present a significant reduction as well: at the start of this study the mean number of days with complaints of rasping was 11. 2 (SEM = 1. 9). At the end of this study this mean number of days was reduced to 2. 6 (SEM = 0. 6) (p < 0. 000). There were no significant changes of the BMI (p= 0. 660). Although the outcome of this study does not give an answer to our hypothesis due to the high number of drop-outs in the control group, it is important to repeat this study with a good control group to investigate this possible new treatment of recurrent upper airway complaints. ...|$|R

In contrast, Tabata et al. reported successful allogeneic HSCT for a patient with MDS and severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Although it was difficult to decide to perform allogeneic HSCT for our patient, we successfully performed the procedure in a patient with MDS and severe pulmonary complications. In conclusion, allogeneic HSCT should be considered a treatment option if pulmonary complications are definitely associated with an underlying hematological malignancy.|$|R
