25|$|On November 26, 1931, a {{connection}} south of Chambers Street to the Montague Street Tunnel opened, adding two stations (Fulton Streets and Broad) and <b>rerouted</b> <b>train</b> {{service on the}} bridge's south side. Service on that side became relatively low afterward as the only trains that normally crossed it were The Bankers’ Special, which ran from either the Sea Beach and/or Fourth Avenue Line, crossed the Manhattan Bridge or Montague Street Tunnel into Manhattan, {{and then returned to}} Brooklyn via the opposite crossing.|$|E
50|$|The {{third track}} is {{occasionally}} {{used for other}} purposes like testing new equipment and <b>rerouting</b> <b>trains</b> during extreme weather conditions.

This would allow a doubling of Blue Line trains to Forest Park on the Congress Branch, since service would no longer be divided between the Forest Park and 54th/Cermak terminals. The CTA has also promised that service to/from 54th/Cermak would be increased 100% during weekday rush hours.|$|R
50|$|In April 1982 a {{collapse}} in Royersville Tunnel (the only tunnel {{on the old}} DT&I) prompted GTW {{to shut down the}} line between Jackson and Ironton. The tunnel had suffered collapses {{many times in the past}} but limited remaining business south of Jackson and the operational problems of the tunnel led to GTW's decision. At the same time, GTW bypassed the steep and treacherous Summithill section between Bainbridge and Waverly by <b>rerouting</b> <b>trains</b> onto Chessie System trackage from Washington Court House, Ohio to Waverly, then back onto the former DT&I to Jackson. In 1984 all operations south of Washington Court House were suspended, the Jackson Shops closed, and the track dismantled.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} eastern {{entrance to}} the tunnel {{in the middle of}} Market Street at Castro was removed and new entrances were placed {{on the sides of the}} street further up the block, though no Metro or streetcar lines use them in regular service (they were used during construction of the Market Street subway and are occasionally used in non-revenue service such as <b>rerouting</b> <b>trains</b> around construction projects). Instead, trains continue directly from the Market Street Subway into the tunnel without going above ground. West Portal Station, which was originally a surface stop outside of the tunnel's western entrance, was rebuilt as a high-platform station located just inside of the entrance.|$|R

50|$|With {{the opening}} of the Cut-Off in 1911, the line became known as the Old Road, relegated to a branch line for local freight shipments. It still saw the {{occasional}} through train when Cut-Off traffic was heavy and served as the main line in 1941 when a rockslide closed the Cut-Off. The effects of Hurricane Diane caused record flooding along the Delaware River and forced DL&W to <b>reroute</b> <b>trains</b> over part the Old Road. The storm also washed out the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) Bel-Del Railroad north of Belvidere, New Jersey, leading the railroad to remove the section north to the junction of the Old Road at Manunka Chunk and end PRR service from Trenton, New Jersey, to East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.|$|R
40|$|To hear of train {{disruptions}} on {{the news}} has been more a rule than an exception in recent years, whether it is signal failure or torn down contact lines, all these disturbances have caused enormous problems both for passengers and goods. A big reason that disruptions have such {{a big impact on}} the railway system is that there are very limited opportunities to divert trains. However, this may change with the future high-speed network in Sweden, where the first stage is the Eastern Link, a new double track railway between Järna - Linköping for speeds up to 320 km / h. Thus, there will be two double-track railways on the route and moreover the single-tracked Nyköping line, which will open up entirely new opportunities to <b>reroute</b> high-speed <b>trains</b> from the Eastern Link when future failures occur. The purpose of this work is to see what effects the <b>rerouting</b> of high-speed <b>train</b> has on other trains {{as well as on the}} <b>rerouted</b> <b>trains.</b> To see these effects a case study is being carried out on the Eastern Link with an unplanned shutdown between Norrköping - Nyköping, where high-speed trains will be diverted in four different scenarios. The goal of the study is to find the best alternative route for the Eastern Link trains in terms of travel time, impact on the other traffic and the number of stations served. Finally, a general model is developed to estimate the total diversion time for high-speed trains. As the Eastern Link is scheduled to be completed in 15 years, other countries like Italy and France that already had a large high-speed network are looked into on the rerouting possibilities they have. A common thing for both countries is that they have built many connection points between the ordinary and high-speed network which provides great opportunities for the <b>rerouting</b> of high-speed <b>trains.</b> The case study is being done with the simulation software RailSys where the four study options and the comparing alternative are simulated. The simulation takes place in the area of Södertälje - Hallsberg - Linköping - Nyköping. In order to get a realistic picture of how the traffic can come to look at the opening of The Eastern Link, year 2030, both forecasts and current timetables (T 15) are used. The use of T 15 is being motivated that no travel time reductions will be made on the relevant courses and that the Western and Southern main line are already heavily loaded. The result indicates that the diversion of high-speed rail has a very marginal impact on other traffic, this is explained by the fact they can keep the track speed limit. In an unplanned shutdown between Norrköping-Nyköping study option 3 (UA 3) is recommended, this option uses both the Southern Main Line and the Nyköping line. The developed model shows that there is potential to calculate the total diversion time and thus better able to predict arrival times for the <b>rerouted</b> <b>trains...</b>|$|R
40|$|Though {{timetabling}} {{can account}} for some possible delays, in practice, external events still regularly lead to delays. Once trains are deviating from their schedule, conflicts can occur. A conflict implies that (at least) two trains require the same part of the infrastructure at the same time. Conflicts need to be resolved quickly {{in a way that}} disturbs the system as little as possible. Therefore, the impact on the whole network should be taken into account when solving conflicts. This paper discusses a heuristic conflict prevention technique capable of solving multiple conflicts together by reordering, retiming and locally <b>rerouting</b> <b>trains.</b> Based on a close-to-practice simulation tool where a simplified prediction horizon up to 10 minutes is considered, this technique is compared to FCFS.

500|$|Work on {{establishing}} {{the new company}} was initiated by Autolink in March 2008, with the company formally established on 27March.

2500|$|Plans for a Tri-Rail [...] "Coastal Link" [...] resurfaced {{with the}} {{construction}} of FEC's All Aboard Florida intercity higher-speed rail system in 2014.

Another plan calls for an initial six stations between downtown Miami and Aventura. Although the All Aboard Florida project includes double tracking the entire line in South Florida, the Coastal Link would require the construction of its own stations between All Aboard Florida's three stations, as well as the possible addition of a third track, at a cost estimated between US$720 and US$800 million in 2014.|$|R
40|$|Maintenance Activities (MA's) are {{necessary}} to sustain the state and functionality of the railway infrastructure.

In {{the first part of}} this work, we present a MILP formulation for rescheduling and <b>rerouting</b> <b>trains</b> that are directly or indirectly affected by MA's. This formulation can be used to validate or to optimize the train schedules and routes with great precision, since a microscopic perspective of the infrastructure and rolling stock is considered.
