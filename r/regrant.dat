25|$|The early Plantations of Ireland {{occurred}} during the Tudor conquest of Ireland. The Crown government at Dublin intended to pacify and Anglicise the country under English rule and incorporate the native ruling classes into the English aristocracy. The government intended to develop Ireland as a peaceful and reliable possession, without risk of rebellion or foreign invasion. Wherever the policy of surrender and <b>regrant</b> failed, land was confiscated and English plantations were established.|$|E
25|$|A charter {{under the}} Great Seal of Scotland of 7 February 1588/9, granted George the lands and lordship of Poppil and Wester Spott (then tenanted by Andrew Brown and Thomas Watson). George had {{resigned}} the lands {{the previous day}} for a <b>regrant</b> in view of his forthcoming marriage to Isobel Hepburn, the eldest daughter of Lord (Laird) Patrick Hepburn of Waughton, knight, by his wife Isobel, daughter of John Haldane of Gleneagles.|$|E
25|$|From 1536, Henry VIII of England {{decided to}} conquer Ireland {{and bring it}} under English control. The FitzGerald dynasty of Kildare, who had become the {{effective}} rulers of the Lordship of Ireland (The Pale) in the 15th century, had become unreliable allies and Henry resolved to bring Ireland under English government control so the island would not become a base for future rebellions or foreign invasions of England. To involve the Gaelic nobility {{and allow them to}} retain their lands under English law the policy of surrender and <b>regrant</b> was applied.|$|E

When the {{recipients}} failed {{to take up the}} grant, it was <b>regranted</b> in 1766, but also without success. Finally, it was <b>regranted</b> by Governor John Wentworth to 72 people on May 1, 1772, and settlement began soon thereafter. The first settlers were Benjamin Rice and Stephen Murch from Hanover, but originally from Connecticut.|$|R
25|$|The {{role of the}} Parliament {{changed after}} 1541, when Henry VIII {{declared}} the Kingdom of Ireland and embarked on the Tudor conquest of Ireland. Despite an era which featured royal concentration of power and decreasing feudal power {{throughout the rest of}} Europe, King Henry VIII overruled earlier court rulings putting families and lands under attainder and recognised the privileges of the Gaelic nobles, thereby expanding the crown's de jure authority. In return for recognising the crown's authority under the new Kingdom of Ireland, the Gaelic-Anglo-Irish lords had their position legalised and were entitled to attend the Irish Parliament as equals under the policy of surrender and <b>regrant.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{conflict}} for the succession Matthew {{was killed by}} the Ó Donnaile followers of Shane and Conn, placing his sons Brian and Hugh in a precarious situation. The continuing support for their claims came from the English administration in Dublin, which was anxious to use the reliance of the sons of Matthew on their support to break the independent power of the O'Neill lords of Ulster. This {{was part of a}} general English policy to transform Irish Gaelic titles into feudal titles granted under the crown that would bring them entirely within the English legal system through a policy known as surrender and <b>regrant,</b> in which the Irish forcibly surrendered their lands to the crown and had them granted back into their keeping as property of the crown, rather than the property of the sept, or Gaelic extended family.|$|E
25|$|If a {{man held}} a peerage, his son would succeed to it; {{if he had}} no children, his brother would succeed. If he had a single daughter, his {{son-in-law}} would inherit the family lands, and usually the same Peerage; more complex cases were decided depending on circumstances. Customs changed with time; Earls {{were the first to}} be hereditary, and three different rules can be traced for the case of an Earl who left no sons and several married daughters. In the thirteenth century, the husband of the eldest daughter inherited the Earldom automatically; in the fifteenth century, the Earldom reverted to the Crown, who might <b>regrant</b> it (often to the eldest son-in-law); in the seventeenth century, it wouldn't be inherited by anybody unless {{all but one of the}} daughters died and left no descendants, in which case the remaining daughter (or her heir) would inherit.|$|E

Dubbed the Precipice Fund, PICA began distributing its first round of grants in 2013. As of 2016, $225,000 has been redistributed over three grant periods to 57 projects in the region.|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, the Brehon Laws {{could never}} be adopted on an {{official}} basis by the English-controlled government of the Lordship of Ireland, although some modernised concepts have been readopted in {{the laws of the}} Republic of Ireland. [...] The imposition of the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367 and the policy of Surrender and <b>regrant</b> effectively outlawed Brehon Law. [...] In one exceptional case, vestigial rights have been recognised in recent Irish case law, in reference to the survival of Brehon law-governed customary local fishery rights in Tyrconnell, but these also amounted to an easement under Common Law.|$|E
