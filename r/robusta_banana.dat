40|$|Problem statement: The {{occurrence}} of endosulfan, carbendazim, chloropyripos in 10 banana samples in southern area of Tamilnadu, India (hill banana, karpuravalli, monthan, nendran, ney poovan, pachanadan, poovan, rasthali, red banana, robusta) was investigated. Approach: In 7 samples, Carbendazim {{was found at}} concentrations ranging from 0. 002 - 0. 11 mg kg - 1. In three samples, carbendazim was not found, whereas endosulfan, chloropyripos was not detected in any sample. Results: Analysis was carried out using HPLC-UV and samples were confirmed by GC-MS. The seven samples contained carbendazim that not exceeded the FAO/WHO codex alimentarius standards for MRLs (Maximum Residue Limit) values of carbendazim pesticide on banana (whole) is 1. 0 mg kg - 1. Conclusion/Recommendations: Based on the HPLC results carbendazim is finding in Hill banana (0. 007 mg kg - 1), Monthan (0. 019 mg kg - 1), Nendran (0. 002 mg kg - 1), Pachanadan (0. 007 mg kg - 1), Poovan (0. 016 mg kg - 1), Rasthali (0. 017 mg kg - 1) and Robusta (0. 11 mg kg - 1) and carbendazim is not finding Karpuravalli, Ney poovan and Red banana. Endosulfan, Chloropyrifos and Carbendazim in <b>Robusta</b> <b>Banana</b> sample are identified by matching their retention times and characteristic ion.

40|$|Studies on the {{efficacy}} of sulphate of potash (SOP) on the physiological, yield and quality parameters of banana cv. Robusta (Cavendish- AAA) The investigation was carried out to assess the comparative efficacy of sulphate of potash (SOP) and muriate of motash (MOP) to improve the growth, yield {{and quality of the}} <b>Robusta</b> <b>banana</b> through enhanced physiological processes. The chlorophyll content, relative water content, NRase activity, soluble protein, photosynthetic efficacy and gas exchange characters were found to be higher with 150 per cent of the recommended potassium (K) using SOP. The treatment T 9 i. e. potassium application at the 150 per cent level as sulphate of potash had a higher total dry matter production, reflecting on the maximum bunch weight coupled with quality. The results clearly indicated the benefit of SOP in increasing the bunch size with better quality fruits, and hence it is recommended to integrate SOP in banana nutrition, by supplying a recommended dose of K through SOP at 2, 4, 6 and 8 months after planting...|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Kamiss {{estimated}} {{the human population}} of the special forest reserve to be 4,500, Within the general population, 2,000-3,000 Baka people live in mud huts or wooden shacks in villages across the reserve. The largest of the villages is Bayanga, while Moussapoula, Kunda Papaye, and Yobe comprise the smaller ones. Babongo and Lindjombo are difficult to reach. Yandombe, just south of Bayanga, is a fairly new settlement established in 1990. Most agricultural activity, such as subsistence farming, occurs along the main north-south axis road that connects the villages north of Bayanga with Lindjombo to the far south. The main diet of the indigenous people includes cassava, corn, peanuts, <b>robusta</b> coffee, cocoyams, <b>bananas,</b> papayas, wild berries and koko leaf. Fences erected around fields are made of string with various suspended objects such as cans, plastic bags, and milk tin lids.|$|R
40|$|Coffee {{and banana}} are major cash and food crops, respectively, for many smallholders in the East African highlands. Uganda {{is the largest}} banana {{producer}} and 2 nd largest coffee producer in Africa. Both crops are predominantly grown as monocultures. However, coffee–banana intercropping is common in densely populated areas. This study assessed the profitability of intercropped coffee–banana systems compared to mono-cropped systems in regions growing Arabica (Mt. Elgon) and Robusta (south and west) coffee in Uganda. The study {{was carried out in}} 152 plots in 2006 / 2007. Data were collected through structured farmer interviews, field measurements and observations. Coffee yields did not differ significantly (P ⩽ 0. 05) between mono-crops and intercrops. Arabica coffee yields were 1. 23 and 1. 18 t ha− 1 year− 1 of green beans in mono-cropped and intercropped plots, respectively. Robusta yields averaged 1. 25 and 1. 09 t ha− 1 year− 1 of green beans in mono-crops and intercrops, respectively. Banana yields were significantly higher (P ⩽ 0. 05) in intercrops (20. 19 t ha− 1 year− 1) compared with mono-crops (14. 82 t ha− 1 year− 1) in Arabica growing region. In <b>Robusta</b> growing region, <b>banana</b> yields were significantly lower (P ⩽ 0. 05) in intercrops (8. 89 t ha− 1 year− 1) compared with mono-crops (15. 04 t ha− 1 year− 1). Marginal rate of returns of adding banana to mono-cropped coffee was 911 % and 200 % in Arabica and Robusta growing regions, respectively. Fluctuations in coffee prices are not likely to affect the acceptability of intercrops when compared with coffee mono-crops in both regions, but an increase in wage rates by 100 % can make intercropping unacceptable in Robusta growing region. This study showed that coffee–banana intercropping is much more beneficial than banana or coffee mono-cropping and that agricultural intensification of food and cash crops in African smallholder systems should not solely depend on the mono-crop pathway.
