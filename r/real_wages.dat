The anti-inflation programme focussed on controlling nominal wages and salaries. Inflation decreased sharply, decreasing from an annual rate of about 30% in 1965–67 to 7.6% in 1969.

5|$|Scottish {{industry}} {{came out}} of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships. Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. <b>Real</b> <b>wages,</b> adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by 2inches.|$|E
5|$|Six {{million people}} were {{unemployed}} when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there were fewer than a million.

Trade unions were abolished in May 1933 with the seizure of the funds and arrest of the leadership of the Social Democratic trade unions. A new organisation, the German Labour Front, was created and placed under NSDAP functionary Robert Ley. The average German worked 43 hours a week in 1933 and by 1939 this increased to 47 hours a week.|$|E

The consensus is that <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> rigidities can be a useful mechanism to induce the inflation persistence that is absent in the standard Calvo model. <b>Real</b> <b>wage</b> rigidities thus generate a slump in output after a credible disinflationary policy. This consensus is flawed, since it depends on analyzing the model in a linearized framework.

5|$|The {{salary for}} Soviet {{citizens}} increased abruptly by almost 2.5 {{times during the}} plan. <b>Real</b> <b>wages</b> in 1980 amounted to 232.7 rubles, compared to 166.3 rubles before the 1965 Soviet economic reform and the Eight-Five Year Plan. The first period, 1960–1964, was characterised by low growth, while the second period, 1965–1981, had a stronger growth rate. The second period vividly demonstrated {{the success of the}} Kosygin reform, with the average annual growth in retail turnover being 11.2 billion rubles, 1.8 times higher than in the first period and 1.2 times higher than the third period (1981–1985). Consumption of goods and daily demand also increased. The consumption of home appliances greatly increased. Refrigerators increased from a low of 109,000 in 1964 to 440,000 units by 1973; consumption declined during the reversal of the reform. Car production increased, and would continue to do so until the late 1980s. The Soviet leadership, under pressure, sought to provide more attractive goods for Soviet consumers.|$|E
5|$|These {{effects were}} not felt uniformly, however. For example, {{by the end}} of the Brezhnev era, blue-collar workers had higher wages than {{professional}} workers in the Soviet Union. For example, the wage of a secondary school teacher in the Soviet Union was only 150 rubles while a bus driver's wage was 230. As a whole, <b>real</b> <b>wages</b> increased from 96.5 rubles a month in 1965 to 190.1 rubles a month in 1985. A small minority benefited even more substantially. The state provided daily recreation and annual holidays for hard-working citizens. Soviet trade unions rewarded hard-working members and their families with beach vacations in Crimea and Georgia. Workers who fulfilled the monthly production quota set by the Soviet government were honored by placing their respective names on the factory's Roll of Honor. The state awarded badges for all manner of public services, and war veterans were allowed to go to the head of the shop queues. All members of the USSR Academy of Sciences were given a special badge and their own chauffeur-driven car. These awards, perks and privileges made it easier for some to find decent job placements, though they did not prevent the degeneration of Soviet society. Urbanization had led to unemployment in the Soviet agricultural sector, with most of the able workforce leaving villages for the local towns.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{relationship}} between population and economics, Malthus wrote that when the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, <b>real</b> <b>wages</b> fall because the growing population causes {{the cost of living}} (i.e., the cost of food) to go up.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the degree of}} <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> flexibility in 19 EU countries in a wage Phillips curve panel framework. We find evidence for a reaction of wage growth to unemployment and productivity growth. However, due to unemployment persistence, over time the <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> response weakens substantially. Our {{results suggest that the}} degree of <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> flexibility tends to be larger in the central and eastern European (CEE) countries than in the euro area; weaker in downturns than during upswings. Moreover, there exists an inflation threshold, below which <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> flexibility seems to decrease.

30|$|The {{estimated}} {{level of}} <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> cyclicality (0.38  %) {{is by far}} the lowest among studies that use worker-level data for developed countries. Pissarides (2009) summarizes results of most available studies. For the United States a drop of one percentage point in the unemployment rate is correlated with a <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> increment of 1.3 – 1.5  %. For European countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Portugal) the estimated <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> cyclicality is even greater at 2.0 – 2.2  %. However, {{based on the results of}} the International Wage Flexibility Project and the Bank of Spain [(see Cuadrado et al. (2011)], none of these European countries exhibits a high degree of <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> rigidity. Spain ranks fifth in such ranking after countries with extensive wage indexation (Belgium, Sweden, Finland and France), while countries such as Germany and Italy have low levels of <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> rigidity. 23 Therefore, the fact that estimated levels of <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> cyclicality in Europe are higher than initially expected may be driven by the selected pool of countries for which estimations are available.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{difficulty}} in defining one {{value for the}} <b>real</b> <b>wage,</b> in some cases a <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> {{can be said to}} have unequivocally increased.

In such a situation, <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> increases no matter how inflation is calculated.

These are the scenarios where the worker can buy some of the bundles that he could just barely afford before and still have money left, {{but at the same time}} he simply cannot afford some of the bundles that he could before.
