40|$|Abstract. At present, in the cycloid <b>rotational</b> <b>indexing</b> {{processing}} {{back taper}} technique, machining requirements were achieved mainly through {{the method of}} using cycloid cluster to approach the involute, so that the processing efficiency was hindered. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved method that reduces the number of cycloids to enhance the processing efficiency. Firstly, the best approximating cycloid of the involute tooth profile is figured out. Then, the involute is segmented into sections, and the best approximating cycloid on each section is calculated. Each cycloid approaches the involute section to a maximum extent until completing the entire involute approximation. Finally, the simulative processing is carried out. The result demonstrates {{that the number of}} cycloids is one third of the previous and the machining time saves about 64 %. This indicates that the improved method is feasible to machine back taper...|$|R

Our goal was to evaluate new 3 D-STE software by comparing regional wall motion (RWM) measurements against 2 D-STE, and testing its ability to identify RWM abnormalities. 2 D and real-time 3 D datasets obtained in 32 subjects were analyzed to measure radial, longitudinal and <b>rotational</b> <b>indices</b> of displacement and strain. Segments were classified as normal or abnormal using cardiac MRI. 3 D-STE and 2 D-STE indices did not correlate well and showed wide limits of inter-technique agreement despite the minimal biases. In normal segments, 3 D-STE showed: (1) higher displacements, due the out-of-plane motion component; (2) smaller SDs, indicating tighter normal ranges; (3) gradual decrease in displacement and reversal in rotation from base to apex. In abnormal segments, all 3 D-STE indices were reduced. In conclusion, this is the first study to evaluate the new 3 D-STE technique for measurements of RWM indices and demonstrate its superiority over 2 D-STE. 1...|$|R

50|$|The on time setting {{determines the}} length or {{duration}} of the spark. Hence, a longer on time produces a deeper cavity for that spark and all subsequent sparks for that cycle, creating a rougher finish on the workpiece. The reverse is true for a shorter on time.

A longer off time, for example, allows the flushing of dielectric fluid through a nozzle to clean out the eroded debris, thereby avoiding a short circuit.

40|$|Abstract—The lack of {{proprioceptive}} feedback {{is a serious}} defi-ciency of current prosthetic control systems. The Osseo-Magnetic Link (OML) is a novel humeral or wrist rotation control system that could preserve proprioception. It utilizes a magnet implanted within the residual bone and sensors mounted in the prosthetic socket to detect magnetic field vectors and determine the bone’s orientation. This allows the use of volitional bone rotation to control a prosthetic rotator. We evaluated {{the performance of the}} OML using a physical model of a transhumeral residual limb. A small Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnet was placed in a model humerus, inside a model upper arm. Four three-axis Hall-effect sensors were mounted on a ring 3 cm distal to the magnet. An optimization algorithm based on Newton’s method determined the position and orientation of the magnet within the model humerus under various conditions, including bone translations, interference, and magnet misalignment. The orientation of the model humerus was determined within 3 for rotations centered in the arm; an additional 6 error was found for translations 20 mm from center. Adjustments in sensor placement may reduce these errors. The results demonstrate that the OML is a feasible solution for providing prosthesis rotation control while preserving <b>rotational</b> proprioception. <b>Index</b> Terms—Hall-effect, optimization, proprioception, pros-thesis control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} rotationally invariant space-time (ST) trellis codes with a 4 -D {{rectangular signal}} constellation for data transmission over fading channels using two transmit antennas. The rotational invariance {{is a good}} property to have that may alleviate {{the task of the}} carrier phase tracking circuit in the receiver. The transmitted data stream is segmented into eight bit blocks and quadrature amplitude modulated using a 256 point 4 -D signal constellation whose 2 -D constituent constellation is a 16 point square constellation doubly partitioned. The 4 -D signal constellation is simply the Cartesian product of the 2 -D signal constellation with itself and has 32 subsets. The partition is performed on one side into four subsets A, B, C, and D with increased minimum-squared Euclidian distance, {{and on the other side}} into four rings, where each ring includes four points of equal energy. We propose both linear and nonlinear ST trellis codes and perform simulations using an appropriate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model. The 4 -D ST codes constructed here demonstrate about the same frame error rate (FER) performance as their 2 -D counterparts, having however the added value of <b>rotational</b> invariance. <b>Index</b> Terms: Antenna diversity, MIMO systems, multidimensional constellations, rotational invariance, space-time coded modulation, wireless communications.

Methods: Twelve dogs {{were used in}} this study. The steerable pacing electrodes were positioned into right heart through the superior or inferior vena cava, into LV through aorta across the aortic valve. The steerable pacing electrodes were positioned individually in the right atrium (RA), right ventricular apex (RVA), RV outflow tract (RVOT), His bundle (HB), LV apex (LVA) and LV high septum (LVS), individual pacing mode was applied at 10 minutes interval for at least 5 minutes from each position under fluoroscopy and ultrasound guidance and at stabilized hemodynamic conditions. LV short-axis images at the apical and basal levels were obtained during sinus rhythm and pacing. Offline STE analysis was performed. Rotation, twist, time to peak rotation (TPR), time to peak twist (TPT), and apical-basal rotation delay (<b>rotational</b> synchronization <b>index,</b> RSI) values were compared at various conditions.

This work extends the Mg II index to the NOAA 9 SBUV 2 instrument and shows that the variations in absolute value between Mg II index data sets caused by interinstrument differences do not affect the ability to track temporal variations. The NOAA 9 Mg II index accurately represents solar rotational modulation but contains more day-to-day noise than the Nimbus 7 Mg II index. Solar variability at other UV wavelengths is estimated by deriving scale factors between the Mg II <b>index</b> <b>rotational</b> variations and at those selected wavelengths.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} designed {{to take full advantage}} of the high dimensionality (photometric, astrometric, temporal) of the DANCe survey to derive self-consistent and robust membership probabilities of the Pleiades cluster. We aim at developing a methodology to infer membership probabilities to the Pleiades cluster from the DANCe multidimensional astro-photometric data set in a consistent way throughout the entire derivation. The determination of the membership probabilities has to be applicable to censored data and must incorporate the measurement uncertainties into the inference procedure. We use Bayes' theorem and a curvilinear forward model for the likelihood of the measurements of cluster members in the colour-magnitude space, to infer posterior membership probabilities. The distribution of the cluster members proper motions and the distribution of contaminants in the full multidimensional astro-photometric space is modelled with a mixture-of-Gaussians likelihood. We analyse several representation spaces composed of the proper motions plus a subset of the available magnitudes and colour indices. We select two prominent representation spaces composed of variables selected using feature relevance determination techniques based in Random Forests, and analyse the resulting samples of high probability candidates. We consistently find lists of high probability (p > 0. 9975) candidates with ≈ 1000 sources, 4 to 5 times more than obtained in the most recent astro-photometric studies of the cluster. The methodology presented here is ready for application in data sets that include more dimensions, such as radial and/or <b>rotational</b> velocities, spectral <b>indices</b> and variability.

40|$|Os primeiros polietilenos de baixa densidade (PEBDs) foram produzidos em reatores de alta-pressão de tecnologia {{autoclave}}, resultando em materiais com boas propriedades ópticas e facilmente processáveis em injeção, extrusão de filmes plano ou balão e revestimento por extrusão, tanto na forma pura quanto em misturas com polietilenos de baixa densidade linear (PEBDLs). No entanto, as plantas autoclave têm se tornado cada vez mais escassas no mundo, já que novos investimentos têm sido realizados em unidades industriais maiores e mais produtivas de tecnologia tubular. Assim, a compreensão das diferenças físicas, estruturais e principalmente reológicas entre PEBDs destas duas tecnologias é o objetivo principal deste trabalho. Além disso, pretende-se estudar o comportamento reológico destes PEBDs no processo de revestimento por extrusão, que é um dos mais críticos em termos de reologia. Para isso, foram selecionados três PEBDs de tecnologia autoclave (A 1, A 2 e A 3) e um de tecnologia tubular (T 1) e foram preparadas misturas de T 1 e A 1. As amostras foram caracterizadas em relação à densidade, temperaturas de fusão e cristalização e grau de cristalinidade por calorimetria diferencial de varredura (DSC), massas molares médias (Mn, Mw, Mz) e polidispersão (PD) por cromatogradia de permeação de gel (GPC); e com relação ao comportamento reológico, tendo sido avaliadas quanto ao índice de fluidez, reometria rotacional, reometria capilar, resistência do fundido e análise dinâmico-mecânica (DMA). Os resultados indicam que as amostras de PEBDs de tecnologia autoclave avaliadas foram produzidos em condições de reação distintas, cada qual resultando em determinada polidispersão e quantidade de cadeias de alta massa molar, responsáveis pelo aumento da elasticidade e resistência do fundido. O PEBD de tecnologia tubular apresentou menor PD, refletindo em menor grau de elasticidade e pseudoplasticidade. O acréscimo de diferentes teores de A 1 (mais ramificado) em T 1 (menos ramificado) resultou em uma interessante combinação entre as características reológicas das duas amostras de PEBDs. Finalmente, conclui-se que diferenças significativas de propriedades físicas, térmicas, estruturais e reológicas entre os PEBDs podem influenciar o desempenho de neck-in e draw-down em processamento e também no produto final. The first {{low density polyethylene}}s (LDPEs) {{were produced}} in high-pressure reactors and autoclave technology, resulting in materials with good optical properties and easily processed in injection, cast and blown film extrusion and extrusion coating, either pure or blended with {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPEs). However, autoclave plants have become increasingly scarce in the world, as new investments have been made in larger and more productive plants based on tubular technology. Thus, understanding the physical, structural and rheological differences between LDPEs of these two technologies is the main objective of this work. Furthermore, this work aims to study the rheological behavior of the LDPEs in the extrusion coating process, {{which is one of the}} most critical in terms of rheology. For this purpose, three autoclave LDPEs (A 1, A 2 and A 3) and one tubular LDPE (T 1) were selected and some blends were prepared with different proportions of A 1 and T 1. The samples were characterized with respect to density, melting/crystallization temperatures and degree of cristalinity by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), average molecular weight distribution (Mn, Mw, Mz) and polydispersity (PD) by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and also the rheological characterization was performed by assessing melt <b>index,</b> <b>rotational</b> rheometry, capillary rheometry, melt strength and dynamic-mechanical analysis (DMA). The results indicate that the autoclave LDPEs were produced at distinct reaction conditions, each one resulting in particular polydispersity and level of long chain branching, which are responsible for elasticity and melt strength. The tubular LDPE presented lower PD, reflecting a lower degree of elasticity and shear thinning. The addition of A 1 (more branched) in hot blends with T 1 (less branched) resulted in an interesting combination of rheological characteristics of the two LDPEs. Finally, it was concluded that distinct physical, thermal, structural and rheological properties between the LDPEs may influence neck-in and draw-down performance during processing and also the final product characteristics...|$|R
