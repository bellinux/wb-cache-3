25|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of the de-epithelialization of the tissues involves cutting the epithelium of a central area on the medial and lateral aspects of each labium minus (small lip), either with a scalpel or with a medical laser. This labiaplasty technique reduces the vertical excess tissue, whilst preserving the natural <b>rugosity</b> (corrugated free-edge) of the labia minora, and thus preserves the sensory and erectile characteristics of the labia. Yet, the technical disadvantage of de-epithelialization is that the width of the individual labium might increase if a large area of labial tissue must be de-epithelialized to achieve the labial reduction.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} by de-epithelialization {{cuts and}} removes the unwanted tissue and preserves the natural <b>rugosity</b> (wrinkled free-edge) of the labia minora, and preserves the capabilities for tumescence and sensation. Yet, {{when the patient}} presents with much labial tissue, a combination procedure of de-epithelialization and clamp-resection is usually more effective for achieving the aesthetic outcome established by the patient and her surgeon. In {{the case of a}} woman with labial webbing (redundant folding) between the labia minora and the labia majora, the de-epithelialization labiaplasty includes an additional resection technique — such as the five-flap Z-plasty ("jumping man plasty") — to establish a regular and symmetric shape for the reduced labia minora.|$|E

In a randomized block design, five different <b>rugosities</b> (smooth, 0. 1 mm, 0. 5 mm, 1 mm, 5 mm) were exposed to natural fouling in the Baltic Sea. In four experiments, test panels were colonized by Mytilus edulis, Polydora dliata, Balanus improvisus, diatoms, hydrozoa, bryozoa, and several ciliates. Settlement densities and microtopographical preferences for pits or elevations as a function of grain size were evaluated. <b>Rugosities</b> influenced settlement densities and the microtopographical preferences of almost all investigated species. Settlement densities were generally lowest on smooth panels, with most species showing distinct preferences for different <b>rugosities.</b> While a preference for pits was frequent, in some species the proportion of individuals settling on elevations significantly increased with roughness. These data on microtopographical preferences of different species give new insights into interactions between settlement behaviour, surface roughness, boundary layer hydrodynamics and community structure...|$|R

2500|$|The dermis {{generating}} the horn is {{anchored to the}} boss by interpenetration between rugosities – various irregularities of bone, which it creates by deposition. This tissue is a specialisation of dermal armour, which, whenever it attaches to bone, deposits the rugosities to strengthen the attachment. The author states that <b>rugosity</b> is [...] "a bony signature of dermal armor". Cranial <b>rugosity</b> is an indication, but not a sure sign, of a horn. If, on the other hand, an annular (ring-shaped) pattern is visible in the <b>rugosity,</b> it is due to [...] "stress concentration {{at the edges of}} horns" [...] and is [...] "the signature for epidermal horns".|$|E
2500|$|Hieronymus found annular rugosities in {{all living}} and some fossil Rhinocerotidae. The rings had {{previously}} been noted on additional fossils. To date Elasmotherium has not been examined for rings under lighting designed to show them up; however, based on the observations of other palaeontologists, the author says [...] "squamosal rugosity" [...] is the [...] "most pronounced cranial <b>rugosity</b> in the elasmotherine lineage". This fact suggests an especially firm attachment was required, which, combined with the extraordinarily large hump of muscle for managing the head, could suggest a large and heavy horn. In the early 19th century {{the state of the}} fossils had not yet revealed the presence of a horn. From around 1910 and ever since then, palaeontologists have not ventured a mathematical estimate but rather have preferred occasionally to refer to the horn as immense, enormous, great or huge (these words turn up more often in popularising works than in scientific articles). As {{the size and shape of}} the horn would depend on the concentration of melanin and calcium, and no known indicator of those remains, any further estimate of horn morphology is purely speculative.|$|E
2500|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of a central wedge-resection involves cutting and removing a partial-thickness wedge of tissue from the thickest portion of the labium minus. Unlike the edge-resection technique, the resection pattern of the central wedge technique preserves the natural <b>rugosity</b> ("wrinkled" [...] edge) of the labia minora. If performed as a full-thickness resection, there exists the potential risk of damaging the pertinent labial nerves, which can result in painful neuromas, and numbness. A partial thickness removal of mucosa and skin, leaving the submucosa intact, decreases the risk of this complication. F. Giraldo et al. procedurally refined the central wedge resection technique with an additional 90-degree Z-plasty technique, which produces a refined surgical scar that is less tethered, and diminishes the physical tensions exerted upon the surgical-incision wound, and, therefore, reduces the likelihood of a notched (scalloped-edge) scar. The central wedge-resection technique is a demanding surgical procedure, and difficulty can arise with judging the correct amount of labial skin to resect, which might result in either undercorrection (persistent tissue-redundancy), or the overcorrection (excessive tension to the surgical wound), and an increased probability of surgical-wound separation. The benefit of this technique is that an extended wedge can be brought upwards towards the prepuce to treat a prominent clitoral hood without a separate incision. This leads to a natural contour for the finished result, and avoids direct incisions near the highly-sensitive clitoris.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRelying on {{the effect}} of {{microscopic}} asperities, one can mathematically justify that viscous fluids adhere completely on the boundary of an impermeable domain. The ru-gosity effect accounts asymptotically for the transformation of complete slip boundary conditions on a rough surface in total adherence boundary conditions, as the amplitude of the <b>rugosities</b> vanishes. The decreasing rate (average velocity divided by the amplitude of the <b>rugosities)</b> computed on close flat layers is definitely influenced by the geometry. Recent results prove that this ratio has a uniform upper bound for certain geometries, like periodical and " almost Lipschitz " boundaries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove that such a result holds for arbitrary (non-periodical) crystalline boundaries and general (non-smooth) periodical boundaries...|$|R

The sculpture consists of irregular concentric <b>rugosities</b> or wrinkles, generally more distant from each other towards the apex, more crowded towards the margin, with a tendency to form lamellae.

2500|$|The {{original}} labiaplasty {{technique was}} simple resection of tissues at the free {{edge of the}} labia minora. One resection-technique variation features a clamp placed across the area of labial tissue to be resected, {{in order to establish}} hemostatis (stopped blood-flow), and the surgeon resects the tissues, and then sutures the cut labium minus or labia minora. This procedure is used by most surgeons because it is easiest to perform. The technical disadvantages of the labial-edge resection technique are the loss of the natural <b>rugosity</b> (wrinkles) of the labia minora free edges, thus, aesthetically, it produces an unnatural appearance to the vulva, and also presents a greater risk of damaging the pertinent nerve endings. Moreover, there also exists the possibility of everting (turning outwards) the inner lining of the labia, which then makes visible the normally hidden internal, pink labial tissues. The advantages of edge-resection include removal of the hyper-pigmented (darkened) irregular labial edges with a linear scar. Another disadvantage of the trim or [...] "amputation" [...] method, is that it is unable to excise redundant tissues of the clitoral hood, when present. Complete amputation of the labia minora is more common with this technique, which often requires additional surgery to correct. In addition, the trim method does not address the clitoral hood. Clitoral hood deformities are common with this approach, again requiring additional corrective surgery. Some women complain of a [...] "small penis" [...] when the trim procedure is performed, owing to the un-addressed clitoral hood tissue and completely removed (amputated) labia minor. Most plastic surgeons do not perform this procedure, and instead favor the extended wedge approach, which is technically more demanding, but produces a more natural result and is able to create a natural and proportioned appearance to the vulva. Reconstructive procedures are often required after the trim (amputation) labiaplasty.|$|E
6000|$|The {{whole family}} of the Phasmidæ, or spectres, to which this insect belongs, {{is more or less}} imitative, and a great number of the species are called [...] "walking-stick insects," [...] from their {{singular}} resemblance to twigs and branches.

They hang loosely about shrubs in the forest, and have the extraordinary habit of stretching out their legs unsymmetrically, so as to render the deception more complete. One of these creatures obtained by myself in Borneo (Ceroxylus laceratus) was covered over with foliaceous excrescences of a clear olive green colour, so as exactly to resemble a stick grown over by a creeping moss or jungermannia. The Dyak who brought it me assured me it was grown over with moss although alive, and it was only after a most minute examination that I could convince myself it was not so.|$|E

They have a remarkable peculiarity about them--namely, a hollow wick,--that beautiful peculiarity which Argand introduced into the lamp, and made so valuable. To those who receive such presents from the East, I may just say that this and such like materials gradually undergo a change which gives them on the surface a dull and dead appearance; but they may easily be restored to their original beauty, if the surface be rubbed with a clean cloth or silk handkerchief, so as to polish the little <b>rugosity</b> or roughness: this will restore the beauty of the colours. I have so rubbed one of these candles, and you see the difference between it and the other which has not been polished, but which may be restored by the same process.

60|$|It is, however, in {{the insect}} world that this {{principle}} of the adaptation of animals to their environment is most fully and strikingly developed. In order to understand how general this is, {{it is necessary to}} enter somewhat into details, as we shall thereby be better able to appreciate the significance of the still more remarkable phenomena we shall presently have to discuss. It seems to be in proportion to their sluggish motions or the absence of other means of defence, that insects possess the protective colouring. In the tropics there are thousands of species of insects which rest during the day clinging to the bark of dead or fallen trees; and the greater portion of these are delicately mottled with gray and brown tints, which though symmetrically disposed and infinitely varied, yet blend so completely with the usual colours of the bark, that at two or three feet distance they are quite undistinguishable. In some cases a species is known to frequent only one species of tree. This is the case with the common South American long-horned beetle (Onychocerus scorpio) which, Mr. Bates informed me, is found only on a rough-barked tree, called Tapiribá, on the Amazon. It is very abundant, but so exactly does it resemble the bark in colour and <b>rugosity,</b> and so closely does it cling to the branches, that until it moves it is absolutely invisible! An allied species (O. concentricus) is found only at Pará, on a distinct species of tree, the bark of which it resembles with equal accuracy. Both these insects are abundant, and we may fairly conclude that the protection they derive from this strange concealment is {{at least one of the}} causes that enable the race to flourish.|$|E
60|$|The {{adaptation}} of the external colouring of animals to their conditions of life has long been recognised, and has been imputed either to an originally created specific peculiarity, or to the direct action of climate, soil, or food. Where the former explanation has been accepted, it has completely checked inquiry, since we could never get any further than {{the fact of the}} adaptation. There was nothing more to be known about the matter. The second explanation was soon found to be quite inadequate to deal with all the varied phases of the phænomena, and to be contradicted by many well-known facts. For example, wild rabbits are always of grey or brown tints well suited for concealment among grass and fern. But when these rabbits are domesticated, without any change of climate or food, they vary into white or black, and these varieties may be multiplied to any extent, forming white or black races. Exactly the same thing has occurred with pigeons; {{and in the case of}} rats and mice, the white variety has not been shown to be at all dependent on alteration of climate, food, or other external conditions. In many cases the wings of an insect not only assume the exact tint of the bark or leaf it is accustomed to rest on, but the form and veining of the leaf or the exact <b>rugosity</b> of the bark is imitated; and these detailed modifications cannot be reasonably imputed to climate or to food, since in many cases the species does not feed on the substance it resembles, and when it does, no reasonable connexion can be shown to exist between the supposed cause and the effect produced. It was reserved for the theory of Natural Selection to solve all these problems, and many others which were not at first supposed to be directly connected with them. To make these latter intelligible, it will be necessary to give a sketch of the whole series of phænomena which may be classed under the head of useful or protective resemblances.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of using <b>rugosity</b> for two- and three-dimensional surface analyses, methodological inconsistency has been problematic. Building off recent advances, the new arc-chord ratio (ACR) <b>rugosity</b> index is capable of measuring the <b>rugosity</b> of two-dimensional profiles and three-dimensional surfaces using a single method (Du Preez 2015). The ACR <b>rugosity</b> index {{is defined as the}} contoured (real) surface area divided by the area of the surface orthogonally projected onto a plane of best fit (POBF), where the POBF is a function (linear interpolation) of the boundary data only. Using a POBF, instead of an arbitrary horizontal geometric plane, results in an important advantage of the ACR <b>rugosity</b> index: unlike most <b>rugosity</b> indices ACR <b>rugosity</b> is not confounded by slope.|$|E
