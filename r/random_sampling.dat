These Film Library copies were a <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> of viewing prints for various episodes, along with seven of the nine episodes that had {{originally}} been telerecorded onto film for editing and/or transmission, rather than recorded to videotape.

5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to <b>random</b> <b>sampling.</b> In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
50|$|The {{best way}} to avoid a biased or unrepresentative sample is to select a <b>random</b> <b>sample,</b> also known as a {{probability}} <b>sample.</b> A <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> is defined as a sample where each individual member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected as part of the sample. Several types of <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> are simple <b>random</b> <b>samples,</b> systematic <b>samples,</b> stratified <b>random</b> <b>samples,</b> and cluster <b>random</b> <b>samples.</b>|$|R

5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{connection}} between the tree and a new state is frequently limited by a growth factor.If the <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> is further from its nearest state in the tree than this limit allows, a new state at the maximum distance from the tree along the line to the <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> is used instead of the <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> itself.The <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> can then be viewed as controlling the direction of the tree growth while the growth factor determines its rate.This maintains the space-filling bias of the RRT while limiting the size of the incremental growth.|$|R

25|$|As {{an example}} of the above, a <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of size 400 will give a margin of error, at a 95% {{confidence}} level, of 0.98/20 or 0.049 - just under 5%.

25|$|However, {{systematic}} sampling is {{especially vulnerable to}} periodicities in the list.

25|$|Cluster {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} clustered sampling) generally increases {{the variability of}} sample estimates above that of simple <b>random</b> <b>sampling,</b> {{depending on how the}} clusters differ between one another as compared to the within-cluster variation.

25|$|Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad {{class of}} {{computational}} algorithms {{that rely on}} repeated <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> to obtain numerical results.

25|$|If {{the exact}} {{confidence}} intervals are used, then {{the margin of}} error takes into account both sampling error and non-sampling error. If an approximate confidence interval is used (for example, by assuming the distribution is normal and then modeling the confidence interval accordingly), then {{the margin of error}} may only take <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> error into account.

His estimates used Bayes' theorem with a uniform prior probability and assumed that his sample was random. Alexander Ivanovich Chuprov introduced sample surveys to Imperial Russia in the 1870s.|$|E
