50|$|Halibut is {{a common}} name principally applied to the two {{flatfish}} in the genus Hippoglossus from the family of <b>right-eye</b> <b>flounders.</b> Less commonly, and in some regions only, other species of flatfish are {{also referred to as}} being halibuts. The word is derived from haly (holy) and butte (flat fish), for its popularity on Catholic holy days. Halibut are demersal fish and are highly regarded as a food fish.|$|E
50|$|Alaska plaice (Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus) is a {{saltwater}} fish {{that live in}} the North Pacific Ocean. Alaska plaice are <b>right-eye</b> <b>flounders</b> which live on the sandy bottoms of the continental shelf, up to 600 metres deep. Their geographic range is from the Gulf of Alaska in the east, to the Chukchi Sea in the north, to the Sea of Japan in the west. Alaska plaice feed mostly on polychaetes, but also eat amphipods and echiurans.|$|E
40|$|Teleosts {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse groups of vertebrates. They utilize a wide array of {{reproductive}} strategies and tactics to overcome the challenges of the many ecological niches they inhabit. The most common reproductive method for teleosts is oviparity. Oviparous animals lay eggs with little or no embryonic development from the mother. The embryos are supplied with nutrition via yolk. Vitellogenesis is the process of the ovary sequestering yolk. It is regulated by exogenous environmental cues that act on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis. Through a series of hormonal controls, the liver produces the yolk precursor, vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is secreted by the liver and absorbed by the growing oocyte by receptor mediated endocytosis. There it is cleaved into the two main yolk proteins which are subsequently used by the growing embryo. The biggest source of nutrition is the yolk protein lipovitellin which also plays a key role in marine teleosts’ ability to osmoregulate their eggs. Lipovitellin is a large glyco-phospho-lipo-protein ca. 200 kDa. Large proteins usually denature easily. However, prior evidence shows that fish lipovitellins are thermally stable. Using differential scanning calorimetry, I quantify lipovitellin’s thermostability amongst four <b>right-eye</b> <b>flounders</b> (Pleuronectidae: winter flounder, American plaice, witch flounder, and yellowtail flounder). Differential scanning calorimetry allows direct interpretation of all thermodynamic properties; however, Lipovitellin was too large and precipitated before other thermodynamic properties could be determined. Pleuronectid lipovitellins all showed high melting points indicative of high thermostability. This shows that despite differing life histories, lipovitellin is conserved. Presence of the pre-cursor, vitellogenin in male or juvenile fish is used as a biomarker for xenoestrogens, a type of endocrine disrupting chemicals that blocks or mimics natural estrogens. They are known to disrupt aquatic life by interfering with natural development and reproduction. A major biological side effect of xenoestrogens is the accumulation of vitellogenin. This effect has made vitellogenin a useful biomarker for monitoring levels of contamination. Unfortunately, vitellogenin can vary greatly in its immunological and structural characteristics, which means that species-specific assays are necessary. This study took the first step in developing an immunoassay for bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix). Vitellogenin was induced by injecting a group of bluefish with an estrogen, estradiol, and the resulting vitellogenin was isolated from the serum of males. The protein was characterized as vitellogenin by determining its large Stokes radius in gel permeation chromatography combined with its characteristic peptide molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis...|$|E

50|$|The {{large-scale}} <b>right-eye</b> <b>flounder</b> is, as {{its name}} suggests, a right-eyed flatfish. It has a slender body, 2.3 times {{long as it is}} wide, with a short pectoral fin.|$|R
50|$|The {{large-scale}} <b>right-eye</b> <b>flounder</b> is, as {{its name}} suggests, a right-eyed flatfish. It has a slender body, 2.2 to 2.4 times {{long as it is}} wide, with a short pectoral fin. It has a tentacle on each eye.|$|R
50|$|The narrow-fin <b>right-eye</b> <b>flounder</b> is, as {{its name}} suggests, a right-eyed flatfish. It has a slender body, almost three times {{long as it is}} wide, with large eyes and a small {{symmetrical}} mouth. The eyes have dark tentacles. The lateral line curves strongly above the pectoral fin, and the caudal fin is pointed. The upper (eyed) side is brown, with indistinct blotches on the fins and darker blotches on the caudal and pectoral fins. The underside is yellowish-white.|$|R
40|$|March 15, 2015 An {{attempt was}} made to analyze the {{relationship}} between the change in the quantity of fishery resources and the change of phosphorus load deposited into Osaka Bay. The phosphorus load had steadily increased from 1955 to 1975, then decreased slowly towards the 2000 s. The major benthic fishery organisms, such as octopus, shrimp and crab, mantis shrimp, tongue-fish and <b>right-eye</b> <b>flounder,</b> were employed to examine the characteristics of change in fishery resources in relation to water environments of Osaka Bay. Excluding shrimp and crab, catch amounts showed a largely equivalent response to phosphorus load in the bay. The results presented here demonstrate that a close relationship exists between phosphorus emissions and benthic fishery resources in Osaka Bay...|$|R
