25|$|The {{conversation}} now revealed {{took place}} in 2006 {{with the aim of}} explaining the large outgoing amounts of money from the company's headquarters in London at the time of approval of the project. According to some sources contacted in London by TVI, José Sócrates remains the main suspect of British police. The British police are now set to send to the Portuguese authorities the 25 volumes of all research done in this process in England. The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major financial fraud in Britain, has seen its activity limited due to the lack cooperation of the Portuguese authorities in investigating the case. The first official meeting took place only on 17 November 2008 in The Hague, the headquarters of Eurojust, a body which is designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in the EU. The judge Cândida Almeida, director of DCIAP (Central Department for investigation and prosecution), which coordinates the department's prosecutor who investigates the case, refused a joint <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> by the English.

2500|$|During this time, the United States was {{involved}} in diplomatic negotiations with whaling nations such as Iceland and Japan. However, the U.S. {{was considered to be}} responsible for whaling troubles by many Icelanders. In October 1986, President Ronald Reagan was booed during the [...] "Superpower Summit" [...] and some lobbied against the American air base at Keflavik. It was argued that the U.S. and the IWC had no standing to interfere with Iceland's sovereignty regarding whale research. Despite the diplomatic tension, U.S. negotiators struck an agreement that would allow Iceland to take 20 sei whales, without the threat of U.S. sanctions (under the Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen's Protection Act the U.S. President could establish an embargo against Iceland's fisheries). Iceland was required to submit a full <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> in 1988. Japan also agreed not to purchase whale meat from Iceland to secure fishing rights in Alaskan waters.|$|E
2500|$|By 1989, boycotts of Icelandic fish, {{organized}} by Greenpeace and other anti-whaling organizations, {{began to take}} a toll on Iceland's economy. Major buyers, such as supermarket and restaurant chains (for example, Wendy's and Long John Silver) canceled their contracts. Burger King reduced its purchases of Icelandic fish by 20%, leading to lost sales worth an estimated $1.5 million per year. The German consortium Tengelmann – which operated 600 supermarkets and 850 warehouses – also stopped purchasing Icelandic seafood due to Iceland's whaling policy, leading to lost sales of an estimated $1.5–1.6 million per year. Aldi Sud stopped purchasing Icelandic shrimp, leading to lost sales of ca $2.6 million per year. In total, Icelandic seafood exporters sustained losses of about $29 million by 1989, whereas the value of whale products had been only $4 million in 1987. Captain D's also stopped purchasing Icelandic seafood. Red Lobster stopped purchasing Icelandic lobster. [...] Also, a strike of Iceland's scientists union meant no experts {{would be available to}} conduct research aboard whaling vessels. In 1989, Iceland announced it would not continue whaling.

The benefits and limitations of using <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> in separation from the actual experience of conducting empirical research are discussed. It is concluded that <b>research</b> <b>proposals,</b> used as stand-alone learning exercises, can prove particularly valuable where there might be concerns about gaining access to appropriate settings or getting ethical approval for practical research activity.

In this paper, {{we focus on}} the evaluation of frontier scientific research projects. We argue that the "intellectual distance" between the knowledge embodied in <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> and an evaluator's own expertise systematically relates to the evaluations given (and consequent resource allocation). We empirically evaluate effects in data collected from a grant proposal process at a leading research university in which we randomized the assignment of evaluators and proposals to generate 2, 130 evaluator-proposal pairs. We find evaluators systematically give lower scores to <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> closer to their own areas of expertise, and to highly novel <b>research</b> <b>proposals.</b> We interpret the empirical patterns in relation to a range of theoretical mechanisms and discuss implications for policy, managerial intervention and allocation of resources in the ongoing accumulation of scientific knowledge...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAimTo {{examine the}} {{engagement}} of French registered nurses with the Ministry of Health's initiative to spur scientific inquiry in the community. BackgroundFrench nursing research {{has suffered from}} a lack of dedicated funding. Positive signs of change have recently appeared, with the launch of the first national public funding programme dedicated to nursing research. This initiative, begun in 2010, was launched by the French Ministry of Health. Through this initiative, 149 registered nurses, serving as principal investigators, and their teams submitted <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> between 2010 and 2011. The administrative guidelines of the funding programme are clearly oriented towards producing quantitative and exogenous nursing research. MethodA cross-sectional analysis of 149 nursing research projects submitted during the first and second years of a French national funding programme for hospital-based nursing research was conducted. <b>Research</b> <b>proposals</b> were included in the analysis whether they received funding or not. Data collection took place in 2011. The categories used in the analysis were the following: (1) the socio-demographic data on the registered nurse principal investigators, (2) the research teams and (3) the <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> (methodologies, bibliography, focus of the research, output, the status of the <b>research</b> <b>proposals).</b> ResultsThis study highlights the presence of methodological homogeneity among the <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> submitted for funding. Clear tendencies were towards interventional and quantitative studies and those with an exogenous factor research objective. Between 2010 and 2011, 25 projects were funded out of 149 submitted. They were mostly quantitative and/or focused on the exogenous factors in patient care.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{measures}} have been implemented at international level {{to ensure that there}} is a greater focus on sex differences in health research. This study evaluates the effect of various formal incentives that were introduced by a Dutch financer of health research to encourage applicants to include sex differences in <b>research</b> <b>proposals.</b> Methods We sampled 213 health <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> submitted in 2003 to the programmes Prevention (N = 104) and Innovation (N = 109) by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw). These proposals were analysed and categorized with regard to the expressed intention to take sex differences into consideration. Furthermore, those proposals in which such intention was absent were appraised by researchers to determine whether an intention of this kind would have been relevant. Results We found that 23 % of proposals submitted to Prevention (incentive: programme specific instructions) and 10 % of those submitted to Innovation (general set of guidelines) took account of sex differences (difference 13 %; 95 % CI: 3. 1 – 22. 9). Conversely, 66 % of the <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> in Prevention, and 20 % in Innovation, failed to take sex differences into consideration, even though this might well have been relevant. Conclusion There is still insufficient incentive for those submitting <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> to ZonMw to systematically incorporate sex differences when drafting such documents. The provisions in ZonMw's policy need to be amended and better monitored. For this, we formulated some recommendations. </p...|$|R
