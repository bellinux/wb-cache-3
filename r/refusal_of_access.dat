50|$|On 6 July 1993, new {{tensions}} arose {{following the}} Croatian government's decision to re-open the strategic Maslenica bridge on 18 July - Croatia {{was cut in}} half while the bridge was in Serb hands. The UNPROFOR forces mandated to monitor the withdrawal of Croatian forces from the area {{had been unable to}} deploy, due to the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> by Croat authorities.

5000|$|Given {{that the}} United States Navy had {{a policy of}} {{deliberate}} ambiguity during the Cold War and refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard its warships and support ships, these laws essentially refused access to New Zealand ports for all United States Navy vessels. In February 1985, a port-visit request by the United States for the guided-missile destroyer USS Buchanan was refused by New Zealand, as the Buchanan was capable of launching nuclear depth bombs. As this occurred after the government unofficially invited the United States to send a ship, the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> was interpreted by the United States as a deliberate slight.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{recognising}} a general principle <b>of</b> public <b>access</b> to documents held by public authorities, both in national and in Community law. Once such a fundamental principle of Community law is established, the exceptions to public access to documents laid down in the internal rules of the institutions must not be construed or interpreted in a manner which will render it impossible to attain the objective of openness. To this effect, and {{in the light of}} the increasing � but still marginal � judicial review <b>of</b> the institutions <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to documents, the European Ombudsman's inquires into public access to documents and his decisions on individual complaints of maladministration have provided an efficient and cost-effective recourse for European citizens. However, the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and the subsequent adoption of secondary legislation is unlikely to resolve all the inadequacies of the current public access regime in Community law. This calls for a uniform interpretation of the law on public access to documents in the Community legal order.

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the status of initiating pattern of hemodialysis (HD). Five hundred-three patients in 8 University Hospitals were included.

Most patients started unplanned HD (81. 9 %) and the most common initial access type was CVC (86. 3 %). The main reason for unplanned HD and high rate of CVC use was patient-related factors such as <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> permanent <b>access</b> creation and failure to attend scheduled clinic appointments. Predialysis care was performed in 57. 9 % of patients and only 24. 1 % of these patients started planned HD and 18. 9 % used permanent accesses initially.

Human Right Watch interviewed 90 prisoners, among which 72 {{said they had been}} tortured during interrogation. Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW director, said that the Iraqi provisional government was not holding to its promise to stand by Human Rights: [...] "A new Iraqi government requires more than a change of leadership - it requires a change of attitude about basic human dignity" [...] [...] "During the first three days there was continuous torture. I was beaten with an aluminum rod and with cables. ? Then I was told to sign a statement with my hands tied behind my back, so I didn't even see the paper and I don't know what I signed." [...] Among bad treatments were such elements as beatings with cables, electric shocks, including on genitals, being tied and blindfolded for days, cells so crowded that it is only possible to stand, arbitrary detention, <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> trials, <b>access</b> to lawyers or contacts with families. These treatments were inflicted to insurgents and criminals alike.|$|R

40|$|Liberalization and {{privatization}} {{of the electricity}} industry {{is one of the}} most important processes in the few last years. Even when the electricity market is fully open, substantial barriers to competition often remain. These barriers are <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the market, the lack of capacity in interconnectors and long-term contracts. The process of liberalization has shown that a third-party access to the network is a critical and important factor in ensuring a real and effective liberalization of the market. The process of liberalization has also supported new ways and forms of energy trading including financial contracts instead of purely physical contracts for the delivery of electricity. It is a question if the benefits of liberalization of the electricity industry compared with a regulated private monopoly or public monopoly were profitable. Someone could argue that the liberalization of electricity tends to bring benefit to monopoly structures and increase prices of electricity in industry. This work tries to present the pros and cons of liberalization in the electricity industry while taking in consideration the best means of making the liberatization as much profitable and useful as possible...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} free access to public information {{in some of the}} new European Union member states from a comparative perspective and tries to highlight some of the best practices in this field that were incorporated or adapted by these countries. It is noted that very often the choice of policy of national governments was determined by past experiences and existing mentalities (see, for example, protection of business data). A sizable part of the analysis is dedicated to exceptions from the rule of free access to public documents. This aspect is important because some of the exclusions leave room for the abuse of public bodies already reluctant to disclose public data. Some considerations regarding the ways in which appeals against the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> are organized were also presented as being relevant to the topic discussed. The last section of the paper focuses on an issue related to free access to public information—namely, the commercial reuse of public data. A distinction needs to be made between the two concepts, because they are usually governed by different regimes and regulations. The authors conclude that, although the jurisdictions examined have relatively progressive legislation regarding free access to public sector information, most challenges occur in practice with regard to implementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{right to}} {{information}} {{as a form of}} right to petition is one of the cornerstones {{in the formation of the}} modern constitutional state and has important ties with the freedom of thought and expression as well as citizens’ right to ask their administration to be accountable. In Turkey, the practices related with the {{right to information}}, as the instrument of making the acts and actions of the government “public”, came to the agenda on the eve of 2000 s, became part of the national legislation, and as of 2015, we commemorated its 10 th anniversary. In the article, the right to information practices will be analyzed by considering the first ten-year period of the practices in Turkey, and also regarding the worldwide experiences and discussions around the issue. The main aim of the study is to elaborate certain practices of the right to information, regulated in the legislation related with the Right to Information in Turkey, and problems encountered in the application process. Also this article will focus on the applications to the Council of Cassation of Right to Information in Turkey since this Council, like European Ombudsman, is the final authority to review the decisions related with partial or full <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>access</b> to the information and documents. The last part of the article is reserved for the evaluations and recommendations on how the practices of right to information contributes to the interaction between citizens and the government and to revive public sphere in the case of Turkey. </p...|$|R
5000|$|In Shabalala v Attorney-General, Transvaal, the {{applicants}} had been indicted {{to stand trial}} in a Provincial Division {{on a charge of}} murder. Before the trial, various applications were made to the trial court on behalf of {{the applicants}}, including an application that they be given copies of the relevant police dockets. The court refused the applications, holding that the applicants had not satisfied it that the documents were [...] "required" [...] by them, within the meaning of section 23 of the Constitution, [...] "for the exercise of any of their rights to a fair trial." [...] It was held that what a fair trial might require depends on the circumstances of each particular case; it is for the trial court to exercise a proper discretion in this regard. The court held that an accused is ordinarily entitled to have access to those documents in the police docket which are exculpatory (or which are prima facie likely to be helpful to the defence)—unless, in very rare cases, the State is able to justify the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> such <b>access</b> {{on the grounds that it}} is not justified for the purposes of a fair trial. Ordinarily the right to a fair trial would include access to the statements of witnesses (whether or not the State intended calling such witnesses) and such of the contents of the docket as are relevant in order to enable an accused person properly to exercise that right. The prosecution might, however, in a particular case, be able to justify the denial <b>of</b> such <b>access</b> on the grounds that it was not justified for the purposes of a fair trial.

40|$|The {{freedom of}} space exploration, {{including}} {{the ability to}} conduct remote sensing activities, is widely accepted by states. The general principles {{set out in the}} Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement were refined in various United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, including the Remote Sensing Principles (RSP) of 1986. Although the RSP support the basic tenets of the outer space treaties and refers to the provision of access to remote sensing data on non-discriminatory terms, the principles are drafted in general terms and fail to provide direction with regard to issues such as the refusal by states to provide access to remote sensing data. Notwithstanding the fact that the RSP makes no provision for such an exception, various states have included provisions in their national legislation allowing for the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to high resolution remote sensing data for national security reasons. In order to evaluate whether there is an existing or new rule of customary international law allowing for the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to remote sensing data on this basis, the state practice and opinio juris of specially affected states were examined. It was found that the conduct of states in this regard constitutes voluntary repeated action for the sake of convenience and is not based on a belief that such conduct is required by a certain rule of law. Accordingly, this study did not find evidence of the requisite state practice and opinio juris to support an existing or new rule of customary international law allowing for the refusal of high resolution remote sensing data for national security reasons. It is argued, however, that this study supports possible emerging state practice in this regard. The terrorist attacks of 9 / 11 was a Grotian moment and resulted in a fundamental change in the concept of national security and what constitutes a threat to national security. The study shows that states predominantly refer to the threat of terrorism when discussing issues of national security. States are concerned that high resolution remote sensing data can be used for terrorist activities, as this imagery can reveal the precise location of roads, buildings and military structures and allow for more precise weapons delivery. Accordingly, it is submitted that the above events have {{paved the way for the}} accelerated development of a new rule of customary international law, namely for states to reserve the right to refuse access to high resolution remote sensing data for national security reasons such as terrorist threats. Customary international law must have the ability to evolve and respond to new developments. Increasing state conduct in this regard points to emerging state practice which may in future be supported by the requisite opinio juris to create a new rule of customary international law.

40|$|The study Unholy Discrimination (Die unheilige Diskriminierung) {{concerns}} {{the clash between}} gender equality and religious freedom, {{and the lack of}} female access to leading spiritual offices. In the Roman-Catholic Church canonic law forbids female priesthood (Can. 1024 “Only a baptised man can validly receive sacred ordination. ”). Islam poses no comparable legal, only social, barriers. In Judaism too there exist primarily de facto inequalities between men and women which, to a large extent, block access to a female rabbinate (apart from inconsistently applied medieval law). The contradiction between the right to non-discrimination and religious communities’ invoking their right to religious freedom needs to be solved by weighing up competing interests. For the latter, the interests (or arguments) are the following: - a long-term uncontested tradition (argument of continuity), - theological reasons (“God’s eternal plan” – interpreted by the clergy; in the Roman-Catholic Church, especially the male sex of Jesus), - the danger of schism (by introducing female priesthood), and - the proven effectiveness of traditional sex roles in the religious field. On {{the other side of the}} balance are, first, the specific features of equality conflicts in the religious field: - the power differentials of counterparts (Catholic women vs. potent religious authority), - the possibility of leaving the religious community (the argument of avoiding the conflict; but also the take-it-or-leave-it-dilemma), and - the argument of Ideological Enterprise (Tendenzbetrieb, enterprises serving ideological ends: as a voluntary member of an enterprise, one is supposed to accept its objectives). Subsequently, the interests of the damaged party carry more weight, if the “interferer” makes it completely impossible for the other side to exercise its fundamental rights. Finally, the counter-arguments must be taken into account when the competing interests are weighed up: - much evidence for the admissibility of female priesthood examined by theological science, - the transition from the hitherto existing consensus to the dissent of many against the “church of men,” - the argument of established practice in all religious communities (female parish leaders in the Roman-Catholic Church, female rabbis in Liberal and Reformed Judaism, female imams in the mosques). In this study the concept of balancing interests is put into concrete terms with three model cases concerning the Catholic Church (1 st case: <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> for a female theology student to seminary, where candidates for priestly ordination receive their theological formation; 2 nd case: refusal of equal payment for male parish leaders [with ordination] and their female fellows [without ordination]; 3 rd case: cancelled election of a female theologian, who was ordained “contra legem”). The weighing up of the opposite interests in these concrete model cases as well as the analysis of the arguments and counterarguments lead to the result that the (nationally and internationally guaranteed) principle of equality between men and women is to be valued more highly than the appeal to a very long tradition of male religious leadership (an image of man to which all three great monotheistic religions are committed). The study takes a legal approach to equal treatment of men and women, and argues from a legal perspective. It discusses the question of the aptness of this method to the religion field, and also considers the problem that it is the State that has a duty to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens, and that fundamental rights mainly have no direct third-party effect between private-law subjects. The study also includes three interviews: with a German Roman-Catholic female priest “contra legem,” with a Swiss female rabbi, and with a female law professor and expert on Islam from Morocco.
