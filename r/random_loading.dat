5000|$|The initial {{derivation}} of SEA {{arose from}} independent calculations made in 1959 by Richard Lyon and Preston Smith {{as part of}} work concerned {{with the development of}} methods for analyzing the response of large complex aerospace structures subjected to spatially distributed <b>random</b> <b>loading.</b> Lyon's calculation showed that under certain conditions, the flow of energy between two coupled oscillators is proportional to the difference in the oscillator energies (suggesting a thermal analogy exists in structural-acoustic systems). Smith's calculation showed that a structural mode and a diffuse reverberant sound field attain a state of 'equipartition of energy' as the damping of the mode is reduced (suggesting a state of thermal equilibrium can exist in structural-acoustic systems). The extension of the two oscillator results to more general systems {{is often referred to as}} the modal approach to SEA. [...] While the modal approach provides physical insights into the mechanisms that govern energy flow it involves assumptions that have been the subject of considerable debate over many decades. [...] In recent years, alternative derivations of the SEA equations based on wave approaches have become available. Such derivations form the theoretical foundation behind a number of modern commercial SEA codes and provide a general framework for calculating the parameters in an SEA model. A number of methods also exist for post-processing FE models to obtain estimates of SEA parameters. Lyon mentioned the use of such methods in his initial SEA text book in 1975 but a number of alternative derivations have been presented over the years ...|$|E

In fact, components always work under repeated <b>random</b> <b>loading,</b> so it is important to derive a reliability model considering the frequency of loading. The two-dimensional distribution of <b>random</b> <b>loading</b> is proposed in this paper. In engineering practice, only a few samples of time-loading process can be obtained because of all kinds of limitation, so the reliability model based on transverse distribution of <b>random</b> <b>loading.</b> In addition, when {{it is difficult to know}} the exact distribution of <b>random</b> <b>loading</b> and strength, a discrete reliablity model is developed through the method of universal generating function.

40|$|The {{reliability}} {{models of}} the components under the nonstationary <b>random</b> <b>load</b> are developed in this paper. Through {{the definition of the}} distribution of the <b>random</b> <b>load,</b> {{it can be seen that}} the conventional load-strength interference model is suitable for the calculation of the static reliability of the components, which does not reflect the dynamic change in the reliability and cannot be used to evaluate the dynamic reliability. Therefore, by developing an approach to converting the nonstationary <b>random</b> <b>load</b> into the <b>random</b> <b>load</b> whose pdf is the same at each moment when the <b>random</b> <b>load</b> applies, the reliability model based on the longitudinal distribution is derived. Moreover, through the definition of the transverse standard load and the transverse standard load coefficient, the reliability model based on the transverse distribution is derived. When the occurrence of the <b>random</b> <b>load</b> follows the Poisson process, the dynamic reliability models considering the strength degradation are derived. These models take the correlation between the <b>random</b> <b>load</b> and the strength into consideration.
