40|$|We {{report the}} autopsy {{findings}} for a 45 -year-old man with polyradiculoneuropathy and fatal acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after having Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. M. pneumoniae antigens were demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue, indicating neuroinvasion {{as an additional}} pathogenetic mechanism in central neurologic complications of M. pneumoniae infection. 45 -year-old, previously healthy man had fever, pain in A the extremities, nasal discharge, and cough with nonpurulent sputum. He sought clinical care 1 week after onset of illness because of his deteriorating general state, including a headache and paresthesias in both hands. Bilateral basal pneumonia was diagnosed and treated with clarithromycin. During the ensuing 4 days, a rapidly ascending polyradiculoneuropathy resulted in tetraparesis, followed by facial palsy, ophthalmoplegia, and then paralysis of all cranial nerves. The initially fully alert patient became comatose, and assisted respiration was necessary. On day 9 of the patient’s illness, an ELISA (Genzyme Diagnostics Virotech, Rüsselsheim, Germany) was performed on serum samples and showed a Mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody titer of 28. 2 Virotech-units/mL (VE) (cut-off 9. 0 – 11. 0) and an IgM antibody titer of 20. 9 VE (cut-off 9. 0 – 11. 0). A PCR for M. pneumoniae was positive in tracheobronchial secretions on day 12, and complement fixation test (antigen purchased from Virion CH- 8803 Rüschlikon, Zürich, Switzerland) showed M. pneumoniae antibody titers of 1, 280 (serum) and 4 (cerebrospinal fluid) on day 16.

Previous studies of the disease in monkeys (WEBB and CHATTERJEA, 1962) have shown bradycardia, hypotension and diarrhoea, as well as the very interesting phenomenon of phagocytosis of nuclear material, probably from broken-down leucocytes, in the peripheral blood and reticulo-endothelial (RE) system. WEBB and LAXMANA RAO (1961) also found bradycardia, hypotension and nuclear phagocytosis in peripheral blood in man.

50|$|The {{disease was}} first {{reported}} from Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka in India in March 1957. The disease first manifested as an epizootic outbreak among monkeys killing {{several of them}} in the year 1957. Hence the disease is also locally known as Monkey Disease or Monkey Fever. The similarity with <b>Russian</b> <b>Spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> was noted and the possibility of migratory birds carrying the disease was raised. Studies began to look for the possible species that acted as reservoirs for the virus and the agents responsible for transmission. Subsequent studies failed to find any involvement of migratory birds although the possibility of their role in initial establishment was not ruled out. The virus was found to be quite distinctive and not closely related to the Russian virus strains. Antigenic relatedness is however close to many other strains including the Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) and birds from Siberia have been found to show an antigenic response to KFD virus. Sequence based studies however note the distinctivenss of OHF. Early studies in India were conducted in collaboration with the US Army Medical Research Unit and this led to controversy and conspiracy theories.|$|E

5000|$|The Russian film {{industry}} avoids provocative {{political and social}} issues because it's financed {{by the government and}} state-owned TV networks.

40|$|A {{single course}} of two {{intraperitoneal}} injections of formalin-inactivated virus of <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> induced in albino mice a solidly immune state which endured almost throughout life. Active virus {{is therefore not}} essential {{for the production of}} a high degree of lasting immunity. The immune response to vaccination consists of resistance to peripherally introduced active virus and development of circulating antibody. A correlation has been found to exist throughout the long period of the immune state between the titer of neutralizing antibody, as determined by the intraperitoneal method described, and the degree of immunity to peripherally introduced active virus. Thus laboratory tests for the immunizing power of a vaccine suggest themselves, to be carried out by an estimation in vaccinated mice of (a) immunity to peripherally inoculated active virus, and (b) serum virus-neutralizing antibody determined by the intraperitoneal method. The rôles as indicators of immunity in vaccinated mice of complement-fixing antibody in the serum, of the intracerebral challenge dose of virus, and of the intracerebral method for testing neutralizing antibody are discussed. Finally, if the immune response of man to vaccination with formalin-inactivated virus of <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> follows the pattern of the response of mice as here described, and if the correlation of neutralizing antibody with immunity to peripherally introduced virus applies to man as to mice, then possibly the degree of immunity in human beings following vaccination can be appraised by a peripheral test for neutralizing antibody in the serum...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of three strains of <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus and one of louping ill virus has yielded the following results:— 1. The sera of mice hyperimmunized to the viruses of Russian encephalitis and louping ill respectively have produced complement fixation with both antigens in almost precisely the same titer. 2. In neutralization tests hyperimmune sera against the Russian virus strains protected against louping ill virus {{to the same extent}} as against the Russian virus strains. Conversely, hyperimmune sera against the louping ill virus protected against the Russian viruses, although to a less degree than against louping ill virus. 3. In cross-resistance tests in mice, a vaccine consisting of formolized Russian virus gave strong protection against this latter and moderate protection against louping ill virus. Formolized louping ill virus gave moderate protection against infection with louping ill and considerably less against the Russian virus. 4. Serum from an individual recovered from a laboratory infection with louping ill virus contracted in 1933 gave positive complement fixation and neutralization tests with the <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> as well as with louping ill virus. 5.

40|$|European tick-borne encephalitis, {{also known}} as European early summer meningoencephalitis (or Frühsommer-Meningoen-zephalitis in German), and Lyme disease {{are the two most}} com-mon tick-borne {{illnesses}} in Europe. Tick-borne encephalitis is caused by an RNA virus of the Flavivirus family, which also includes West Nile virus, dengue fever, and the family prototype, yellow fever.

40|$|After an {{historical}} survey establishing {{the distinction between}} <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> a serious disease with a high mortality rate caused by a virus spread by the tick Ixodes persulcatus, and the milder Central European encephalitis, which is spread by I. ricinus, the public health aspects of the latter disease are discussed. The factors affecting the incidence of the disease—tick population, role of rodents and insectivores, etc. —are considered. Only {{a small proportion of}} those infected develop clinical symptoms. Measures for the control of the disease include (a) vaccination of humans, (b) reduction of the tick population by cultivation of the land, by spreading the enemies of ticks and by dusting with insecticides, and (c) reduction of the infectivity of ticks by vaccination of domestic animals. It is concluded that, under the conditions prevailing in Central Europe, mass vaccination is not to be recommended, although those working regularly within a natural focus of infection should be vaccinated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOmsk {{hemorrhagic fever}} virus (OHFV) and <b>Russian</b> <b>spring–summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (RSSEV) are tick-borne flaviviruses that have close {{homology}} but different pathology and disease outcomes. Previously, we reported that C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice were excellent models {{to study the}} pathology and clinical signs of human RSSEV and OHFV infection. In the study described here, we found that RSSEV infection induced robust release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP- 1, MIP- 1 β, RANTES and KC) in the brain at 9 and 11 dpi, together with moderate to low Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines. In contrast, OHFV infection stimulated an early and prominent induction of IL- 1 α, TNF-α, IL- 12 p 70, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 α and MIP- 1 β in the spleen of infected mice. Collectively our data suggest that a differential host response to infection {{may lead to the}} alternate disease outcomes seen following OHFV or RSSEV infection...|$|E
40|$|Dengue {{virus is}} a member of flavivirus group. Diseases caused by flaviviruses have been a scourge of mankind for long history of human kind; with yellow fever at the top, {{followed}} by dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (RSSE). Due to the dvevelopment of a safe and efficacious live-attenuated vaccine against yellow fever as a first laboratory-designed virus vaccine, this disease is no longer a threat in countries where adequate vaccination is practiced. Similarly, safe and efficacious inactivated vaccines against JE and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) have also been developed, resulting in dramatical reduction in the disease incidences. In spite of these successes, the development of vaccines against other pathogenic flaviviruses, such as dengue fever and RSSE have not been successful. Control of dengue virus became rather urgent because of the emergence of new syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which causes high mortality among infants. The present review attempts to summarize the characteristics of dengue fever and DHF, common features of flavivirus infections as the basis vaccine development and recent advances and problems encountered in dengue vaccine research...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} awareness of the importance of arthropod-borne viruses in the Western Pacific region and in South-East Asia. This realization of the importance of these viruses as causes of human morbidity and mortality and of economic loss due to infection of domestic animals has led to studies attempting to elucidate the basic ecology of some of these viruses. The author reviews the extent of knowledge of the ecology of Japanese and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses and indicates possible mechanisms for the overwintering of the viruses based on experiments in which other viruses were mainly used. He discusses the limited available knowledge on the ecology of dengue and emphasizes the necessity of research on the possibility that this disease is a zoonosis.

40|$|In 1957, a fatal disease {{occurred}} among monkeys in a {{forested area}} of Shimoga District, Karnataka State, India. Concurrently, {{there was an}} outbreak of febrile, occasionally fatal illness among {{people living in the}} vicinity. The disease was caused by a new tick-borne flavivirus belonging to the <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> complex of viruses. The early clinical description of the disease included severe cases with hemorrhagic manifesta-tions, including intermittent epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, and frank blood in the stools. Pathologic and hematologic investigations emphasized similarities with Omsk hemor-rhagic fever. Two years later there was a shift in clinical emphasis from hemorrhagic to neurologic complications; this could have resulted from the special interests or bias of the principal investigator or the changing patterns of intercurrent infections. Clinical, clinicopathologic, hematologic, and hemostatic features of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) are described, particularly in relation to IgE as a cofactor in the immunopathology of KFD and possibly of other hemorrhagic fevers.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the working out of a laboratory test, other than actual infection, which would indicate the efficacy of vaccination with the inactivated virus of <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis</b> through the determination of the titer of circulating antibody.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether relapsing fever–like spirochetes associated with hard ticks may infect Ixodes ricinus ticks in central Europe, we screened questing ticks for 16 S rDNA {{similar to that}} of Asian and American relapsing fever–like spirochetes. We compared the prevalence of these spirochetes to that of Lyme disease spirochetes transmitted by the same vector. Relapsing fever-like spirochetes infect 3. 5 % of questing vector ticks in our three central European sites near the Rhein Valley. These spirochetes differ genetically from their American and Asian analogs while being relatively homogeneous in the region we sampled. The Lyme disease genospecies most commonly detected in central Europe are distributed broadly, whereas those that are less frequently found appear to be place-specific. The absence of co-infected ticks suggests that relapsing fever–like and Lyme disease spirochetes may not share hosts. Exposure risk for relapsing fever–like spirochetes is {{similar to that of}} certain Lyme disease genospecies. Although many persons may be bitten by ticks infected by relapsing fever–like spirochetes, health implications remain unknown. Diverse pathogens infect ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex in North America, Asia, and Europe. Viral agents include those of tick-borne encephalitis, <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> louping ill, Powassan encephalitis (1), and its variant known as deer tick virus (2). The piroplasms that infect these ticks include Babesia divergens, B. microti, B. odocoilei, and B. gibsoni (3). Other infectious agents include Ehrlichia (Anaplasma) phagocytophila, Rickettsia helvetica, possibly Bartonella quintana, and a nonpathogenic endosymbiontic rickettsia (4 – 6). Entomophagic fungal, nematode, and wasp pathogens are also found in these ticks (7). The diverse array of Lyme disease spirochetes infecting ticks in the I. ricinus complex has been subdivided into at least six known genospecies, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. valaisiana, B. bissettii, and B. lusitaniae (8, 9). More recently, a relapsing fever–like spirochete, B. miyamotoi (10), has been added to this array of parasitic microbes. *Institut für Pathologie, Charité, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin...|$|E
40|$|From {{observations}} {{carried out}} with the viruses of <b>Russian</b> <b>spring-summer</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> louping ill, W. E. E., and the Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile types of encephalitis, the following facts and inferences have been derived. 1. Russian encephalitis and louping ill viruses showed a close relationship by complement fixation, neutralization, and intraperitoneal cross-resistance tests. Intracerebral cross-resistance tests, on the other hand, failed to reveal any connection between them. Neither Russian nor louping ill virus appeared {{to be related to}} the remaining viruses tested. 2. Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile types of encephalitis, as a group, showed a certain degree of group relationship, but it was not so close as that between the Russian and louping ill viruses. In complement fixation tests, besides homologous reactions, Japanese serum brought about reactions with both St. Louis and West Nile antigens; St. Louis serum reacted with Japanese antigen, and West Nile serum with Japanese antigen. In neutralization tests with mouse sera, no relationship was found amongst these three viruses, while in similar tests with either hamster or guinea pig serum,—which gave higher homologous titers,—it was found that Japanese serum protected against West Nile and St. Louis viruses, St. Louis serum protected against West Nile virus, and West Nile serum against Japanese virus. In intracerebral and intraperitoneal cross-resistance tests, no relationship was found to exist between these three viruses. Moreover, the Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile viruses appeared to be unrelated to any one of the three other viruses tested. 3. W. E. E. virus stood apart in all tests as unrelated to any of the other viruses studied. 4. The homologous titers of complement-fixing antibodies in mouse sera showed a gradual decline with the passing of time after vaccination, and this loss of homologous titer was paralleled by a similar drop in the titer of the heterologous reactions. In the case of the Japanese B, St. Louis, and West Nile viruses, with which at the start the amount of crossing was not high, a point was reached beyond which heterologous reactions could no longer be detected. 5. A comparison of the specific levels of complement-fixing and neutralizing antibodies for the viruses in mouse hyperimmune sera showed their rate of persistence to differ. Complement-fixing antibodies which had highest titers on the 10 th day, diminished gradually until, when tested on the 50 th day, all titers had reached levels from one-fourth to one-eighth of their values on the 10 th day. On the other hand, the levels of neutralizing antibodies for the same samples of serum were, on the 50 th day, as high as or higher than those found on either the 25 th or 10 th days, save in the case of the Japanese B virus. 6. The state of immunity of animals following vaccination with the viruses discussed was found to be different at a given time, depending on the method employed to determine it. Thus, mice vaccinated with St. Louis virus had positive complement-fixing antibodies on the 10 th day and no neutralizing antibodies. The state of immunity changed in the course of time. For this reason it is felt that in order to detect whether two viruses are related or not, multiple observations are necessary, over a considerable time and employing all available methods of immune comparison...|$|E
