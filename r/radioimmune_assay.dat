On day 6 or later virus antigen was found in spleen, liver, kidney, lymph nodes, peritoneal exudate, and bone marrow cells. With inhibition of antigen binding, a <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assay</b> was developed for antibody detection. Viral antibodies could be detected as early as 3 days after infection.

40|$|Allotypes of {{immunoglobulins}} are inherited as codominant Mendelian alleles (1, 2). However, {{deviations from}} expected allelic behavior {{have been observed}} for allotypes expressed by cells in culture (3), by transplanted lymphoid cells (4), by inbred mice (5), and by hyperimmune rabbits (6). For example, Bosma and Bosma (5) observed that a mouse C H allotype was expressed in an unpredictable and transitory fashion in a congenic strain that had been bred to exclude this allotype. Strosberg et al. (6) have observed that antisera from a rabbit immunized with Micrococcus lysodeickticus simultaneously possessed immunoglobulins with three group a and three group b allotypes. These reports have prompted a reassessment of the assumption that immunoglobulin synthesis is directed by allelic structural genes. By the use of sensitive <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assays,</b> low levels of group a allotypes not detected by qualitative typing or anticipated from breeding data were detected in about 50 % of rabbit sera tested.

40|$|<b>Radioimmune</b> <b>assays</b> were {{developed}} to assay the binding of complement components C 1 q, C 1 s and C 4 to antibody aggregates and to cell-bound antibody. The binding of the components was compared with the haemolytic activity and with the capacity to form the C 3 convertase activity {{in the presence of}} excess C 2. The destruction of whole complement and of C 4 activity is similar per 1, 000 molecules of antibody in aggregates and cell-bound antibody, as is the binding of C 1 g and C 1 s, the latter being in a 1 : 2 molar ratio. The binding of C 4 is about 12 times greater, per 1, 000 molecules of antibody, on cells than in aggregates.

These sera also react with Friend- or Rauscher-MuLV in <b>radioimmune</b> precipitation <b>assays.</b> This reaction is not due to a separate immune response, but rather is primarily a consequence of the cross-reactivity of antibodies to the AKR strain of MuLV p 15 (E) with the p 15 (E) of these viruses. These data, using autogenous immune sera, emphasize the serological differences of the virion glycoproteins and the serological similarity of the p 15 (E) virion component of the viruses.

40|$|The major {{envelope}} glycoprotein (gp 71) from AKR {{murine leukemia virus}} (MuLV) was purified and its serological reactivity with heterologous and autogenous immune mouse sera was examined. Homologous and interspecies competition radioimmunoassays using antisera to Rauscher-MulV gp 69 / 71 or Friend-MuLV gp 71 or antisera to feline leukemia virus to precipitate 125 I-labeled gp 71 from various MuLV showed that distinct differences exist between Rauscher- or Friend-MuLV and AKR-MuLV glycoproteins. Characteristically the AKR-MuLV gp 71, in contrast to FLV or RLV gp 71, does not compete fully in homologous or interspecies radioimmunoassays with iodinated Friend of Rauscher glycoproteins.

40|$|Comparison of c. d. {{spectra of}} Zn-insulin with Zn 2 +-free insulin {{demonstrated}} significant differences. It {{has been proposed}} that these differences are due to either changes {{in the structure of}} insulin monomers within aggregated insulins or the results of insulin aggregation. The effect of Zn 2 + on the immunological activity of insulin indicated that the antigenic determinants of insulin were also altered. The apparent loss of immunological activity of monoiodotyrosylinsulin was demonstrated to be due to the loss of Zn 2 + rather than the substitution of iodine. The immunological activity of Zn-insulin and Zn 2 +-free insulin was compared in both the radioimmune and immune haemolysis-inhibition assays by using an identical population of antibodies and concentrations of inhibitor. Relative to Zn-insulin, Zn 2 +-free insulin had a markedly attenuated immunological activity in the immune haemolysis-inhibition assay, whereas in the <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assay</b> slightly greater immunological activity was observed with the Zn 2 +-free insulin. These observations are submitted as evidence that the removal of Zn 2 + perturbs the conformation of determinants that react with antibodies operative in the immune haemolysis-inhibition assay (immune haemolysis determinants) and has a minimal effect on the conformation of determinants that react with antibodies operative in the <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assay</b> (radioimmune determinants) ...|$|E

The sequences of these phage-derived antibodies showed no similarities with DNA-binding antibodies from other sources. Even after six rounds of panning no positive clones were detected which bound to poly[d(AT) ] and after seven rounds only two were derived from panning with calf thymus DNA.

It {{was applied to}} the exploration of steroid output in 120 normal prepuberal children to both sexes aged 3 mth to 12 yr. Urinary data were compared to plasmatic values of adrenal hormones estimated by <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assays</b> (RIA). Analysis of the relationships between steroids outputs and bone age revealed that the excretion of cortisol catabolites was expressed by a saturation curve whereas that of Δ 4 - 3 keto androgens catabolites were expressed by geometrical progression curves; urine dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and plasma DHEA-sulfate showed outbreaks of high values beyond 6 yr of age which ruled out all curve fitting attempts. The computation of these relationships allowed to determine the confidence belts of the various regressions which appear as a useful tool to estimate the delayed or accelerated character of adrenal activity in prepuberal childhood.

40|$|Quantitation of the {{expression}} of cell surface antigens has hitherto been limited to analysis by either cytotoxicity tests or <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assays</b> (5, 15). We report here {{the use of a}} new methodology to analyze and quantitate {{the expression}} of mouse histocompabililty antigens (H- 2 locus) in hybrid clones and parental cell types. The binding of fluorescein-tagged antibody is measured on a cell-to-cell basis in large viable cell populations using flow microfluorimetric techniques. These techniques have been used to measure hapten and immunoglobulin binding to lymphocyte populations (8, 9, 14). However, this is the first report in which these techniques have been used to examine {{the expression of}} the H- 2 locus. The advantage of this approach is twofold: first, a large and statistically significant sample population may be analyzed one cell at a time, thus revealing the fine detail of heterogeneity in the expression of the cell surface markers within a population.

The cell surface reactivity of the hyperimmune antiserum was also demonstrated by solid-phase <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assays</b> with unfixed infected cells or infected cells fixed with low concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0. 025 %) before reactivity with antisera. Higher concentrations of glutaraldehyde lowered the sensitivity of detection.

That hyperimmune anti-SIN serum also cross-reacts with capsid protein {{on the surface of}} Semliki Forest virus-infected cells was suggested by the fact that capsid protein inhibited cross-cytolysis in the antibody-dependent, complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay. The latter antiserum was collected after repeated injections of purified virions over a 9 -month period.

40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} and disk membranes of bovine retinal rod outer segments (ROS) have been purified by a novel density-gradient perturbation method {{for analysis of}} their protein compositions. Purified ROS were treated with neuraminidase to expose galactose residues on {{plasma membrane}}-specific glycoproteins and labeled with ricin-gold-dextran particles. After the ROS were lysed in hypotonic buffer, the plasma membrane was dissociated from the disks by either mild trypsin digestion or prolonged exposure to low ionic strength buffer. The dense ricin-gold-dextran-labeled plasma membrane was separated from disks by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopy was used to follow this fractionation procedure. The dense red pellet primarily consisted of inverted plasma membrane vesicles containing gold particles; the membrane fraction of density 1. 13 g/cc consisted of unlabeled intact disks and vesicles. Ricin-binding studies indicated that the plasma membrane from trypsin-treated ROS was purified between 10 - 15 -fold. The protein composition of plasma membranes and disks was significantly different as analyzed by SDS gels and Western blots labeled with lectins and monoclonal antibodies. ROS plasma membrane exhibited three major proteins of 36 (rhodopsin), 38, and 52 kD, three ricin-binding glycoproteins of 230, 160, and 110 kD, and numerous minor proteins {{in the range of}} 14 - 270 kD.

40|$|An immune {{adherence}} receptor {{exists on}} the surface of primate erythrocytes, and has been characterized as a receptor for the activated third component of complement (C 3 b). We have applied human red blood cells (RBCs, blood group O) to a sensitive determination of complement-fixing, soluble immune complexes in serum. The method involved the binding of immune complexes with RBCs in the presence of complement and the detection of cell-bound IgG molecules by radiolabelled anti-human IgG antibodies. Since the binding of RBCs with monomeric IgG was minimal, cell-bound IgG molecules were taken as representing immune complexes. When aggregated human gammaglobulin (AHG) was used as a model of immune complexes, as little as 5 μg dissolved in 1 ml of normal human serum were detected. The binding of RBCs with AHG was inhibited in EDTA solution where the classical complement pathway could not be activated. The RBC <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assay</b> was successfully applied to the determination of soluble immune complexes in pathological serum samples obtained from the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and those with fulminant Type B hepatitis.

40|$|The {{activation}} of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by lipopolysaccharide or other ligands evokes a proinflammatory immune response, {{which is not}} only capable of clearing invading pathogens but can also inflict damage to host tissues. It is therefore important to prevent an overshoot of the TLR-induced response where necessary, and here we show that extracellular ATP is capable of doing this in human monocytes. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we showed that monocytes express P 2 Y(1), P 2 Y(2), P 2 Y(4), P 2 Y(11), and P 2 Y(13) receptors, {{as well as several}} P 2 X receptors. To elucidate the function of these receptors, we first studied Ca(2 +) signaling in single cells. ATP or UTP induced a biphasic increase in cytosolic Ca(2 +), which corresponded to internal Ca(2 +) release followed by {{activation of}} store-operated Ca(2 +) entry. The evoked Ca(2 +) signals stimulated Ca(2 +) -activated K(+) channels, producing transient membrane hyperpolarization. In addition, ATP promoted cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration; however, unlike chemoattractants, the migration was non-directional and further analysis showed that ATP did not activate Akt, essential for sensing gradients. When TLR 2, TLR 4, or TLR 2 / 6 were stimulated with their respective ligands, ATPgammaS profoundly inhibited secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1) but increased the production of interleukin- 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. In <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assays,</b> we found that ATP (or ATPgammaS) strongly increased cAMP levels, and, moreover, the TLR-response was inhibited by forskolin, whereas UTP neither increased cAMP nor inhibited the TLR-response. Thus, our data suggest that ATP promotes non-directional migration and, importantly, acts as a "host tissue damage" signal via the G(s) protein-coupled P 2 Y(11) receptor and increased cAMP to negatively regulate TLR signaling.

40|$|ABSTRACT-A <b>radioimmune</b> {{precipitation}} <b>assay</b> {{was used}} to evaluate the humoral immune response of baboons (Papio cyno-cephalus) to their endogenous, xenotropic, type C (M 7) virus. Using 1251 or [3 H]leucine-labeled intact virus preparation, we dem-onstrated that baboons possess naturally occurring virus-binding antibodies to this virus. Antibody appeared directed against en-velope and not internal viral proteins. Immunoglobulins responsi-ble for virus-binding were predominant in the IgG and IgA serum fractions, whereas IgM participated to a minor degree. The bio-logic activities of these immunoglobulins were investigated by means of a focus reduction assay for virus neutralization with a murine sarcoma virus (M 7) pseudotype. We determined that, despite the presence of considerable virus binding, none of the normal baboon sera tested possessed neutralizing activity for M 7 virus. -J Natl Cancer Inst 57 : 561 - 565, 1976. Autogenous humoral immunity to endogenous mouse ecotropic (or as we prefer, H-tropic) and X-tropic viruses has been demonstrated (1 - 6). In addition, a recent report suggests that autogenous CMI in the form of lymphocytes cytotoxic for virus-infected cells may also be present in some mouse strains (7). This "natural " immunity has been demonstrated by radioim-mune precipitation, neutralization of the X-tropic var-iant, and, for CMI, by cell culture techniques. The existence of this immunity is surprising, for one would think that at least a partial state of "tolerance " or immu-nologic unresponsiveness should exist if these endoge-nous viruses were truly verticallv transmitted and con-sidered self-antigens. The baboon endogenous, X-tropic, type C virus was originally observed (8) in and isolated (9) from a full-term placenta. In addition, type C viruses have been observed by electron microscopy in baboon tubal ova (10). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the primate, endogenous, X-tropic virus is vertically transmitted. In this paper, a <b>radioimmune</b> precipitation <b>assay</b> is used to demonstrate that, despite exposure to overt virus replication in utero, baboons are not tolerant to their endogenous type C virus, responding with hu-moral immunity at least to virus envelope antigens...|$|R

Although these mice were bred to exclude the IgG 2 a allotype of BALB/c (Ig-la), an Ig-la-like antigen was detected in the 7 S Ig fraction of two (of five) pooled serum samples, it represented 0. 1 [...] 0. 3 % of the total 7 S protein and was indistinguishable from a reference Ig-la. The detection of putative Ig-la in Igb-congenic mice is inconsistent {{with the notion that}} allotypes are products of allelic structural genes. It appears rather that expression of Ig-la is controlled by allelic regulator genes and that its low and transient production in Igb- congenic mice results from incomplete negative regulation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough most duplex DNAs are not {{immunogenic}} some synthetic DNAs such as polyl[d(Tm 5 C) ] · poly-[d(GA) ] are weakly immunogenic {{allowing the}} production of monoclonal antibodies. The specificity {{of one of these}} antibodies, Jel 172, was investigated in detail by a competitive solid-phase <b>radioimmune</b> <b>assay.</b> Jel 172 bound well to poly[d(TC) ]·poly[d(GA) ] but not to other duplex DNAs such as poly[d(TTC) ] · poly-[d(GAA) ] and poly[d(TCC) ]· poly[d(GGA) ]. The binding to poly[d(Br 5 UC) ]· poly[d(GA) ] was enhanced while that to poly[d(TC) ]· poly[d(IA) ] was decreased compared to poly[d(TC) ]· poly[d(GA) ]. Thus, not only is the antibody very specific for a sequence of duplex DNA but it also appears to recognize functional groups in both grooves of the helix...|$|E
40|$|Three linear {{antigenic}} regions on the P protein {{from human}} {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) subgroup A (strain A 2) were represented by peptides that reacted with monoclonal antibodies and with sera from humans with recent or previous RSV infection. The determinants were localized within three hydrophilic regions of the P protein: Prog ~ to AspH 0, Ser 16 ~ to LySls 0 and Glu 221 to Phe 241. The role of individual amino acids in the epitopes defined by monoclonal antibodies was determined. Two monoclonal antibodies reacting with the same antigenic site were found to detect epitopes that had different amino acid dependencies. Rabbit hyperimmune sera raised against selected peptides specifically precipitated different forms of the P protein from RSV-infected 35 S-labelled cell extracts in a <b>radioimmune</b> precipitation <b>assay.</b> These findings have implications for forthcoming structural-functional studies of RSV capsid component interactions and also for serological diagnosis of RSV infection...|$|R
40|$|The humoral immune {{responses}} of NIH Swiss and SWR/J mice immunized with formalin-inactivated AKR or Gross murine leukemia virus, respectively, were examined. Both immune sera had high titers of antibodies detectable in <b>radioimmune</b> precipitation <b>assays</b> using [3 H]leucine-labeled AKR virus and in radioimmunoassays using purified virion components. The predominant antibody titers were directed against gp 71 and pl 15 (E). The immune response against gp 71 was predominantly type-specific, whereas the reactivity with pl 15 (E) was predominantly group-specific. A weak immune response against p 15 was also detected. Both sera were cytotoxic against cells replicating the AKR-Gross virus type but not against cells replicating Friend murine leukemia virus. This cytotoxicity could be specifically blocked with purified gp 71 of AKR murine leukemia virus. Sera from immune NIH Swiss mice neutralized AKR virus, {{but did not}} neutralize Rauscher, Scripps, or wild mouse leukemia virus...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{impressive}} quantitative {{differences in}} antibody to various streptococcal extracellular and cellular antigens among patients with acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, and following uncomplicated streptococcal infection has prompted investigation of qualitative {{aspects of the}} antibody response among these patients. By using a radiolabeled antigenically univalent hapten derived from streptococcal A carbohydrate, affinity of serum antibody to A-carbohydrate (A-antibody) was studied by an ammonium sulfate precipitation technique. The data obtained demonstrate average association constants (K 0 S) of acute rheumatic fever patient sera to be significantly {{lower than those of}} acute glomerulonephritis or streptococcal infection patients (P< 0. 02 and P< 0. 001, respectively). Further analysis of the data from hapten binding studies documents the fact that the <b>radioimmune</b> precipitin <b>assay</b> for the determination of A-antibody level is little influenced by K 0 but directly correlates with the concentration of antibody binding sites...|$|R
