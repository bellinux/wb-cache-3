In the context of food sampling and <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the {{veterinary medicinal products}} and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for <b>residue</b> <b>testing.</b> However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> programme.

The effects of tempering on the precipitation in F 82 H steels were elucidated {{on the basis of}} the characterization of carbides, as well as the quantitative estimation of precipitation strengthening at room temperature. Firstly, the number density of precipitates was measured by extracted <b>residue</b> <b>test</b> in Fe- 0. 2 TaC and tempered F 82 H steel, and compared with the TEM observation. It was found that the ratio of volume fraction between the TEM and the ERT was respectively 1. 84 and 0. 54 for Fe- 0. 2 TaC and tempered F 82 H steel, revealing that the collection probability of ERT strongly depends on the precipitate features, size and number density. Effects of annealing on the precipitation in F 82 H steels were investigated by ERT. The amount of carbide showed a non-linear relationship to tempering parameter, TP[*] = [*]T(20 [*]+[*]logt). It steeply increased in the TP range from 15. 3 to 16. 2. The precipitation strengthening in F 82 H steel was estimated to be about 5 – 10 % relative to its proof strength, suggesting that the carbides in F 82 H steel have a minor role on the tensile strength at room temperature, though these precipitates are greatly beneficial for improving the creep and radiation resistance at elevated temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Monday, December 20, 2004 Media Advisory UGA law {{professor}} says associational effect may be crucial in any potential prosecution of Dr. Barton Corbin According to nationally recognized trial law expert and University of Georgia {{law professor}} Ronald L. Carlson, {{in the event}} the grand jury indicts Barton Corbin for shooting {{his wife in the}} head and leaving the handgun next to her on the bed, events in Augusta may dramatically affect any possible Gwinnett County prosecution. In Augusta in 1990, Corbin 2 ̆ 7 s girlfriend Dorothy Hearn was found on a couch dead from a single gunshot wound to the head with a revolver in her lap. “As in the Lynn Turner antifreeze poisoning deaths, the ability of a prosecutor to bring in evidence of both deaths is often crucial in such cases. Introduction of this sort of evidence results from the operation of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s ‘similar crimes’ law, which allows pattern conduct exhibited in a former case to be used in a later prosecution,” Carlson said. Augusta authorities are reported to be reopening the case of the Augusta shooting of Hearn. Carlson wonders whether a gunshot <b>residue</b> <b>test</b> was ever conducted on Hearn’s hands. “Much has been made of a similar test done on the hands of Corbin, with authorities awaiting results from the GBI, but media sources have not reported whether any such test was conducted on the hands of Jennifer Corbin,” he said. Carlson is curious about whether GSR testing was done on the victim 2 ̆ 7 s hands in both the Buford shooting in 2004 as well as the 1990 fatality in Augusta.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} research investigates estimating {{of power}} system static and dynamic states (e. g. rotor angle, rotor speed, mechanical power, voltage magnitude, voltage phase angle, mechanical reference point) {{as well as}} identification of synchronous generator parameters. The research has two focuses: i. Synchronous generator dynamic model states and parameters estimation using real-time PMU data. ii. Integrate PMU data and conventional measurements to carry out static state estimation. The {{first part of the}} work focuses on Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data-based synchronous generator states and parameters estimation. In completed work, PMU data-based synchronous generator model identification is carried out using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The identification not only gives the states and parameters related to a synchronous generator swing dynamics but also gives the states and parameters related to turbine-governor and primary and secondary frequency control. PMU measurements of active power and voltage magnitude, are treated as the inputs to the system while voltage phasor angle, reactive power, and frequency measurements are treated as the outputs. UKF-based estimation can be carried out at real-time. Validation is achieved through event play back to compare the outputs of the simplified simulation model and the PMU measurements, given the same input data. Case studies are conducted not only for measurements collected from a simulation model, but also for a set of real-world PMU data. The research results have been disseminated in one published article. In {{the second part of the}} research, new state estimation algorithm is designed for static state estimation. The algorithm contains a new solving strategy together with simultaneous bad data detection. The primary challenge in state estimation solvers relates to the inherent non-linearity and non-convexity of measurement functions which requires using of Interior Point algorithm with no guarantee for a global optimum solution and higher computational time. Such inherent non-linearity and non-convexity of measurement functions come from the nature of power flow equations in power systems. The second major challenge in static state estimation relates to the bad data detection algorithm. In traditional algorithms, Largest Normalized <b>Residue</b> <b>Test</b> (LNRT) has been used to identify bad data in static state estimation. Traditional bad data detection algorithm only can be applied to state estimation. Therefore, in a case of finding any bad datum, the SE algorithm have to rerun again with eliminating found bad data. Therefore, new simultaneous and robust algorithm is designed for static state estimation and bad data identification. In the second part of the research, Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) is used to improve solving technique for power system state estimator. However, the non-convex feasible constraints in SOCP based estimator forces the use of local solver such as IPM (interior point method) with no guarantee for quality answers. Therefore, cycle based SOCP relaxation is applied to the state estimator and a least square estimation (LSE) based method is implemented to generate positive semi-definite programming (SDP) cuts. With this approach, we are able to strengthen the state estimator (SE) with SOCP relaxation. Since SDP relaxation leads the power flow problem to the solution of higher quality, adding SDP cuts to the SOCP relaxation makes Problem’s feasible region close to the SDP feasible region while saving us from computational difficulty associated with SDP solvers. The improved solver is effective to reduce the feasible region and get rid of unwanted solutions violate cycle constraints. Different Case studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method. After introducing the new solving technique, a novel co-optimization algorithm for simultaneous nonlinear state estimation and bad data detection is introduced in this dissertation. ℓ_ 1 -Norm optimization of the sparse residuals is used as a constraint for the state estimation problem to make the co-optimization algorithm possible. Numerical case studies demonstrate more accurate results in SOCP relaxed state estimation, successful implementation of the algorithm for the simultaneous state estimation and bad data detection, and better state estimation recovery against single and multiple Gaussian bad data compare to the traditional LNRT algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Australia exports a major {{proportion}} of its agricultural production and is {{highly dependent on}} maintaining and developing access to, and competitiveness in, export markets. To preserve Australia’s status as a provider of high quality grain, the majority of Australian primary producers rely on pesticides to protect their crops from pests and diseases, particularly in post-harvest situations. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) supports Australian agriculture by registering and allowing the supply of safe and effective animal health and crop protection products. A residue risk management continuum is established when the effectiveness of chemical registration and control of chemical use regulations is assessed through residue monitoring programs. Programs assess good agricultural practice and provide traceback capacity to investigate areas of concern. Risk communication provides opportunities for continuous improvement. In the early 1960 s, the Australian Government established a non-regulatory body, the national residue survey (NRS). In 2008 - 2009, random monitoring programs were conducted for over 50 commodities (21 grains, five horticultural commodities, 11 fish species, 12 animal species, honey and egg with over 20, 000 samples collected for analytical testing. The NRS grain residue monitoring program {{is presented as a}} case study of the residue risk management continuum demonstrating to overseas markets the high level of residue integrity of Australian grain. Over 4, 000 grain samples are collected and analysed per annum. Most of the samples are collected in the bulk export program where samples are collected from every hatch of every ship loaded at the seventeen Australian grain export terminals. The chemical screens have expanded beyond the multi-residue screen (MRS) insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, to include phosphine, additional herbicides (not included in the MRS), heavy metals and mycotoxins. In its current form, the NRS grains program provides 15 years of <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> data which demonstrates a very high degree of conformance with Australian MRLs and the import tolerances of overseas trading partners. In addition, trends in <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> data demonstrate a decline in the frequency of residue detections and the levels of residue detected. To be confident that <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> results meet the requisite standards, the reliability of the Australian analyses must be assured. The NRS laboratory performance evaluation system has been developed to provide that assurance, using a range of proficiency tests and other techniques in the selection of laboratories for NRS work. <b>Residue</b> <b>testing</b> results are reported against both Australian MRLs and the international MRLs which apply in the relevant export market. NRS maintains databases of overseas MRLs and compares its <b>residue</b> <b>testing</b> results of exported commodities against those standards.
