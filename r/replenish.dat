5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs <b>replenish</b> the player's health, blue orbs <b>replenish</b> magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and <b>replenish</b> the Rage meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, <b>replenish</b> the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to <b>replenish,</b> have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the game}} world, the player finds chests colored green, blue, or red, and each chest {{contains}} orbs of the corresponding color. Green orbs <b>replenish</b> the player's health, blue orbs <b>replenish</b> magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic—allowing new, more powerful attacks—and replenishing the Rage meter, which, if full, {{allows for the}} usage of the Rage of the Gods ability. Red orbs are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers in unmarked chests. The Eyes and Feathers increase {{the length of the}} Health and Magic Meters, respectively; finding eighteen of an item maximizes a meter and in turn, the player's power.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of Qi-replenishing and Yin-nourishing in {{inhibiting}} tumor metastasis. Methods: Fifty mice were randomly divided into <b>replenishing</b> Qi group, <b>replenishing</b> Yin group, <b>replenishing</b> Qi and Yin group, chemotherapy group and control group. Models of Lewis lung cancer and B 16 melanoma were observed in vivo. The tumor weight inhibiting rate, metastatic lung tumor, concentrations of t-PA and TXB 2 in tumor tissue and IL- 2 and TNF-α in spleen were observed. Results: The tumor weight inhibiting rates of <b>replenishing</b> Qi and Yin group for Lewis lung cancer and B 16 melanoma were both 42. 9 ％. <b>Replenishing</b> Qi and Yin could decrease the contents of TXB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, and increase the levels of IL- 2 and TNF-α.

Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as power-ups that <b>replenish</b> the player's health.|$|E
