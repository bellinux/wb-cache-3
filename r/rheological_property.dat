50|$|Robocasting or Direct Ink Writing (DIW) is an {{additive}} manufacturing technique {{in which a}} filament of a paste (known as an 'ink', as per the analogy with conventional printing) is extruded from a small nozzle while the nozzle is moved across a platform. The object is thus built by 'writing' the required shape layer by layer. The technique was first developed in the United States in 1996 as a method to allow geometrically complex ceramic green bodies to be produced by {{additive manufacturing}}. In robocasting, a 3D CAD model is divided up into layers {{in a similar manner}} to other additive manufacturing techniques. A fluid (typically a ceramic slurry), referred to as an 'ink', is then extruded through a small nozzle as the nozzle's position is controlled, drawing out the shape of each layer of the CAD model. The ink exits the nozzle in a liquid-like state but retains its shape immediately, exploiting the <b>rheological</b> <b>property</b> of shear thinning. It is distinct from fused deposition modelling as it does not rely on the solidification or drying to retain its shape after extrusion.|$|E

Experiments and micro-analyses were carried out to determine the <b>rheological</b> <b>properties</b> with temperature response characteristics and the mechanism involved in solid-free polymer drilling fluid (SFPDF) at low temperatures when drilling in permafrost with natural gas hydrates (NGH). The curves of shear stress with the shear rates of three kinds of polymer drilling fluids, Semen Lepidii natural vegetable gum, polyacrylamide, and xanthan gum, were drawn.

Polymers used as flocculants in the {{secondary}} sludge dewatering process {{are one of the}} most expensive inputs in these plants. The disadvantage is that these polymers cannot be recycled. Currently, controlling of polymer dosing rate is done by trial and error method. It has been shown that huge savings can be made by optimising the polymer dosing using <b>rheological</b> <b>properties.</b> It is not an easy task to optimise this process because of changing sludge characteristics on a daily, seasonal and annual basis. To try and optimise polymer dosing and polymer concentration, the variation in <b>rheological</b> <b>properties</b> needs to be understood first. The correlation between the process parameters and the <b>rheological</b> <b>properties</b> needs to be determined. There is currently no database of <b>rheological</b> <b>properties</b> of secondary wastewater sludge feeding belt filter presses available. To address these issues, a 12 week assessment of the <b>rheological</b> <b>properties</b> of the sludge feed to the belt filter press before and after conditioning in four wastewater treatment plants in Cape Town was conducted. The <b>rheological</b> <b>properties</b> were determined using an MCR- 51 rheometer with parallel plate geometry under controlled temperature.

The intensities {{of growth in}} viscosity of TiO 2 nanofluids with particle loadings greatly differ in various studies.

The pronounced differences in different samples are mainly due to the complex influence factors on the <b>rheological</b> <b>property.</b> The shear rate has been proved to have great effect on the <b>rheological</b> <b>property,</b> and also, it has combined effect with other factors including temperature, shearing time, particle loading, base fluid type, and particle shape [124], which make it rather difficult to predict whether a nanofluid is Newtonian fluid or not except by experimental means.|$|E
