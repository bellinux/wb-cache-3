50|$|There {{has been}} {{historical}} decline of Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism {{in the areas}} of Pakistan. This happened {{for a variety of reasons}} even as these religions have continued to flourish beyond the eastern frontiers of Pakistan.

In general, religious conversion was a gradual process, with some converts attracted to pious Muslim saints, while others converted to Islam to gain tax <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> grant, marriage partners, social and economic advancement, or freedom from slavery. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India migrated to Pakistan.

50|$|Although {{they may}} not {{recognize}} themselves as antiglobalists and are pro-capitalism, some economists who don't share the neoliberal approach of international economic institutions have strongly influenced the movement. Amartya Sen's Development as Freedom (Nobel Prize in Economics, 1999), argues that third world development must be understood as the expansion of human capability, not simply the increase in national income per capita, and thus requires policies attuned to health and education, not simply GDP. James Tobin's (winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics) proposal for a tax on financial transactions (called, after him, the Tobin tax) {{has become part of}} the agenda of the movement. Also, George Soros, Joseph E. Stiglitz (another Economic Sciences Nobel prize winner, formerly of the World Bank, author of Globalization and Its Discontents) and David Korten have made arguments for drastically improving transparency, for debt <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> reform, and restructuring corporate accountability systems.

40|$|New Zealand is {{undertaking}} a {{new phase}} of soil mapping (S-map) {{with the goal of}} national soil map coverage at 1 : 50 000 scale. One S-map objective is to develop a national capability in digital soil mapping (DSM). Concurrent development of the global soil map (GSM) project provides an opportunity for the S-map project to align its work with the GSM initiative both to achieve an enhanced national soil map and contribute New Zealand data to the GSM project. Consequently we have applied GSM method guidelines nationally. We matched the generic GSM methods to 193 New Zealand soilscapes. Soilscapes with similar levels of legacy soil information were grouped into eight soilscape groups, and DSM methods applied to them. Four soilscape groups were in low <b>relief</b> <b>land</b> where intensification of land use generates high demand for new soil information. The other four method classes were in rolling, hilly and mountainous land. The most extensive method in low <b>relief</b> <b>land</b> requires establishment of better environmental covariate layers followed by soil map reference area extrapolation, and the most extensive method in high <b>relief</b> <b>land</b> involves sampling programmes and scorpan analysis.

BIS based Landslide Hazard Evaluation Factor (LHEF) rating scheme for landslide susceptibility zonation is a heuristic approach to landslide hazard assessment. According to Bureau of Indian Standards (1998) landslide hazard zonation procedure {{can be performed}} using LHEF rating for different landslide causative factors. BIS identified six landslide causative factors for hazard zonation viz. lithology, structure, slope morphometry, relative <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> use-land cover and hydrological condition. In this method, the area under investigation is divided into small mapping units to which numerical weights are assigned for each thematic data layer and finally TEHD (Total Estimated Hazard) is obtained by adding weights of all variables for each mapping unit and Landslide Hazard map is produced.|$|E
40|$|A {{mosaic of}} ERTS {{images of the}} CARETS region {{has been used to}} {{partition}} the region into zones on the basis of similarity of tones and textures visible at a regional-scale overview. The resulting patterns were compared with existing small scale maps of the region representing <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> surface forms, geology, soils, vegetation, forest types, and land use. The ERTS-derived zones most closely resemble the patterns on the small scale land use map, suggesting that, at least in a highly developed region such as CARETS, land use is an indicator or resultant surface expression of several interacting environmental processes. These results lend support to the CARETS model of interdisciplinary regional analysis, whereby remote sensor-derived data sets on land use and land use change become the basic data entry into a regional information system to serve regional planners and land managers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a {{methodology}} is proposed to elaborate landslide activity maps {{through the use}} of PS (Persistent Scatterer) data. This is illustrated through the case study of Tramuntana Range in the island of Majorca (Spain), where ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) images have been processed through a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique during the period of 2007 – 2010. The landslide activity map provides, for every monitored landslide, an assessment of the PS visibility according to the <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> use, and satellite acquisition parameters. Landslide displacement measurements are projected along the steepest slope, in order to compare landslide velocities with different slope orientations. Additionally, a ground motion activity map is also generated, based on active PS clusters not included within any known landslide phenomenon, butRemote Sens. 2013, 5 6199 even moving, potentially referred to unmapped landslides or triggered by other kinds o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract; The {{surveillance}} {{and the management}} of the wind resources in Romania represent an issue of national importance considering the fact that the natural potential of the wind is non-polluted resource. This activity requires a great number of observations points and stations of measurement and processing. The paper presents the study carried out in the National Meteorological Administration regarding the influences of geographical factors {location, <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> cover/land use) on the wind speed and direction in the SW part of Romania. The working methods consisted in statistical analysis of the database climatic parameters (wind speed and direction) for the 1961 - 2000 period of 13 meteorological stations (situated in the SW mountainous region of Romania). The obtained results emphasized the important differences in the wind speed and frequency due to different local geographical conditions and variety of mountainous microclimate. The high baric gradients generate strong winds (with regional character) and the low baric gradients determine weak winds (with local character) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the present condition of natural resources of the Milpa Alta area (Central Mexico) Environmental Biophysical Indicators (EBI) of state at detailed scale were determined. Environmental Biophysical Units (EBU) from morphogenetic characteristics of relief were obtained, which served as base as synthetic-unit of reference. EBI indicators of <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> use/cover, climate and soil, factors were determined. The dominant EBU are from endogenous accumulative volcanic origin of upper, medium and lower mountain slopes of andesite-basalte lava flows of Pleistocene-Holocene. The dominant land use is of rain-feed agriculture of annual and semi permanent prickly pear, crops. There are forest areas with Abies religiosa, Pinus spp and grassland areas which are used for sheep production. Climate influences the spatial distribution of land use-cover. Soils presented high organic matter contents, slightly acid, loamy-sand texture, and a complex of change dominated by Ca 2 +. The EBI indicators of state analyzed of EBU groups do not show deterioration for the study area. The statistical analyses from the EBI clustering using the EBU represent a spatial reference that will allow proposing strategies for handling and conservation of natural resources...|$|E

40|$|Are {{economic}} incentives and regulatory relief useful tools for encouraging reuse of abandoned or under-utilised urban sites with historic buildings? Answering {{this question is}} of key importance for many European cities and for older US cities, and has important implications in terms of urban sustainability and “smart growth” initiatives. This study uses conjoint choice experiments to explore {{the relative importance of}} {{economic incentives}}, regulatory <b>relief,</b> <b>land</b> use and property regime offerings at under-utilised historic sites in Venice, Italy. Real estate developers and investors were surveyed, and asked to choose between pairs of hypothetical projects in three Venice locations, as well as between one of these projects and the alternative to do a development project elsewhere. Statistical models of the responses to these choice questions indicate that respondents were sensitive to the price of acquiring the land (and hence to any policies that influence prices), and particularly sensitive to the property regime that would be granted to developers and investors and to the allowable land use. It is concluded that the city should focus on offering land uses and property regimes that are more in tune with developer demand. conjoint choice experiments, real estate developers, building conservation restrictions, redevelopment incentives, brownfields, infill redevelopment,...|$|E
