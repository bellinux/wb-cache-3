5|$|The prince was {{plunged into}} debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, {{forcing him to}} quit Carlton House and live at Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the prince's {{political}} allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. The prince's relationship with Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on the prince's authority, the Whig leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny. Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to the prince. He appeased her by asking another Whig, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, to <b>restate</b> Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, granted the prince £161,000 (equivalent to £ today) to pay his debts and £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) for improvements to Carlton House.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a {{considerable}} amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist {{point of view of a}} male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and Hermetic Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title Hermetic Definition (1972). The poem Hermetic Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy. being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to <b>restate</b> the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to Helen in Egypt.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether earnings restatements have a larger effect on the earnings quality (proxied by persistence) of <b>restating</b> firms relative to similar non-restating firms and if <b>restated</b> earnings are more persistent than the originally reported earnings. Design/methodology/approach – Cross-sectional earnings persistence models are used to analyze how earnings persistence changes around restatements for both the originally reported earnings and the new <b>restated</b> earnings numbers. The study looks at restatements from 1997 through 2006. Findings – The findings show that <b>restating</b> firms exhibit a larger increase in earnings persistence from the two-year period before to the two-year period after the restatements. Results also show that the <b>restated</b> portion of earnings is incrementally persistent relative to the originally reported earnings and the incremental persistence, although mitigated, is still significant after the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, the evidence shows that core account restatements are associated with more persistent earnings relative to non-core restatements in the two-year period after the most recent restatement year. Originality/value – The paper presents the first study to examine earnings restatements' impact on the future earnings persistence of <b>restating</b> firms in the context of the <b>restated</b> financial period as opposed to the restatement announcement period.

40|$|Enterprises {{located in}} {{countries}} with highly inflationary economies may prepare financial statements <b>restated</b> for general price-level changes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The tax bases of assets and liabilities of those enterprises are often <b>restated</b> {{for the effects of}} inflation. For those enterprises, the issues are: 1. How temporary differences should be computed under Statement 109 2. How deferred income tax expense or benefit for the year should be determined. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that when preparing financial statements <b>restated</b> for general price-level changes using end-of-current-year purchasing power units, temporary differences under Statement 109 are determined based on the difference between the indexed tax basis amount of the asset or liability and the related price-level <b>restated</b> amount reported in the financial statements.

25|$|Neo-creationism is a pseudoscientific {{movement}} {{which aims}} to <b>restate</b> creationism in terms {{more likely to be}} well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the scientific community. It aims to re-frame the debate over the origins of life in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the United States Supreme Court in Edwards v. Aguillard that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public-school curricula violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted. It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. In 2010, Dell paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.|$|E
25|$|The first {{movement}} {{revolves around}} a diatonic melody that soon develops into complex pianistic figuration. The second theme opens with quiet exchanges between the orchestra and the piano before fully diving {{into the second}} theme in B major. The {{first part of the}} first theme is restated before the movement is pulled into a loud development section which opens with toccata like quavers in the piano and reaches a loud chordal section. The whole development exhibits features similar to a canon, such as an eighth note passage in the piano in which the left hand and the right hand play overlapping figures. The movement reaches a number of ferocious climaxes, especially in the cadenza. Rachmaninoff wrote two versions of this cadenza: the chordal original, which is commonly notated as the ossia, and a second one with a lighter, toccata-like style. Both cadenzas lead into a quiet solo section where the flute, oboe, clarinet and horn <b>restate</b> the first theme of the exposition, accompanied by delicate arpeggios in the piano. The cadenza then ends quietly, but the piano alone continues to play a quiet development of the exposition's second theme in E major before leading to the recapitulation, where the first theme is restated by the piano, with the orchestra accompanying, soon closing with a quiet, rippling coda reminiscent of the second theme.|$|E
