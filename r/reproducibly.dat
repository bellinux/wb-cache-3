Ability to <b>reproducibly</b> differentiate between candidates, also known as overall test reliability, is markedly higher for the MMI than for other interview formats. This has translated into higher predictive validity, correlating for future performance much more highly than standard interviews.|$|E

In 2006 administration of normal circulating lymphocytes transduced with a retrovirus encoding a T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognized the MART-1 melanoma-melanocyte antigen, mediated tumor regression. In 2010 administration of lymphocytes genetically engineered to express a chimeric antibody receptor (CAR) against B cell antigen CD19 was shown to mediate regression of an advanced B cell lymphoma.|$|E
50|$|The Virtual Cybernetic Building Testbed (VCBT) {{is a whole}} {{building}} emulator {{located at}} the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It is designed with enough flexibility {{to be capable of}} <b>reproducibly</b> simulating normal operation and a variety of faulty and hazardous conditions that might occur in a cybernetic building. It serves as a testbed for investigating the interactions between integrated building systems and {{a wide range of issues}} important to the development of cybernetic building technology.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, [...] "Secondary {{thermometers}} {{are most}} widely used because of their convenience. Also, they are often much more sensitive than primary ones. For secondary thermometers knowledge of the measured property {{is not sufficient to}} allow direct calculation of temperature. They have to be calibrated against a primary thermometer at least at one temperature or at a number of fixed temperatures. Such fixed points, for example, triple points and superconducting transitions, occur <b>reproducibly</b> at the same temperature." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{electrical}} unit for the base unit in a rationalized system depends only on practical considerations, particularly {{the ability to}} realize the unit accurately and <b>reproducibly.</b> The ampere rapidly gained support over the ohm, as many national standards laboratories were already realizing the ampere in absolute terms using ampere balances. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted the Giorgi system with the ampere replacing the ohm in 1935, and this choice of base units is often called the MKSA system.|$|E

The association of abstract ideas and brain reward circuitry may interact with frontal attentional and emotive salience processing, suggesting a mechanism whereby doctrinal concepts {{may come to}} be intrinsically rewarding and motivate behavior in religious individuals." ...|$|E
50|$|The first <b>reproducibly</b> {{accurate}} measurements of atmospheric CO2 were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the 1950s. A {{few years later}} in March 1958 the first ongoing measurements were started by Keeling at Mauna Loa. Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since then. Now measurements are made at many sites globally. Additional measurement techniques are also used as well. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available on the conditions of proper acknowledgement according to the respective data user policies.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{individual}} genes {{have been identified}} as influencing variations in life span within a population of organisms. The effects of these genes is strongly dependent on the environment, in particular, on the organism's diet. Caloric restriction <b>reproducibly</b> results in extended lifespan in a variety of organisms, likely via nutrient sensing pathways and decreased metabolic rate. The molecular mechanisms by which such restriction results in lengthened lifespan are as yet unclear (see for some discussion); however, the behavior of many genes known to be involved in DNA repair is altered under conditions of caloric restriction.|$|E
50|$|Based on his dissertation, he {{developed}} together with Jacques van Rossum, {{a method for}} quantification of pharmacological effects {{as a result of}} ligand-receptor interactions. The thesis developed the concepts of receptor affinity and intrinsic activity. With the help of these terms he could describe the behavior of agonists and antagonists as well as the dual agonist / antagonist behavior of partial agonists. An important accomplishment of Ariëns was the establishment of experiments on isolated organs instead of the living animal (ex vivo), which quickly and <b>reproducibly</b> delivered data on the affinity and intrinsic activity of test substances.|$|E
50|$|Bacterial oxalotrophic {{metabolism}} {{is common}} in the environment, particularly in soils. Oxalotrophic bacteria are capable of using oxalate as a sole carbon and energy source. Closed-ampoule IMC was used to study metabolism of oxalotrophic soil bacteria exposed to both an optimized medium containing potassium oxalate as the sole carbon source and a model soil (Bravo et al. 2011). Using an optimized medium, growth of six different strains of soil bacteria was easily monitored and <b>reproducibly</b> quantified and differentiated over a period days. IMC measurement of bacterial metabolic heat flow in the model soil was more difficult, but a proof of concept was demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|Measurement of VOCs {{from the}} indoor air {{is done with}} {{sorption}} tubes e. g. Tenax® (for VOCs and SVOCs) or DNPH-cartridges (for carbonyl-compounds). The VOCs adsorb on these materials and are afterwards desorbed either thermally (Tenax®) or by elution (DNPH) and then analyzed by GC-MS/FID or HPLC. Reference gas mixtures are required for quality control of these VOC-measurements. Furthermore, VOC emitting products used indoors, e. g. building products and furniture, are investigated in emission test chambers under controlled climatic conditions. For quality control of these measurements round robin tests are carried out, therefore <b>reproducibly</b> emitting reference materials are ideally required.|$|E
50|$|Analysis by gas {{chromatography}} (GC) is {{the method of}} choice for FAME analysis. The GC is coupled with either a mass spectrometer detector (MSD) or a flame ionization detector (FID). The GC-MSD system is more expensive to purchase and to maintain as well as requiring considerable skill in operation. Identification of fatty acids using the GC-FID system is dependent on comparison of retention times of the compounds in comparison to purchased standards of fatty acid esters. A commercially available, fatty-acid based microbial identification system (using GC-FID), which <b>reproducibly</b> names and quantitates the FAMEs, has been widely adopted for PLFA analysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} was first described by Josef Rösch in 1969 at Oregon Health and Science University. It {{was first used}} in a human patient by Dr. Ronald Colapinto, of the University of Toronto, in 1982, but did not become <b>reproducibly</b> successful until the development of endovascular stents in 1985. In 1988 the first successful TIPS was realized by M. Rössle, G.M. Richter, G. Nöldge and J. Palmaz at the University of Freiburg. The procedure has since become widely accepted as the preferred method for treating portal hypertension that is refractory to medical therapy, replacing the surgical portocaval shunt in that role.|$|E
50|$|This {{position}} is used when restoring edentulous patients with removable or either implant-supported hybrid or fixed prostheses. Because the dentist {{wants to be}} able to <b>reproducibly</b> relate the patient's maxilla and mandible, but the patient does not have teeth with which to establish his or her own vertical dimension of occlusion, another method has been devised to achieve this goal. The condyle can only be in the same place as it was the last time it was positioned by the dentist if it is consistently moved to the most superior and anterior position within the fossa.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the beta}} {{cells in the}} {{pancreatic}} islets are selectively destroyed by an autoimmune process in type 1 diabetes, clinicians and researchers are actively pursuing islet transplantation {{as a means of}} restoring physiological beta cell function, which would offer an alternative to a complete pancreas transplant or artificial pancreas. Islet transplantation emerged as a viable option for the treatment of insulin requiring diabetes in the early 1970s with steady progress over the last three decades. Recent clinical trials have shown that insulin independence and improved metabolic control can be <b>reproducibly</b> obtained after transplantation of cadaveric donor islets into patients with unstable type 1 diabetes.|$|E
50|$|CERC-501 {{has been}} shown to <b>reproducibly</b> {{penetrate}} the blood-brain-barrier, and positron emission tomography imaging revealed that brain KORs were almost completely saturated by the drug 2.5 hours following a single dose of 10 mg, which supported the 4 mg to 25 mg dosages that CERC-501 is being explored in clinical trials. Occupancy was 35% for a 0.5 mg dose and 94% for a 10 mg dose. At 24 hours post-dose, receptor occupancy was 19% for 0.5 mg and 82% for 25 mg. No serious side effects were observed, and all side effects seen were mild to moderate and not considered to be due to CERC-501.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the lack}} of a {{connection}} between circular DNA and aging in higher organisms, extra copies of Sir2 are capable of extending the lifespan of both worms and flies (though, in flies, this finding has not been replicated by other investigators, and the activator of Sir2 resveratrol does not <b>reproducibly</b> increase lifespan in either species.) Whether the Sir2 homologues in higher organisms have any role in lifespan is unclear, but the human SIRT1 protein has been demonstrated to deacetylate p53, Ku70, and the forkhead family of transcription factors. SIRT1 can also regulate acetylates such as CBP/p300, and has been shown to deacetylate specific histone residues.|$|E
50|$|Pressure Cycling Technology ("PCT"). PCT is a patented, {{enabling}} technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels (up to 90,000 psi) to safely, conveniently and <b>reproducibly</b> control {{the actions of}} molecules in biological samples, e.g., the rupture (lysis) of cells and tissues from human, animal, plant, and microbial sources, and the inactivation of pathogens. PCT-enhanced systems (instruments and consumables) address some challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation. PCT advantages include: (a) extraction and recovery of more membrane proteins, (b) enhanced protein digestion, (c) differential lysis in a mixed sample base, (d) pathogen inactivation, (e) increased DNA detection, and (f) exquisite sample preparation process control.|$|E
5000|$|Modification of {{electrodes}} {{has developed}} beyond the size parameter. SECM-AFM probes {{can act as}} both a force sensor and electrode through the utilization of a flattened, etched metal wire coated by electrophoretic paint. In this system, the flattened wire acts as a flexible cantilever to measure the force against a sample (AFM) as the wire electrode measures the current (SECM). [...] Similarly, SECM functionality can be imparted into standard AFM probes by sputtering the surface with a conductive metal or by milling an insulated tip with a Focused Ion Beam (FIB). More recently, Electron Beam Lithography has been demonstrated to <b>reproducibly</b> generate SECM-AFM probes using silicon wafers.|$|E
5000|$|Validated {{biomarkers}} {{of aging}} {{would allow for}} testing interventions to extend lifespan, because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism. [...] Although maximum lifespan would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, {{it would not be}} a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because longitudinal studies would take far too much time. [...] Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of ageing and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be <b>reproducibly</b> measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism.|$|E

50|$|The benign human has {{an ability}} to quickly {{understand}} novel solutions, and provide the ability to adapt to unexpected conditions. This behavior can provide additional resilience to a control system, but <b>reproducibly</b> predicting human behavior is a continuing challenge. The ability to capture historic human preferences {{can be applied to}} bayesian inference and bayesian belief networks, but ideally a solution would consider direct understanding of human state using sensors such as an EEG. Considering control system design and interaction, the goal would be to tailor the amount of automation necessary to achieve some level of optimal resilience for this mixed initiative response. Presented to the human would be that actionable information that provides the basis for a targeted, reproducible response.|$|E
50|$|In HIL simulation, a {{simulator}} {{mimics the}} environment in which an ECU will function: a car, an airplane, a robot, etc. First the ECU’s inputs and outputs are connected to the simulator's inputs and outputs. In the next step, the simulator executes a real-time model of the ECU’s working environment, which can consist of Automotive Simulation Models (ASMs) from dSPACE or of models from other vendors. This method provides a way to test new functions <b>reproducibly</b> in a safe environment, before a prototype of the product has even been produced. As with rapid control prototyping, Simulink models are the foundation.The advantage of HIL simulation in comparison with ECU tests in real prototype vehicles is that the tests on the control unit can be performed already during the development process. Errors are detected and eliminated very early and cost-efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Although {{silanization}} of silicate surfaces {{was introduced}} more than 40 years ago, {{the process of}} formation of smooth layers on surfaces is still poorly understood. Probably {{the most important reason}} for this situation is that a number of studies that have involved silanization as part of the procedure have not been concerned with thoroughly characterizing the silane layer formed. The one result that unifies recent studies on the characterization of silane layers is centered on the extreme sensitivity of the reactions that lead to the formation of silane layers. Indeed, self-assembled layers of silanes on silicate surfaces have been reported to be dependent on various parameters such as humidity, temperature, impurities in the silane reagent and the type of silicate surface. In order to consistently and <b>reproducibly</b> make diverse functionalized surfaces with layers that are molecularly smooth, it is critical to understand the chemistry of the silicate surfaces {{and the ways in which}} various parameters affect the nature of the self-assembled layers.|$|E
50|$|The {{controlled}} combustion engines, {{designed by}} Bradley Howell-Smith of Australian firm Revetec Holdings Pty Ltd, use opposed pairs of pistons {{to drive a}} pair of counter-rotating three-lobed ("trilobate") cams through bearings. These elements replace the conventional crankshaft and connecting-rods, which enables {{the motion of the}} pistons to be purely axial, so that most of the power otherwise wasted on lateral motion of the con-rods is effectively transferred to the output shaft. This gives six strokes per revolution of the shaft. Independent tests <b>reproducibly</b> measure the efficiency of these engines at figures approaching 40%. Any even number of pistons can be used, in boxer or X configurations; the three lobes of the cams can be replaced by any other odd number greater than one; and the geometry of the cams can be changed to suit the needs of the target fuels and applications of the engines. Such variants may have ten or more strokes per cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Some cis eQTLs are {{detected}} in many tissue types {{but the majority}} of trans eQTLs are tissue-dependent (dynamic). eQTLs may act in cis (locally) or trans (at a distance) to a gene. The abundance of a gene transcript is directly modified by polymorphism in regulatory elements. Consequently, transcript abundance might be considered as a quantitative trait that can be mapped with considerable power. These have been named expression QTLs (eQTLs) The combination of whole-genome genetic association studies and the measurement of global gene expression allows the systematic identification of eQTLs. By assaying geneexpression and genetic variation simultaneously on a genome-wide basis in a large number of individuals, statistical genetic methods can be used to map the genetic factors that underpin individual differences in quantitative levels of expression of many thousands oftranscripts. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) <b>reproducibly</b> associated with complex disorders [...] as well as certain pharmacologic phenotypes [...] are found to be significantly enriched for eQTLs, relative to frequency-matched control SNPs.|$|E
50|$|The {{bioactive}} structures (native or 3D conformation or shape) of {{the isolated}} protein molecules do not undergo any significant conformational changes. Thus, active metal cofactor-containing proteins can be isolated <b>reproducibly</b> {{in the same}} fractions after a PAGE run (see figure Electropherogram). A shifting peak in the respective electropherogram (here: different from peak maximum in fraction 24) may either indicate that a denatured metalloprotein is available in a complex protein mixture to be separated or the standardized time of gel polymerization (69 hr, RT) is not implemented in a PAGE experiment. A lower deviation of the standardized polymerization time (< 69 hr) stands for incomplete polymerization, and thus, for inherent instability due to gel softening during the cross-linking of polymers as the material reaches swelling equilibrium, whereas exceeding this time limit (> 69 hr) is an indicator of gel aging (see figures Electropherogram and Hydrolysis, cf. section Principle). Under standard conditions excluding denaturing pre-analytical steps, metalloproteins with different molecular mass ranges and isoelectric points have been recovered in biologically active form at a quantitative yield of more than 95%.|$|E
5000|$|Above all, these {{instruments}} {{are famous for}} the quality of sound they produce. However, the many blind experiments from 1817 to the present (as of 2014) have never found any difference in sound between Stradivari's violins and high-quality violins in comparable style of other makers and periods, nor has acoustic analysis. In a particularly famous test on a BBC Radio 3 programme in 1977, the violinists Isaac Stern and Pinchas Zukerman and the violin expert and dealer Charles Beare tried to distinguish between the [...] "Chaconne" [...] Stradivarius, a 1739 Guarneri del Gesú, an 1846 Vuillaume, and a 1976 British violin played behind a screen by a professional soloist. The two violinists were allowed to play all the instruments first. None of the listeners identified more than two of the four instruments. Two of the listeners identified the 20th-century violin as the Stradivarius. Violinists and others have criticized these tests on various grounds such as that they are not double-blind (in most cases), the judges are often not experts, and the sounds of violins are hard to evaluate objectively and <b>reproducibly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the small}} size of the fluidic conduits, nanofluidic {{structures}} are naturally applied in situations demanding that samples be handled in exceedingly small quantities, including Coulter counting, analytical separations and determinations of biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA, and facile handling of mass-limited samples. One of the more promising areas of nanofluidics is its potential for integration into microfluidic systems, i.e. micrototal analytical systems or lab-on-a-chip structures. For instance, NCAMs, when incorporated into microfluidic devices, can <b>reproducibly</b> perform digital switching, allowing transfer of fluid from one microfluidic channel to another, selectivity separate and transfer analytes by size and mass, mix reactants efficiently, and separate fluids with disparate characteristics. In addition, there is a natural analogy between the fluid handling capabilities of nanofluidic structures and the ability of electronic components to control the flow of electrons and holes. This analogy has been used to realize active electronic functions such as rectification and field-effect and bipolar transistoraction with ionic currents. Application of nanofluidics is also to nano-optics for producing tuneable microlens array ...|$|E

50|$|The Xenopus model {{organism}} {{is responsible}} for large amounts of new knowledge on embryonic development and cell biology. Xenopus {{has a number of}} unique experimental advantages as a vertebrate model. Paramount among these is the robustness of early embryos and their amenability to microinjection and microsurgery. This makes them a particularly attractive system for testing the ectopic activity of gene products and loss-of-function experiments using antagonizing reagents such as morpholinos, dominant-negatives and neomorphic proteins. Morpholinos are synthetic oligonucleotides {{that can be used to}} inhibit nuclear RNA splicing or mRNA translation and are the common gene inhibition reagent in Xenopus as neither siRNA or miRNA have yet been shown to <b>reproducibly</b> function in frog embryos. Xenopus embryos develop very quickly and form a full set of differentiated tissues within days of fertilization, allowing rapid analysis of the effects of manipulating embryonic gene expression. The large size of embryos and amenability to microinjection also makes them extremely well suited to microarray approaches. Furthermore, these same characteristics make Xenopus, one of the few vertebrate model organisms suited for chemical screens. Xenbase provides a large database of images illustrating the full genome, movies detailing embryogenesis, and multiple online tools useful for designing and conducting experiments using Xenopus.|$|E

In these patients, cardiac arrhythmias it was shown {{for the very first time}} that were first shown to be possibly initiated and terminated by critically timed premature beats. In 1971, he reported on the use of programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in patients with atrial flutter, AV nodal tachycardia, and accessory atrioventricular connections. In 1972, he showed that the arrhythmia of patients with ventricular tachycardia could also <b>reproducibly</b> be initiated and terminated by timed premature stimuli. These investigations were the basis for the new surgical and pacing approaches to the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias that became known as [...] "cardiac electrophysiology".to be Wellens also demonstrated that the reproducible initiation and termination of arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart allowed the study of the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs on the mechanism of the arrhythmia. In 1977, he moved to the new University of Limburg in Maastricht, Netherlands, to develop academic cardiology there. Starting from scratch, he created an internationally known center for the study and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.|$|E
5000|$|They {{noted that}} 70% of the {{transcription}} coverage {{was less than}} 1 transcript per cell. They noted that this [...] "larger proportion of genome with reproducible but low biochemical signal strength and less evolutionary conservation is challenging to parse between specific functions and biological noise". Furthermore, assay resolution often is much broader than the underlying functional sites so some of the <b>reproducibly</b> “biochemically active but selectively neutral” sequences are unlikely to serve critical functions, especially those with lower-level biochemical signal. To this they added, [...] "However, we also acknowledge substantial limitations in our current detection of constraint, given that some human-specific functions are essential but not conserved and that disease-relevant regions need not be selectively constrained to be functional." [...] On the other hand, they argued that the 12-15% fraction of human DNA under functional constraint, as estimated {{by a variety of}} extrapolative evolutionary methods, may still be an underestimate. They concluded that in contrast to evolutionary and genetic evidence, biochemical data offer clues about both the molecular function served by underlying DNA elements and the cell types in which they act. Ultimately genetic, evolutionary, and biochemical approaches can all be used in a complementary way to identify regions that may be functional in human biology and disease.|$|E
