5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to <b>really</b> <b>set</b> this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would <b>really</b> <b>set</b> this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what <b>really</b> <b>set</b> her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E
25|$|Byron would pleasantly {{pretend that}} Braham called 'enthusiasm' entoozy-moozy; {{and in the}} {{extraordinary}} combination of lightness, haste, indifference and fervour with which he would pitch out that single word from his lips, accompanied with a gesture to correspond, he would <b>really</b> <b>set</b> before you the admirable singer {{in one of his}} (then) characteristic passages of stage dialogue. He did not live to see Braham become an exception in his dialogue as in his singing.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Richardson's consistency and strenuous work, Lockwood was never capable of long bowling spells. He bowled off a much shorter run than Richardson {{and tended to}} come down very heavily in his delivery stride. Lockwood could break back, though rarely as sharply as Richardson, but what <b>really</b> <b>set</b> Lockwood apart was his unpredictability, with extremely subtle variations of pace and pitch characterising his bowling. Frequently Lockwood would deliver a slow ball without change of action and the batsman would claim they never expected it.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} {{transportation}} improvements {{during the early}} nineteenth century, industry paved the way within individual states. After successful canal development projects further east in the United States, {{it would not be}} long until canals would soon be dug across the Midwest. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 paved the way for improvement projects across the United States and changed the course of American transportation history. The Erie Canal was an immediate financial success. This <b>really</b> <b>set</b> the precedent for future canals and proved canals could provide a viable contribution to local economies.|$|E

It was reported on 19 August 2007 that Kensit's casting had [...] "boosted the series' appeal" [...] {{to such an extent}} that for the first time, a Holby City calendar had been commissioned.

Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples. Coker still has nightmares from his time as a POW. Reflecting on his wartime experiences in a Veterans Day tribute to POWs, he said [...] "If you're never tested, you don't know...You're capable of a great deal more than you realize, if you <b>really</b> <b>set</b> your mind to it.

500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{said that}} the lack of the writing staff in the second season was [...] "disappointing". He [...] "love how this show is about NBC and <b>really</b> <b>set</b> at NBC", but was worried about the misuse of guest stars. Robert Canning of IGN said that for the first time, Jenna's storyline was the [...] "most {{entertaining}} of the night". He felt that first half of the episode was [...] "tightly written and very funny", but the second half [...] "waned a bit, with less than stellar conclusions to the stories and far less funny bits". Canning said that Jack's storyline was the [...] "most disappointing", and hoped that future guest stars were used properly, rather than for the sake of having a name guest star. George Freitag of BuddyTV said that although Tracy was [...] "not as strong as the previous two episodes", he was [...] "still terrific and the nod to his old SNL skit was a nice touch". He felt {{that the lack of}} focus on the personal life of Liz seemed to give the series [...] "a lack of focus". Freitag hoped that her private issues would be further explored, as [...] "her approachable yet successful persona {{was one of the main}} draws to the series in the first place". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that the episode [...] "fell a bit flat", and that the season lacked the other TGSers, Lonny, Frank, Twofer and [...] "director guy". He did not enjoy Jack's storyline, but said that Jenna's storyline [...] "ultimately won a thumbs-up from me for her getting turned on by Kenneth's rudeness".|$|E
500|$|The {{sequencing}} of the record's track list was done strategically, starting with songs that lyrically depict societal injustices {{and ending with}} those that explore love, relationships and sexuality. This decision also factored into the album's artwork and marketing, giving it an overt black and white militant imagery. Jam explained that [...] "he idea of putting 'Rhythm Nation', 'Living in the World' and 'The Knowledge' as the first three songs on the record <b>really</b> <b>set</b> the tone {{as to what the}} record was. Then to have the segue after that where she says, 'Get the point? Good. Let's dance...' and then go into 'Miss You Much', that was purposely done." [...] He also stated that the safer marketing strategy for the project would have been [...] "a beautiful colored picture of Janet on the cover" [...] with Escapade as its title, starting the track listing with [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] and [...] "Escapade", and ending it with [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "The Knowledge" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] but noted that despite being the same collection of songs, the alternate sequencing and imagery would not have had the same impact. Of its lyrical themes, Kate Kelly stated the album [...] "reveals a social conscience speaking of getting an education, avoiding drugs, and feeding the homeless. All this might seem a little heavy for dance music or pop radio, but Jackson fuses her concepts with driving dance energy that hits the hearts of those hitting the dance-floor." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety described it as [...] "a quasi-concept album whose opening three songs directly addressed crime, the crack epidemic, racism, homelessness and youth illiteracy — not exactly a recipe for a party. And yet the record was somehow even more successful than Control, generating a then-record seven top 5 singles." ...|$|E

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what <b>really</b> <b>set</b> their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Demonstrations against {{violence}} in Venezuela began in January 2014, and continued, when {{former presidential candidate}} Henrique Capriles shook the hand of President Maduro; this [...] "gesture... cost him support and helped propel" [...] opposition leader Leopoldo López Mendoza to the forefront.

[...] But what <b>really</b> <b>set</b> them off was the harsh police response to their initial protest, in which several students were detained and allegedly abused, as well as follow-up demonstrations to call for their release". These protests expanded, attracted non-students, and led to more detentions; eventually, other students joined, and the protests spread to Caracas and other cities, with opposition leaders getting involved.|$|E
