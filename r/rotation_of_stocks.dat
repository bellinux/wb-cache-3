These investigations produced a Queensland phenomenon without Australian precedent in terms of rationale, geographical diversity, and commitment of resources. In some regions, exposure of herds to fluoride emerged as an urgent issue because fluoride was perceived as an invasive, invisible, and odourless ‘contaminant’ in artesian water. This paper discusses the scientific background to, and management of, concerns over the consumption by <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> artesian water with {{a high concentration of}} natural bioavailable fluoride.

Using a case study approach a total of eleven interviews were conducted with employees of the retailer to identify factors contributing to product shrinkage and ways to overcome these through the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.

The objective of this research was to study the effect of different farming systems (conventional farming with mineral fertilizers vs. organic farming with organic fertilizers (catch crops and composted manure)) under the same 5 -crop rotation system on the SOC stock. Data presented in this paper concerned the first rotation during 2008 – 2012. The main factors were farming systems: conventional and organic. Four conventional farming systems differed in the mineral nitrogen application rates. In two organic farming systems catch crops were used with or without composted solid cattle manure.

Single entry overbark and underbark total volume tables are given for E. camaldulensis and D. sissoo using DBH as the predictor variable.
