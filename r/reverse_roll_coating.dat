40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} study of dynamic wetting in metering and pre-metered forward roll coating shows that the dimensionless applicator flow rate λA, is the key parameter as it defines whether dynamic failure occurs by air entrainment (λA>λA, trans) or cascade (λA< λA, trans). λA, trans is the flow rate when the regime switches from metering to pre-metered and λA, min, the minimum flow rate in the pre-metered regime. When Ca was varied in the range 0. 2 → 5, λA, trans and λA, min were in the range 1. 40 → 1. 29 and 1. 20 → 1. 18 respectively. These values compare very well with theoretical predictions. The air entrainment speeds V*M {{were found to be}} similar to the corresponding speeds V*plunging, measured in plunging tape flow but the cascade speeds V**M can be smaller or larger depending on λA. This led to exploring hydrodynamic assistance and drawing an analogy with curtain coating, which was supported by the data. It was also observed that cascade occurred in the pre-metered regime because the dynamic wetting line XD, moves near the minimum gap position just as in <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating.</b> Indeed the cascade speeds conform to correlations developed for <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating.</b> Finally the study gives data on XD, and compares them with theoretical predictions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} primarily with the investigation, both analytically and numerically, of instabilities in reverse- and forward-roll and slot coating flows. Consideration {{is restricted to}} Newtonian, incompressible fluids {{in the absence of}} inertial forces. The onset of the ribbing instability in inlet flooded, <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> is examined first by applying linear stability theory to a base flow formulated using lubrication theory. Regions of instability are established and found to be in accord with experimental observation. These results are then compared with predictions from a stability hypothesis based on a two-dimensional force balance argument. This simple criterion shows that the effect of various parameters on the stability of the downstream free surface can be ascertained by examining their influence on the pressure gradient and meniscus location. The stability hypothesis is shown to underpredict the critical capillary number and so is only sufficient for predicting stability. Results are also compared to ones obtained numerically by applying linear stability theory to finite element solutions for the entire flow field, the principal difference being that the analytical approach overpredicts the critical capillary number for the onset of instability. A variation of inlet flooded, <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> is then studied in which the nip is fed from above by a large reservoir of fluid (i. e. a hydrostatic head). The influence of this head on the base flow (obtained using lubrication theory) and its stability is then investigated. An improved model of the dynamic contact line, developed by Shikhmurzaev [1993 a] is described in which the dynamic contact angle is no longer kept constant, but is a function of various fluid and geometrical parameters. The limit of this theory for small capillary number is incorporated into the analytical model from which its effect on the base flow and stability is examined. Instabilities in forward roll coating are then investigated. The inlet flooded case is studied using linear stability analysis, a stability hypothesis and the finite element method. As in <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating,</b> the stability hypothesis at the downstream free surface is sufficient for predicting stability only. The finite element method, on the other hand, leads to solutions that are in close agreement with linear stability theory, unlike the reverse roll case. Inlet starved forward roll coating is examined next and, as with the inlet flooded case, the ribbing instability can still manifest at the downstream free surface. The presence of an instability known as bead break, noted experimentally by Malone [1992] and Gaskell et al [1998], is verified analytically using linear stability theory. It is then shown that a stability hypothesis applied at the upstream free surface gives an accurate description of stability (unlike at the downstream free surface). Finally, the slot coating geometry is explored. A geometrically flexible finite element code is described for which it is possible to use various lip shapes and a roll of variable radius and location (with respect to the slot). Initially, as has always been the case in previous work reported in the literature, the numerical mesh incorporates a downstream wetting line pinned at the lip edge and the effect of the various fluid and geometrical parameters on the resultant pressure profile and upstream meniscus location is examined. These numerical results are seen to compare favourably with predictions obtained analytically using a model based on lubrication theory. However, Sartor [1990] showed that the downstream wetting line does not always remain pinned, but can climb up the die shoulder or regress into the coating gap. This has been confirmed experimentally by Kapur [1998] who also notes that ribs only appear when operating in the unpinned regime. Hence, the case in which the downstream, static contact line has retreated from the lip edge towards the inlet is studied. Pressure profiles and meniscus locations are compared with those for the case of a pinned downstream wetting line and the numerical linear stability analysis used to determine the effect of the fluid and geometrical parameters on the stability of the downstream free surface...|$|E

The study on the dynamics and optimal coating windows in coating processes is quite important industrially as well as academically, because it {{is closely related to}} productivity and high quality control of coating products, especially, in films, flat panel displays, batteries, and steel products. Recently, rheological aspects of viscoelastic coating liquids on the coating dynamics have attracted researchers' interest, since non-Newtonian behavior in coating flows can change the performance of a coater (Dontula, 1999).

40|$|The {{objective}} of a coating operation is to transfer a defect free liquid film onto a continuous substrate {{in order to}} meet the requirements of the final products. Mainly two concerns govern the process. The first concern is the economics of the process and the second concern is the quality of the coated film. The economics of the process are dictated by the speed of coating and the film thickness. Clearly, higher speeds mean better productivity hence less cost of operation and thinner films are desirable because less material is being used. Quality is governed by film uniformity and integrity, indicating that the film will perform as designed. Film defects such as streaks or tiny air bubbles are indication that the film properties are not uniform rendering it unacceptable to customers. One of the most versatile coating systems to achieve thin films at high speeds is <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> which has been used for a long time all over the world. At low speed, typically 1 m/s, this coating operation is inherently stable and with small gaps of order 100 microns can ii lead to film thickness of order 30 - 50 microns. Much research, theoretical and experimental, has been devoted to this coating flow but only at low speeds and for large gaps (> 100 microns). There are no comprehensive data how very thin films, 20 microns and less (particularly lower limits in the region of 5 microns) can be achieved at high speeds, of 2 or more metres per second. This study is concerned precisely with this aim, that of investigating the effect of large speeds and small roller gaps (rollers nearly touching or in elastohydrodynamic contact) to achieve the very thin films desired by modern applications (electronics, medical and others). In order to achieve this aim, a rig was designed and built to enable to understand the effect of various coating conditions and liquid properties on the metered film thickness and coating instability. To achieve thin films at high speeds, small roll gap and low viscosity are needed, however flow instabilities will develop under these conditions. To achieve stable coating window at high speeds high surface tension is needed. It was found that the roll gap and the viscosity have complicated effect on the coating window. In the case of low viscosity liquid (7 mPa. s), small roll gaps are needed, whereas in the case of high viscosity liquid (more than 30 mPa. s), large gaps are needed. It was found that Weber number is better describer for ribbing instability in rigid <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> unlike in rigid forward roll coating in which capillary number is the one. In addition the potential of reverse deformable roll coating (rolls in elastohydrodynamic contact) was investigated in order to achieve much thinner films at higher speeds. As a result of the investigation of reverse deformable roll coating, it was found that there is a possibility to get much thinner stable films at much higher speeds compared to reverse rigid roll coating. The liquid transfer from an applicator roller to a PET film was investigated in this study. It was found that air stagnation at downstream meniscus and air entrainment at upstream meniscus depend on the liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension and coating conditions such as web tension and wrap angle of web. As a result, wet film instability also depends on liquid properties and coating conditions. It was found that air stagnation causes streaks on the wet film and air entrainment caused bubbles on the wet film. To get a stable wet film, it was found that suitable viscosity and high surface tension were needed. TOYOB...|$|E
40|$|Coil coating is {{a widely}} used coating method where a coating is {{continuously}} applied onto a steel strip. At SSAB the topcoat is applied using reverse three-roll coating. There are various coating errors that are typical for this coating method {{that are difficult to}} eliminate. The aim of this thesis was to reduce the formation of striping errors in polyester coatings at SSAB's continuous color coating lines by modifying the properties of the paint. The focus of this thesis is on two specific common coating errors: the longitudinal ribbing stripe and the transverse cascade stripe. Cascade occurs when the meniscus between the rolls travels too far inside the nip due to a high roll speed ratio. This causes air to get caught in the meniscus, which leads to a transverse stripe. Ribbing occurs when pressure gradients in the meniscus cause small disturbances to widen instead of leveling. The conditions where striping errors form are complicated and often difficult to control. In practice, the surface quality in <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> is controlled by modifying the roll speeds. Suitable roll speed ranges constitute a coating window, in which the produced surface quality is considered to be acceptable. Based on literature, it was identified that the coating window could be widened by increasing the surface tension of the paint. To confirm the effect of surface tension on error formation, a series of trial runs with modified polyester paints with increased and lowered surface tension was performed. The line trials were designed to go through a trial cycle, where the striping of the paints was comprehensively tested at various roll speed conditions. Viscosity and surface tension of the paints were measured. In addition to the polyester paints, a particle structured paint was also modified and a line trial was performed. The results of the trial runs were positive with the high surface tension polyester paints exhibiting superior surface quality compared to production paints in all trial runs. The high surface tension particle structured paint also had significant improvement in striping performance, which means that the improvements gained by increasing the surface tension could potentially be extended to other coatings used at SSAB...|$|E

40|$|Gravure <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> is a {{technique}} used to coat fluids {{of a wide range}} of viscosities (up to 1500 mPa s) onto substrates at speeds of up to 900 m/min (Booth, 1970, 1990). Coat thicknesses in the range of less than 1 micron up to 50 microns can be achieved, making this a versatile process which is finding application across a growing number of market sectors. Gravure <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> differs from many of the conventional <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> techniques in that one of the rolls is patterned with a surface engraving (the ‘gravure’ or ‘anilox’ pattern). Both the shape and the size of the gravure pattern can be varied which affects the final properties of the coating. The term ‘gravure roll coating’ covers a number of distinct gravure coating arrangements. Two common variants of these are direct gravure coating and offset gravure coating, see Figure 1. Direct gravure coating is where the fluid transfer takes place directly from the gravure roll to the web, whilst in offset gravure coating, fluid is transferred first from the gravure roll to a smooth deformable roll (often termed the applicator roll), and then from the deformable roll to the web. Whilst both are described as gravure coating processes, the fluid mechanics of these two processes are very different and will be described separately. Gravure ‘coating’ is distinct from gravure ‘printing’ (or roto-gravure), in that gravure coating is designed to give uniform coverage on the substrate whilst gravure printing is designed to print specifi c patterns. The quality of gravure coating can be defi ned in terms of the thickness and variation of the coating, whilst the quality of gravure printing will include quantifi cation of print characteristics such as resolution and edge definition. This article will focus on gravure coating, but many of the emerging markets, for example in the manufacture of electronic products such as solar cells, require both large areas of uniform coating but with good edge definition.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} a number of coating processes using experimental, analytical and computational techniques. The first problem, considered experimentally, is that of <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> with a liquid reservoir positioned directly above horizontally aligned rollers. Measurements of the film thickness {{as a function of the}} height of fluid in the reservoir and speed ratio are presented. When the wetting line is located downstream of the nip, either a decrease in the height of the associated hydrostatic head or an increase in the speed ratio causes a reduction in the thickness of the outgoing film. However, when the wetting line is located upstream of the nip the opposite is found to be true. The bead-break instability in forward meniscus coating is considered both experimentally and analytically. Agreement between predictions from a simple mathematical model of the stable bead and experimentally determined meniscus positions is seen to be excellent. A perturbation hypothesis is used to predict the onset of the bead-break instability, at which the upstream meniscus accelerates rapidly towards the downstream one, so the two collide and the bead collapses. The results from the model compare well with experiments. An outline of a method for using the bead-break instability as a design criterion is also presented. Typically in a slot, blade or knife coater the downstream meniscus is assumed to pin at a corner of the coating device. In chapter 5, a series of experiments and a corresponding computational study, are presented which illustrate that the meniscus can advance up the face of such coating devices (in this case a roll-flat plate system). Reducing the corner angle is seen to reduce the size of the climb region and the associated recirculation at this point at the downstream meniscus. It is also shown that the meniscus can detach from the corner and retreat into the gap, which can in turn give rise to the ribbing instability. An offset gravure coating arrangement is considered in chapter 6. The coating arrangement is split into two areas of study - the offset gravure nip and the kiss coating bead. An experimental investigation of the offset nip with the two rolls vertically aligned and running at the same speed in forward mode reveals two ways in which the metered film thickness can be influenced. Either increasing the nip force by pressing the two rolls together or decreasing the roll speeds causes a reduction in the metered film thickness. At higher speeds the metered film thickness is observed to asymptote to a limiting value, the value of which depends on the gravure pattern. The reverse mode kiss coating bead operating at speed ratios greater than one is also investigated. Experiments reveal that under these conditions, all the fluid is transferred from the roll surface to the web and the two make contact due to the generation of a sub-ambient pressure field within the bead. Two models based on lubrication theory are derived, one assuming an infinitely tensioned web and a second that incorporates the effect of web flexibility. The latter is found to give much better agreement with the experimental data. Finally a perturbation hypothesis is applied to these to models in order to predict the onset of the ribbing instability, both of which are found to give reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the results of a systematic experimental investigation of reverse mode direct gravure coating is reported, where the web runs directly over a gravure roll surface. This wide ranging parametric study illustrates the effect of the operating parameters on the final film thickness. Key findings are that speed ratio, fluid properties and cell shape and size can significantly influence the final film thickness. For a fixed roll speed it is observed that as the web speed is increased the gravure bead becomes unstable. This results in streaking on the web, and gives an upper limit to the speed ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|YesThis {{experimental}} study of forward gravure coating considers the effects of operating variables on air entrainment, ribbing instabilities and {{the thickness of the}} film formed. The data show that this coating method can yield very thin films of thickness of order of 15 - 20 % at most of the equivalent cell depth of a gravure roller. Air free and non ribbed stable uniform films can however only be obtained in a narrow window of operating conditions at very low substrate capillary number (CaS ~ 0. 02) equivalent to substrate speeds typically less than 20 m/min. The paper draws a similarity with flow features observed with smooth forward <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> and slide coating. It is shown that the onset of ribbing and the flux distribution between the gravure roller and the substrate at the exit of the nip obey approximately the same rules as in smooth forward <b>roll</b> <b>coating,</b> whereas the onset of air entrainment actually corresponds to a low-flow limit of coatability similar to that observed in slide coating...|$|R

The compressive stress improves the ability of the glass surface to withstand damage from mechanical impact. However, the presence of the damage resistant layer makes conventional mechanical and laser cutting of the ion-exchanged glass difficult.

Even successful in some samples, the underlying central tension is exposed on the edge, and the mechanical strength and durability of this edge is degraded.

One of the largest application areas is thin films, which can be produced {{on a piece of}} substrate by spin coating or dip coating. Protective and decorative coatings, and electro-optic components can be applied to glass, metal and other types of substrates with these methods. Cast into a mold, and with further drying and heat-treatment, dense ceramic or glass articles with novel properties can be formed that cannot be created by any other method. Other coating methods include spraying, electrophoresis, inkjet printing or <b>roll</b> <b>coating.</b>|$|R

40|$|A two-roll {{apparatus}} is used {{to explore}} experimentally the detailed fluid mechanics of meniscus <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> in which inlets are starved and flow rates are small. Both forward and reverse modes of operation (with contra- and co-rotating rolls) are investigated using optical sectioning combined with dye injection and particle imaging techniques. That part of parameter space where meniscus coating occurs is identied by varying the roll separation and roll speeds and hence flow rate and capillary number. Key features of the flow structures identied in the forward mode include two large eddies (each with saddle point, separatrix and sub-eddies), a primary fluid transfer jet {{and the existence of}} two critical flow rates associated with the switching-on of a second fluid transfer jet and the switching-o of the primary transfer jet followed by a change in the flow structure. In the reverse mode, the key features are a single large eddy consisting of two sub-eddies, a saddle point and separatrix, a primary fluid transfer jet and once again two critical flow rates. These correspond to (i) the switching-on of a secondary transfer jet and (ii) the disappearance of a saddle point at the nip resulting in the merger of the primary and secondary transfer jets. Measurements of lm thickness and meniscus location made over a range of speed ratios and capillary numbers are compared with theoretical predictions. A plate{roll apparatus {{is used to}} conrm the presence, for very small flow rates, of a sub-ambient, almost linear, pressure prole across the bead. Investigated also is the transition from inlet-starved to fully flooded <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> as flow rate is increased and the changes in flow structure and pressure prole are observed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Near-surface {{deformed}} layers {{developed on}} aluminum alloys significantly influence the corrosion and tribological behavior {{as well as}} reduce the surface quality of the rolled aluminum. The evolution of the near-surface microstructures induced on magnesium containing aluminum alloys during thermomechanical processing has been investigated with the aim generating {{an understanding of the}} influence of individual forming parameters on its evolution and examine the microstructure of the <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> induced on the mating steel roll through material transfer during rolling. The micro-mechanisms related to the various features of near-surface microstructure developed during tribological conditions of the simulated hot rolling process were identified. Thermomechanical processing experiments were performed with the aid of hot rolling (operating temperature: 550 to 460 °C, 4, 10 and 20 rolling pass schedules) and hot forming (operating temperature: 350 to 545 °C, strain rate: 4 × 10 - 2 s- 1) tribo-simulators. The surface, near-surface features and material transfer induced during the elevated temperature plastic deformation were examined and characterized employing optical interferometry, SEM/EDS, FIB and TEM. Near-surface features characterized on the rolled aluminum alloys included; cracks, fractured intermetallic particles, aluminum nano-particles, oxide decorated grain boundaries, rolled-in oxides, shingles and blisters. These features were related to various individual rolling parameters which included, the work roll roughness, which induced the formation of shingles, rolling marks and were responsible for the redistribution of surface oxide and the enhancements of the depth of the near-surface damage. The enhanced stresses and strains experienced during rolling were related to the formation and propagation of cracks, the nanocrystalline structure of the near-surface layers and aluminum nano-particles. The mechanism of the evolution of the near-surface microstructure were determined to include grain boundary sliding which induced the cracks at the surface and subsurface of the alloy, magnesium diffusion to free surfaces, crack propagation from shear stresses and the shear strains inducing the nanocrystalline grain structure, the formation of shingles by the shear deformation of micro-wedges induced by the work roll grooves, and the deformation of this oxide covered micro-wedges inducing the rolled-in oxides. Magnesium diffusion to free surfaces was identified as inducing crack healing due to the formation of MgO within cracks and was responsible for the oxide decorated grain boundaries. An examination of the <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> revealed a complex layered microstructure that was induced through tribo-chemical and mechanical entrapment mechanisms. The microstructure of the <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> suggested that the work roll material and the rolled aluminum alloy were essential in determining its composition and structure. Subsequent hot forming processes revealed the rich oxide-layer of the near-surface microstructure was beneficial for reducing the coefficient of friction during tribological contact with the steel die. Damage to the microstructure include cracks induced from grain boundary sliding of near-surface grains and the formation of oxide fibres within cracks of the near-surface deformed layers...|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{version of}} the game is {{somewhat}} different from the Western version and the remake Shinobi Gaisen. The game came with 8 levels (missing Cross the Checkpoint and Punish the Corrupt Minister) and each level only has one layout. The option screen, character select and level select all come with different graphics. The boss characters have different weapons and before each level there is a small amount of Japanese dialogue that gives more detail into the game. The fighting moves are also different, whereas on the later version, mashing the button for attacks is all well and good, but in this version each strike must be timed to get the full flurry of moves. The 180 degree <b>reverse</b> <b>roll</b> is also absent.|$|R
