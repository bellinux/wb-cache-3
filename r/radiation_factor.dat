40|$|The {{radiation}} efficiency of different plasterboard walls was determined through measurements in the direct sound transmission facilities at the University of Applied Science in Stuttgart. The {{radiation efficiency}} was determined using airborne sound excitation in the source room. The velocity on the plasterboard {{on the receiving}} room side was measured using accelerometers and the radiated sound power was calculated from the sound pressure level in the diffuse receiving room. In this study it was identified that the radiation efficiency of identical boards depends strongly {{on the construction of}} the wall (shaft wall, single stud wall, double stud wall) and in the low frequency range also on the mass-spring-mass resonance frequency of the double walls. The typical shape of the <b>radiation</b> <b>factor,</b> going from high to low frequencies, shows a decrease below the critical frequency of the plasterboard (at approx. 3 kHz) down to approx. - 15 dB in the frequency range from 1250 Hz to 250 Hz. Below 250 Hz the <b>radiation</b> <b>factor</b> increases again, almost up to 0 dB in the frequency region close to the resonance frequency of the mass-spring-mass resonance. Why there is this increase of the radiation efficiency at low frequencies is explained through calculations that are related to the stiffness of the complete construction.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} so-called <b>radiation</b> effectiveness <b>factors</b> {{that are}} intended to represent the biological effective-ness of different radiation types, relative to high-energy 60 Co gamma rays, {{for the purpose of}} estimating cancer risks and probability of causation of radiogenic cancers in identified individuals. <b>Radiation</b> effectiveness <b>factors</b> are expressed as subjective probability distributions to represent uncertainty that arises from uncertainties in estimates of relative biological effectiveness obtained from radiobiological studies of stochas-tic endpoints, limited data on biological effectiveness obtained from human epidemiological studies, and other judgments involved in evaluating the applicability of available informa-tion to induction of cancers in humans. Primarily on the basis of reviews and evaluations of available data by experts, probability distributions of <b>radiation</b> effectiveness <b>factors</b> are developed for the following radiation types: neutrons of energy less than 10 keV, 10 – 100 keV, 0. 1 – 2 MeV (including fission neutrons), 2 – 20 MeV, and greater than 20 MeV; alpha parti-cles of any energy emitted by radionuclides; photons of energy 30 – 250 keV and less than 30 keV; and electrons of energy less than 15 keV. Photons of energy greater than 250 keV and electrons of energy greater than 15 keV are assumed to have the same biological effectiveness as reference 60 Co gamma rays and are assigned a <b>radiation</b> effectiveness <b>factor</b> of unity, without uncertainty. For neutrons and alpha particles, sepa-rate probability distributions of <b>radiation</b> effectiveness <b>factors</b> are developed for solid tumors and leukemias, and small corrections to represent an inverse dose-rate effect are applied to those distributions in cases of chronic exposure.

The Population oncological morbidity indicators were analyzed (all malignant neoplasms, including those in thyroid gland, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue) in the territories contrastingly differing on the levels of <b>radiation</b> <b>factor</b> impact. The study covered the period of 2010 – 2014. It was established that for Voronezh Region territories referred to as the post- Chernobyl radioactively contaminated zone over 29 years period the maximum soil surface contamination by 137 Cs and 90 Sr radionuclides reduced by 1. 90 and 1. 91 times (from 3, 15 Ci/km 2 to 1, 66 Ci/km 2 and from 0, 063 Ci/km 2 to 0, 0033 Ci/km 2, respectively).

40|$|Abstract. The {{study was}} done to {{determine}} concentrations of radionuclides and heavy metals and to evaluate the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in samples of Elodea canadensis, a submerged plant, collected {{in different parts of}} the Yenisei River. Samples were collected in the area subjected to radioactive impact of the Mining-and-Chemical Combine (MCC) at Zheleznogorsk and in the control areas, upstream of the MCC. The investigations showed that Elodea biomass in the area affected by MCC operation contained a long inventory of artificial radionuclides typical of the MCC discharges. Upstream of the MCC, in the control sampling areas, the sediments and the Elodea biomass contained only one artificial radionuclide – 137 Cs. Thus, the exposure doses to Elodea shoots and roots upstream of the MCC are small (not more than 8 Gy/d) and the main contribution to them is made by natural radionuclides. At the MCC discharge site (the village of Atamanovo) and downstream of it, the total dose rate increases almost an order of magnitude, reaching its maximal values – 72 Gy/d for Elodea shoots and 58 Gy/d for roots. Cytogenetic investigations of Elodea roots showed that at the MCC discharge site (the village of Atamanovo) and downstream of it the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations in ana-telophase and metaphase cells of Elodea was considerably higher than in the control area. It is highly probable that this simultaneous dramatic increase in the total exposure rate and the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations in Elodea is associated with the <b>radiation</b> <b>factor.</b> It is suggested that Elodea is affected not only by the <b>radiation</b> <b>factor</b> but also by the chemical factor – toxicity of heavy metals. 1...|$|E
