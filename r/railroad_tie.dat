25|$|Ballastless track {{does not}} require {{underlying}} ballast to maintain its integrity. The first such tracks were used for mountain railways (such as the Pilatus Railway, built in 1889), with the rails being attached directly to the mountain rock. From the late 1960s onwards, German, British, Swiss and Japanese railways experimented with alternatives to the traditional <b>railroad</b> <b>tie,</b> {{in an effort to}} create track with greater accuracy and longevity, along with lower maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|The type of <b>railroad</b> <b>tie</b> {{used on the}} {{predecessors}} of {{the first}} true railway (Liverpool and Manchester Railway) consisted {{of a pair of}} stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses to tread the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found that it was hard to maintain the correct gauge. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on soft ground, such as at Chat Moss, where timber ties had to be used. Bi-block ties with a tie rod are somewhat similar.|$|E
500|$|The Cook County Coroner's Office took 70 day {{sessions}}, 20 night {{sessions and}} 450 witnesses examinations {{to collect evidence}} about the riots. Its report stated that on July 27, 1919, Eugene Williams, an African American youth, drifted towards an informally segregated beach on the South Side while holding onto a <b>railroad</b> <b>tie.</b> He was subsequently hit by a stone as a white man threw rocks at him and other African Americans to drive them away from their part of the 29th Street beach in the city's Douglas community on the South Side. A witness recalled seeing a single white male standing on a breakwater [...] from the raft of the African Americans and throwing rocks at them. Williams was struck in the forehead. He then panicked, lost {{his grip on the}} <b>railroad</b> <b>tie,</b> and drowned. The assailant ran toward 29th Street, where a different fight had already started when African Americans tried to use a section of the beach there, in defiance of its tacit segregation.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the logging}} {{operations}} provided an economic {{boost to the}} northwestern Smokies, the rapid deforestation of Little River's watershed proved devastating for the river's ecosystem. [...] With {{the formation of the}} Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934 and the end of logging operations in 1938, however, the forest quickly regrew. [...] The Civilian Conservation Corps converted Little River Railroad's railroad beds into roads and trails. [...] Today, other than the occasional stray skidder cable or <b>railroad</b> <b>tie,</b> there is little immediate evidence that logging ever took place in the area.|$|E
2500|$|In the meantime, Custer's 5th Michigan Cavalry used snipers to {{suppress}} Confederate rifle fire while several daring dismounted troopers crossed the damaged railroad bridge, hopping from <b>railroad</b> <b>tie</b> to tie while menaced by [...] persistent enemy artillery fire. Followed by the 6th Michigan, they succeeded {{in the early}} afternoon in clearing the north bank of the Chickahominy and gaining a foothold on the Confederate side of the river. Custer's men pinned down remaining threatening enemy units and captured two artillery pieces, while pioneers energetically planked the bridge to provide safe passage for large numbers of men and horses. By mid-afternoon, Merritt's entire division had crossed and engaged the Confederate hasty works on Richmond Heights, driving the defenders back to Gaines's Mill. By 4 p.m., the rest of Sheridan's cavalry had crossed the river.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{also worked}} for James J. Hill the legendary “ Empire Builder” of the Great Northern Railway. [...] Hill’s vision {{included}} the introduction of cattle into the Great Plains to replace the buffalo as a food source, fatten them in the West, and ship {{them back to the}} East. Hill began his cattle promotion with the ‘Great Fat Stock Show’, July 4, 1886 in Devil's Lake, then the far western terminus of the Great Northern Railway. [...] The Great Fat Stock Show was a gala midsummer fair of bronco-busting, horse races, Indian war dances and festivities. [...] Hill needed someone with banking experience to manage the show, and McCreight was “commandeered” to serve as “ticket seller, money counter and banker.” [...] The show was a success and Hill later invited McCreight to shovel the dirt to lay the first <b>railroad</b> <b>tie</b> to the Great Northern Railway transcontinental system from Devils Lake to Seattle, Washington.|$|E

2500|$|For the {{preservation}} of anthropological and biological specimens during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, objects were dipped in or were painted with a [...] "mercuric solution". This was done to prevent the specimens' destruction by moths, mites and mold. Objects in drawers were protected by scattering crystalline mercuric chloride over them. [...] It finds minor use in tanning, and wood was preserved by kyanizing (soaking in mercuric chloride). [...] Mercuric chloride {{was one of the}} three chemicals used for <b>railroad</b> <b>tie</b> wood treatment between 1830 and 1856 in Europe and the United States. [...] Limited railroad ties were treated in the United States until there were concerns over lumber shortages in the 1890s. [...] The process was generally abandoned because mercuric chloride was water-soluble and not effective for the long term, as well as poisonous. [...] Furthermore, alternative treatment processes, such as copper sulfate, zinc chloride, and ultimately creosote; were found to be less toxic. [...] Limited kyanizing was used for some railroad ties in the 1890s and early 1900s.|$|E

As far along the track as the Arch, each <b>railroad</b> <b>tie</b> (or sleeper) had for him a personality: the fat, white tie, which oozed at the end into an awkward knob, he had always hated because it resembled a flattened grub; a new tamarack tie with a sliver of fresh bark still on it, recently put in by the section gang, was an entertaining stranger; and he particularly introduced Gertie to his favorite, a wine-colored tie which always smiled.|$|E

2500|$|In recent years, wooden <b>railroad</b> <b>ties</b> {{have also}} become popular for {{gardening}} and landscaping, both in creating retaining walls and raised-bed gardens, and sometimes for building steps as well. Traditionally, the ties sold {{for this purpose}} are decommissioned ties taken from rail lines when replaced with new ties, and their lifespan is often limited due to rot. Some entrepreneurs sell new ties. Due {{to the presence of}} wood preservatives such as coal tar, creosote or salts of heavy metals, <b>railroad</b> <b>ties</b> introduce an extra element of soil pollution into gardens and are avoided by many property owners. [...] In the UK, new oak beams of the same size as standard <b>railroad</b> <b>ties,</b> but not treated with dangerous chemicals, are now available specifically for garden construction. They are about twice the price of the recycled product. In some places, <b>railroad</b> <b>ties</b> have been used in the construction of homes, particularly among those with lower incomes, especially near railroad tracks, including railroad employees.
