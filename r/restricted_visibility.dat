5|$|Twenty {{years after}} the Falklands {{conflict}} Bravo November saw service in Iraq, being the first British helicopter to land Royal Marines ashore. After departing from , Bravo November landed the first Royal Marines on to the Al-Faw peninsula to seize oil-pumping facilities before Iraqi troops could destroy them. The second DFC for actions at the controls of Bravo November was awarded to Squadron Leader Steve Carr {{for his role in}} an operation in Iraq. Bravo November was tasked with delivering the Marines to the landing sites marked by US special forces before returning for more troops, guns and freight. The aircraft was being flown at an altitude of less than 100ft with <b>restricted</b> <b>visibility</b> due to dust clouds thrown up by American armoured forces.|$|E
25|$|They {{found that}} dust and ashes inside {{compartment}} nine severely <b>restricted</b> <b>visibility.</b> As they gradually {{worked their way}} inside the compartment and down two levels, Warrant Officer Sergei Shmygin found the remains of Captain-lieutenant Dmitry Kolesnikov. All of the casualties had clearly been badly burned. The divers cut additional holes in the hull over {{the third and fourth}} compartments. The Russian divers removed secret documents and eventually recovered a total of 12 bodies from the ninth compartment. This contradicted earlier statements made by senior Russian officials that all of the submariners had died before the submarine hit the bottom. They also found the ship's log, but then had to suspend work because of severe winter weather. The rescue teams conducted ongoing measurements of radiation levels inside and outside the submarine but none of the readings exceeded normal ranges.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the number}} of open and ungated level {{crossings}} there are minor collisions, and these are reported in the local press. These have become more commonplace but are usually minor; warning signage to alert motorists that trams are operating has been erected at the start of each season in recent times, but incidents still occur. There are many occupation crossings, some with <b>restricted</b> <b>visibility</b> for motorists. The most recent incident took place on Monday, 27 July 2009, when a vehicle carrying a mechanical excavator came into contact with the overhead wires supplying power to both the line and the Snaefell Mountain Railway at a busy road crossing in Laxey; there were no injuries. Police and the line's electrical engineering crews attended the scene, the report also said. It did not indicate what damage had occurred. Service resumed the next day after temporary repairs to the overhead lines, which were permanently repaired over the subsequent couple of weeks. An investigation into the incident was scheduled to take place later.|$|E

500|$|Having {{opened up}} the route to Cádiz, la Peña {{instructed}} Graham to move his troops forward to Bermeja. [...] However, on Graham's strenuous objections to vacating a position {{that would result in}} both an exposed flank and rear, a force of five Spanish battalions and Browne's battalion was left to hold the Barrosa Ridge. [...] In addition, three Spanish and two King's German Legion (KGL) squadrons of cavalry, under the command of Colonel Samuel Whittingham, were sent to flank this rearguard force on the coast track. [...] Graham's division then moved north as ordered—instead of descending from the heights on the coast road, they followed a path through a pine wood {{to the west of the}} ridge. [...] This route was shorter and more practical for artillery, but the trees <b>restricted</b> <b>visibility</b> in all directions, meaning that they were effectively marching blind.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{stop signs}} may be placed only at sites with {{severely}} <b>restricted</b> <b>visibility,</b> and each must be individually {{approved by the}} Secretary of State for Transport. Section 79 of the Highways Act 1980 enables the government to improve visibility at junctions, as by removing or shortening walls or hedges, in preference to placing a stop sign. The former UK practice of using [...] "Halt" [...] or [...] "Slow" [...] at Major Road Ahead signs was discontinued in 1965 at {{the recommendation of the}} Worboys Committee. Instead of replacing all the old [...] "Halt" [...] signs with the new Vienna Convention [...] "Stop" [...] sign, [...] "Give Way" [...] became the standard sign at UK priority junctions. Most UK drivers would treat a stop sign as a give way sign despite the rules {{due to the fact that}} they are so sparse in the country.|$|E
2500|$|Feighnter was {{assigned}} as the Navy's project pilot for the Vought F7U Cutlass, a carrier-based jet fighter-bomber with swept wings and an unusual tailless design. From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability {{tests of the}} Cutlass on board the USS Midway. Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine. On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier [...] Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that <b>restricted</b> <b>visibility</b> forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the Landing Signal Officer (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly struck the ramp. Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did {{not live up to}} its potential and remained in service less than four years.|$|E

50|$|The gulled {{upper wing}} of the I-15 was unpopular with some pilots, as it was felt to <b>restrict</b> <b>visibility,</b> so Polikarpov's design bureau {{produced}} a revised version, again powered by the M-25, with a longer span un-gulled upper wing. This version, the I-15bis, commenced production in 1937, a total of 2,408 I-15bis' being delivered by the time production finished in 1940.|$|R
