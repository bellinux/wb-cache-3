5|$|The first West Saxon nunneries {{were founded}} in Ine's reign by Ine's kinswoman, Bugga, the {{daughter}} of King Centwine, and by Ine's sister Cuthburh, who founded the abbey of Wimborne at some point after she separated from her husband, King Aldfrith of Northumbria. At the bishop Aldhelm's suggestion in 705, Ine built the church which later became Wells Cathedral, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also records that Ine built a minster at Glastonbury. This must refer to additional building or <b>re-building</b> since there was already a British monastery at Glastonbury.|$|E
5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from <b>re-building</b> residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
25|$|The modern-day line shows {{a mix of}} {{its various}} <b>re-buildings.</b> The 1920 subway portion from the DeKalb Avenue {{connection}} to the Fourth Avenue subway is a typical New York City subway tunnel of the Dual Contracts era.|$|R
50|$|Elstead Mill, now a pub restaurant, was {{occupied}} by Oliver Cromwell’s ‘roundhead’ army during the English Civil War but subsequently burnt down. The present structure is described in its listing as being the result of several <b>re-buildings</b> from the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|The campanile, {{which dates}} from the 15th century, is most unusually {{positioned}} in {{the centre of the}} cathedral's west front. This has sometimes led to suppositions over whether the present church building occupies the same position as the original church or whether repeated <b>re-buildings</b> and restorations over time have had the effect of moving it.|$|R
5|$|In the arts, Romanticism {{manifested}} itself in literature and drama in {{the adoption of the}} mythical bard Ossian, the exploration of national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his <b>re-building</b> of Abbotsford House in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part of an attempt to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{the first}} Capcom-designed Vs. {{installment}} to be rendered fully in 3D. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and its graphical characteristics were optimized for the Wii, which prevents the game from being ported to other consoles without completely <b>re-building</b> the game. Niitsuma explained that its Wii exclusivity was also {{due to a lack}} of Capcom fighting games for the console, and because the Wii's casual quality matches the Vs. series trait of accessibility. The producer suggested that porting a sequel would be easier, but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making such plans. On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's senior vice president Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell Tatsunoko vs. Capcom physically or digitally.|$|E
5|$|Dwane Casey, an {{assistant}} coach with the Mavericks, was hired as the new head coach of Toronto before the 2011–12 season. The Raptors used their number five pick to select Jonas Valančiūnas, a centre from Lithuania in the 2011 NBA draft. The season was shortened by 16 regular season games due to the 2011 NBA lockout, and the Raptors finished {{the season with a}} 23–43 record. During the 2012 off-season, Colangelo tried to lure Canadian free agent and two-time MVP Steve Nash, who had become a free agent after playing for the Phoenix Suns, to play for the Raptors. When Nash joined the Los Angeles Lakers instead, the Raptors acquired point guard Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets for a future first round pick. Lowry, combined with Valančiūnas and the 8th pick in the 2012 draft Terrence Ross, represented the next phase of the <b>re-building</b> process. On January 30, 2013, the Raptors acquired Memphis Grizzlies star Rudy Gay and centre Hamed Haddadi as well as Pistons player Austin Daye in a three-way deal that sent Calderón to the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran Tayshaun Prince and a 2nd round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along with a second round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard Sebastian Telfair. The 2012–13 season was the first season since 2009–10 that the Raptors finished the season with a winning home record (21–20), despite their overall losing record (34–48).|$|E
50|$|A {{much larger}} pipe organ was {{installed}} in the church in 1911, replacing the earlier organ by R C Clifton. This new organ was built by the Adelaide builder J. E. Dodd. The organ has encountered many <b>re-buildings</b> over the years, but has been kept in remarkable condition. In 2004 the organ was fully rebuilt and now features {{a state of the}} art transmission system.|$|R

After the 1926 and 1934 redesigns and <b>re-buildings,</b> it was finally deemed completed by William Randolph Hearst in 1936.|$|R
50|$|However Greyfriars did {{not prove}} a {{successful}} town hall, and some {{twenty years later}} the council created a new town hall by inserting an upper floor into the refectory of the Hospitium of St John, the former hospitium of Reading Abbey. This was to remain the site of Reading's civic administration, through the successive <b>re-buildings</b> that eventually created today's Reading Town Hall, until the move to Reading Civic Centre in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|Tipu's {{successful}} {{attacks in}} 1790 on the Kingdom of Travancore, a British ally, was an effective victory for him, however {{it resulted in}} greater hostilities with the British {{which resulted in the}} Third Anglo-Mysore War. In the beginning, the British made gains, taking the Coimbatore district, but Tipu's counterattack reversed many of these gains. By 1792, with aid from the Marathas who attacked from the north-west and the Nizam who moved in from the north-east, the British under Lord Cornwallis successfully besieged Srirangapatna, resulting in Tipu's defeat and the Treaty of Srirangapatna. Half of Mysore was distributed among the allies, and two of his sons were held to ransom. A humiliated but indomitable Tipu went about <b>re-building</b> his economic and military power. He attempted to covertly win over support from Revolutionary France, the Amir of Afghanistan, the Ottoman Empire and Arabia. However, these attempts to involve the French soon became known to the British, who were at the time fighting the French in Egypt, were backed by the Marathas and the Nizam. In 1799, Tipu died defending Srirangapatna in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, heralding the end of the Kingdom's independence. Modern Indian historians consider Tipu Sultan an inveterate enemy of the British, an able administrator and an innovator.|$|E

25|$|The Manly lines, {{which were}} {{administered}} by the Railways, suffered from maladministration (as {{in the case of}} the Castle Hill line), resulting in considerable overcapitalisation of the network, unnecessary re-routing and <b>re-building</b> of the track at Manly terminus. Consequently, the system never made a profit. <b>Re-building</b> the terminal at Manly terminus several times, accompanied by costly property resumption, accounted for huge expenditures with little gain.|$|E
50|$|In 1585 however, every {{building}} except the main pagoda, {{and a few}} others, were burnt down during the Siege of Negoro-ji by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who feared the growing military power of the priesthood and the Negoro-gumi, warrior monks of the temple, who were skilled {{in the use of}} firearms. In 1623, the head of the Kii branch of the Tokugawa feudal clan, Tokugawa Yorinobu, initiated the reconstruction of the temple grounds, and through numerous <b>re-buildings</b> over many decades during the Edo period, the Negoro-ji was completely transformed.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the 16th century, civic {{administration}} {{for the town}} of Reading was situated in the Yield Hall, a [...] situated by the River Kennet near today's Yield Hall Lane. After a brief stay in what later became Greyfriars Church, the town council created a new town hall by inserting an upper floor into the refectory of the Hospitium of St John, the former hospitium of Reading Abbey. This was to remain the site of Reading's civic administration, through the successive <b>re-buildings</b> that eventually created today's Reading Town Hall, until the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|It was Bishop Gentile (end of the 12th {{century to}} the {{beginning}} of the 13th) who built the present presbytery and the crypt beneath. At the end of the 13th century Bishop Giovanni modified the structure of the Romanesque church by introducing Gothic elements. In 1393 the building was partially destroyed in a fire. Numerous <b>re-buildings</b> and extensions took place in the succeeding centuries, of which the most important were: the internal vaulting (late 15th century); the staircase to the tribune (second half of the 16th century); the new pavement and the side altars (17th century), as also the plastering of all the internal walls.|$|R

500|$|The {{shift in}} {{architectural}} focus reflected changing political alliances, as James V {{had formed a}} close alliance with France during his reign. He encountered the French version of Renaissance building while visiting for his marriage to Madeleine of Valois in 1536 and his second marriage to Mary of Guise may have resulted in longer term connections and influences. Work from his reign largely disregarded the insular style adopted in England under Henry VIII and adopted forms that were recognisably European, beginning with the extensive work at Linlithgow. This was followed by <b>re-buildings</b> at Holyrood, Falkland, Stirling and Edinburgh, described by Roger Maison as [...] "some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain".|$|R
5000|$|Fort Independence is {{a granite}} bastion fort that {{provided}} harbor defenses for Boston, Massachusetts. Located on Castle Island, Fort Independence {{is one of}} the oldest continuously fortified sites of English origin in the United States. [...] The first primitive fortification, called [...] "The Castle", was placed on the site in 1634 and, after two <b>re-buildings,</b> replaced circa 1692 with a more substantial structure known as Castle William. [...] Re-built after it was abandoned by the British during the American Revolution, Castle William was renamed Fort Adams and then Fort Independence. The existing granite fort was constructed between 1833 and 1851. Today it is preserved as a state park and fires occasional ceremonial salutes. Fort Independence was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.|$|R
500|$|James V {{encountered}} the French version of Renaissance building while visiting for {{his marriage to}} Madeleine of Valois in 1536 and his second marriage to Mary of Guise may have resulted in longer term connections and influences. Work from his reign largely disregarded the insular style adopted in England under Henry VIII and adopted forms that were recognisably European, beginning with the extensive work at Linlithgow, the first Scottish royal residence to {{be described as a}} palace. This was followed by <b>re-buildings</b> at Holyrood, Falkland, Stirling and Edinburgh, described as [...] "some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain". Rather than slavishly copying continental forms, most Scottish architecture incorporated elements of these styles into traditional local patterns, adapting them to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl). Work undertaken for James VI demonstrated continued Renaissance influences, with the Chapel Royal at Stirling having a classical entrance built in 1594 and the North Wing of Linlithgow, built in 1618, using classical pediments. Similar themes {{can be seen in the}} private houses of aristocrats, as in Mar's Wark, Stirling (c. 1570) and Crichton Castle, built for the Earl of Bothwell in the 1580s.|$|R
25|$|Rather {{than looking}} {{only at the}} {{construction}} cost, the whole of life cost (or life-cycle cost) should be considered, as the regular emptying or <b>re-building</b> of pit latrines may add a significant expense to the households in the longer term.|$|E

500|$|The {{origins of}} private estate houses in Scotland {{are in the}} {{extensive}} building and rebuilding of royal palaces that probably began under James III (r. 1460–88), accelerated under James IV (r. 1488–1513), and reached its peak under James V (r. 1512–42). These works {{have been seen as}} directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace of a palatium ad moden castri (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions. James V encountered the French version of Renaissance building while visiting for his marriage to Madeleine of Valois in 1536 and his second marriage to Mary of Guise may have resulted in longer term connections and influences.

50|$|Uusvada tsässon {{is a small}} one-storied unhewn pine {{cross-beam}} building, {{which has}} a square floor plan and a gable roof, the outer measurements are 308 x 409 cm; the building has one interior room (7.2 m2) and an external shelter (2.5 m2). The shelter has wane beam posts and a horizontal wide boarding fence. The {{main part of the}} building is covered by narrow horizontal boarding from the outside; from the inside the beams are uncovered. The beams are bound by axe-hewn corner tenon joints from the corners. The walls of the building stand on granite stones. The height of the building from the ground up to where the rafter and the wall unite is 188 cm and the height up to the ridge is 320 cm. There is a wooden decoration sawn round and tenoned vertically in {{the front end of the}} ridge raising-plate. There are no ceiling or floor beams.The building has a floor made of half-beams axe-hewn on the top. They support on the slots in the front wall. The width of the beams is different, 10 cm on average. The floor of the entrance-room is original and consists of the same half-beams axe-hewn on top. The building has one round ridge raising-plate remaining and rafters with hewn sides and profiled ends. During 2009 renovation, the tsässon got a new shingle roof and a forged cross that was on the ridge during the 1980s.The door of the building is probably original. The leaf of the door is made from four wide boards fixed on the crosspiece, sized 153 x 84 cm. The door opens on the inside and is fixed on the hewn supporting posts by forged hinges. The door is not painted. There is no handle on it, old forged staple and clamp have remained on the outside, but the building is not locked. A finely drawn orthodox cross on the outside of the door is especially noteworthy.Looking at the earlier photos, it is possible to fixate the time of the different <b>re-buildings</b> of the tsässon: A photo from the beginning of the 20th century shows that the exterior walls are without planks, there is a shingle-roof and the entrance-room is exposed. The walls on the 1974 photo have narrow planks on them; part of the entrance-room fence is also replaced by planks. There is a shingle-roof and a different cross than before. From the photo dating back to the 1980s, it can be seen that the shingle-roof had eternit installed on top of it and there is no cross. At the end of the 1980s, a different cross had been placed on the roof.|$|R
