25|$|In 1945 {{the steel}} plant was looted by soviet forces. The Republic of China {{government}} partially repaired the site {{but it was}} destroyed again during the Chinese civil war that saw the Communist forces victorious. The mills were once again repaired and Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) was founded in 1948. Form then to 2001, the company produced 290 million tons of steel, 284 million tons of pig iron and 192 million tons of <b>rolled</b> <b>steel.</b> Until relatively recently, when a new steel plant opened in Shanghai, Angang was the largest steel producer in China. Today, Angang consists of three steelworks with 13 rolling mills plus supporting plants which produce coke, refractory materials and machinery for the steel plants. The company has an annual production capacity of 10 million tons of pig iron, 10 million tons of steel and 9.5 million tons of <b>rolled</b> <b>steel.</b> A quarter of China's total iron ore reserves, about 10 billion tons, are located in Anshan ensuring that the city will remain an important steel producer well into the future.|$|E

25|$|Other {{iron and}} steel unions had also formed in the post-Civil War period, and in 1873 merger of the largest unions was proposed. The Associated Brotherhood of Iron and Steel Heaters, Rollers, and Roughers had formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1861. This craft union {{recruited}} the skilled workers who <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> in railroad track mills, but soon expanded its membership to rollers throughout the {{iron and steel}} industry. Another union, the Iron and Steel Roll Hands of the United States, formed in Chicago in 1870. This union attracted anyone whom the Associated Brotherhood would not permit as a member. The Roll Hands never achieved much membership growth, which led the union to propose merger {{as a way of}} combating employer resistance to unions.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{industry}} {{was attracted to}} the region by the ready availability of coal. In 1928 Hoskins, later Australian Iron & Steel, started a steelworks at Port Kembla, a few kilometres south of Wollongong. The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company (now BHP Billiton after merging with Billiton plc) acquired AI in 1935, but has since spun-out their steel division as a separate company, now known as BlueScope Steel. The steelworks has grown to become a world-class flat <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> producer, operating as a fully integrated steel plant with a production of around 5 million tonnes per year. Other industries to have {{set up in the}} massive Port Kembla industrial complex—the largest single concentration of heavy industry in Australia—include a fertiliser plant, an electrolytic copper smelter, a locomotive workshop, a coal export shipping terminal, a grain export shipping terminal and an industrial gases manufacturing plant.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these reforms, the {{distribution}} of goods used in industrial production was based on mandatory planning with fixed prices, guidance planning with floating prices, and the free market. Mandatory planning covered sixty industrial products, including coal, crude oil, <b>rolled</b> <b>steel,</b> nonferrous metals, timber, cement, electricity, basic industrial chemicals, chemical fertilizers, major machines and electrical equipment, chemical fibers, newsprint, cigarettes, and defense industry products. Once enterprises under mandatory planning had met the state's mandatory plans and supply contracts, they could sell surplus production to commercial departments or other enterprises. Prices of surplus industrial producer goods floated within limits set by the state. The state also had a planned distribution system for important materials such as coal, iron and steel, timber, and cement. Enterprise managers who chose to exceed planned production goals purchased additional materials on the market. Major cities established wholesale markets for industrial producer goods to supplement the state's allocation system.|$|E

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{products}} find extensive application in modern construction in both low-rise and high-rise steel buildings. In low-rise construction, primary {{as well as}} secondary framing members are fabricated using cold-formed steel sections, while in high-rise buildings; roof and floor decks, steel joists, wall panels, door/window frames, and sandwich panel partitions are successfully built using cold-formed steel sections. In cold <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction, fibre cement board is used as cladding material over steel sections on inside and outside, which creates a cavity wall action. Later on, glass wool and mineral wool insulation are also inserted in these walls making buildings more energy efficient in summer {{as well as in}} winter. In this paper, a comparison has been carried out between ordinary/conventional construction of a two roomed simple building and cold <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction for the same type of building. The comparison includes design, analysis, structural detailing, cost and management on site for execution of both types of systems. It was found that cold <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction has highest strength-to-weight ratio, easy to handle, quick and precise in manufacturing, fast in construction and dimensionally stable - does not expand or contract with moisture content. Also there is less probability of foundation problems due to less weight and less probability of damage due to earthquakes and heavy winds. Lighter structure with stronger connections results in less seismic forces. As cold <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction is new in Pakistan and most of the material is being imported, so its prices are on higher side but still approximately 40 %- 50 % less than conventional construction beside it’s all other benefits and energy efficiency behaviour...|$|R

500|$|The target {{selected}} for the first raid on Japan was the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, an industrial city about [...] from Chengdu. This was {{the single most important}} facility in Japan's steel industry as it produced 24 percent of the country's total output of <b>rolled</b> <b>steel.</b> The facility was dependent on three coke plants and the largest of these was selected as the designated aiming point for the B-29s. Nearby Laoyao harbor, which was an important industrial port, was designated as the raid's secondary target. The selection of Yawata's steel works as the first target to be attacked was in accordance with a decision made by the Twentieth Air Force on 1April 1944 which assigned the highest priority to attacking Japan's steel and coke industry. It was decided to conduct the raid at night with each B-29 bombing individually as the aircraft lacked the range needed to conduct a more fuel-intensive formation flight between the forward air bases and Yawata.|$|E

They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand. In the 1990s some material scientists concluded that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking.
