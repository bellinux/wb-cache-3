5000|$|Since the 15th century, {{the term}} nap {{generally}} {{refers to a}} special pile given to the cloth. [...] The term pile refers to <b>raised</b> <b>fibres</b> that are there on purpose, {{rather than as a}} by-product of producing the cloth. [...] In this case, the nap is woven into the cloth, often by weaving loops into the fabric, which can then be cut or left intact. Carpets, rugs, velvet, velour, and velveteen, are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a nap or pile.|$|E
50|$|In the {{finishing}} process of manufacturing textiles, after the cloth is woven, {{it goes through}} processes such as washing, fulling, raising the nap and trimming the nap. After the nap is trimmed, the fabric is considered finished. The raising process, which draws out {{the ends of the}} fibres, is done on both woollen and cotton fabric. Flannelette is a cotton fabric that goes through this process. There are ways to 'raise the nap', most of which involve wire brushes such as raising cards. Originally, dried teasel pods were used and were still preferred for use on woollen cloth for a long time. Woollen fabrics, which must be damp when raising the nap, are then dried and stretched before the nap is trimmed or sheared. Cotton cloth goes straight to the shearing process, where the nap gets trimmed to ensure that all the <b>raised</b> <b>fibres</b> are the same length.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with type}} 1 and 2 {{diabetes}} {{have a higher}} risk of cardiovascular disease compared to non-diabetic populations. Improved dietary quality is essential to control risk factors and can prevent or delay cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients. Higher dietary fibre intake was inversely associated with cardiovascular disease in several general population studies. However, in diabetes mellitus, and especially type 1 diabetes, little information is available. A literature study was performed to summarize the available evidence for a possible relationship between fibre consumption from natural foods and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 and type 1 diabetes. In November and December 2014, PubMed was searched for relevant articles. The full texts of 15 articles were reviewed. Prospective cohort studies reported an inverse association between dietary fibre intake and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality risk in both diabetes types. Randomized controlled trials were inconsistent. For type 2 diabetes, dietary fibre intake was related to lower plasma glucose and plasma lipid levels. In terms of foods, mainly legume and cereal fibre, vegetables and fruits were found to beneficially influence cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. For type 1 diabetes, no foods were investigated, but dietary fibre had some beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors from limited trials. To lower CVD risk in people with type 1 diabetes in the future, the potential of <b>raising</b> <b>fibre</b> in the diet should be further explored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Porcine {{congenital}} splayleg (PCS) is {{the most}} important congenital condition of piglets, associated with lameness and immobility, of unknown aetiology and pathogenesis, hence the need to better understand the condition by defining, in the first instance, its histopathology and molecular pathology. Results Semitendinosus, longissimus dorsi, and gastrocnemius muscles were removed from 4 sets of 2 -day-old splayleg piglets, each with a corresponding normal litter mate. Based on immunohistochemistry and histological image analysis, PCS piglets showed significantly smaller fibre size without any accompanying sign of inflammation. Although there was no dramatic change in fibre type composition in affected muscles, several structural myosin heavy chain genes were significantly down-regulated. MAFbx, a major atrophy marker, was highly up-regulated in nearly all PCS muscles, in comparison with controls from normal litter mates. In contrast, P 311, a novel 8 kDa protein, was relatively down-regulated in all the PCS muscles. To investigate a functional role of P 311 in skeletal muscle, its full-length cDNA was over-expressed in murine C 2 C 12 muscle cells, which resulted in enhanced cell proliferation with reduced myotube formation. Hence, reduced P 311 expression in PCS piglets might contribute to atrophy through reduced muscle cell proliferation. P 311, predictably, was down-regulated by the over-expression of calcineurin, a key signalling factor of muscle differentiation. Conclusion We demonstrated that PCS is a condition characterised by extensive <b>fibre</b> atrophy and <b>raised</b> <b>fibre</b> density, and propose that the combined differential expression of MAFbx and P 311 is of potential in the diagnosis of subclinical PCS. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to provide further {{information}} on how replacing wheat flour by whole quinoa flour (at 25 and 50 g/ 100 g of flour) affects bread performance and to assess its potential as a nutritious ingredient. Bread with quinoa resulted in a depreciation in quality in terms of loaf specific volume (from 4. 48 to 3. 46 / 2. 63 cm 3 /g), crumb firmness (from 0. 77 to 1. 55 / 2. 64 N) and acceptability (from 7. 94 to 7. 58 / 5. 94). Quinoa increased the bread nutritional value, <b>raising</b> <b>fibre</b> (from 5. 5 to 7. 2 g/ 100 g) and minerals (Ca from 0. 35 to 1. 28 mg/g, Fe from 17 to 34 ¿g/g, and Zn from 23 to 48 ¿g/g). The phytates were controlled by bifidobacterial phytase treatment during breadmaking (from 4. 7 ¿mol/g to below the detection limit), which decreased phytate/mineral molar ratios to values lower than the threshold for inhibition of Fe and Zn absorption. Quinoa could partially replace wheat flour in bread, increasing its nutritional value in terms of dietary fibre, minerals, proteins of high biological value and healthy fats, with only a small depreciation in bread quality at 25 g/ 100 g of flour substitution. The high phytate contents were efficiently removed by phytase treatment and the breads were accepted by consumers.

40|$|The {{strength}} of wet-spun poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva) fibres is given as function of bath-stretching, wet-stretching and hot-stretching. In the two equations derived for {{strength of}} wet-stretching and hot-stretching the complex {{influence of the}} bath-stretching and hot-stretching is demonstrated. The bath-stretching is connected with a pure orientation effect and the residence time in the coagulating bath which is a measure for the ‘freshness’ of the fibre. The hot-stretching can be separated in a pure orientation effect and a crystallization effect. Fibres of the pva, used in the experiments, were soluble in boiling water.

5000|$|In {{the history}} of textiles, frieze (French: frisé) is a Middle English term for a coarse woollen, plain weave cloth with a nap on one side. The nap was raised by {{scrubbing}} it to <b>raise</b> curls of <b>fibre,</b> and was not shorn after being raised, leaving an uneven surface. Panni frisi, [...] "Frisian cloths", appear in medieval inventories and other documents. Frieze was woven in the English Midlands and Wales, and in Ireland from the fourteenth century, and later in Holland as well. A similar textile is baize. In Old Norse, such cloth was called vaðmál (wadmal), and lengths of wadmal were a medium of exchange, especially for the poor who had neither cattle nor silver.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityTanning {{is defined}} as a process of skin {{treatment}} whereby the hot water shrinkage point of the skin is <b>raised,</b> the <b>fibres</b> of the skin substance are prevented from mutually adhering on drying, and the skin substance is protected from putrefaction under ordinary conditions in air. There are various kinds of tanning processes such as vegetable tanning, chrome tanning, formaldehyde tanning, oil tanning and synthetic tanning. In vegetable tanning the materials used for the actual preservation process are obtained from the bark or wood or other parts of various trees or plants. Vegetable tannins may be conveniently divided into three groups. The first of these is the class of depsides or gallotannins which are hydrolysable and yield gallic acid. The second group consists of hydrolysable tannins which yield ellagic acid. The third group consists of non-hydrolysable tannins called phlobatannins. The latter yield red-colored insoluble products called "phlobaphenes" on boiling with acid. Catechin tannin is a phlobatannin and the structure of catechin is known, but not the structure of its tannin. The structure of no phlobatannin is known at present. Many have speculated as to their general structure on very slim evidence and some tannins have been synthesized which appear qualitatively similar to phlobatannins, but no real proof of structure has been forthcoming.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of replacing wheat flour by whole. Amaranthus cruentus flour (up to 40 g/ 100 g) to evaluate its potential utility as a nutritious breadmaking ingredient. The incorporation of amaranth flour significantly increased protein, lipid, ash, dietary fibre and mineral contents. Breads with amaranth have significantly higher amounts of phytates and lower. myo-inositol phosphates, which could predict low mineral bioavailability at high levels of substitution (30 - 40 g/ 100 g). An increase in crumb hardness and elasticity was observed, and tristimulus colour values were significantly affected when the amaranth concentration was raised. Mineral contents, both micro- and macroelements, were increased significantly by the wheat flour substitution. Whole amaranth flour {{could be used as}} a partial replacement for wheat flour in bread formulations, increasing the product's nutritional value and <b>raising</b> dietary <b>fibre,</b> mineral and protein levels, with a significant slight depreciation in bread quality when used in proportions between 10 and 20 g/ 100 g. Thus, the inclusion of amaranth flour could be limited to a maximum proportion of 20 g/ 100 g, thereby maintaining both product quality as well as the nutritional benefit of this ingredient.

Specific properties are examined using field and laboratory experiments against reference species; iroko (Milicia excelsa), African mahogany (Khaya ivorensis), teak (Tectona grandis) and European oak (Quercus robur). The effectiveness of decking and teak oil coatings at reducing weathering defects is described. With weathering colours of all species changed over the six month exposure period though the greatest rate of change is seen in iroko and oak. There {{is an increase in}} lightness (L* value) and greying (a* and b* values). Oil treatments delay the rate of colour change but do not prevent it. Oil treatments reduce checking during weathering which is worse in oak, esa and denya. Analysis of samples during outdoor exposure using FTIR show a loss in lignin at the surface, with the absorbance peak at (1505 cm) - 1 absent following 1 month for untreated samples and two months for oiled samples. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that teak and deck oil formed thin films on the surfaces of wood but do not coat vessel lumens. Following six months exposure a number of defects were apparent, including <b>raised</b> wood <b>fibres,</b> fungal colonisation and cell wall and pit checking. Defects are observed in coated and uncoated wood. Natural durability using the method described in BS EN 350 - 1 show denya to be very durable, dahoma moderately durable and esa not durable.

40|$|When {{describing}} the sclerophyllous nature of leaves, two indices are most commonly cited: fibre:protein ratio (FPR), {{better known as}} the Loveless sclerophylly index; and leaf mass per unit area (LMA), or its inverse, specific leaf area (SLA). Here, we assess the relative importance of these two indices in accounting for changes in leaf structure, the primary basis for variations in sclerophylly. FPR compares structural (i. e., lignin and cellulose [crude fibre]) to non-structural (i. e., protein = protoplasm) leaf material, on the basis that increasing sclerophylly is associated with a greater contribution of crude fibre and smaller contribution of protein to total dry weight. However, <b>raising</b> the crude <b>fibre</b> content is just one way of increasing sclerophylly, and a decrease in the nitrogen content (i. e., protein) does not contribute directly to the impression of leaf hardness. While FPR lacks a clear anatomical basis, it may provide a biochemical interpretation of sclerophylly. In contrast, LMA is the cross product of leaf thickness and leaf density, two (often independent) attributes that are linked to different components of a leaf’s anatomical/structural attributes. We show that FPR and LMA are often poorly correlated and conclude that LMA is a more useful measure of sclerophylly, especially when thickness and density are known...|$|R
40|$|Twenty four {{patients}} with pure motor neuropathy are reported. The chronic motor involvement associated with fasciculations and cramps, {{mainly in the}} arms, led, in most patients, to an initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease. In some patients (nine of 24), there was no appreciable muscle atrophy. Tendon reflexes were often absent or weak. The finding of persistent multifocal conduction block confined to motor nerve <b>fibres</b> <b>raises</b> questions {{about the nature and}} the importance of this syndrome. Segmental reduction of motor conduction velocity occurred {{at the site of the}} block, but significant slowing of motor nerve conduction was not found outside this site. The response to intravenous IVIg treatment seems to be correlated with the absence of amyotrophy. Patients with little or no amyotrophy had an initial and sustained response to IVIg, and did not develop amyotrophy during the follow up study. They could be considered to have a variant of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Patients with pronounced amyotrophy independent of the disease duration did not respond as well to IVIg treatment, suggesting the existence of a distinct entity. Among the patients treated about two thirds who had an initial good response to IVIg had high or significant antiganglioside GM 1 (anti-GM 1) antibody titres, but there was no correlation between the high titres before treatment and long lasting response to IVIg treatment...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Dyeing has an {{influence}} on the characteristic properties of wool fibres. This can result in changes in the final properties of the fibre including fibre elasticity, fibre strength and breaking elongation of the wool fibres, {{especially in the case of}} dark colours. Damage that occurs to the fibre surface due to the action of acid, alkali, dyestuff, water, heat, and mechanical stress during the dyeing process can thus have an affect on the fibre breaking elongation and the fibre strength. The aim of this project was to assess the effect of dyeing with different colours (ranging from light to dark) on the surface of wool fibres using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicated that four different types of surface damage can be discerned: scale raising, scale chipping, fluting and pitting. The findings also indicate that the surface damage to the fibres was greater and more noticeable (especially the scale <b>raising)</b> on <b>fibres</b> dyed with dark colours than to fibres dyed with light colours. The same applied to the fibre strength and elongation, where generally the fibre breaking extension and the breaking load was smaller in the case of darker colours. The effect of dyeing with different colour shades on the fibre surface was observed with AFM. Several characteristic scale parameters of a statistical significant number of dyed and undyed fibres were measured in order to determine the surface damage caused by dyeing. The correlation between the surface damage, observed by AFM, and the loss in tensile strength and fibre elongation, determined by tensile tests, were investigated. This was done in order to determine the effect of the cuticle damage on the tensile stress/strain behaviour. The results show that AFM is a viable tool to study the effects of different dyes on the fibre surface and for detecting surface modifications with great accuracy. It was found that dyeing with dark colours caused greater damage to the surface than light colours, and it was possible to distinguish different lightness areas, which could be regarded as light and dark colours...|$|R

The birds were randomly allotted to 6 experimental diets tagged T 10, T 10 100, T 10 200, T 15, T 15 100 and T 15 200 which were compounded to be isonitrogenous (23 % crude protein) and isocaloric (2900 Kcal/Kg ME). Treatments T 10, T 10 100 and T 10 200 contained 10 % crude fibre (low fibre level) while treatments T 15, T 15 100 and T 15 200 contained 15 % crude fibre level (high fibre level). The enzyme was included at 0, 100 and 200 ppm thus, treatments T 10 and T 15 contained 0 ppm, T 10 100 and T 15 100 contained 100 ppm and T 10 200 and T 15 200 contained 200 ppm of the enzyme such that treatments T 10 and T 15 served as the control for treatments T 10 100 and T 10 200 and T 15 100 and T 15 200 for low and high fibre diets, respectively. The birds were randomly allocated to the treatments {{at the rate of}} 80 birds per diet; each treatment was replicated 4 times in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement. At the end of the 3 weeks feeding trial, 10 female birds per treatment were randomly selected according to average group weight, slaughtered and their carcasses evaluated. All the parameters evaluated were not at variance (P> 0. 05) across the dietary treatment groups except for back (22. 52 vs. 24. 32 and 21. 62 %), neck (7. 78 vs. 10. 24 and 7. 49 %) and gastrointestinal tract (8. 44 vs. 10. 84 and 12. 22 %) which was significantly (P< 0. 05) heavier in percent weight due to enzyme supplementation. <b>Raising</b> dietary <b>fibre</b> from low to high level significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the percent weight of fasted weight (144. 20 and 124. 70 g/bird), dressed weight (87. 52 and 83. 79 g/bird), back (24. 80 and 20. 84 %), neck (9. 41 and 7. 59 %) and liver (3. 06 and 2. 92 %) but increased that of legs (2. 54 and 2. 92 %) and heart (0. 69 and 0. 82 %) while the interactive effects of enzyme and dietary fibre affected the percent weights of legs, drumstick, back, neck, heart and liver.
