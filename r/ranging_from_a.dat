5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{began with}} an army of 13,000 men; 1,500 were {{reported}} missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To speed up the retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium; the number who died remains disputed, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> low of 30 {{to a high of}} 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.|$|E
5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|Coin-operated {{machines}} to vend food, for amusement, and for gambling became {{popular in the}} 1890s. Such machines could be placed on otherwise unused floor space in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners.

The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing machines <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mechanically played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some {{machines to}}ok cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin of choice for these machines.|$|E

5|$|Differences {{occur in}} pelage colouration, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pale white (as in the Arabian oryx) to black (as {{in the black}} wildebeest). However, only the {{intermediate}} shades, such as brown and reddish brown (as in the reedbuck), are commonly observed. In several species, females and juveniles exhibit a light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age. As in the wildebeest, the coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes. In some species such as the addax, the coat colour can vary by the season. Scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E

5|$|Some temples kept sacred animals, {{which were}} {{believed}} to be manifestations of the temple god's ba {{in the same way that}} cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the Apis bull, worshipped at Memphis as a manifestation of the Memphite god Ptah, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.|$|E
