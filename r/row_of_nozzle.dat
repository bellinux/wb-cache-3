The method calculates the gradient of an objective function w. r. t. the design variables of the aerodynamic shape. The formulation of the adjoint equations is introduced within a generic time-dependent optimal design problem.

5000|$|Except for {{low-power}} applications, {{turbine blades}} {{are arranged in}} multiple stages in series, called compounding, which greatly improves efficiency at low speeds. A reaction stage is a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>nozzles</b> followed by a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>nozzles.</b> Multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops, resulting in a pressure-compounded turbine. Impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded, velocity-compounded, or pressure-velocity compounded. A pressure-compounded impulse stage is a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>nozzles</b> followed by a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> moving blades, with multiple stages for compounding. This {{is also known as}} a Rateau turbine, after its inventor. A velocity-compounded impulse stage (invented by Curtis and also called a [...] "Curtis wheel") is a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>nozzles</b> followed by two or more <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> moving blades alternating with <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> fixed blades. This divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops. A series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a pressure-velocity compounded turbine.|$|R

Energy requirements for this technique are {{an order of}} magnitude less than those to operate a thermo-kinetic system. An important side benefit is the considerable emergency fire extinguishing capability it provides along the runway. Tests conducted to provide drop spectra measurements and temperature response measurements of suitable water sprays are described. Three mobile firefighting modules capable of spraying up to 630 l/s (10, 000 gpm) to a height in excess of 50 m were utilized.

The nozzle patterns included single and multiple orifices, single <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and duplicates <b>of</b> the RAM C-III nozzles. The flat-plate tests were made at Mach 8. Total pressure was varied from 3. 45 MN/m 2 to 10. 34 MN/m 2, Reynolds number was varied form 9, 840, 000 per meter to 19, 700, 000 per meter, and liquid injection pressure was varied from 0. 69 MN/m 2 to 3. 5 MN/m 2. The hemisphere-cone tests were made at Mach 7. 3. Total pressure was varied from 1. 38 MN/m 2, to 6. 89 MN/m 2, Reynolds number was varied from 3, 540, 000 per meter to 17, 700, 000 per meter, and liquid-injection pressure was varied from 0. 34 MN/m 2 to 4. 14 MN/m 2. Photographs of the tests and plots of liquid-penetration and spray cross-section area are presented. Maximum penetration was found to vary as the square root of the dynamic-pressure ratio and the square root of the total injection nozzle area.

5000|$|A splash {{fountain}} or bathing fountain {{is intended}} {{for people to come}} in and cool off on hot summer days. These fountains are also referred to as interactive fountains. These fountains are designed to allow easy access, and feature nonslip surfaces, and have no standing water, to eliminate possible drowning hazards, so that no lifeguards or supervision is required. These splash pads are often located in public pools, public parks, or public playgrounds (known as [...] "spraygrounds"). In some splash fountains, such as Dundas Square in Toronto, Canada, the water is heated by solar energy captured by the special dark-colored granite slabs. The fountain at Dundas Square features 600 ground nozzles arranged in groups <b>of</b> 30 (3 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> 10 <b>nozzles).</b> Each group <b>of</b> 30 <b>nozzles</b> is located beneath a stainless steel grille.

40|$|Drying, curing, baking are {{few of the}} {{manufacturing}} processes that {{require the use of}} impingement ovens. For {{the manufacturing}} of large batches typically continuous flow ovens are used that are part of an automated conveyor processing line. The retention time for a product to be treated in the oven usually drives the production efficiencies (i. e. energy usage or lead times). In many processing lines though, the ovens are not designed and run in the most efficient way, and as a result become the “bottleneck” process phase. In such ovens, usually the hot air is ejected from <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>nozzles</b> perpendicularly to the moving product. In the most advanced designs the ovens are divided in zones, with each zone having different targeted operating temperature. The optimization of the manufacturing process is difficult to be experimentally determined due to several reasons: the length of the ovens and the complexity of the movement of the product {{in and out of the}} oven are the most challenging ones. The main objective of this paper thus is the development of a Computer Fluid Dynamics model for simulating the thermal - transfer efficiency of an existing hot-air convection oven used to produce continuous products. The model is used for the estimation of the maximum speed that the conveyor belt can be run, and further investigate possible improvements on the design of the oven for the reduction of the cycle time. The results can be useful during the overview of the actual production and manufacturing rules...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate different nozzles and spray rates on drop deposition in corn (Zea mays), Euphorbia heterophylla and Brachiaria plantaginea, both weeds located at and between crop rows. The experimental design established was complete random blocks with treatments arranged at 2 x 2 factorial scheme (2 nozzles types: DG 11002 VS flat flan and medium droplets, TXVK 08 cone and very fine droplets; and 2 rates: 100 and 200 L ha(- 1)) with four replications. The spray applications occurred at 13 days after corn germination (3 - 5 expanded leaves), when E. heterophylla and B. plantaginea plants had 2 - 4 and 2 - 3 leaves, respectively. Solution of Brilliant Blue (FD&C- 1) dye at 3, 000 ppm was used as spray tracer. It was concluded that the greatest average deposits in corn plants was provided by TXVK 08, independently of the spray rates used. The most uniform deposits occurred when the spray rates of 200 L ha(- 1) was used. Spray deposits were most uniform in B. plantaginea compared to E. heterophylla when both weds were located at crop <b>row,</b> independently <b>of</b> <b>nozzle</b> or spray rates.

5000|$|In a more {{sophisticated}} performance model, the cooling air for the first <b>row</b> <b>of</b> (static) turbine <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes (immediately downstream of the combustor) can be safely disregarded, since for a given (HP) rotor inlet temperature it has no effect upon either the combustor fuel flow or the net thrust of the engine. However, the turbine rotor cooling air must be included in such a model. The rotor cooling bleed air is extracted from compressor delivery and passes along narrow passageways before being injected into {{the base of the}} rotating blades. The bleed air negotiates a complex set of passageways within the aerofoil extracting heat before being dumped into the gas stream adjacent to the blade surface. In a sophisticated model, the turbine rotor cooling air is assumed to quench the main gas stream emerging from turbine, reducing its temperature, but also increasing its mass flow: ...|$|R

The research {{is focused on the}} influence of cleaning pressure, the diameter <b>of</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and the ratio of sectional area <b>of</b> <b>nozzles</b> to that <b>of</b> pulse jet pipe on pulse cleaning performance. The results show that the difference <b>of</b> pulse jet <b>nozzles</b> performance increases when cleaning pressure increases. The main reason leading to the difference of pulse cleaning is that the increasing rate of static pressure along cleaning direction is slow after the first large increase. The diameter <b>of</b> pulse jet <b>nozzles</b> has a significance affect on cleaning performance so that the uneven performance can be improved by decreasing the diameter <b>of</b> <b>nozzle</b> along the cleaning direction ladder likely.

50|$|In nozzle {{governing}} the flow rate of steam is regulated by opening and shutting <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>nozzles</b> rather than regulating its pressure.

The actuation of individual valve closes the corresponding set <b>of</b> <b>nozzle</b> thereby controlling the flow rate. In actual turbine, nozzle governing is applied only to the first stage whereas the subsequent stages remain unaffected. Since no regulation to the pressure is applied, the advantage of this method lies in the exploitation of full boiler pressure and temperature.
