40|$|This paper {{examines}} economic <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for China’s Korean {{minority in}} the urban labour market using ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares. The OLS estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> are similar <b>to</b> findings from recent studies for the Chinese urban labour market. We use father’s education, mother’s education and spouse’s education to instrument for education. The two-stage least squares estimates are considerably higher than the OLS estimates for <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> and slightly higher than existing two-stage least squares estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the Chinese urban labour market. The two stage least squares estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the Korean minority living in urban areas are high compared with the Asian average and world average. The economic <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> reported in this study assists to explain why private demand for education among the Korean minority in China is strong and provides a justification for the Korean minority’s focus on educational attainment. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> is {{a fundamental}} parameter of interest in many different areas of economics and public policy.

The objective of this study was <b>to</b> estimate the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> as a random coefficient and obtain accurate and reliable estimates that will be useful for policy recommendations. The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method was used to estimate the parameters of a random coefficient model using data from a 2007 / 2008 Ghanaian twins’ survey.

This dissertation {{examines the}} decision by adults <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> after they have {{spent some time in}} the workforce. Studies of higher education enrollment have long focused on the enrollment behavior of students who enter college immediately following high school graduation.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{the first set}} of estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> over an extended period in Russia and Ukraine (1985 - 2002). There has been an increase in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in both countries but the increase is much bigger in Russia than in Ukraine. The intriguing question is why <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in Russia and Ukraine diverged so much over the transition period while the skill composition of employment did not. Our approach in analyzing the sources of cross-country differences in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> is <b>to</b> compare the Mincerian earnings functions between the two countries and then to employ decomposition techniques. Using semiparametric methods, we construct counterfactual wage distributions for university and secondary school graduates for Ukraine using the distributions of Russian characteristics, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> characteristics, and unobservables. This allows us to decompose differences in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> between the two countries due to differences in the labor market returns (price effect), differences in unobservables (residual effect), and differences in the labor force composition (composition effect). We conclude that of these three effects the price effect makes a major contribution to the observed differences in the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{a structural}} dynamic programming model of schooling decisions and obtain individual specific {{estimates of the}} local (and average) <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> {{as well as the}} <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. Homogeneity of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> human capital is strongly rejected in favor of a discrete distribution version of the random coefficient specification. The results indicate that individuals who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> are also those who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. There is a 5. 9 percentage points difference in the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> at college graduation between high and low market ability individuals (2. 3 % vs 8. 2 %) and a 5. 4 percentage points difference in the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience upon entrance in the labor market (3. 1 % vs 8. 5 %). When averaged over all types, the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience in the early phase of the life cycle (6. 8 %) exceeds the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> (6. 4 % at college graduation). After conditioning on a specific type, the log wage regression function remains rather convex in schooling.

This marriage was unusual, since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history, and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to estimate and compare the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> investments in education for men belonging to different parts of the ability distribution. Our ability measure is the achievement test score from the Swedish Military Enlistment Battery.

We find that a higher score on the Swedish Enlistment test is associated with a higher <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling.</b> The relationship between the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> and the test score does however seem to be decreasing in the test score. Thus, it it primarily the ability specific <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the lower test groups that divert from the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling.</b> In general, the measurement errors in the test score do not seem to bring about any major biases in the ability specific <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling.</b> ...|$|R

The senior team was captained by Bill O'Reilly, a leg spin bowler who represented Australia in Tests and was regarded as the best bowler in the world. O'Reilly was a firm man and came to be a father figure for Lindwall. Lindwall came into the team seeing himself as an into-the-wind swing bowler. O'Reilly felt that pace bowlers were only useful for a few overs with new ball, so he instructed Lindwall to lengthen his run-up and bowl as fast as possible. O’Reilly also decided that the team needed more bowlers. He placed Lindwall low in the batting order, where he often did not get an opportunity to bat. Lindwall did not bother protesting, realising that dissent against the autocratic O’Reilly would be futile. O'Reilly also reversed Morris from a bowler into a batsman. Both Morris and Lindwall became world-leading players in the fields that O’Reilly chose for them. By the end of the 1938–39 season, Lindwall had not yet established himself as a cricketer. Former Test batsman Charlie Macartney lamented what he perceived as a lack of talent and substance at St. George.
