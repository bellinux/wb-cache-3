5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> {{of workers}} is {{associated}} with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (soil surface temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the physiological stress put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E
25|$|A {{character}} can be positioned {{in one of}} three stances: standing, crouching, or prone; each affecting the character's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> accuracy, and stealth.

When the character has taken damage, the edges of the screen glow red and the character's heartbeat increases. If the character stays out of fire, the {{character can}} recover. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, a marker indicates the direction of the grenade, helping the player in deciding whether to flee or throw it back at the enemy.|$|E

25|$|The first {{electronic}} autonomous robots {{with complex}} behaviour {{were created by}} William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between {{a small number of}} brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.|$|E
500|$|Frogs in the {{families}} Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and Microhylidae have short back legs {{and tend to}} walk rather than jump. When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) {{has been described as}} having a gait that is [...] "a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length". In an experiment, Fowler's toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.|$|E
500|$|Hawaiian volcanoes drift {{northwest}} {{from the}} hotspot {{at a rate}} of about [...] a year. The hotspot has migrated south by about [...] relative to the Emperor chain. Paleomagnetic studies support this conclusion based on changes in Earth's magnetic field, a picture of which was engrained in the rocks at the time of their solidification, showing that these seamounts formed at higher latitudes than present-day Hawaii. Prior to the bend, the hotspot migrated an estimated [...] per year; the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> changed at the time of the bend to about [...] per year. The Ocean Drilling Program provided most of the current knowledge about the drift. The 2001 expedition drilled six seamounts and tested the samples to determine their original latitude, and thus the characteristics and speed of the hotspot's drift pattern in total.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{the present}} study was {{assessment}} of laterality of the legs of young female soccer players and their non-training counterparts. Methods. The study sample comprised 9 female soccer players and 19 non-training girls. They underwent three measurement sessions, one every six months. The applied tests included kinesthetic differentiation, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> local <b>movements,</b> static balance, single-leg hop, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> global <b>movements,</b> strength and speed, and functional asymmetry of the legs tests. Results. The soccer players were better than the controls in their performance <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> local <b>movements,</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> global <b>movements,</b> kinesthetic differentiation, single-leg 15 m timed hop and static balance tests. Smaller differences between the results of the left and the right legs in soccer players, than in non-training girls, were noted in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> local <b>movements,</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> global <b>movements</b> and kinesthetic differentiation tests. In the static balance test, the differences were greater in the group of soccer players. Conclusions. Lateralization of the lower limbs is a highly complex characteristic with a different variability in athletes than in nontraining individuals. The results {{of the present study}} also point to the specialization of soccer players’ left legs in body balance and single-leg hop tests...|$|R
500|$|As {{opposed to}} earlier {{games in the}} Call of Duty series, the game {{features}} modern equipment and new features, many exclusive to the multiplayer part of the game, such as [...] "killstreaks"; killing a number of enemies without the player dying in between kills allows access to various assets including airstrikes and helicopter support. A character can be positioned {{in one of three}} stances: standing, crouching, or prone, each affecting the character's <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> accuracy, and stealth. Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage. As such, there are no armor or health power ups.

500|$|A month {{prior to}} the 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens, Voight was contacted by Rocky Crandell, a United States Geological Survey (USGS) employee working in the Vancouver office near the mountain. Crandell sought Voight's expertise in landslides, hoping Voight would opine on a growing bulge, [...] long, which had emerged on the mountain's north face. In his reporting to Crandell and his associates, Voight said that the bulge could fail and collapse the volcano's entire north sector. He suggested they begin monitoring the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> of the bulge, worried that the collapse could trigger an eruption. He also advised hiring a local surveyor to take measurements, offending several of the geologists. Shortly after, Voight left the mountain and returned to teaching classes at Penn State. Before the eruption, he had sent his full report to the USGS, summarizing his predictions, depicting {{the failure of the}} bulge and the collapse of the mountain's north side followed by a violent eruption. After a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope caused that part of the volcano to slide, Mount St. Helens erupted, causing $1.1 billion in damage and killing 57 people.|$|E

40|$|Single actin {{filaments}} stabilized with fluorescent phalloidin exhibit ATP-dependent {{movement on}} myosin filaments fixed to a surface.

2500|$|Black Ops is a first-person shooter, {{retaining}} the same gameplay mechanics as previous Call of Duty titles. The player assumes {{the role of}} a foot soldier who can wield various firearms (only two of which can be carried at once), throw grenades and other explosives, and use other equipment as weapons. A player close enough to an enemy can kill with one knife blow. A character can take three stances: standing, crouching or prone. Each affects <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> accuracy, and stealth. The player can drop to the prone stance from the standing stance while running (colloquially known as [...] "dolphin diving"), and can momentarily sprint before having to stop. The screen glows red to indicate damage to a player's health, which regenerates over time. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, an on-screen marker indicates where it is in relation to the player, helping the player to move away or to throw it back. Among the weapons new to the series in Black Ops are crossbows with bolts and explosive ammunition, Dragon's Breath rounds and ballistic knives.|$|E
2500|$|While most {{earthquakes}} {{are caused}} by movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Four main activities contribute to this phenomenon: storing large amounts of water behind a dam (and possibly building an extremely heavy building), drilling and injecting liquid into wells, and by coal mining and oil drilling. Perhaps the best known example is the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China's Sichuan Province in May; this tremor resulted in 69,227 fatalities and is the 19th deadliest earthquake of all time. The Zipingpu Dam {{is believed to have}} fluctuated the pressure of the fault [...] away; this pressure probably increased the power of the earthquake and accelerated the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> for the fault. The greatest earthquake in Australia's history is also claimed to be induced by humanity, through coal mining. The city of Newcastle was built over a large sector of coal mining areas. The earthquake has been reported to be spawned from a fault that reactivated due to the millions of tonnes of rock removed in the mining process.|$|E

[...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier {{than it used to}} be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today {{than they were in the}} last war."
