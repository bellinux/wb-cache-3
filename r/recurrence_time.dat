40|$|The {{outbursts of}} black hole X-ray {{transients}} {{can be understood}} as caused by a limit cycle instability in the accretion disk, similar to dwarf nova outbursts. For adequately low mass overflow rates from the companion star long outburst <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> are expected. But the fact that we find predominantly long <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> or that only one X-ray nova outburst was detected at all poses a problem. The question arises whether any braking mechanism could act in a way that long <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> are favored. We suggest that a circumbinary disk exists and brakes the orbital motion of the binary stars by tidal interaction. The irradiation during an outburst leads to mass loss by winds from the circumbinary disk, releaving the braking force until the removed matter is refilled by diffusion from outer parts. We show that this reduction of braking will self-adjust the mass transfer to the marginal rate that gives long <b>recurrence</b> <b>times.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures; in: Conference Proceedings "Evolution of Binary and Multiple Star Systems", Bormio 2000, ASP Conference Series, Vol. 229, 2001, in pres...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Observing {{how long}} a {{dynamical}} system takes to return to some state {{is one of the}} most simple ways to model and quantify its dynamics from data series. This work proposes two formulas to estimate the KS entropy and a lower bound of it, a sort of Shannon’s entropy per unit of <b>time,</b> from the <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> of chaotic systems. One formula provides the KS entropy and is more theoretically oriented since one has to measure also the low probable very long returns. The other provides a lower bound for the KS entropy and is more experimentally oriented since one has to measure only the high probable short returns. These formulas are a consequence of the fact that the series of returns do contain the same information of the trajectory that generated it. That suggests that <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> might be valuable when making models of complex systems. <b>Recurrence</b> <b>times</b> measure the time interval a system takes to return to a neighborhood of some state, being that it was previously in some other state. Among the many ways <b>time</b> <b>recurrences</b> can be defined, two approaches that have recently attracted much attention are the first Poincaré <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> (FPRs) [1] and the recurrence plots (RPs) [2].

50|$|The Poincaré {{recurrence}} theorem {{considers a}} theoretical microscopic description of an isolated physical system. This {{may be considered}} as a model of a thermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation has removed an internal wall. The system will, after a sufficiently long time, return to a microscopically defined state very close to the initial one. The Poincaré <b>recurrence</b> <b>time</b> is the length of time elapsed until the return. It is exceedingly long, likely longer than the life of the universe, and depends sensitively on the geometry of the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation. The recurrence theorem may be perceived as apparently contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. More obviously, however, it is simply a microscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system formed by removal of a wall between two systems. For a typical thermodynamical system, the <b>recurrence</b> <b>time</b> is so large (many many times longer than the lifetime of the universe) that, for all practical purposes, one cannot observe the recurrence. One might wish, nevertheless, to imagine that one could wait for the Poincaré recurrence, and then re-insert the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation. It is then evident that the appearance of irreversibility is due to the utter unpredictability of the Poincaré recurrence given only that the initial state was one of thermodynamic equilibrium, {{as is the case in}} macroscopic thermodynamics. Even if one could wait for it, one has no practical possibility of picking the right instant at which to re-insert the wall. The Poincaré recurrence theorem provides a solution to Loschmidt's paradox. If an isolated thermodynamic system could be monitored over increasingly many multiples of the average Poincaré <b>recurrence</b> <b>time,</b> the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under time reversal.|$|E
40|$|The active {{plate margin}} of South America is {{characterized}} by a frequent occurrence of large and devastating subduction earthquakes. Here we focus on marine sedimentary records off Southern Chile that are archiving the regional paleoseismic history over the Holocene and Late Pleistocene. The investigated records - Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1232 and SONNE core 50 SL - are located at ~ 40 °S and ~ 38 °S, within the Perú-Chile trench, and are characterized by frequent interbedded strata of turbiditic and hemipelagic origin. On the basis of the sedimentological characteristics and the association with the active margin of Southern Chile, we assume that the turbidites are mainly seismically triggered, and may be considered as paleo-megaearthquake indicators. However, the long-term changes in turbidite <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> appear to be strongly influenced by climate and sea level changes as well. During sea level highstands in the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> of turbiditic layers are substantially higher, primarily reflecting a climate-induced reduction of sediment availability and enhanced slope stability. In addition, segmented tectonic uplift changes and related drainage inversions likely influenced the postglacial decrease in turbidite frequencies. Glacial turbidite <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> (including MIS 2, MIS 3, cold substages of MIS 5, and MIS 6), on the other hand, are within the same order of magnitude as earthquake <b>recurrence</b> <b>times</b> derived from the historical record and other terrestrial paleoseismic archives of the region. Only during these cold stages sediment availability and slope instability were high enough to enable recording of the complete sequence of large earthquakes in Southern Chile.
