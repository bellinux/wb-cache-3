Two months after Conner said she ended the affair, Birchtree Healthcare was cited by state regulators for numerous violations of health and safety <b>rules.</b> <b>By</b> July 2002, the state had pulled all Medicare and Medicaid payments from the facility, which soon went bankrupt. Conner further alleged that the state investigation of Birchtree was retaliation by Patton for her ending of the affair.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the <b>rules</b> <b>by</b> adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt <b>rules.</b> <b>By</b> {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E

5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} <b>rules</b> <b>by</b> which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells.

It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the <b>rules</b> <b>by</b> talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E

Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety, and laid down <b>rules</b> <b>by</b> which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority. These included denying surveyors sent by the province the ability to survey any land in the Grants, not just land owned through the Wentworth grants.|$|E

Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she has taken an overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E

5|$|Although Lillard {{planned to}} attend the University of Minnesota, {{he changed his mind}} when Clarence Spears, the college's head {{football}} coach, left to go to the University of Oregon. Lillard decided to attend Oregon, and played for the school's freshman football team in 1930. The following year, he appeared in two games for the varsity team. Against Idaho, Lillard was responsible for all of Oregon's points in a 9–0 Ducks win. Suspected of breaking college amateurism <b>rules</b> <b>by</b> playing semi-professional baseball for the Gilkerson Colored Giants, Lillard was briefly suspended by the PCC before Oregon's next game. The suspected violation placed Lillard's collegiate eligibility in question. While he did play in games, Lillard claimed that he received money not for playing, but for driving the team. The decision was overturned; according to PCC rules, no protest was possible during the week prior to a game between PCC teams. In the game against Washington, their second of the season, the Ducks claimed an upset victory, 13–0; Lillard had a touchdown and intercepted two passes. Before Oregon's next game against USC, Lillard was ruled ineligible by the PCC as a result of playing with the Gilkerson baseball team. Spears estimated that Lillard had provided half of his team's production on offense, and USC defeated Oregon by 53 points in the game after the ruling. Lillard dropped out of the university after the PCC's decision, becoming a professional football player and playing for various All-Star teams that traveled across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Her {{aspiration}} for fame commenced after she met Angel Anden and {{was asked to}} be a cover girl of the Valentine issue of the magazine (printed on Feb 15, 1953) called This Week (now, Chronical Magazine), where Anden was the editor. Imelda {{was not able to}} get an approval and acquire a sponsorship to participate in the Miss Manila contest from her cousins (Danieling, Eduardo, and Loreto), but, with the help of Adoracion, gained a sponsorship from Philippine Women's University after a meeting {{with the president of the}} university, Mrs. Francisca Benitez. The controversial Miss Manila beauty pageant dawned on Mar 1, 1953, when Imelda and the Reyes spouses were in great despair after hearing news that Norma Jimenez became the candidate of Miss Philippines and the winner of Miss Manila, and sought to meet the mayor of Manila, Aresenio Lacson, who revoked the decision and made Imelda Romualdez the winner of Miss Manila. The mayor announced that there were violations of <b>rules</b> <b>by</b> the International Fair Board, and it is the mayor's authority to nominate the candidate of the City of Manila for the beauty contest. It turned out that Imelda won 655 points whereas Norma Jimenez acquired 453 points. Both Imelda and Norma participated in Miss Philippines; however, the winner of Miss Philippines was Cristina Galang (Caedo, now) from Tarlac, who became one of the members of Imelda's band of women campaigners, Blue Ladies.|$|E

5|$|In 1883 Blackburn Olympic, a team {{composed}} {{mainly of}} factory workers, {{became the first}} Northern team to win the FA Cup, {{and the next year}} Preston North End won an FA Cup match against London-based Upton Park. Upton Park protested that Preston had broken FA <b>rules</b> <b>by</b> paying their players. In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the North, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. A schism was avoided in July 1885 when professionalism was formally legalised in English football. The Football League was founded in 1888, and marked its independence from the London-based Football Association by establishing headquarters in Preston – the League retained a Northern identity even after it accepted several Southern teams into its ranks. Intense local derbies between neighbouring teams mean that there is less of a North–South rivalry than in some other sports.|$|E
