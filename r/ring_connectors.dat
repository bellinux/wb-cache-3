40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{observed}} midterm {{results of}} vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> in surgery for aortic dissection. MethodsVascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> {{were used as}} stents in vascular grafts to achieve quick, sutureless anastomoses. Tapes were used to secure ringed vascular grafts from outside the aorta. ResultsFrom November 2007 to February 2011, 113 consecutive patients with aortic dissection, except 3 in preoperative profound shock, underwent open surgery. All underwent aortic reconstruction with vascular grafts and vascular ring connectors: ascending aorta in 29, descending thoracic aorta in 20, distal hemiarch plus descending thoracic aorta in 22, total arch in 14, ascending aorta plus total arch in 12, total arch plus descending thoracic aorta in 7, ascending aorta plus arch plus descending thoracic aorta in 8, and thoracoabdominal aorta in 1. Concomitant operations were 19 Bentall procedures, 14 coronary bypasses, 2 mitral valve replacements, 1 aortic valve replacement, and 1 heart transplant. We used sternotomy to repair 77 % of type B dissections, 83 % with elephant trunks. Time to extubation was 9. 0 ± 6. 2 hours. Average blood loss was 345 ± 195 mL. Half the patients needed no blood transfusion. In-hospital mortality was 5. 3 %; late mortality was 2. 7 %. ConclusionsUse of vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connectors</b> in surgical repair for aortic dissection might reduce risks and improve early and midterm results. With addition of elephant trunk, most type B dissections could be repaired through sternotomy. With the improved surgical results, we can suggest open repair for most uncomplicated type B dissections; however, more long-term follow-up is needed...|$|E

MethodsThe vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> is a titanic ring used as a stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless anastomosis. From November 2007 to December 2008, 19 consecutive patients (age range 36 – 77 years; 16 male and 3 female) with aortic dissection underwent open surgery. All patients received aortic reconstruction with vascular grafts (including 5 cases of arch replacement). The combined procedures were 5 Bentall and 4 {{coronary artery bypass graft}} operations. ResultsThere were no significant blood leaks from the anastomotic sites. The time required for each anastomosis was 1 to 2 minutes. All patients were discharged uneventfully and are still doing well after a follow-up period of 1 to 12 months. ConclusionThe vascular <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> may improve the early surgical results of aortic dissection by reducing both the time for anastomosis and the risk of bleeding and may be an alternative technique for aortic reconstruction.

Instead, the [...] "maleness" [...] of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of male pins, rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like XLR.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the utility of the {{vascular}} <b>ring</b> <b>connector</b> (VRC) and compare the clinical outcomes to conventional suture technique in the operation for acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD). Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 64 consecutive patients (mean age 57. 4 ± 12. 7 years, range 24 - 82 years) with AAAD who underwent emergent surgery in our institution from September 2010 to November 2014. Patients were divided into VRC group (55 patients) and conventional suture group (nine patients) based on the use of VRC during the operation. The preoperative characteristics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: Male patients predominated in both groups. The mean times of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp were 200. 1 ± 99. 9 and 193. 6 ± 54. 7 min (P = 0. 425) and 107. 5 ± 56. 2 and 112. 3 ± 40. 8 min (P = 0. 404) in the VRC group and suture group, respectively. There were more blood transfusions within 24 h (1513. 3 ± 949. 2 vs. 841. 8 ± 801. 1 ml) and more mediastinal drainage amount (1314. 4 ± 650. 3 ml vs. 942. 1 ± 527. 2 ml) in the suture group than in the VRC group. In the VRC group, 36. 3 % of patients did not require blood transfusion. Moreover, the pumping time and cardiac ischemic times were longer in the one-VRC group than in the two-VRC group. Operative mortality did not differ between the two groups (10. 9 % in VRC and 11. 1 % in suture group, P = 0. 985). No dislodgement of VRC during or after operation and no bleeding from sutureless anastomosis site were noted. Conclusion: Use of VRC is associated with equivalent operative mortality and morbidity compared to suture group in patients with AAAD undergoing an emergent operation. This study demonstrates the clinical safety and efficacy of VRC in reducing the need of blood transfusion within 24 h and mediastinal drainage within 72 h. However, further randomized studies and long-term surveillance of the use of VRC in AAAD are still mandatory...|$|R

40|$|Biochemical {{reactions}} {{powered by}} ATP hydrolysis are fundamental {{for the movement}} of molecules and cellular structures. One such reaction is the encapsidation of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome of an icosahedrally symmetric virus into a pre-formed procapsid {{with the help of}} a genome-translocating NTPase. Such NTPases have been characterized in detail from both RNA and tailed DNA viruses. We present four crystal structures and the biochemical activity of a thermophilic NTPase, B 204, from the nontailed, membrane-containing, hyperthermoacidophilic archaeal dsDNA virus Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus 2. These are the first structures of a genome-packaging NTPase from a nontailed, dsDNA virus with an archaeal host. The four structures highlight the catalytic cycle of B 204, pinpointing the molecular movement between substrate-bound (open) and empty (closed) active sites. The protein is shown to bind both single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids and to have an optimum activity at 80 °C and pH 4. 5. The overall fold of B 204 places it in the FtsK-HerA superfamily of P-loop ATPases, whose cellular and viral members have been suggested to share a DNA-translocating mechanism. Viruses with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or dsRNA ge-nomes often package their genome through a channel in a preformed capsid or procapsid (1). Genome translocation is pow-ered by NTP hydrolysis catalyzed by a DNA- (or RNA) -packaging enzyme (1).

40|$|Copper–graphite {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} possess {{the properties of}} copper, i. e. excellent thermal and electrical conductivities, and properties of graphite, i. e. solid lubricating and small thermal expansion coefficient. They are widely used as brushes, and bearing materials because of the above properties. Copper-graphite with low percentages of graphite is also used for slip <b>rings,</b> switches, relays, <b>connectors,</b> plugs and low voltage DC machines with very high current densities. In the present investigation, {{attempts have been made}} for the fabrication of Cu-graphite MMC by conventional and spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques. The MMCs were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different mechanical properties like density, bulk hardness and wear study were also conducted. XRD spectra show the presence of Cu, graphite and Cu 2 O peaks which shows that no interaction between Cu and graphite takes place during fabrication. The presence of a weak peak of Cu 2 O proves that slight oxidation of Cu takes place during sintering. It has been found that addition of graphite into copper does not result in much improvement in hardness due to the soft nature of graphite. However, 90 % and 97 % of theoretical density have been obtained for conventional sintered and SPS samples respectively. Maximum Vickers hardness value of around 100 has been achieved for Cu- 1 vol. % graphite MMC when it is fabricated by SPS. However, a hardness value of 65 has been obtained for the same composite when it is fabricated by conventional sintering at 900 °C for 1 hour. The micrographs of Cu-graphite reflect the clean interface and good compatibility between matrix and reinforcement. From wear study, it is concluded that the wear resistance of the composite increases with increase in graphite content due to the lubricating properties of graphite. It has also been found that wear depth decreases with increase in graphite content. SPS sintered samples show higher wear resistance than conventional sintered samples...|$|R
40|$|The SA 1358 - 10 and SA 2052 - 4 {{circular}} JT Type plug connectors {{are used}} {{on a number of}} nuclear weapons and Joint Test Assembly (JTA) systems. Prototype units were evaluated for the following specific defects associated with the 95 Sn- 5 Sb (Sn-Sb, wt. %) solder joint used to attach the beryllium-copper (BeCu) spring fingers to the aluminum (Al) connector shell: (1) extended cracking within the fillet; (2) remelting of the solder joint during the follow-on, soldering step that attached the EMR adapter <b>ring</b> to the <b>connector</b> shell (and/or soldering the EMR shell to the adapter ring) that used the lower melting temperature 63 Sn- 37 Pb (Sn-Pb) alloy; and (3) spalling of the Cd (Cr) layer overplating layer from the fillet surface. Several pedigrees of connectors were evaluated, which represented older fielded units as well as those assemblies that were recently constructed at Kansas City Plant. The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the spring finger solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR adapter ring attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the spring finger solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR adapter ring and/or EMR shell to the connector shell, requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the spring finger solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR adapter ring onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the hand soldering iron used to attach the EMR shell to the adapter ring...|$|R
40|$|During the {{self-assembly}} of bacteriophage phi 29, the {{viral genome}} is packaged into a pre-formed capsid by a molecular motor. The packaging motor {{is a complex}} of several oligomers including a dodecameric <b>connector</b> <b>ring</b> and a pentameric ATPase ring. These rings coordinate with each other, generating high forces in order to compact the dsDNA genome into the capsid at high pressures. The connector was proposed to engage and directly perform work on the DNA during packaging. Consideration of the symmetry of the connector and the capsid predicts that the connector must rotate relative to the capsid {{as part of the}} mechanism for translocating the DNA. An experiment designed to directly measure rotation of the connector is discussed in Chapter 2 of this dissertation. A combination magnetic tweezers and total internal reflection microscope is used to track the polarization of single fluorescent dyes attached to the connector. No evidence of polarization changes were found, indicating that the connector does not rotate at the expected rates. This further suggests that the connector does not directly perform mechanical work on the DNA during packaging. Viral packaging can be observed in optical tweezers by monitoring the length of the DNA as it is drawn into the capsid. Past studies have revealed many details of the packaging mechanism by following the dependence of the packaging velocity on factors like ATP concentration and applied load. In Chapter 3, I propose an experimental design intended to measure the effect of the packaging motor on the angle of the DNA in addition to its length and thus recover the full three-dimensional trajectory of the DNA as it passes into the capsid. In addition, this scheme can be used to apply torque and thus provides an additional tool with which to probe the packaging mechanism. In Chapter 4, we find that during packaging the downstream DNA is twisted in an underwinding direction, with a magnitude that depends {{on the extent to which}} the capsid is filled. The change in twisting can be attributed to cumulative looping of the DNA within the capsid, and the data predicts that the loops formed in the last kilobasepair of packaging are as small as 4 nm in radius. In addition, a non-lethal method of rupturing the viral capsids prior to packaging was discovered. Observations of DNA twisting by those packaging complexes revealed that, in the absence of internal pressure, the DNA is twisted by - 1. 2 °/bp. This number suggests that one of the packaging motor's five subunits makes contact with the DNA every ten basepairs, and that the cycle repeats with that subunit performing the same function every time. Such a strict functional segregation, in addition to the catalytic segregation revealed in previous high-resolution optical tweezers experiments, is an important part of the mechanism by which the motor packages DNA against high forces...|$|R
