25|$|The {{biological}} process of acidogenesis results in further {{breakdown of the}} <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> by acidogenic (fermentative) bacteria. Here, VFAs are created, along with ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide, {{as well as other}} byproducts. The process of acidogenesis is similar to the way milk sours.|$|E

25|$|On February 13,1981 the {{original}} headhouse roof was removed {{in one piece}} and stored during subway construction. The <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> were dismantled or discarded. Following completion of the subway station and new headhouses, the kiosk was reconstructed, with a contemporary façade, slightly north of its original location. No longer needed by the MBTA, the structure was acquired by the City of Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|Clarified {{butter is}} butter with {{almost all of}} its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating butter to its melting point and then {{allowing}} it to cool; after settling, the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|The Bohemic acid {{complex is}} a mixture of {{chemicals}} obtained through fermentation of a species of actinobacteria. In 1977 the components were isolated and have been found useful as antitumor agents and anthracycline antibiotics. The authors named the complex (and one of its components, bohemamine) after the opera La bohème by Puccini, and the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> were named after characters in the opera: alcindoromycin (Alcindoro), collinemycin (Colline), marcellomycin (Marcello), mimimycin (Mimi), musettamycin (Musetta), rudolphomycin (Rodolfo) and schaunardimycin (Schaunard). However, the relationships between the characters do not correctly reflect the chemical relationships.|$|E

25|$|Fourier {{transformation}} is also {{useful as a}} compact representation of a signal. For example, JPEG compression uses {{a variant of the}} Fourier transformation (discrete cosine transform) of small square pieces of a digital image. The Fourier components of each square are rounded to lower arithmetic precision, and weak components are eliminated entirely, so that the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> can be stored very compactly. In image reconstruction, each image square is reassembled from the preserved approximate Fourier-transformed components, which are then inverse-transformed to produce an approximation of the original image.|$|E
500|$|After {{facilities}} checkout at KSC was completed, the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> of SA-500F {{were then}} transferred to MSFC for inclusion in SA-500D: the Apollo boilerplate BP-27 and S-II-F/D. [...] The second stage was modified for dynamic testing, and shipped by Posideon from KSC on October 29 to arrive at MSFC November 10, 1966.|$|E
500|$|His lake {{design was}} at the heart of the city and {{consisted}} of a Central Basin in the shape of circular segment, a West and East Basin, which were both approximately circular, and a West and East Lake, which were much larger and irregularly shaped, at either side of the system. The East Lake was supposed to be [...] higher than the <b>remaining</b> <b>components.</b> Griffin's proposal was [...] "the grandest scheme submitted, yet it had an appealing simplicity and clarity.|$|E
40|$|The four-form field {{strength}} in F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds takes its {{value in the}} middle cohomology group H 4. The middle cohomology is decomposed into a vertical, a horizontal and a <b>remaining</b> <b>component,</b> all three of which are present in general. We argue that a flux along the <b>remaining</b> or vertical <b>component</b> may break some symmetry, while a purely horizontal flux does not influence the unbroken part of the gauge group or the net chirality of charged matter fields. This makes the decomposition crucial to the counting of flux vacua {{in the context of}} F-theory GUTs. We use mirror symmetry to derive a combinatorial formula for the dimensions of these components applicable to any toric Calabi– Yau hypersurface, and also make a partial attempt at providing a geometric characterization of the four-cycles Poincare ́ dual to the <b>remaining</b> <b>component</b> of H 4. It is also found in general elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds supporting SU(5) gauge symmetry that a <b>remaining</b> <b>component</b> can be present, for example, in a form crucial to the symmetry breaking SU(5) −→ SU(3) C×SU(2) L×U(1) Y. The dimension of the horizontal component above is used to derive an estimate of the statistical distribution of the number of generations and the rank of 7 -brane gauge groups in the landscape of F-theory flux vacua. a...|$|R
30|$|By {{utilizing}} alternating {{least squares}} (ALS) algorithm, (12) {{can be solved}} in an iterative scheme. Such algorithm fixes (N− 1) factor matrices in each iteration and updates the <b>remaining</b> <b>component</b> via least square approach, then repeats this process until the condition of convergence is satisfied.|$|R
25|$|Generically (if {{a certain}} linear {{function}} of electromagnetic field does not vanish identically), {{three out of}} four components of the spinor function in the Dirac equation can be algebraically eliminated, yielding an equivalent fourth-order partial differential equation for just one <b>component.</b> Furthermore, this <b>remaining</b> <b>component</b> can be made real by a gauge transform.|$|R
500|$|Most of the {{components}} for Little Boy left San Francisco on the cruiser [...] on 16 July and arrived on Tinian on 26 July. Four days later the ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine. The <b>remaining</b> <b>components,</b> which included six uranium-235 rings, were delivered by three C-54 Skymasters of the 509th Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron. Two Fat Man assemblies travelled to Tinian in specially modified 509th Composite Group B-29s. The first plutonium core went in a special C-54. A joint targeting committee of the Manhattan District and USAAF was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets, and recommended Kokura, Hiroshima, Niigata, and Kyoto. At this point, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing {{that he would be}} making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto on the grounds of its historical and religious significance. Groves therefore asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well. One of Kyoto's substitutes was Nagasaki.|$|E
500|$|Praising its story, Pereira {{claimed that}} it is [...] "a more {{personal}} story than the other GOW games, but one that still features the series' signature trademarks", and {{also said that the}} sex mini-game is [...] "arguably the most over-the-top of the bunch". Nelson stated {{that it is}} [...] "a game that upholds the standard of quality in gameplay, storytelling and sheer wow factor of the series, while also– like [...] before it– blurring the lines between portable and console experiences with its amazing presentation." [...] Juba said that it [...] "doesn’t have any mind-blowing moments", but [...] "this isn’t an optional side-story; Ghost of Sparta is a must-play for God of War fans." [...] GameTrailers said it has a [...] "pretty cool story" [...] that will [...] "definitely feel familiar". Parkin, however, stated the [...] "game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus" [...] and that the series [...] "is principally concerned with endlessly upping the ante." [...] He also claimed that the developers have [...] " [...] away the sense of wonder" [...] that is expected of a God of War game and stated [...] "the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> struggle to carry the experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{indicated}} before, {{there are}} varying treatments for the energy-momentum [...] {{so that one}} may also see it expressed as [...] or [...] The first component is the total energy (including mass) of the particle (or system of particles) in a given frame, while the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> are its spatial momentum.

50|$|This {{provides}} for two inputs and one output. Usually, in an automatic transmission, one component is held fixed, while another component is input, and the <b>remaining</b> <b>component</b> {{is used for}} output. By choosing a set of components for held, input, and output, the planetary gear will increase or decrease speed and change direction.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the case}} of our square wave force, the first {{component}} is actually a constant force of 0.5 newton and is represented by a value at [...] "0" [...] Hz in the frequency spectrum. The next component is a 1nbsp&Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.64. [...] This is shown by the line at 1nbsp&Hz. The <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> are at odd frequencies and it takes an infinite amount of sine waves to generate the perfect square wave. [...] Hence, the Fourier transform allows you to interpret the force as a sum of sinusoidal forces being applied instead of a more [...] "complex" [...] force (e.g. a square wave).|$|E
2500|$|The {{division}} was again activated in 1962 at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida when TAC took over that base from Strategic Air Command. [...] The two tactical fighter wings at MacDill were initially equipped with obsolescent Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks, but soon {{became the first}} McDonnell F-4 Phantom II wings in the Air Force. [...] Beginning in 1964, division units began deploying for combat in Southeast Asia, and eventually two entire wings moved to South Vietnam. [...] Until the 836th inactivated in 1971, its <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> acted primarily as training units for the Phantom II and, after 1968, for the Tropic Moon B-57G.

2500|$|In November 1994, The Washington Post {{came out}} with an {{announcement}} that Sweden could have kept its nuclear weapons option open on the sly. That statement stemmed from the [...] fact that the R3 reactor in Ågesta facility was still in place, {{but it was not}} subject to the ongoing inspection within the NPT framework. The reactor was shut down in 1974, but not dismantled. The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI) pointed out that the reason for the facility [...] not to be covered by the inspection was that Sweden signed the NPT in 1975 (not in 1968 when the NPT was ratified). Only then R3 was taken out of service and all fissile material was removed. Since none of the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> of the reactor had been maintained since 1974, the site was not viewed as an immediate subject for the SKI inspection.|$|E
50|$|In {{a general}} case (if a certain linear {{function}} of electromagnetic field does not vanish identically), {{three out of}} four components of the spinor function in the Dirac equation can be algebraically eliminated, yielding an equivalent fourth-order partial differential equation for just one <b>component.</b> Furthermore, this <b>remaining</b> <b>component</b> can be made real by a gauge transform.|$|R

2500|$|The bipolar cell {{active zone}} of the ribbon synapse can release {{neurotransmitter}} continuously for hundreds of milliseconds during strong stimulation. This release of neurotransmitters occurs in two kinetically distinct phases: a small fast pool where about {{twenty percent of the}} total is released in about 1 millisecond, and a large sustained pool where the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> are released over hundreds of milliseconds. [...] The existence of correspondence between the pool of tethered vesicles and the pool for sustained release in the rods and bipolar cells of the ribbon reveals that the ribbon may serve as a platform where the vesicles can be primed to allow sustained release of neurotransmitters. This large size of the sustained large component is what separates the ribbon synapse active zones from those of conventional neurons where sustained release is small in comparison. Once the presynaptic vesicles have been depleted, the bipolar cell’s releasable pool requires several seconds to refill with the help of ATP hydrolysis.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{introduction}} of active yeasts to the grape must, phosphates {{are attached to the}} sugar and the six-carbon sugar molecules begin to be split into three-carbon pieces and go through a series of rearrangement reactions. During this process, the carboxylic carbon atom is released in the form of carbon dioxide with the <b>remaining</b> <b>components</b> becoming acetaldehyde. The absence of oxygen in this [...] process allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted, by reduction, to ethanol. During the conversion of acetaldehyde, a small amount is converted, by oxidation, to acetic acid which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity (vinegar taint). After the yeast has exhausted its life cycle, they fall {{to the bottom of the}} fermentation tank as sediment known as lees. Yeast ceases its activity whenever all of the sugar in must has been converted into other chemicals or whenever the alcohol content has reached 15% alcohol per unit volume; a concentration strong enough to halt the enzymatic activity of almost all strains of yeast.|$|E
