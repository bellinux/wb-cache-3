40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{the adoption of}} IFRS increases the value relevance of accounting information for firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Using a longitudinal study that covers pre-IFRS and post-IFRS periods during 1990 - 2008, we find that earnings become more value-relevant whereas the book value of equity does not. This impact is concentrated in the subsamples of industrial firms, both large and small, and firms reporting an AGAAP-IFRS accounting reconciliation upon IFRS adoption.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of financial <b>reporting</b> instruments <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> mechanisms in Austria, with special emphasis {{on the role of the}} courts in this process. Former research in this area has either focused on the content of judicial rulings and interpretations of the law or on the interplay between regulation and creative accounting, whereas this paper focuses on the involvement of courts and administrative authorities in the regulation <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> process by means of a statistical analysis of judicial rulings and interpretations of the law in the case of Austria between 1990 and 2003. The Administrative Court, in its role as the highest court of appeal in all tax matters, emerges as by far the most active enforcement agent in Austria. This is a direct result of fiscal authorities fulfilling the role of an enforcement agency of financial reporting regulations in Austria. Regulation <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> of financial <b>reporting</b> regulations occur less frequently in the civil and criminal courts and emerge as a by-product of company litigation issues. Almost fifty percent of cases are not primarily concerned with the enforcement of accounting regulations, but with the enforcement of filing regulations. ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{individuals}} and organizations argued that the settlement in the consent decree should have included broader relief.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen {{the rise of a}} new model of {{production}} and consumption of goods and services, {{often referred to as the}} “sharing economy. ” Fueled by startups such as Uber and Airbnb, sharing enables individuals to obtain rides, accommodations, and other goods and services from peers via the Internet or mobile application in exchange for payment. The rise of sharing has raised questions about how it should be regulated, including whether existing laws and regulations can and should be enforced in this new sector or whether new ones are needed. In this Article, we explore those questions in the context of taxation. We argue that, contrary to the claims of some commentators, the application of substantive tax law to sharing is mostly (though not completely) clear, because current law generally contains the concepts and categories necessary to tax sharing. However, tax <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> compliance may present challenges, as a result of two distinctive features of sharing. First, some sharing businesses tend to opportunistically pick the more favorable regulatory interpretation if there is ambiguity regarding which rule applies or whether a rule applies.

We suggest strategies for addressing these dual challenges, including lower information reporting thresholds, safe harbors and advance rulings to simplify tax <b>reporting,</b> <b>and</b> targeted <b>enforcement</b> efforts...|$|R

40|$|Local {{government}}s {{were among the}} first levels of government to develop and implement policies and measures to combat climate change. They remain in many respects at the forefront of climate policy. Since the early 1990 s they have acted collectively to create transnational voluntary climate change initiatives, from the Europe-based Climate Alliance and EU Mayors’ Covenant to the global Cities for Climate Protection campaign and carbonn Cities Climate Registry. After more than two decades of experience with the oldest of these initiatives, it is somewhat surprising that these transnational local government climate initiatives have not received more attention in the scholarly literature. This paper surveys more than a dozen of the most prominent transnational local government climate change initiatives, compares them against key variables likely to affect their performance (namely, process versus performance orientation; self-determined versus pre-determined targets; specificity of commitments; geographic scope; measurement, <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> verification; <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> sanctions), assesses the economic incentives and other factors driving or constraining their adoption (including externalities, free-rider incentives, cost savings, co-benefits, voter demand, symbolic action, political entrepreneurship, piggy-backing, “green” market opportunities, desire to shape future regulation, desire to put pressure on higher levels of government, principled normative beliefs, and opportunities for policy learning), and predicts their likely effects in terms of GHG emissions reductions, policy learning, and enhanced adaptation capacity. The paper concludes that modest optimism is warranted about the potential of such initiatives to foster climate change adaptation and policy learning in the long run, tempered by considerable skepticism about their potential to reduce global GHG emissions in the short run...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{poses the}} basic {{question}} that is reflected in its title {{and that was the}} subject of the conference where the Article was initially presented: whether technology poses any threats to the mission of compliance and the position of compliance officers, whether it is just another useful tool for them, or whether it is something of both. It begins by explaining the origin of compliance in broker-dealers and investment advisers and its important current position in those firms. It then discusses why compliance officers have always been drawn to technology, particularly {{to keep up with the}} business sides of the firms for which they work—a need made more acute because of technological developments in the securities industry. After setting forth the question inspiring the conference, chiefly, what will be the effect of the use of new technology on compliance, the Article next articulates the following hypothesis: that more use of this technology in compliance—termed “dashboard compliance”—will increase the productivity of compliance officers, decrease their numbers, emphasize “legal” compliance, which is designed to ensure that the firm and its employees comply with the law, and diminish “values” compliance, which encourages conduct in line with firm and industry values. It then looks at the preliminary evidence, drawn from industry <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), as to whether this hypothesis is supported. It observes that compliance officers are finding it necessary to use dashboard compliance, and that the SEC and FINRA are encouraging this use. It also finds that dashboard compliance is making compliance officers more productive and suggests, albeit weakly, that this enhanced productivity might result in a loss of compliance officer positions, as firms make investments in technology at the expense of hiring or retaining human compliance officers. Finally, the Article observes that there is little evidence so far about a negative effect on “values” compliance from the use of dashboard compliance. Indeed, other outcomes are possible, such as dashboard compliance liberating compliance officers from many mundane tasks of legal compliance and giving them more time for values compliance. The Article concludes by recommending that, while the final outcome for dashboard compliance is unclear, in coming years compliance practitioners should remain alert to its possible effects to ensure that they try to maintain all that is valuable about compliance...|$|R
