5000|$|A 7.62mm or [...]50 {{machine gun}} can be {{mounted on the}} <b>roof,</b> while firing <b>ports</b> allow use of small arms from inside. Remote Weapon System can also be {{installed}} upon requirement.|$|R
50|$|Blazoning: Azure, a castle, triple-towered, embattled {{above the}} port, all argent, masoned sable, the port sable, the towers <b>roofed</b> gules. The <b>port</b> {{charged with a}} lion rampant azure {{surrounded}} by seven hearts gules on an inescutcheon bendwise or.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the target}} date of his [...] "coup" [...] approached, {{he claimed to}} be a {{journalist}} with Metropolis, a French architecture magazine, so that he could gain permission to interview the workers on the <b>roof.</b> The <b>Port</b> Authority allowed Petit to conduct the interviews, which he used as a pretext to make more observations. He was once caught by a police officer on the roof, and his hopes to do the high-wire walk were dampened. He eventually regained the confidence to proceed.|$|R
40|$|The slides {{were taken}} on {{collecting}} trips {{sponsored by the}} William L. Bryant Foundation, where books, music and art indigenous to the regions were gathered. The are organized by geographical location. A wooden house with zinc paneled <b>roofing</b> in <b>Port</b> of Spain, Trinidad. The house includes ornate fretwork on the house's gabled porch, along the eaves, and under the window beams. The house sits in a yard enclosed by a wire and concrete wall. A man is walking next to the house. In the background are other wooden houses and tall palm trees. Slide labeled Old House Port of Spain...|$|R
50|$|Each {{blockhouse}} {{was built}} of sawed wood slabs or thick boards, which {{were covered with}} rough boards. Each had a wood shingle <b>roof</b> and had <b>ports</b> for aiming rifles and small cannon. Each was two stories tall. Each blockhouse was surrounded by log palisades covered on the outside by earthworks, which in turn were surrounded by wide, deep ditches.|$|R
500|$|Twenty-one {{people were}} killed and 76 others were injured in the outbreak. The first tornado damaged 1,145homes and {{destroyed}} 200others in Sumter County before hitting the Lady Lake area where it killed eight people. A total [...] of 180homes were damaged and 101homes were destroyed in Lake County. The second tornado killed 13people in the Lake Mack area and damaged or destroyed over 500homes and other structures during its existence, including the 1500-foot (450-meter) tall transmission tower of WCFB FM. The final tornado damaged <b>roofs,</b> car <b>ports</b> and garage doors along its path through New Smyrna Beach. The outbreak was the second-deadliest on record for Florida, with damages of $218million.|$|R

50|$|The troop {{compartment}} accommodates six {{soldiers who}} enter {{and leave the}} vehicle by a door in {{either side of the}} hull. The lower part of the door folds downward to form a step, with the upper part opening forwards. There are also hatches in the <b>roof</b> and firing <b>ports</b> with associated vision devices provided in the sides and front of the vehicle. An air conditioning system is fitted as standard to ensure crew comfort in hot conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Honda {{drastically}} {{altered the}} head castings, tightening the valve angle from the 38degrees of the RC30 to 26degrees in the RC45. By reducing the valve angle, they straightened the port, along with making it higher, thus reducing the turbulence generating ‘short turn’ of the cylinder head. Honda {{also made the}} intake ports shorter and utilised intake valves that were 2 mm larger in diameter. The exhaust ports were also modified with a higher <b>port</b> <b>roof,</b> which reduced flow restrictions. The exhaust valves were also larger than the RC30’s in diameter ...|$|R
500|$|The main gun turrets had sides 300mm {{thick with}} 150mm <b>roofs.</b> The gun <b>ports</b> were {{protected}} by 50mm plates, and 25mm bulkheads separated each gun. The barbettes were [...] thick, decreasing to [...] when behind other armour. They were shaped like truncated cones which matched the trajectories of descending shells and thus lessened their protective value. The conning tower was [...] thick, reduced to 300mm below the upper deck. The funnel uptakes were protected by 50mm of armour. The upper deck was [...] thick while the middle deck consisted of [...] plates of KNC on 25mm of nickel-steel over the armoured citadel. Underwater protection was minimal: {{there was only}} a [...] watertight bulkhead behind the upward extension of the double bottom, and even this was thinner as the hull narrowed towards the end turrets.|$|R
25|$|A new $3.3 million {{cultural}} precinct {{was completed}} in 2010 built by the Port Pirie Regional Council {{in partnership with the}} Federal Government. A committee is also looking at building a multi-purpose stadium. The swimming pool is now state of the art after receiving a $1 million refit. A major Waste Recovery Facility was opened in 2013, which allows all waste and recycled material to be sorted and sorted under one <b>roof.</b> In 2012 <b>Port</b> Pirie Regional Council completed a $5m Community Water Recycling project with Nyrstar which allows 350ML of water to be reused from the smelter. Plans are underway to establish a large shopping complex in the city with an additional supermarket and department store. The city's population is continually growing and property prices continue to rise. The Port Pirie Regional Council has a number of large projects that will be launched or completed next financial year.|$|R
50|$|The main gun turrets had sides 300 mm {{thick with}} 150 mm <b>roofs.</b> The gun <b>ports</b> were {{protected}} by 50 mm plates, and 25 mm bulkheads separated each gun. The barbettes were 247.5 mm thick, decreasing to 147.5 mm when behind other armour. They were shaped like truncated cones which matched the trajectories of descending shells and thus lessened their protective value. The conning tower was 400 mm thick, reduced to 300 mm below the upper deck. The funnel uptakes were protected by 50 mm of armour. The upper deck was 37.5 mm thick while the middle deck consisted of 40 mm plates of KNC on 25 mm of nickel-steel over the armoured citadel. Underwater protection was minimal: {{there was only}} a 10 mm watertight bulkhead behind the upward extension of the double bottom, and even this was thinner as the hull narrowed towards the end turrets.|$|R
500|$|They {{returned}} {{to assist in}} the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Shortly after having done so Suffren was under heavy fire and was struck no less than [...] 14 times in 15 minutes. Most did no significant damage, including a [...] that bounced off the after 305-millimetre turret, but one 24-centimetre shell ricocheted off the port midships 164-millimetre turret and ripped the <b>roof</b> off the <b>port</b> casemate, killing the entire gun crew. Some flaming debris dropped into that gun's magazine and started a fire, but it was quickly flooded to prevent an explosion. Another shell tore a hole [...] across in the bow which flooded the base of the forward turret. While the French Squadron was withdrawing pursuant to Admiral de Robeck's order Bouvet struck a mine and sank in 55 seconds. Suffren lowered her admiral's barge, her only intact boat, and rescued 75 men before she had to escort the badly-damaged Gaulois away from the Dardanelles. The latter was taking on water by the bow and had to be beached on one of the Rabbit Islands at the entrance of the Dardanelles before she sank.|$|R
40|$|The Portoro “marble” {{is a fine}} {{variety of}} black {{limestone}} from the La Spe- zia area, in Liguria (North-western Italy), which consists of a Liassic limestone with limonite and calcite veins. The Portoro typically crops out close to the Portovenere village and Poets’ Gulf area, which is very known and sensitive in terms of scenery and tourist appeal. Even if few stone quarries are still working, it is evident how quar- rying must be done with special care. So underground excavation {{is more and more}} developing, in order to control waste production, environmental impact and slope in- stability: big blocks are mined in large underground chambers whose <b>roofs</b> are sup- <b>ported</b> by pillars. In this study a numerical modeling, based on a distinct element method was used, in order to compare stresses and displacements with the in situ measurements and to reach an optimum quarrying design. This research mainly aimed at improving the working conditions, as regards different topics: work safety in under- ground environment; prevention of fracturing of intact rock, induced by excessive stress concentration; improvement of the extraction process, to quarry intact, bigger stone blocks and produce less waste material; providing the underground chambers with long-term stability conditions, for possible future use...|$|R
