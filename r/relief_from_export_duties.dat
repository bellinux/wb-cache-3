50|$|Although {{relations}} remained {{close and}} friendly, the Bhutanese government expressed {{a need to}} renegotiate parts of the treaty to enhance Bhutan's sovereignty. Bhutan began to slowly assert an independent attitude in foreign affairs by joining the United Nations in 1971, recognising Bangladesh and signing a new trade agreement in 1972 that provided an exemption <b>from</b> <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> for goods <b>from</b> Bhutan to third countries. Bhutan exerted its independent stance at the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit conference in Havana, Cuba also in 1979, by voting with China and some Southeast Asian countries rather than with India {{on the issue of}} allowing Cambodia's Khmer Rouge to be seated at the conference. Unlike in Nepal, where its 1950 treaty with India {{has been the subject of}} great political controversy and nationalist resentment because of Indian immigrants in Nepal, the nature of Bhutan's relationship with India has not been affected by concerns over the treaty provisions.

The residents of Albemarle were unhappy with the Navigation Acts. They relied on tobacco for their income, and since Albemarle didn’t have a good port, they sold much of their tobacco to traders from New England, whose small ships could get through narrow inlets. They considered the tax an unfair hardship. Worse, the taxes came on top of several years of bad harvests caused by major hurricanes, drought, and wild rains. And settlers also grumbled about the quitrents they had to pay on their land, which were higher than in neighboring colonies.|$|R

50|$|With World Bank backing {{and support}} from France, the Netherlands, and the EC, {{restructuring}} of Cotontchad began in 1986 with government implementation of the Emergency Cotton Program. At the producer level, the program called for freezing the price paid producers at the CFA F100-per-kilogram level through 1988 and studying new methods of fixing producer prices to reflect world market conditions. Subsidies on improved inputs, such as fertilizer and insecticides, were eliminated as of 1987, with producers assuming the costs. Cotton production was {{to be limited to}} about 100,000 tons by restricting the area under production to 750 square kilometres during the program period. At the company level, Cotontchad sold nonessential assets to the private sector (including two aircraft and about 150 vehicles), closed its branch office in Bangui, Central African Republic, and laid off administrative staff. It also closed six ginneries and reduced the number of cotton collection centers in accordance with the production target of 100,000 tons. For its part, the government exempted Cotontchad <b>from</b> taxes, particularly <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> and suspended its contributions to the CSPC, the ONDR, and the Debt Amortization Fund (Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement—CAA). Staffs at the CSPC and the ONDR were reduced, and the roles of both organizations were reviewed.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} analysis of the impacts of trade policy reforms in Sri Lanka. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is constructed with detailed description of the domestic production structure and foreign trade. The model is then used to investigate the effects of trade policy reforms on resource allocation and welfare. ^ Prior to 1977, Sri Lanka maintained stringent control over its imports through rigid quantitative restrictions. A new economic policy reform package was introduced in 1977, and it shifted Sri Lanka 2 ̆ 7 s development strategy toward an export oriented policy regime. The shift of policy focus from a restrictive trade regime toward a more open trade regime is expected to {{have a significant impact on}} the volume of external trade, domestic production structure, allocation of resources, and social welfare. ^ Simulations are carried out to assess the effects of three major policy reforms: (1) a devaluation of the Sri Lanka rupee, (2) a partial or a complete elimination of <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> and (3) a devaluation-cum-removal of <b>export</b> <b>duties.</b> ^ Simulation results indicate that the macroeconomic impact of a devaluation-cum-removal of <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> can be substantial. They also suggest that the resource-pull effects of a devaluation and a devaluation-cum-export duty removal policy are significant. However, the model shows that a devaluation combined with an <b>export</b> <b>duty</b> reduction is likely to be a superior strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|Prices for {{commodities}} such as {{minerals and}} metals have increased significantly {{over the past few}} years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in restrictions on the export of raw materials which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper provides information on the present situation regarding the use of export restrictions and international disciplines on these measures. Export restrictions are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. Export restrictions take various forms such as <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> quantitative restrictions, and licensing requirements. The number of countries applying <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> over the period 2003 - 2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative export restrictions which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive discipline on <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. Export restrictions have also been discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of <b>export</b> <b>duties.</b> <b>Export</b> restrictions, by creating a differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. Although several governments apply export restrictions to achieve diverse policy objectives, not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of the significant impacts of export restrictions on global supply chains, transparency on the use and implementation of such measures should be substantially improved. transparency, quantitative restrictions, accession, export licensing, food security, conservation of natural resources, subsidy, raw materials, terms-of-trade, fiscal receipts, trade policy review, Doha Development Agenda, regional trade agreements, <b>export</b> restrictions, <b>export</b> <b>duties,</b> social objectives, tariff escalation, non-agricultural market access, WTO disciplines...|$|R

40|$|The current World Trade Organization (WTO) regime on export {{restraints}} comprises two extremes: {{at one end}} is the near-complete {{freedom to}} levy <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> enjoyed by most Members, which renders theWTO discipline on export restrictions largely ineffective; at the other end, the rigid obligations imposed on several acceding Members prohibiting the use of <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> for any purpose. The recent WTO ruling in China-Raw Materials has only solidified the latter extreme. This article seeks to expose the irrationality of the current regime, especially the problems created by the rigid obligations of the several acceding Members. It contends that such obligations deprive these Members of their ownership right to claim {{a larger share of}} their natural resources for domestic use and of an effective tool for managing environmental externalities associated with the resource products exported. The virtual immutability of such obligations is at odds with the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources. To rectify these problems, this article proposes integrating all stand-alone export concessions into General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) schedules, which would provide the acceding Members with the policy space and flexibility available under the GATT. It is also submitted that the key to gaining support from developing countries {{for the establishment of a}} system-wide discipline lies in the recognition of legitimate functions of <b>export</b> <b>duties.</b> Rather than pushing for their elimination, the WTO should aim to regulate <b>export</b> <b>duties</b> in the same manner as its regulation of import duties...|$|R
