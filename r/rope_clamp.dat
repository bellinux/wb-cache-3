5000|$|<b>Rope</b> <b>clamp,</b> an {{assembly}} {{attached to a}} rope and measures its tension. Rope clamps are popular in hoist, crane and elevator applications due to the ease of their installation; {{they have to be}} designed for a large range of loads, including dynamic peak loads, so their output for the rated load tends to be lower than of the other types ...|$|E
50|$|The Franklin Manufacturing Company was {{established}} in 1884 by Frank Johnson and Oliver Crosby in St. Paul, Minnesota. One year later Franklin Manufacturing Company {{changed its name to}} American Manufacturing Company. A wire <b>rope</b> <b>clamp</b> designed to loop wire cable without the losing the integrity of the wire was invented by Oliver Crosby in 1886. American Manufacturing Company invented further enhancements to the construction industry by establishing steam-powered hoists in 1889 and the largest electric hoists, up to 15 hp.|$|E
50|$|A wire <b>rope</b> <b>clamp,</b> {{also called}} a clip, {{is used to}} fix the loose end of the loop back to the wire rope. It usually {{consists}} of a U-shaped bolt, a forged saddle, and two nuts. The two layers of wire rope are placed in the U-bolt. The saddle is then fitted over the ropes on to the bolt (the saddle includes two holes to fit to the u-bolt). The nuts secure the arrangement in place. Three or more clamps are usually used to terminate a wire rope. As many as eight may be needed for a 2 in diameter rope.|$|E
40|$|Topic of this {{research}} is "Review of tree climbing knots strength as safety elements for the tree climbing". Main objective is to describe mechanical options as replacements for the climbing knots as <b>rope</b> <b>clamps</b> and descenders. Research also contains comparisons of <b>rope</b> <b>clamps</b> and climbing knots [...] their advantages and disadvantages. Main part describes measurement of the strength three different types of climbing knots, measured on two types of ropes before start of the sliding movement. Results of the measurements are output tables which contain recommendation for the practical usage...|$|R
5000|$|Nonlinearity: {{at the low}} end {{of their}} scale, the load cells tend to be nonlinear. This becomes {{important}} for cells sensing very large ranges, or with large surplus of load capability to withstand temporary overloads or shocks (e.g. the <b>rope</b> <b>clamps).</b> More points may be needed for the calibration curve.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a pilot study}} of end connections for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene 12 -strand braided rope (synthetic rope) for use in timber harvesting applications. Fourteen different end connections for 14 mm and 16 mm diameter synthetic rope were developed and break tested to determine suitability. Three types of end connections were evaluated: spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. End connections with adhesive had variable strength performance and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware group, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strengths. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, <b>rope</b> <b>clamps,</b> knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and in limited applications, <b>rope</b> <b>clamps.</b> Further research and development is needed on these six concepts with larger sample sizes and under testing and operating varied conditions...|$|R

50|$|Catharpin is a {{nautical}} term, {{which is}} often pronounced cat-harping. It describes one of the short <b>ropes</b> or iron <b>clamps</b> used to brace in the shrouds toward the masts so as to give a freer sweep to the yards.|$|R
50|$|The company only built fixed-grip lifts, whose chair grip is {{woven into}} the haul <b>rope</b> rather than <b>clamped</b> onto it. But other {{technologies}} eventually proved more popular. In early 2003, the firm {{announced that it was}} no longer viable and would go out of business.|$|R
5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy <b>ropes.</b> Heavier <b>clamps</b> were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware end connections, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, <b>rope</b> <b>clamps,</b> knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and Y-splice. These end connections suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given. Further research and development needs to be conducted on these seven concepts with larger sample sizes and in varied conditions...|$|R
6000|$|A prodigious {{confusion}} and clamoring of tongues ensued; Mr. Blyth being louder, wilder, and more utterly useless {{in the present}} emergency {{than any of his}} neighbors. Mat, cool as ever, kept his hold of the picture; and, taking no notice of the confused advice and cumbersome help offered to him, called to Zack to fetch a ladder, or, failing that, to [...] "get a hoist" [...] on some chairs, and cut the <b>rope</b> from the <b>clamp</b> that remained firm. Wooden steps, as young Thorpe knew, were usually kept in the painting-room. Where had they been removed to now? Mr. Blyth's memory was lost altogether in his excitement. Zack made a speculative dash at the flowing draperies which concealed the lumber in one corner, and dragged out the steps in triumph.|$|R
