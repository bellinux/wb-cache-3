5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} <b>radiation</b> <b>shield.</b> One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E

25|$|Here Z is {{atomic number}} and n {{is a number}} which varies between 4 and 5. (At lower photon {{energies}} a characteristic structure with edges appears, K edge, L edges, M edges, etc.) The obvious interpretation follows that the photoelectric effect rapidly decreases in significance, in the gamma ray region of the spectrum, with increasing photon energy, and that photoelectric effect increases steeply with atomic number. The corollary is that high-Z materials make good gamma-ray shields, which is the principal reason that lead (Z = 82) is a preferred and ubiquitous gamma <b>radiation</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: High hydrogen-content {{aliphatic}} polymers {{have been}} identified as good for shielding against galactic cosmic radiation. However, their utility in structural elements is limited to modest temperatures where desirable mechanical properties are maintained. On the other hand, aromatic polymers generally have a broader range of operating temperatures but are less effective as <b>radiation</b> <b>shields.</b> The <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding</b> properties of aromatic polymers is enhanced by the incorporation of hydrogen-rich aliphatic groups appended to aromatic units in the macromolecular structure. It is envisioned that functionally graded polymer structures using aliphatic/aromatic hybrids can be used to meet the requirements of the service environment with beneficial <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding</b> properties in future space structural applications. This paper discusses the syntheses of such hybrid polymers. Key Words: Polyimides, poly(arylene ethers), <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding</b> 1...|$|R
25|$|The cost of food {{irradiation}} {{is influenced by}} dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation. Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1million to $5million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5acres), <b>radiation</b> <b>shield,</b> and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs. Perishable food items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.|$|E
25|$|Use of a {{radioisotope}} requires shielding for {{the safety}} of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the <b>radiation</b> <b>shield.</b> One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated into the water towards the source in hermetic bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in Decatur Georgia, US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma photons have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of Caesium-137 radiation.|$|E
25|$|It {{was water}} hammer {{that caused the}} {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective <b>radiation</b> <b>shield</b> for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Radiation</b> <b>shielding</b> is {{considered}} as a highly sensitive issue {{in the department of}} medical physics. Proper utilization of material in <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding</b> can be effective in terms of economy, durability and safety measure. Concrete is nowadays extensively used as a material for <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding.</b> The coarse aggregate of concrete {{plays an important role in}} concrete density where the density is related to the radiation attenuation. In this research, the feasible study has conducted of using the recycled coarse aggregate in <b>radiation</b> <b>shielding.</b> The focus of this paper is to introduce a possible better alternative of fresh aggregate to make the concrete shielding. Two types of recycled aggregates were taken; recycled stone aggregate (RCA) and recycled brick aggregate (RBA). Aggregate material properties were found out at the beginning of the research. As the Brachytherapy unit used in the research, the Cobalt- 60 (Co- 60) was selected as a source of photon energy. Then the HVL and TVL were measured based on the attenuation of radiation.
