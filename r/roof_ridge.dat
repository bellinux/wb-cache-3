5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and is more of a low-shed type.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower at}} {{the west end of}} the church dates from the early 17th century. It sits next to the {{south-west}} corner of the nave, aligned with the south wall, because the former church plan included a north aisle; the north wall of the tower meets the nave at its <b>roof</b> <b>ridge.</b> It is castellated and constructed of coursed roughly-dressed stone. It has two diagonal buttresses, two angled buttresses and four corner pinnacles. There are slate belfry louvres {{on each side of the}} tower and clock faces on the north and south sides.|$|E
5|$|Rappaport died in 1994, and in January 1995 {{developer}} P Associates {{announced its}} agreement {{to buy the}} properties from his estate. The developer also disclosed {{plans to build a}} luxury residential tower at the site. The plan called for dismantling part of Furness's additions to the PSFS headquarters, which would serve as the tower's lobby. The York Row houses would have been completely demolished. The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged. P Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a new plan that would preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade. The new plan, which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space. The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored. P Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses, back to the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> line.|$|E

25|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps {{built the}} guard station {{residence}} in 1938. It is rectangular one-story, wood-frame structures with gabled roof. The structure rests of a concrete foundation. There is an interior stone chimney off center from the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge.</b> The exterior walls are horizontal clapboard with vertical board and batten covering the gable ends. Windows are either a nine or twelve pane light sash type. The main front window {{is a group}} of three twelve pane windows set below a front gabled bay. A garage with hinged two-leaf doors is built into one end of the structure.|$|E
25|$|Javanese {{people are}} {{descendant}} from Austronesian peoples. Temple relief in 9th-century Borobudur shows Javanese houses that were archetype of Austronesian houses: pile foundations, pitched roofs and an extended <b>roof</b> <b>ridge.</b> While these reliefs suggest houses on piles were in common use from the 9th to 12th centuries, between the 13th and 14th century the preferred Javanese style (east and central Java) {{was to build}} on the ground with a raised floor, the form of Javanese house that we know today. This new form resembles the vernacular architecture of eastern Indonesia such as Balinese and Sumbanese houses. Excavations at Trowulan (East Java), the probable site of Majapahit's capital in the 14th century, have uncovered remains of dwellings with permanent materials such as brick floors, foundations for walls and tile roofs.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the living accommodation in part of the Deele explains the very unusual layout of the Low German house. Whilst other 'all-in-one' farmhouses have their living quarters at the front, the Low German house across most of its native region has its main gateway at the front. The large gateway gable (colloquially: Grotdörgiebel) was very carefully made. The frame and especially the lintel of the Grote Dör (great door) were adorned with inscriptions and decorations. On simple houses the gable above is just filled in with vertical timber laths; on more complicated buildings the timber-framing of the steep gable extends almost to the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge.</b> In the Altes Land projecting gables are preferred. In Schaumburg Land and the area around Hanover the gable is topped by a roof section sloping at about 80°.|$|E

5000|$|... tsumairi or tsumairi-zukuri (妻入・妻入造) - a {{style of}} {{construction}} in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs perpendicular to the <b>roof's</b> <b>ridge</b> (gabled side). The taisha-zukuri, sumiyoshi-zukuri, ōtori-zukuri and kasuga-zukuri belong to this type.|$|R
25|$|The {{church was}} {{completed}} {{four years after}} the houses and school by other architects and it seems that Andrews and Pepper's scheme anticipated a major building at this point. The impact of the completed scheme was dramatic, especially when viewed from the east. Ripley terrace was virtually level along its 750ft length. The slight fall of about 4ft was compensated for by building up gardens walls in the lower section so that doors and windows remained in alignment. Behind the south section of the terrace the school buildings rose above the house roofs with the pinnacle of the clock tower about 50 feet above the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> of the houses. Behind the central and north sections of Ripley Terrace the roof lines of the successive terraces rose in echelon with the gable of St Bartholomew's rising 40 feet above the highest roofs. The pyramidical theme was repeated in the front elevations of the terraces.|$|E
25|$|The main door {{is made of}} double-leafed {{timber and}} painted with phoenixes. The two side doors {{flanking}} the main door are painted with door gods. The main door is usually kept barred except on important occasions. The roof ridges and eaves of the temple have chien nien ornamentation and plaster relief-work. Chen nien ornamentation is the tradition southern Chinese art of creating figures, flowers, leaves and other images with small pieces of colourful porcelain. Another key feature of traditional Chinese building is exposed structural elements. Traditionally constructed without nails, {{the weight of the}} roof is supported on the columns on which rest of the beams. Walls in Chinese temples do not bear the weight of the roof. The exposed structure shows off the ingenious carpentry. The roof of the main hall is a two-tiered xie shan roof with curved swallow tail ridge ends. In the centre of the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> are two prancing dragons on either side of a blazing pearl. At the ends of the lower-tier roof are Minnan spirals.|$|E
25|$|Roofs were {{typically}} covered with wood shingles until sheet metal roofing became available. Thatch roofing {{had fallen out}} of use by this time period. The wall sheathing was usually vertically boarded but may be studded with the wall boards installed horizontally. Barns may be left unpainted or painted, most commonly an inexpensive red color. Ventilation was desired in barns so the walls were sometimes left without siding or covered with wood shingles or clapboards and then asphalt shingles. The New England barn may have been ornamented in an architectural style to match the farmhouse. Ventilators and cupolas were added to some barns in the 19th century to improve ventilation. Lightning protection systems were often strung along the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> in intercept lightning strikes and prevent fire. New England barns are usually a type of bank barn, built into the side of a hill giving ground level access to one side, but a ramp or rarely a bridge were used to access the doors. The roof form is typically a gable roof but some New England barns were built with a gambrel roof.|$|E
5000|$|... hirairi or hirairi-zukuri (平入・平入造) - a {{style of}} {{construction}} in which the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the <b>roof's</b> <b>ridge</b> (non gabled-side). The shinmei-zukuri, nagare-zukuri, hachiman-zukuri, and hie-zukuri belong to this type.|$|R

The rain-inflicted damage includes chipped <b>roof's</b> <b>ridge.</b> An official of the Cultural Heritage Administration stated that [...] "The aged gate underwent repairs in 1998 and seems to have become soaked in heavy rains".|$|R
50|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>ridges</b> {{contains}} {{animal with}} dragon head added with fish tail. The roof {{is covered with}} shingles of asbestos and modeled after the effects of red copper tiles. The external walls are decorated with a coating of pebbles and moldings to imitate the exterior of certain wall.|$|R
2500|$|The {{intermediate}} variant is the Dreiständerhaus or three-post farmhouse. This is an asymmetric {{version of}} the two- and four-post farmhouses, in which the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> is located almost directly {{over one of the}} Deele walls. On this side the eaves are like those on the Vierständerhaus, often {{at the height of the}} Deele ceiling. On the other side the rafters are arranged like those of a Zweiständerhaus. Often the lower part of the roof is attached on both sides.|$|E
2500|$|The present {{church was}} built in 1863 and public opinion about its look was not {{particularly}} positive. In his [...] "Remembrance protocol" [...] the pastor, Bernt Askevold, put it like this: [...] "The new church was built with a simple steeple which rose {{only a few feet}} above the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> and with a big wooden cross {{at the other end of}} the ridge. But people have never liked the simple shape of the church steeple." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{its basic}} layout, {{consisting}} of an elevated [...] partially {{surrounded by a}} veranda called hisashi (all under the same roof), is modified {{by the addition of}} a room in front of the entrance. A nagare-zukuri honden (sanctuary) varies in <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> length from 1 to 11 ken, but is never 6 or 8 ken. The most common sizes are 1 and 3 ken. The oldest shrine in Japan, Uji's Ujigami Shrine, has a honden of this type. Its external dimensions are 5x3 ken, but internally it is composed of three [...] measuring 1 ken each.|$|E
5000|$|Hirairi or hirairi-zukuri (平入・平入造) is a Japanese {{traditional}} architectural structure, {{where the}} building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the <b>roof's</b> <b>ridge</b> (non gabled-side). The shinmei-zukuri, nagare-zukuri, hachiman-zukuri, and hie-zukuri Shinto architectural styles belong to this type. It survives mostly in religious settings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architecture}} and village layouts {{of the six}} Batak groups also show significant differences. Toba Batak houses, for example, are boat-shaped with intricately carved gables and upsweeping <b>roof</b> <b>ridges.</b> Karo Batak houses rise up in tiers. Both are built on piles and are derived from an ancient Dong-Son model.|$|R

2500|$|The major {{architectural}} {{feature of}} St Vincent’s is its nave, with Pevsner reporting {{the building as}} [...] "one of the rare two-naved churches;" [...] it being one of only four such in England. A two-and-a-half-bay arcade supported by three octagonal piers runs through {{the centre of the}} nave and rises to the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge.</b> It begins at the west wall and ends with a half arch meeting the west arch of the central crossing. The chief timbers of the nave, with its corbels at the south, are probably 14th-century. A 17th-century poor box is at the west of the nave. The unadorned [...] "chalice shaped" [...] Decorated hexagonal baptismal font is, according to Caythorpe Parish Council, 600 years old, but according to English Heritage is 19th-century.|$|E
2500|$|The Low German {{house is}} similar in {{construction}} to the neolithic longhouse, {{although there is no}} evidence of a direct connexion. The longhouse first appeared during the period of the Linear Pottery culture about 7,000 years ago and has been discovered during the course of archaeological excavations in widely differing regions across Europe, including the Ville ridge west of Cologne. The longhouse differed from later types of house in that it had a central row of posts [...] under the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge.</b> It was therefore not three- but four-aisled. To start with, cattle were kept outside overnight in Hürden or pens. With the transition of agriculture to permanent fields the cattle were brought into the house, which then became a so-called Wohnstallhaus or byre-dwelling.|$|E

2500|$|Constructed {{at the top}} of a hill, in a {{grove of}} oaks, with rolling {{pastures}} surrounding, the house designed by Memphis architectural firm, Furbringer and Erhmanis, is a two-story, five bay residence in the Colonial Revival style with a side-facing gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, a central two-story projecting pedimented portico, and one-story wings on its north and south sides. Attached to the wing is an additional one-story stuccoed wing that originally housed a four-car garage. There are two chimneys; one on the north exterior side wall, and a second chimney that rises through the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge</b> on the south side of house. The front and side facades of the central block are veneered with tan Tishomingo limestone from Mississippi, and its rear wall is stuccoed, as are the one-story wings. Front facade fenestration at the first floor includes 12-over-12 double-hung windows set in arched openings with wooden panels above the windows, and six-over-six double-hung windows at the second floor. Four stone steps, flanked by two large lions, ascend from the driveway to the two-story central projecting portico containing four Corinthian columns with capitals modeled after James Stuart's conjectural porticos for the [...] "Tower of the Winds" [...] in Athens. Its pediment has dentils and a central, small, leaded oval window. The columns at the corners of the portico are matched by pilasters on the front facade. The doorway has a broken arched pediment, full entablature, and engaged columns. Its transom and sidelights contain elaborate, colorful stained glass. Above the main entrance is a window with a shallow iron balcony.|$|E
60|$|The {{train was}} late, {{and it was}} past ten o'clock when they at last {{appeared}} before the concierge of Helen's home. During their journey, and while passing though the crowds at the station and in the streets, Ostrander had exhibited a new and grave guardianship over the young girl, and, on the first landing, after a scrutinizing and an almost fierce glance at {{one or two of}} Helen's odd fellow lodgers, he had extended his protection so far as to accompany her up the four flights to the landing of her apartment. Here he took leave of her with a grave courtesy that half pained, half pleased her. She watched his broad shoulders and dangling sleeve as he went down the stairs, and then quickly turned, entered her room, and locked the door. The smile had faded from her lips. Going to the window, she pressed her hot forehead against the cool glass and looked out upon the stars nearly level with the black roofs around her. She stood there some moments until another star appeared higher up against the <b>roof</b> <b>ridge,</b> the star she was looking for. But here the glass pane before her eyes became presently dim with moisture; she was obliged to rub it out with her handkerchief; yet, somehow, it soon became clouded, at which she turned sharply away and went to bed.|$|E

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the barn swallow is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, preferably with nearby water. This swallow avoids heavily wooded or precipitous areas and densely built-up locations. The presence of accessible open structures such as barns, stables, or culverts to provide nesting sites, and exposed locations such as wires, <b>roof</b> <b>ridges</b> or bare branches for perching, are also important in the bird's selection of its breeding range.|$|R
5|$|The stable was {{designed}} by McKim, Mead & White and built in the late 19th century using the same yellow brick used for the main residence. The stable is {{two and a half}} stories high, 29 bays wide, and 5bays deep, and it has a gable roof covered with asbestos shingles that replaced its original ceramic tile. On the <b>roof's</b> <b>ridge</b> sits a shallow monitor, flanked by two taller octangular monitors with louvered ventilating elements and bell-cast copper roofs.|$|R
