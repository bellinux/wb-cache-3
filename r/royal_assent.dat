5|$|<b>Royal</b> <b>Assent,</b> UK Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Under the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> Act 1967, <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> can {{be granted}} by the {{sovereign}} in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly {{for the purpose of}} receiving the notice of <b>royal</b> <b>assent.</b> The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> in writing under the 1967 Act ("... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...").|$|E
5|$|In 2011, campaigners {{against a}} law that sought {{to reduce the number}} of {{senators}} in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse the equivalent of the <b>royal</b> <b>assent.</b> An Order in Council of 13 July 2011 established new rules for the consideration of petitions against the granting of the equivalent of the <b>royal</b> <b>assent.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the {{traditional}} ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long {{after it had}} been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived {{as part of a}} string of acts intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent realm, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> personally in the United Kingdom. Under the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately (the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent),</b> was brought into force. As the act also provides, <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed. However, the act provides that a grant of <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ {{the traditional}} ceremony where required.|$|E
5|$|In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is {{required}} {{as well as}} <b>royal</b> <b>assent.</b> In other monarchies—such as Sweden—the government officially promulgates laws. In both cases, however, the process of <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> is usually a formality, whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Royal</b> <b>assent</b> is {{sometimes}} associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> has been granted {{at a ceremony}} held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament {{of his or her}} agreement to the bill.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} procedure enabling an Act {{to come into}} force {{at the same moment}} as the receipt of the equivalent of the <b>royal</b> <b>assent,</b> when it is being announced at an ordinary sitting of the Tynwald, subject to its being promulgated within 12 months, was introduced in 1916; since 1988, this has been the normal procedure, but an Act ceases to have effect unless promulgated within 18 months after the equivalent of the <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> is announced in the Tynwald.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> by Commission Act of 1541 became law, assent {{was always}} {{required}} to be given by the sovereign in person before Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-13 is The 2006 Canadian federal budget, which {{received}} <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> in the Senate on June 22, 2006.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December 2009, the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 {{received}} the <b>royal</b> <b>assent.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Royal</b> <b>assent</b> or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{last time}} <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> {{was given by}} the {{sovereign}} in person was in the reign of Queen Victoria at a prorogation on 12 August 1854.|$|E
5|$|Under section 14 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, a {{bill which}} has been {{approved}} by the Northern Ireland Assembly is presented to the Queen by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> after a four-week waiting period during which the Attorney General for Northern Ireland may refer the bill to the Supreme Court. Assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the Northern Ireland (<b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> to Bills) Order 1999.|$|E
5|$|When {{the act is}} assented to by the {{sovereign}} in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> is considered given {{at the moment when}} the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of <b>royal</b> <b>assent.</b> Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.|$|E
5|$|Between 1922 and 1972, bills {{passed by}} the Parliament of Northern Ireland were passed to the Governor of Northern Ireland for <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> under the Government of Ireland Act of 1920, {{replacing}} the office of Lord Lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-288, {{an act of}} the {{opposition}} parties {{to try to make}} the government support its global climate change obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. It received <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> on June 22, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In certain republican constitutions, <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> has {{developed}} into {{the possibility of}} a presidential veto, such as in the United States of America or in several European countries.|$|E
5|$|Special {{procedures}} {{apply to}} legislation {{passed by the}} Tynwald of the Isle of Man. Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, {{the equivalent of the}} <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{repealed}} {{and replaced}} by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> Act of 1967. However section 1(2) of that Act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring assent in person {{if he or she}} so desires.|$|E
5|$|The Third Report of the Law Reform Committee {{recommended}} changing this system, and the Occupiers' Liability Bill {{was given}} its second reading on 6 March 1957 by Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, the Solicitor-General, and the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> on 6 June 1957.|$|E
5|$|The bills {{received}} <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> as the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act, 1902 and the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1902 on 8 August 1902, {{and as the}} Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway Act, 1902 on 18 November 1902.|$|E
5|$|Under the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 {{a measure}} of the General Synod of the Church of England becomes law once it has {{received}} <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> {{in the same way as}} an Act of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|When {{the media}} asked King Juan Carlos {{if he would}} sign the bill that was being debated in the Cortes Generales, he {{answered}} {{that he was the}} King of Spain, not of Belgiuma reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. For the King to withhold his <b>royal</b> <b>assent,</b> it would effect a veto of the legislation. However, the King gave his <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005, and the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. The King received criticism by Carlist and other far right conservatives for signing the legislation.|$|E
5|$|A motion {{passed by}} the {{opposition}} parties (161 for to 115 against) on February 5, 2007 to reaffirm Canada's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. The motion may not have any legal effect, but it is related to Bill C-288 – which received <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> on June 22, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{bill passed}} by the {{legislative}} Houses can become law, the <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> (the monarch's approval) is required. In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.|$|E
5|$|For the 1904 Parliamentary session, the BS bill sought {{permission}} to add new stations at Lambeth, Regent's Park and Edgware Road. The new stations were permitted by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1904 given <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> on 22 July 1904.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November 1922, the LER {{announced}} {{a bill for}} the 1923 parliamentary session. It included the proposal to extend the line from its southern terminus to the C's station at Kennington where an interchange would be provided. The bill received <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> as the London Electric Railway Act, 1923 on 2 August 1923.|$|E
5|$|The Paddington {{extension}} {{was aligned}} {{to allow a}} westward extension to continue to Royal Oak or Willesden, areas already served by the MR, which again opposed the plans. This time, the BS was successful and <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> for the extensions was granted in the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1900 on 6 August 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Privileges Committee {{unanimously}} {{found that}} the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent,</b> and from 1999, hereditary peers {{have not had the}} automatic right to sit in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{governors of}} the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick and Islands of Guernsey do not by and {{under their own}} authority grant assent, nor, as proxies, as the British crown's representative, deliver <b>royal</b> <b>assent,</b> to legislation emulating from the respective legislatures of these islands.|$|E
5|$|Though the act won easy {{passage through}} the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen {{reserved}} <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, {{the court found that}} it was unconstitutional, and it never became law.|$|E
5|$|A future {{roll-out}} {{of small}} scale DAB multiplexes would be performed {{with a number}} of DAB frequency blocks, subject to business users migrating away from those frequencies and also subject to Parliamentary approval through the Broadcasting (Radio Multiplex Services) Bill 2016-17 which gained <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> on April 27, 2017. This should allow at least one multiplex {{in most parts of the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, an Order in Council {{delegated}} to {{the lieutenant governor}} the power to grant <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> to bills passed by Tynwald. The lieutenant governor must however refer any bill impacting on reserved powers (defence, foreign relations, nationality law, {{the relationship between the}} island and the United Kingdom and any matters relating to the monarch) to the British government for advice, on which he is required to act.|$|E
5|$|In most circumstances, {{in order}} to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then {{promulgate}}d by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor is similar to the <b>Royal</b> <b>Assent</b> in some other nations; however, the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is merely a formality.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} after the E {{received}} <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> for its route from Edgware to Hampstead, the company continued to search for finance and revised its plans in conjunction both with the CCE and a third railway company, the Watford & Edgware Railway (W) which had {{plans to build a}} line linking the E to Watford.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{from the}} Met to extend south from Paddington to South Kensington and east from Moorgate to Tower Hill were {{accepted}} and received <b>royal</b> <b>assent</b> on 29 July 1864. To complete the circuit, the committee encouraged the amalgamation of two schemes via different routes between Kensington and the City, and a combined proposal {{under the name}} Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District railway) was agreed on the same day.|$|E
