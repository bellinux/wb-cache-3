5000|$|Phytotrons unified and {{extended}} earlier piecemeal efforts to claim {{total control of}} the whole environment. In both walk-in rooms and smaller <b>reach-in</b> cabinets, phytotrons produced and reproduced whole complex climates of many variables. In the first phytotrons each individual room was held at a constant unique temperature. The Australian phytotron, for example, had rooms maintaining 9°C, 12°C, 16°C, 20°C, 23°C, 26°C, 30°C, 34°C. Because {{some of the earliest}} controlled environment experiments showed that plants reacted differently in daytime temperatures and nighttime temperatures, the first experiments to observe the effect(s) of varying the daytime versus the nighttime temperature saw experimenters move their plants from higher to lower temperatures {{over the course of a}} daily, or any other variable or constant, routine. This rendered the variable “temperature” experimentally controllable. Even a brute force approach that tested each successive environmental variable and every variety of plant would serve to pinpoint specific environmental conditions to maximize growth. Expecting that more knowledge would surely come from greater technology, the next generation of phytotrons expanded in technological reach, in their ranges of environmental variables, and also in the degree of control over each variable. The phytotron in Stockholm offered a humidity controlled room and a custom built computer, as well as a low temperature room that extended the temperature range down to -25°C for the study of Nordic forests. After that, phytotron technology compressed whole environments into smaller cabinets able to be set to any desired combination of environmental conditions, which are still in use today.|$|E
50|$|On August 30, 2007, Zolman {{played a}} key role in the waning moments of the Phoenix Mercury's {{controversial}} victory over the Silver Stars in Game 1 of the WNBA Western Conference Finals. After Becky Hammon hit a three-point shot to tie the game with approximately three seconds left in regulation, Phoenix attempted to drive for a final basket. Phoenix guard Cappie Pondexter fell to the floor in the backcourt under defensive pressure from Zolman. Zolman was called for a <b>reach-in</b> foul with 2.1 seconds remaining, and in turn Pondexter made two free throws and Phoenix won the game, 102-100. ESPN announcers and many fans questioned the call, because video footage arguably indicated that Pondexter had merely slipped and Zolman had committed no foul. Additionally, the replay also showed that Shanna's jab step toward Pondexter is what caused Cappie to falter, and since there wasn't any contact made, the correct call should have been a traveling violation on Phoenix; in effect, a great defensive play by Shanna Zolman. Mercury fans, however, felt the call was appropriate. While most objective fans consider it to be one of the worst calls in WNBA history. The head official reviewed the call to determine how much time remained on the clock, but WNBA rules do not permit instant replay review of whether a foul was committed. At the post game press conference, Hammon stated that Zolman did nothing wrong and that the officials made a mistake. Lost in all this, is that Zolman came within an eyelash of sinking a 75-foot shot at the buzzer to make the issue moot. But, it bounced off the rim. Determined to make good, Shanna came out of the gate sizzling hot in Game 2, scoring 17 first half points including 5 three pointers.

40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} decreasing indoor ambient relative humidity on the performance and energy use of four different types of refrigerated display cases commonly used in supermarkets. A correlation was established between decreasing indoor relative humidity and eleven key parameters. Results of the study indicate {{that there is a}} direct relation between the indoor relative humidity and the weight of moisture removed from the air during the process of refrigeration. Open vertical meat and dairy fixtures demonstrated more vulnerability to humidity variations, and removed more moisture from the air, than the coffin and <b>reach-in</b> units. Decreasing indoor relative humidity had an immediate impact on the latent load of all fixtures. The effect of latent load reduction, as a result of lowering indoor humidity, was reflected directly on the evaporator coil load and consequently the power consumption of the test compressor. The study also provides important quantification of the impact of reduced indoor relative humidity on the length of time required for <b>reach-in</b> freezer door fogging to be cleared. Lowering the relative humidity from 50 % to 35 % resulted in 69. 2 % reduction in fog recovery time. It is recommended that store designers and operators reexamine HVAC and refrigerated display case designs to obtain economic benefits from the effects of reducing humidity through HVAC systems and optimizing energy use and demand.

40|$|Background: Despite {{a number}} of studies {{addressing}} uptake of health check-up, very few studies were conducted to assess two screening regimes with one served on institution basis and the other on out-reaching basis from aspect of geographical and socio-demographic inequality in accessing to health check-up. Aims: The current study aimed to assess whether two screening regimes complement each other in terms of coverage rate and explore whether geographical or socio-demographic inequality exists and how socio-demographic features affect uptake of two screening regimes. Methods: Study population was based on 198, 834 residents from an urban-rural-aboriginal mixed type area, Nantou County, located in central Taiwan. Data on uptake of two health check-up programs, one featured by <b>reach-in</b> service and one featured by out-reaching service, and socio-demographic variables were collected. Coverage rate for the combination of two screening regimes was calculated by two age cohorts and the overlapping rate between the two regimes was also calculated. The association between socio-demographic variables and uptake of each screening regime or both was assessed by logistic regression model with adjustment for health status and severity of health. The independence of two screening regimes given socio-demographic variables was also evaluated. Results: For the young cohort, the overall coverage rate was 8. 65 % for AHPS only with 10. 5 % for female and 6. 8 % for male. The NCIS gives an incremental 6. 1 % of coverage rate to AHPS. Attendant involved in both program was only 1. 4 %. For the elderly cohort, the overall coverage rate was 21. 9 % for AHPS only with 22 % for female and 21. 8 % for male. The NCIS adds an incremental 6. 2 % of coverage rate to AHPS. Attendant involved in both program was only 3. 8 %. The overlapping rate was small. Of total of 28, 140 attenders in the AHPS, only approximately 2. 04 % (4, 049) re-attend NCIS. After interaction assessment, gender difference in uptake of two screening regimes was modified by place of residence. After being stratified by place of residence and gender, all socio-demographic variables were statistically related to uptake of each or both of screening regimes after controlling for health status and the severity of health. For the elderly cohort, there was lacking of interaction terms between any of two variables and the main effects of all socio-demographic variables were statistically significant. For the part of independence of two screening regimes, all socio-demographic variables, medical utilization, and the severity of health made additional 14. 13 % contribution to uptake of outreaching service given uptake of <b>reach-in</b> service for the elderly cohort whereas the corresponding figure was 37. 64 % for the young cohort. Conclusions: The present study compared two health check-up programs, <b>reach-in</b> service and out-reaching service, to assess geographic and socio-demographic inequality in uptake of two programs. Although out-reaching service did not substantially enhance the absolute coverage rate of <b>reach-in</b> service two programs complement each other in solving geographic and socio-demographic inequality in uptake of preventive services.

40|$|The {{substantial}} efficiency improvements {{which have}} been realized in residential refrigerators over {{the last twenty years}} due to implementation of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act and changing consumer reactions to energy savings give an indication of the potential for improvement in the commercial sector, where few such efficiency improvements have been made to date. The purchase decision for commercial refrigerators is still focused primarily on first cost and product performance issues such as maximizing storage capacity, quick pulldown, durability, and reliability. The project applied techniques used extensively to reduce energy use in residential refrigeration to a commercial <b>reach-in</b> refrigerator. The results will also be applicable to other commercial refrigeration equipment, such as refrigerated vending machines, <b>reach-in</b> freezers, beverage merchandisers, etc. The project described in this paper was a collaboration involving the Appliance and Building Technology Sector of TIAX, the Delfield Company, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Building Technologies. Funding was provided by DOE through Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 41000. The program plan and schedule were structured to assure successful integration of the TIAX work on development of efficient design concepts into Delfield's simultaneous development of the Vantage product line. The energy-saving design options evaluated as part of the development included brushless DC and PSC fan motors, high-efficiency compressors, variable-speed compressor technology, cabinet thermal improvement (particularly in the face frame area), increased insulation thickness, a trap for the condensate line, improved insulation, reduced-wattage antisweat heaters, non-electric antisweat heating, off-cycle defrost termination, rifled heat exchanger tubing, and system optimization (selection of heat exchangers, fans, and subcooling, superheat, and suction temperatures for efficient operation). The project started with a thorough evaluation of the baseline Delfield Model 6051 two-door <b>reach-in</b> refrigerator. Performance testing was done to establish a performance baseline which, to meet end-users requirements, would have to be met or exceeded by the high-efficiency refrigerator design. Energy testing was done to establish the baseline energy use. Diagnostic testing such as reverse heat leak testing and insulation conductivity testing was done to evaluate factors contributing to the cabinet load and energy use. Modeling was done to assess the energy savings potential of the energy saving design options. Discussion with vendors and cost modeling was done to assess the manufacturing cost impact of the options. Based on this work, the following group of design options was selected for incorporation in the final refrigerator design: (1) Brushless DC evaporator fans; (2) Improved face frame design; (3) Reduced antisweat heater wattage; (4) Condensate line trap; and (5) Optimized refrigeration system. There was no net cost premium associated with these design changes, leading to a high-efficiency design requiring no payback of any initial additional investment. Delfield incorporated these design options in the Vantage line design and built a first prototype, which was tested at TIAX. Additional design changes were implemented in the transition to manufacturing, based in part on results of initial prototype testing, and a pilot production unit was sent to TIAX for final testing. The energy use of the pilot production unit was 68 % less than that of the baseline refrigerator when tested according to the ASHRAE 117 Energy Test Standard. The energy test results for the baseline refrigerator and the two new-design units is shown in Figure ES- 1 below. The resulting energy consumption is well below Energy Star and proposed Canadian and California standards levels.

Foliage fresh and dry weights increased with increased CO 2 up to 800 micromoles mol- 1, but declined at 1200 micromoles mol- 1. The number and the fresh and dry weights of pods also increased with increasing CO 2 concentration. However, the yield of immature pods was not significantly influenced by increased CO 2. Total seed yield increased 33 % from ambient to 800 micromoles mol- 1 CO 2, and 4 % from 800 to 1200 micromoles mol- 1 CO 2. Harvest index increased with increasing CO 2. Branch length increased while specific leaf area decreased linearly as CO 2 increased from ambient to 1200 micromoles mol- 1.

40|$|Deictic pointing—pointing {{at things}} during conversations—is natural and {{ubiquitous}} in human communication. Deictic pointing {{is important in}} the real world; it is also important in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) because CVEs are 3 D virtual environments that resemble the real world. CVEs connect people from different locations, allowing them to communicate and collaborate remotely. However, the interaction and communication capabilities of CVEs are not as good as those in the real world. In CVEs, people interact with each other using avatars (the visual representations of users). One problem of avatars is that they are not expressive enough when compare to what we can do in the real world. In particular, deictic pointing has many limitations and is not well supported. This dissertation focuses on improving the expressiveness of distant pointing—where referents are out of <b>reach—in</b> desktop CVEs. This is done by developing a framework that guides the design and development of pointing techniques; by identifying important aspects of distant pointing through observation of how people point at distant referents in the real world; by designing, implementing, and evaluating distant-pointing techniques; and by providing a set of guidelines for the design of distant pointing in desktop CVEs. The evaluations of distant-pointing techniques examine whether pointing without extra visual effects (natural pointing) has sufficient accuracy; whether people can control free arm movement (free pointing) along with other avatar actions; and whether free and natural pointing are useful and valuable in desktop CVEs. Overall, this research provides better support for deictic pointing in CVEs by improving the expressiveness of distant pointing. With better pointing support, gestural communication can be more effective and can ultimately enhance the primary function of CVEs—supporting distributed collaboration...|$|E

40|$|While {{developments}} in the law of insider trading usually attract significant scholarly interest, far less {{attention has been paid}} to the design and effects of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s complementary Regulation Fair Disclosure. Yet, this Article argues that the SEC’s current quandaries relating to insider trading enforcement are largely self-inflicted and could have been avoided if it had better aligned its Reg. FD with the Supreme Court’s insider trading jurisprudence. Introduced sixteen years ago to prevent senior officers of public firms from leaking material information to preferred investors and financial analysts, Reg. FD was designed to function as a backstop for undesirable favoritism that insider trading law, as developed by the Supreme Court, could not <b>reach—in</b> particular, the situation where a corporate manager divulges valuable information to a preferred investor not for any obvious personal benefit (which would trigger insider trading law) but for the ostensible benefit of the firm. This Article analyzes Reg. FD through the lens of private investor meetings—personal conversations between corporate managers and investors they select—to find that Reg. FD should not be expected to deter selective disclosure. The regulation was disjointed from the outset and professional market participants rationally appear to have taken advantage of its permissive design to obtain preferential access to inside information. For example, through one recently introduced service offering, “corporate access,” selected investors spend billions of dollars on private access to corporate managers in return for the opportunity to lawfully trade on valuable information before it is released to the public. This Article argues that the design of Reg. FD causes undesirable effects and that the SEC should redraft the regulation to follow the Supreme Court’s classification of corporate information as firm property. The SEC could then regulate selective disclosures as transactions in this property that require public disclosure, similar to how insiders must report their personal transactions in firm stock. By increasing transparency to inform investors of selective disclosure events, concerns recently expressed by the SEC and the Department of Justice relating to insider trading enforcement could be alleviated and their requests for Supreme Court intervention in insider trading law reconsidered...|$|E
40|$|Supermarkets {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} energy-intensive building groups in the commercial sector, consuming 2 to 3 million kWh/yr per store (ES- 1). Over half of this energy use is for the refrigeration of food display cases and storage coolers. Display cases are used throughout a supermarket for the merchandising of perishable food products. The cases are maintained at air temperatures ranging from - 10 to 35 F, depending upon the type of product stored. The operating characteristics and energy requirements of the refrigeration system are directly related to the refrigeration load. The sources of the display case refrigeration load consist of: (1) Moist and warm air infiltration through the open front of the case [...] air curtains are employed to inhibit this infiltration, but some ambient air is entrained, which adds a substantial portion to the refrigeration load. (2) Heat conduction through case panels and walls. (3) Thermal radiation from the ambient to the product and display case interior. (4) Internal thermal loads [...] the use of lights, evaporator fans, periodic defrosts, and antisweat heaters adds to the refrigeration load of the display case as well as directly consuming electric energy. The impact of each of these elements on the refrigeration load is very dependent upon case type (Figure ES- 1). For example, air infiltration is the most significant portion of the refrigeration load for open, multi-deck cases, while radiation is the largest part of the load for tub-type cases. The door anti-sweat heaters represent a major share of the refrigeration load for frozen food door <b>reach-in</b> cases. Figure ES- 2 shows the distribution of display cases in a typical supermarket (ES- 2). Open, multi-deck, medium temperature display cases typically comprise about half of the refrigerated fixtures in a store (ES- 3). In addition, medium temperature fixtures and storage coolers account for roughly 70 to 75 percent of the total store refrigeration load with open, multi-deck cases contributing about 3 / 4 of that fraction. Consequently, the focus of this investigation has tilted toward the open, vertical, multi-deck medium temperature case type. Various technologies and control methods are energy efficiency measures (EEMs) that could be applied to display cases and result in the reduction of the refrigeration load and of the energy consumption of the supermarket refrigeration system. An extensive evaluation of the EEMs was conducted in order to select those that met the following criteria: (1) Near-term implementation [...] All EEMs considered could be implemented with existing refrigeration hardware and technology. (2) Potential for energy-efficiency improvements [...] Energy savings and/or refrigeration load reduction must be obtained by the implementation of the EEM. (3) Enhancement of the ability to maintain target product temperature [...] Proper operation of the display case and maintenance of the stored product temperature could not be compromised by the use of the EEM. The energy impact of a number of viable display case EEMs was quantified by performing whole building hourly simulations. A special version of the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE- 2. 3) program was used to develop a model of a supermarket. The model was then calibrated using available end-use monitored data to increase confidence in simulation results...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 200 years, the Earth's {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration {{has increased by}} more than 35 %, and climate experts predict that CO 2 levels may double {{by the end of this}} century. Understanding the mechanisms of resource management in plants is fundamental for predicting how plants will respond to the increase in atmospheric CO 2. Plant productivity sustains life on Earth and is a principal component of the planet's system that regulates atmospheric CO 2 concentration. As such, one of the central goals of plant science is to understand the regulatory mechanisms of plant growth in a changing environment. Short-lived positron-emitting radiotracer techniques provide time-dependent data that are critical for developing models of metabolite transport and resource distribution in plants and their microenvironments. To better understand the effects of environmental changes on resource transport and allocation in plants, we have developed a system for real-time measurements of metabolite transport in plants using short-lived positron-emitting radiotracers. This thesis project includes the design, construction, and demonstration of the capabilities of this system for performing real-time measurements of metabolite transport in plants. The short-lived radiotracer system described in this dissertation takes advantage of the combined capabilities and close proximity of two research facilities at Duke University: the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) and the Duke University Phytotron, which are separated by approximately 100 meters. The short-lived positron-emitting radioisotopes are generated using the 10 -MV tandem Van de Graaff accelerator located in the main TUNL building, which provides the capability of producing short-lived positron-emitting isotopes such as carbon- 11 (11 C; 20 minute half-life), nitrogen- 13 (13 N; 10 minute half-life), fluorine- 18 (18 F; 110 minute half-life), and oxygen- 15 (15 O; 2 minute half-life). The radioisotopes may be introduced to plants as biologically active molecules such as 11 CO 2, 13 NO 3 -, 18 F - -[H 2 O], and H 2 15 O. Plants for these studies are grown in controlled-environment chambers at the Phytotron. The chambers offer an array of control for temperature, humidity, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and light intensity. Additionally, the Phytotron houses one large <b>reach-in</b> growth chamber that is dedicated to this project for radioisotope labeling measurements. There are several important properties of short-lived positron-emitting radiotracers that make them well suited for use in investigating metabolite transport in plants. First, because the molecular mass of a radioisotope-tagged compound is only minutely different from the corresponding stable compound, radiotracer substances should be metabolized and transported in plants the same as their non-radioactive counterparts. Second, because the relatively high energy gamma rays emitted from electron-positron annihilation are attenuated very little by plant tissue, the real-time distribution of a radiotracer can be measured in vivo in plants. Finally, the short radioactive half-lives of these isotopes allow for repeat measurements on the same plant in a short period of time. For example, in studies of short-term environmental changes on plant metabolite dynamics, a single plant can be labeled multiple times to measure its responses to different environmental conditions. Also, different short-lived radiotracers can be applied to the same plant over a short period of time to investigate the transport and allocation of various metabolites. This newly developed system provides the capabilities for production of 11 CO 2 at TUNL, transfer of the 11 CO 2 gas from the target area at TUNL to a radiation-shielded cryogenic trap at the Phytotron, labeling of photoassimilates with 11 C, and in vivo gamma-ray detection for real-time measurements of the radiotracer distribution in small plants. The experimental techniques and instrumentation that enabled the quantitative biological studies reported in this thesis were developed through a series of experiments made at TUNL and the Phytotron. Collimated single detectors and coincidence counting techniques were used to monitor the radiotracer distribution on a coarse spatial scale. Additionally, a prototype Versatile Imager for Positron Emitting Radiotracers (VIPER) was built to provide the capability of measuring radiotracer distributions in plants with high spatial resolution (~ 2. 5 mm). This device enables detailed quantification of real-time metabolite dynamics on fine spatial scales. The full capabilities of this radiotracer system were utilized in an investigation of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration and root nutrient availability on the transport and allocation of recently fixed carbon, including that released from the roots via exudation or respiration, in two grass species. The 11 CO 2 gas was introduced to a leaf on the plants grown at either ambient or elevated atmospheric CO 2. Two sequential measurements were performed per day on each plant: a control nutrient solution labeling immediately followed by labeling with a 10 -fold increase or decrease in nutrient concentration. The real-time distribution of 11 C-labeled photoassimilate was measured in vivo throughout the plant and root environment. This measurement resulted in the first observation of a rapid plant response to short-term changes in nutrient availability via correlated changes in the photoassimilate allocation to root exudates. Our data indicated that root exudation was consistently enhanced at lower nutrient concentrations. Also, we found that elevated atmospheric CO 2 increased the velocity of photoassimilate transport throughout the plant, enhanced root exudation in an annual crop grass, and reduced root exudation in a perennial native grass.
