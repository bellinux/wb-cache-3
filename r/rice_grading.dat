40|$|Based on multi-spectral {{digital image}} texture feature, a new rapid and {{nondestructive}} method for discriminating rice categories was put forward. The new method combined {{the advantages of}} wavelet packet and support vector machine (SVM). In the present study, the images which are 1 036 pixels in vertical direction by 1 384 pixels in horizontal direction with 24 -bit depth were captured using a red (R) waveband, near infrared (NIR) waveband and green (G) waveband multi-spectral digital imager. The three wavebands of image (red, green and NIR) can be composed into one image which contains more information than images captured by ordinary digital cameras, and the NIR image can catch more information than visible spectrum. NIR waveband images were decomposed to 16 subbands using three wavelet packet multi-resolution. Because the main feature of texture information is concentrated on the middle frequency, the 8 subbands of middle frequency were selected to calculate entropy, and the entropy of three wavebands of original image was calculated at the same time. Eighty images (twenty for each category) were used for calibration set and eighty images (twenty for each category) were used as the prediction set. Then the rice categories were classified by SVM. The classification rate of rice categories was only 93. 75 % using the entropy of original image, but reached 100 % by wavelet packet decomposition. The overall {{results show that the}} technique combining wavelet packet and support vector machine can be efficiently utilized for texture recognition of multi-spectra, and is an effective and simple technique for discriminating the rice categories.

40|$|Gelatinization is the {{irreversible}} melting {{process of}} starch. It is an endothermic process, and the peak temperature at which starch absorbs heat is called gelatinization temperature (GT). GT {{is one of}} the key traits measured in breeding programs in rice. It is important because it affects the texture of cooked rice and it is said to be related to the cooking time of rice. Given the number of times that rice is cooked in the world every day, selecting rice varieties with low GT represents huge potential savings in fuel consumption. There are several ways to measure GT. The most common method is alkali spreading value (ASV), for which the degree of disintegration of milled <b>rice</b> is <b>graded</b> after immersion in potassium hydroxide for 24 hours. A more modern assay is by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This detects the peak temperature absorbed by the flour-water mixture during gelatinization and is thus more precise than ASV. GT has been linked to starch synthse IIa (SSIIa) in numerous studies (Nakamura et al 2002).

40|$|The {{topic of}} online product quality {{inspection}} (OPQI) with smart visual sensors is attracting increasing interest {{in both the}} academic and industrial communities {{on account of the}} natural connection between the visual appearance of products with their underlying qualities. Visual images captured from granulated products (GPs), e. g., cereal products, fabric textiles, are comprised {{of a large number of}} independent particles or stochastically stacking locally homogeneous fragments, whose analysis and understanding remains challenging. A method of image statistical modeling-based OPQI for GP quality grading and monitoring by a Weibull distribution(WD) model with a semi-supervised learning classifier is presented. WD-model parameters (WD-MPs) of GP images’ spatial structures, obtained with omnidirectional Gaussian derivative filtering (OGDF), which were demonstrated theoretically to obey a specific WD model of integral form, were extracted as the visual features. Then, a co-training-style semi-supervised classifier algorithm, named COSC-Boosting, was exploited for semi-supervised GP quality grading, by integrating two independent classifiers with complementary nature in the face of scarce labeled samples. Effectiveness of the proposed OPQI method was verified and compared in the field of automated <b>rice</b> quality <b>grading</b> with commonly-used methods and showed superior performance, which lays a foundation for the quality control of GP on assembly lines...|$|R
40|$|Thai rice {{is favored}} by {{large numbers of}} {{consumers}} of all continents because of its excellent taste, fragrant aroma and fine texture. Among all Thai rice varieties, Thai Hommali rice is the most preferred. Classification of rice as premium quality requires that almost all grain kernels of the rice be perfectly whole with only a small quantity of foreign particles. Of all the foreign particles found in rice, rice weevils can wreck severest havoc on {{the quality and quantity}} of rice such that premium <b>grade</b> <b>rice</b> is transformed into low <b>grade</b> <b>rice.</b> It is widely known that rice millers adopt the "overdose" fumigation practice to control the birth and propagation of rice weevils, the practice of which inevitably gives rise to pesticide residues on rice which end up in the body of consumers. However, if population concentration of rice weevils could be approximated, right amounts of chemicals for fumigation would be applied and thereby no overdose is required. The objective of this study is thus to estimate the quantity of rice weevils in both milled rice and brown rice of Thai Hommali rice variety using the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique. Fourier transforms near infrared (FT-NIR) spectrometer was used in this research and the near-infrared wavelength range was 780 – 2500 nm. A total of 20 levels of rice weevil infestation with an increment of 10 from 10 to 200 mature rice weevils were applied to 1680 rice samples. The spectral data and quantity of weevils are analyzed by partial least square regression (PLSR) to establish the model for prediction. The results show that the model is able to estimate the quantity of weevils in milled Hommali rice and brown Hommali rice with high R_ val^ 2 of 0. 96 and 0. 90, high RPD of 6. 07 and 3. 26 and small bias of 2. 93 and 2. 94, respectively...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{are nearly}} 1000 rice {{landrace}} varieties in the Taihu basin, China. To assess the genetic {{diversity of the}} rice, 24 intragenic molecular markers (representing 17 starch synthesis-related genes) were investigated in 115 Taihu basin rice landraces and 87 improved cultivars simultaneously. The {{results show that the}} average genetic diversity and polymorphism information content values of the landraces were higher than those of improved cultivars. In total, 41 and 39 allele combinations (of the 17 genes) were derived from the landraces and improved cultivars, respectively; only two identical allele combinations were found between the two rice variety sources. Cluster analysis, based on the molecular markers, revealed that the rice varieties could be subdivided into five groups and, within these, the japonica improved rice and japonica landrace rice varieties were in two separate groups. According to the quality reference criteria to classify the <b>rice</b> into <b>grades,</b> some of the landraces were found to perform well, in terms of starch quality. For example, according to NY/T 595 - 2002 criteria from the Ministry of Agriculture of China, 25 and 33 landraces reached grade 1, in terms of their apparent amylose content and gel consistency. The varieties that had outstanding quality could be used as breeding materials for rice quality breeding programs in the future.

Despite considerable rice-growing potential, lack of water control systems, access to improved seeds, agrochemicals and appropriate mechanization have resulted in modest production growth rates, unable to alter the region's dependency on imported rice. Governments aim to boost production with import duties and input subsidies. However, questions remain as to whether these policies enable the rice sector to respond to changing consumers preferences for high <b>grade</b> <b>rice</b> and to contribute to national economic growth. We present the results from a Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) on rice production in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Niger and under three water management systems: irrigation (public scheme), supplemented rain-fed (rainfall aided by autonomously-sourced water supplies) and purely rain-fed. Our results show that policy interventions in these West African countries (i. e., input subsidies and import taxes) did not significantly enhance the profitability of rice production to farmers due {{to the effect of}} market failures (limited capital access and non-competitive market for rice) and the low quality of local milled rice.

30|$|With India being a major {{petroleum}} importing country, {{the choice}} of feedstock for production of biodiesel within the geographical region is an economical viable option, as approximately 60 – 70  % of biodiesel cost is attributed to raw material (Demirbas 2007; Phan and Phan 2008). Higher Free Fatty Acid (FFA) crude rice bran oil {{is one of the}} potential sources for production of biodiesel (Balat 2011; Ju and Vali 2005). It is extracted from rice bran which is a byproduct of rice processing industry (Kusum et al. 2011). Crude rice bran oil having lower FFA is used for production of edible <b>grade</b> <b>rice</b> bran oil. India ranks among the leading rice producing countries in the world and is capable of producing around 6 million tonnes of oil. Current production capacity is limited to 0.4 million tonnes, half of it being from edible grade and rest being with higher FFA which is left unutilized (Kusum et al. 2011). For higher FFA content oils esterfication is carried out in two stages. Firstly an acid catalyzed esterification followed by an alkali catalyzed trans-esterification is adopted (Gerpen 2005; Leung et al. 2010; Canakci and Gerpen 2001; Ramadhas et al. 2005). Thus as a low cost feedstock, the unutilized rice bran oil can be used for biodiesel production and used as an alternative cheap and environmental friendly fuel in India.|$|R

This objective is important because of the demand for high quality rice by consumers, the necessity of enhancing Japan’s international competitive power, and a declining trend {{in the production of}} first <b>grade</b> <b>rice.</b> To achieve stable yield and quality, it is important to control panicle number appropriately since it is a primary factor to determine rice yield and quality. In this study, a multiple linear regression model was built to predict panicle number, which can support the decision–making process of farmers in agricultural practice. Surveys of 33 paddy fields were conducted in the Fukuoka Prefecture in 2010 − 2011. Data regarding influential factors on panicle number, such as solar radiation, water temperature, and exchangeable ammo–nium (eNH 4) content in the soil, were collected and used for building the model as candidates of the explanatory variable. As the results, eNH 4 content in the soil at the beginning of tillering stage and accumulated amount of daily solar radiation during the tillering stage were selected as explanatory variables.

The study was based on survey conducted from April 2004 to March 2005 at three-rice market centers representing a village market (Pasar Inpres) in Subang, district capital market (Pasar Johar) in Karawang, and rice center market (Pasar Induk Cipinang) in Jakarta, respectively. Parameters evaluated were changes in the quality and price of rice over time. The quality of the rice at each market was sampled monthly from two traders consisting three samples each. The <b>rice</b> quality was <b>graded</b> using existing local standar, i. e. grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3, and the price of each grade was recorded. The physical qualities of the rice samples such as moisture content, grain dimensions, percentage of whole kernels, grain color, and impurities/dockage (foreign matters, unhulled grains, and milled rice) were determined by ISO 950 : 1979 (for cereals-sampling as grain). Whereas the chemical qualities such as amylose and gelatinization were analyzed using Rapid Visco Analisis. The study showed that rice quality varied, most of them were long and slender kernels, chalkiness ranged between 10 - 20 % (scale 5), and head rice around 69 - 84 %. The amylose content was intermediate (20 - 21 %), the gelatinization temperature was high-intermediate (70 - 74 oC), and the gel consistency was soft (65 - 70). The quality incentive, defined as the additional return assuming the quality level can be raised from grade 3 to grade 1, was up to Rp 700 kg- 1 (~ 25 %).
