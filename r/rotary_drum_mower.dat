5000|$|There {{are three}} types of mowers: sickle bar mowers, disc <b>mowers,</b> and <b>drum</b> <b>mowers.</b> Sickle bar mowers use a {{reciprocating}} blade to cut the grass and typically use a reel to fold the grass over the knife. Disc mowers {{have a number of}} hubs across the cutting width, each hub having a small (18") rotating disc with knives. <b>Drum</b> <b>mowers</b> use two or three large plates (called the drums, about 36" [...] across) which ride over the ground as they are spinning. A sickle bar mower's main advantage over disc <b>mowers</b> and <b>drum</b> <b>mowers</b> is the reduced horsepower requirements. Its disadvantage is the extra maintenance required due to the high number of moving parts and wear items. Disc mowers were historically considered an [...] "all the eggs in one basket" [...] kind of mower because all the mower hubs were in one large gearbox. If one blade hit something and a gear tooth broke, the whole gearbox would suffer a catastrophic failure, and there would be nothing worth fixing. If anything broke, everything broke. <b>Drum</b> <b>mowers</b> prevented this by having typically two belt-driven drums compared to six or more gear-driven hubs. Modern disc mowers use isolated gearboxes, and if one fails it can be swapped out without rebuilding the entire machine.|$|R

30|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>drum</b> {{composting}} is {{an efficient}} and promising technology compared to conventional outdoor {{technologies such as}} windrows and static piles, as it provides adequate agitation, aeration and proper compost mixing to produce consistent and uniform end product without any nuisance odor or leachate-related problems (Kalamdhad et al. 2009; Rodríguez et al. 2012). Different types of wastes (cattle manure, swine manure, municipal biosolids, brewery sludge, chicken manure, animal mortalities and food residues) can be effectively composted in <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> reactors (Vuorinen and Saharinen 1997; Mohee and Mudhoo 2005; Aboulam et al. 2006; Kalamdhad and Kazmi 2008; Rodríguez et al. 2012).

40|$|Abstract <b>Rotary</b> <b>drums</b> {{can show}} {{different}} granular flow regimes each one {{with its own}} specific flow behavior, which increase the complexity in their study. The way particles move inside the <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> {{is directly related to}} the mass and energy transfer rates, and consequently to the process performance. Thus, an experimental investigation regarding the transition between different flow regimes inside a <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> was carried out in the present work. To the best of our knowledge, the hysteresis phenomenon was observed for the first time in the transition between cataracting-centrifuging regimes, which was shown to be dependent on the physical properties of the particles such as sphericity, density and particle-wall friction coefficient. A new expression for the centrifuging critical rotation speed was proposed in this work...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on the {{speciation}} of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Cr) during <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> composting of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) {{for a period of}} 20 days. Five different proportions of cattle manure, water hyacinth and sawdust were prepared for composting. This study concluded that, <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> was very efficient for the degradation of organic matter {{as well as for the}} reduction of mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals during water hyacinth composting. The results from the sequential extraction procedure of heavy metals shows that <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> composting changed the distribution of five fractions of Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Cr. The highest reduction in the bioavailability factors of Pb and Cd was observed during the process. The total concen-tration of Cu, Cr, and Cd was very low compared to the other metals (Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Pb); however, the percentage of exchangeable and carbonate fractions of these metals was similar to other metals. These results confirmed that the bioavailability of metals does not depend on the total concentration of metals. From this study, it can be concluded that the addition of an appropriate proportion of cattle manure significantly reduced the mobile and easily available fractions (exchangeable and carbonate fractions) during water hyacinth composting in <b>rotary</b> <b>drum...</b>|$|R

30|$|For <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> composting, a waste {{mixture of}} 150  kg with water hyacinth, cow dung and sawdust were {{prepared}} {{in the proportion}} of 6 : 3 : 1, respectively. The physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, volatile solids and the electrical conductivity were analyzed to detect the compost quality. Pb, Ni, Zn, and Cd were investigated for total heavy metals, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and water solubility tests.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model was built {{and used to}} show the motion of particles in a cascade <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> dryer. In a cascade <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> the flights pick up the particles {{at a number of}} points in {{the lower half of the}} drum while, in the upper half, the particles fall freely. A model is derived where the drag force exerted on the particles throughout the falling period is emphasised. The motion of the particles in a <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> is described by three actions: Cascade; Kiln and Bouncing. In this study a horizontal <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> was used where both the kiln and bouncing actions have minimal effect, therefore, the focus is on the cascade motion of the particles. A characteristic of the model is the 'falling number' which is found to be dependent on the curtain properties. The model has demonstrated its ability to predict the effect of many important parameters such as drying medium velocity, drum rotation speed, particle size and feeding flow rate. It has been shown that increasing the drying medium velocity by 2. 5 times results in an 85 % decrease in the residence time. Also, the number of falling is shown to be limited and a function of the drum rotation speed, in this case 0. 59 falling per second. An important feature of this model is the ability to predict the mean resident time, contact time interval and the resting time interval. The maximum error between the predicted and the measured data was < 10 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{treatment}} has played prominent roles in bioremediation of wastes and contaminants. Composting {{is one of}} the biological process that has been considered {{to be one of the}} most suitable ways of converting organic wastes into products that are beneficial for plant growth. The study of the bio-composting process by solid-state bioconversion utilizing palm oil mill effluent (POME) and empty fruit bunch (EFB) were studied in lab scale. From the study it is found that horizontal <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> bioreactor was the most suitable to run this study. In this project, four filamentous fungi were used; (i) Phanerochaete chrysosporium. (ii) Trichoderma harzianum. (iii) Aspergillus niger. (iv) Penicillium sp. The bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials by evaluating the C/N ratio and other parameters using horizontal <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> bioreactor were studied. The good and mature of the compost is reflected by C/N ratio, germination index and glucosamine assay. The result showed that the C/N ratio drop from days 10 onwards and in the range of 25 to 30. The germination indexes of 50 to 70 % indicate that the compost produce was a phyto toxic-free product and merely achieved as mature compost. The composting period required to complete this process was two months. Thus, this study developed an effective and feasible composting technique of POME and EFB using horizontal <b>rotary</b> <b>drum</b> bioreactor by solid state bioconversion process...|$|R

30|$|Composting is the {{biological}} decomposition {{of organic matter}} involving the transformation and mineralization of the organic matter, leading to a stabilized final product with pathogen free and other humic properties (Zucconi et al. 1987).

It also reduces {{the volume of the}} mass and destructs weed seeds and pathogenic microorganism (Bernala et al. 2009).
