5|$|The {{ending of}} Redemption varies {{depending}} upon on {{the quantity of}} humanity Christof has retained during the game. If the quantity is great, Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns her into a vampire, sparing her from death. If his humanity is moderate, he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka. A lesser quantity of humanity results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood. Greatly empowered, Christof forsakes his humanity, murders Anezka, and <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> his new power.|$|E
5|$|Twilight {{finds herself}} in the long-forgotten crystal caves beneath Canterlot. An image of Cadance appears and taunts her, {{explaining}} that the marriage will continue without Twilight's interference. Using her magic to shatter a crystal wall, Twilight finds another Cadance waiting there, but the mare is bruised and battered. Twilight attacks her, but the weary alicorn proves {{that she is the}} real Cadance by demonstrating their shared rhyme from their youth. Cadance explains she was abducted by the impostor in the castle to marry Shining Armor herself. The two then work together to escape the caves and try to stop the wedding. Meanwhile, the fake Cadance <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> her victory, secretly plotting against Shining Armor and the others ("This Day Aria").|$|E
5|$|As {{he builds}} this army to attack Superior Spider-Man, Norman {{takes on the}} new alias of the Goblin King. The Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive at the sewers and join up with Goblin King's Goblin Underground. The group <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> the news that, thanks to Superior Spider-Man's assault, the Goblin King now owns over the half of New York's {{organized}} crime. He claims he now owns New York City as the Goblin Kingpin of Crime. With the help of Menace, the Goblin King later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport, and upgrades Urich's Goblin armor and weapons. Goblin King asks in return only that Urich dedicate his only identity from here on as the Goblin Knight. Goblin King trains Goblin Knight, anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. Goblin King later poses as Hobgoblin and is sighted {{by some of the}} Spiderlings.|$|E
60|$|She {{was sure}} to come at last, and touch him. Then he burst into flame for her, and lost himself. They looked at each other, a deep laugh {{at the bottom of}} their eyes, and he went to take of her again, wholesale, mad to <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> the inexhaustible wealth of her, to bury himself in the depths of her in an inexhaustible exploration, she all the while <b>revelling</b> <b>in</b> that he <b>revelled</b> <b>in</b> her, tossed all her secrets aside and plunged to that which was secret to her as well, whilst she quivered with fear and the last anguish of delight.|$|R

5|$|The {{accounting}} department features Angela Martin, an admitted uptight and hypocritical woman {{who wishes to}} keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as serious as possible; Kevin Malone, a lovable, but dim-witted man who <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> juvenile humor and frequently indulges himself with gambling and M and Oscar Martinez is intelligent but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and Hispanic heritage made him a favorite target for Michael's unintentional off-color comments. Rounding out the office are the stern salesman Stanley Hudson, who barely stood for Michael's constant references to his Black-American heritage (he also doesn't like {{to take part in}} time wasting meetings and sometimes sleeps in them or works on crossword puzzles); eccentric quality assurance representative Creed Bratton; the kind and caring saleswoman Phyllis Lapin-Vance, who marries Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration across the hall from the office; Andy Bernard is a salesman introduced in season three after the closing of the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin and the merging of the two; the bubbly and talkative customer service representative Kelly Kapoor; the promiscuous alcoholic supply relations representative Meredith Palmer; human resources representative Toby Flenderson, who is admittedly hated by, and often the target of abuse by Michael Scott; warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin; Warehouse dock worker and Pam's ex-fiancé Roy Anderson, who was fired in the third season; and Michael's former love interest and former Vice President for Regional Sales for Dunder Mifflin Jan Levinson (Jan Levinson-Gould until her divorce in season 2).|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} principle may be {{the specific}} allotment in Jewish worship of a particular mode to each sacred occasion, because of some esthetic appropriateness felt to underlie the association. In contrast to the meager modal choice of modern melody, the synagogal tradition <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> the possession of scale-forms preserved from the remote past, much as are to be perceived in the plain-song of the Catholic, the Byzantine, and the Armenian churches, as well as Hungarian, Roma, Persian and Arab sources.|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{calendar}} incorporated {{elements of}} existing practice and dominated the social life of communities. Fairs {{were held at}} Whitsun and Martinmas, at which people traded, married, moved house and conducted other public business. The mid-Winter season of Yule involved two weeks of <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> which even the clergy joined in. The feast of Corpus Christi, focused {{on the body of}} Christ and held in June, grew in importance throughout the period. The central occasion of the Christian calendar was Easter. It was preceded by the 40 days of fasting of Lent, during which preachers urged full confession, which took place in church aisles to by priests and friars. It cumulated in Easter Sunday, when most parishioners received their annual communion.|$|E

25|$|Venus <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> {{having the}} girl under her power, and turns Psyche {{over to her}} two handmaids, Worry and Sadness, to be whipped and tortured. Venus tears her clothes and bashes her head into the ground, and mocks her for conceiving {{a child in a}} sham marriage. The goddess then throws before her a great mass of mixed wheat, barley, poppyseed, chickpeas, lentils, and beans, {{demanding}} that she sort them into separate heaps by dawn. But when Venus withdraws to attend a wedding feast, a kind ant takes pity on Psyche, and assembles a fleet of insects to accomplish the task. Venus is furious when she returns drunk from the feast, and only tosses Psyche a crust of bread. At this point in the story, it is revealed that Cupid is also in the house of Venus, languishing from his injury.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{sentencing}} of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between {{the reading of the}} sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl (Karoline Herfurth) selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.|$|E

500|$|Ed, Edd n Eddy {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Cornelius of DVD Talk considered the Eds to be child equivalents of The Three Stooges, believing that [...] "the series <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> {{the sort of}} frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily." [...] Cornelius also wrote that the [...] "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated." ...|$|E
500|$|Menken and Slater {{deliberately}} wrote [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] in {{the style}} of an old-fashioned Broadway musical number after directors Byron Howard and Nathan Greno specifically asked that they provide the film with one. Musically, [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] directly contrasts with the more pop-oriented singer-songwriter style of Rapunzel's songs, which are performed by pop singer Mandy Moore. A Tony Award-winning Broadway performer, Murphy recorded [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] by envisioning Gothel as a person who <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> the spotlight and enjoys being the center of attention.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, {{the studio}} and {{producer}} Wendy Finerman sought a director. Out of many candidates with experience in comedy, David Frankel was hired despite his limited experience, having only made one feature, Miami Rhapsody, along with some episodes of Sex and the City and Entourage. He was unsure about the property, calling it [...] "undirectable ... a satire rather than a love story." [...] Later, he cited Unzipped, the 1995 documentary about designer Isaac Mizrahi, as his model for the film's attitude towards fashion: [...] " [...] <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> some of the silliness of the fashion world, but is also very serious." ...|$|E

As Esther gains popularity and submits to numerous acts of peer pressure [...] including attacking a girl from her old school [...] her friendship with Sunni starts to deteriorate. [...] At her old school, meanwhile, her classmates have been led to believe that she was chosen for an elite social experiment, and when she returns she is treated like royalty.|$|E
500|$|Leng compares [...] "Sunshine Life for Me" [...] with [...] "The Pirate Song", a sea shanty {{written by}} Harrison and comedian Eric Idle in 1975, in which Harrison sings {{of wanting to}} be a pirate rather than a celebrity. Theologian Dale Allison views the track {{as an example of how}} its composer's work [...] "often <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> the natural world". According to Allison, the same [...] "easy romanticism about nature" [...] returns in [...] "Blow Away" [...] and songs from Gone Troppo (1982), while also {{contrasting}} with the [...] "ecological anxiety" [...] Harrison expresses in tracks such as [...] "Tears of the World", [...] "Cockamamie Business" [...] and the Monty Python-influenced [...] "Save the World".|$|E
500|$|While {{some critics}} have tended to view the film as {{perfectly}} straightforward, and even criticize its overarching themes as [...] "the stuff of torpid platitudes," [...] online discussion has been much more positive. Heated debate has centered on the ambiguity of the ending, with many critics like Devin Faraci making {{the case that the}} film is self-referential and tongue-in-cheek, both a film about film-making and a dream about dreams. Other critics read Inception as Christian allegory and focus on the film's use of religious and water symbolism. Yet other critics, such as Kristin Thompson, see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling, highlighting Inception as a new form of narrative that <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> [...] "continuous exposition".|$|E

500|$|A {{decade after}} Bernstein premiered the work, Pierre Boulez, who had succeeded Bernstein as music {{director}} of the New York Philharmonic in 1971, conducted Connotations with the orchestra for the ten-year anniversary of Philharmonic Hall (subsequently renamed Avery Fisher Hall; later David Geffen Hall). According to Copland, ten years had allowed enough time to change audience perceptions for the better. In his review for The New York Times Harold C. Schonberg wrote that this time, the audience [...] "did not rise in revolt" [...] as it had in 1962. He added, [...] "The composer's cause was helped by, if memory serves, a better performance than had been given in 1962. Mr. Boulez <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> this kind of music, and he brought drama to it as well as a synthesizing quality." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{interest}} in female characters, Kon stated that female characters were easier to write {{because he is not}} able to know the character {{in the same way as}} a male character, and [...] "can project my obsession onto the characters and expand the aspects I want to describe." [...] With a frame of reference up to Tokyo Godfathers, Susan J. Napier notes that while the theme of performance is the one obvious commonality in his works, she finds that the concept of the male gaze is the more important topic for discussion. Napier shows the evolution of Kon's use of the gaze from its restrictive and negative aspects in Magnetic Rose and Perfect Blue, to a collaborative gaze in Millennium Actress before arriving at a new type of gaze in Tokyo Godfathers which <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> uncertainty and illusion.|$|E
500|$|... "The Bells of Saint John" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{but several}} critics felt underwhelmed by the story. Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode four-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars. He was positive towards the visual style and the plot, {{as well as the}} performances of Smith, Coleman, and Imrie. [...] A Radio Times reviewer was pleased that Coleman was playing Clara as a straightforward companion, and highlighted her chemistry with Smith. He described it as [...] "a hugely enjoyable episode that <b>revels</b> <b>in</b> its modern London setting", praising the way its ideas were realised visually on-screen. MSN's Hilary Wardle gave [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] episode four out of five stars, noting that it moved at a fast pace and the plot was similar to [...] "The Idiot's Lantern" [...] (2006) but was [...] "very well done".
