40|$|Rapid {{expansion}} of e-commerce, along with rising domestic and cross-border payments, has fueled the demand among financial institutions for a cost-effective means to expedite {{clearing and settlement}} of low-value <b>retail</b> <b>payments.</b> These are called faster payments settlement systems. Traditionally, <b>retail</b> <b>payments</b> have made extensive use of interbank netting systems, in which payments are accumulated for end-of-day settlement. This approach, known as deferred net settlement (DNS), reduces the liquidity needs of the payment system, but bears inherent operational and financial risks for unsettled intraday payments. As large dollar volumes of <b>retail</b> <b>payments</b> accumulate, real-time gross settlement (RTGS) has been recognized as an attractive option, especially for high-value payments. It permits immediate settlement of transactions during the day, but it brings up other risks and incentives issues that require consideration. This research proposes a hybrid faster payments settlement system involving elements of both DNS and RTGS. We explore a mechanism that supports centralized queuing, permits payment prioritization, reduces payment delays, enhances liquidity, and optimizes the settlement process. We offer a modeling framework and experimental simulations to evaluate the proposed approach. Our evaluation {{is based on a}} set of system performance conjectures that support operational performance evaluation and mechanism design-related policy insights.

40|$|The European banking {{industry}} {{joined forces to}} achieve a fully integrated market for <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> services in the euro area: the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Against this background, the present paper examines the fundamental relationship between <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> business and overall bank performance. Using data from across 27 European markets over the period 2000 - 07, we analyse whether the provisions of <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> services are reflected in improved bank performance, using accounting ratios and efficiency measures. The results confirm that the performance of banks in countries with more developed <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> service markets is better. This relationship is stronger in countries with a relatively high adoption of <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> transaction technologies. <b>Retail</b> <b>payment</b> transaction technology itself can also improve bank performance, and evidence shows that heterogeneity in <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> instruments is associated with enhanced bank performance. Similarly, a higher usage of electronic <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> instruments seems to stimulate banking business. We also show that <b>retail</b> <b>payment</b> services have a more significant impact on savings and cooperative bank performance although they have {{a positive influence on}} the performance of commercial banks. Additionally, findings reveal that impact of retail services on bank performance is dominated by fee income. Finally, an effective payment service market is found to be associated with higher bank stability. Our findings are robust to different regression specifications. The results may also be informative for the industry when reconsidering its business models in the light of current financial market developments.

40|$|The <b>retail</b> <b>payments</b> {{system in}} the United States has changed {{significantly}} in recent years. Advances in technology have caused a greater reliance on electronic payment networks. And the industrial structure of the payment services industry has evolved, {{as more and more}} nonbanks deliver payment products to end users and supply back-end processing. In general, these changes have made the payments system more efficient and given more choices to consumers and more payment options to merchants and businesses.; At the same time, however, the rapid pace of change has introduced new risks to the payments system. First, as more and more banks market payment services to nonbanks and outsource payments processing, the differences in information possessed by payments participants can magnify difficulties in managing risk. Second, electronic payments have a significantly different risk profile than paper checks. Third, greater complexity of the payments network potentially reduces incentives to manage risk and may cause difficulties in coordinating risk mitigation.; Sullivan lays the groundwork for a dialogue on policy to control risk in the U. S. <b>retail</b> <b>payments</b> system. He concludes that a thorough review of supervisory authority relevant to <b>retail</b> <b>payments</b> would be valuable. In particular, the original authority to supervise nonbank payment processors was established over 40 years ago, when the primary reason for establishing that authority was the use of computer technology applied to bank accounting systems.
