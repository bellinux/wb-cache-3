40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we make a}} {{comparison}} between two management strategies of hydroelectric power plan consisting of multi-reservoirs. The first strategy is base on the maximization of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>contents</b> {{at the end of}} the exploitation horizon. The second strategy is base on the maximization of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>contents</b> {{at the end of the}} sub-periods of the same exploitation horizon. To solve such problem, we propose a new objective function model which permits to minimize the use of water. This model is based on the enhancement of the water value in function of its location in any reservoirs of the system and of the waterfall height. Hence, the objective function is represented in function of the water potential energy stored in all reservoirs...|$|R

The Moss and Gilroy (1980) method estimates the standard error of the annual discharge by using information contained in the periodic discharge measurements made at a streamflow-gaging station and was modified to be more site-specific and reflective of actual conditions during the year of interest. The two main improvements are using only discharge measurements pertinent to the year of interest rather than all discharge measurements, and using a semivariogram to estimate three discharge-uncertainty parameters: measurement variance, process variance, and the one-day serial correlation coefficient of the discharge-rating residuals. The new method for estimating the standard error of the annual change in <b>reservoir</b> <b>content</b> uses the standard error of the two reservoir stage readings and the corresponding reservoir surface areas for the readings...|$|R

Use of these gauges will help reduce the need for chemical based extractions. Effective use of the gauges depends on the accurate preparation and transfer of project mix calibrations from the Central Lab to the Districts. The objective of this project was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of a gauge in determining asphalt contents and to develop a mix calibration transfer procedure for implementation during the 1987 construction. The first part of the study was accomplished by preparing mix calibrations in the Central Lab gauge and taking multiple measurements of a sample with known asphalt content. The second part was accomplished by preparing transfer pans, obtaining count data on the pans using each gauge, and transferring calibrations from one gauge to another through the use of calibration transfer equations. The transferred calibrations were tested by measuring samples with a known asphalt content.

40|$|Essay I {{examines}} the market efficiency {{issues at the}} Nord Pool power exchange in the September 1995 – July 2002 period. A unique characteristic of this electricity exchange is the high hydropower proportion in the traded electricity; water in the hydro reservoir acting as hydropower inventory therefore {{plays an important role}} in the pricing of electricity. Inventory holding and the seasonality of both the supply and demand of hydropower generate inter- and intra-year autocorrelation in power prices. I present a theoretical discussion on why power price persistence invalidates the applicability of a market efficiency concept based on the random walk theory. To lend support for the theoretical argument, I conduct an empirical investigation consisting of various unit roots and cointegration methods to tackle the data problems/properties, and results show that weekly spot and futures prices are cointegrated. Philips-Loretan’s nonlinear least square is applied in testing the restriction of the coefficient according to the market efficiency hypothesis. The Wald statistic shows that the cointegration vector being (1, - 1) is not binding. Residual testing using a Ljung-Box Q-statistic confirms serial correlation. These findings are consistent with the theoretical prediction. Essay II models electricity prices in the context of the Nord Pool power exchange which has a considerable proportion of hydropower supply. Since hydropower is storable in a producer perspective and the system price is a uniform price for all sources of electricity supply, the applicability of the rational expectation competitive commodity storage model to characterize the spot and futures/forward prices is validated. I further show the nonlinearity between futures/forward prices and water <b>reservoir</b> <b>content</b> as inventory. I perform a BDS test (a test for nonlinearity), Hsieh’s third-order moment test (a test that discriminates between different types of nonlinearities) and a nonlinear causality test to portray the nonlinear relationship using short/long maturities contracts. Empirical evidence shows that futures/forward prices are nonlinearly connected with water <b>reservoir</b> <b>content</b> via variance changes, and that the detection of causality varies as maturities change from short to long. These findings provide strong support for the credibility of the arbitrage argument and in a certain case verify the existence of the non-arbitrage condition. Essay III investigates convenience yield behavior at the Nord Pool power exchange given the considerable storable hydropower being traded. Several hypotheses are tested concerning the behavior and determinants of convenience yield from holding hydropower as inventory. The results reveal that 1) convenience yield has a negative relationship with hydro <b>reservoir</b> <b>content</b> as inventory, 2) convenience yield behavior can be statistically explained within a standard financial call option framework and the call option component can explain a large portion of variability in convenience yield, 3) convenience yield varies on both a yearly and a monthly basis, and 4) there is an asymmetry of volatility of convenience yield during high/low hydro inventory periods...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The long-distance {{behaviour}} of N = 1 supersymmetric field theories {{is believed}} to unravel {{a new kind of}} duality 1. Two theories described in the ultraviolet by different <b>gauge</b> <b>contents</b> and <b>gauge</b> groups flow in the infrared towards the same fixed point of the renormalization group.

The gist of this relationship is better understood in terms of the dual pair of moduli spaces. In general the scalar potential of a supersymmetric gauge theory comprises two terms known as the D- and F -terms. The possible supersymmetric vacua are labelled by the vanishing of both the D- and F -terms. The locus of the scalar fields where the scalar potential vanishes is the moduli space.
