5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1962 ADAC {{announced}} the retirement of their motor-bike-sidecar combinations which would be replaced by 40 appropriately equipped Volkswagen Beetles. [...] Equipment on the new cars included a flashing <b>roof-light,</b> repair tools, a radio-based communication device, compressed air canisters, a spade and broom set, and a basic [...] "doctor-kit" [...] incorporating blood-plasma.|$|E
50|$|A {{bus network}} - Covibus - covers all the urban area {{as well as}} the {{outskirts}} of the city making it easy to travel both within and outside the city limits, although the time between buses is big (not less than 1 hour). Several bus lines serve university buildings. Cabs are also an option. They are painted cream (mostly black these days) and sometimes have a <b>roof-light</b> to identify them. In town they use taximeters, but once outside urban boundaries the service is charged per km.|$|E
5000|$|Cruachan {{features}} {{heavily in}} the Ulster Cycle {{as it was the}} home of one of its chief characters Queen Medb. She had been given the kingdom of Connacht by her High-King father Eochaid Feidlech who had de-throned the previous king Tindi Mac Conra over an act of treachery. It is unclear if Tindi had actually ruled the province from Cruachan or if had been built by/for Medb. Another story states that Cruachan had been ruled by the queen's sister, Clothru, before Medb herself had her killed. Vivid descriptions of the Western capital are given in Fled Bricrenn ("Bricriu's Feast"), and this one in Táin Bó Fraích: [...] "Of pine the house was made; it is a covering of shingle it had externally. There were sixteen windows in the house, and a frame of brass, to each of them; a tie of brass across the <b>roof-light.</b> Four beams of brass on the apartment of Ailill and Medb, adorned all with bronze, and it in the exact centre of the house. Two rails of silver around it under gilding. In the front a wand of silver that reached the middle rafters of the house. The house was encircled all round from the door to the other." [...] Cruachan features at the start and end of the Táin Bó Cúailgne with the pillow talk in the royal residence, and concluding with the fight of the bulls, supposed to have taken place at Rath na dTarbh, one of the largest ring-forts on the site. Aside from the Ulster tales there are not many mythical descriptions of Connacht's main fort with one of the best examples occurring in a Dindshenchas poem on Carn Fráich. This poem deals with two figures of this name, one being the Fráech of Medb's time and one who was a Connacht prince preceding Irelands division into Conn's and Eoghan's half, with this section of the poem describing Cruachan as a stone-built fortress.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 {{renovation}} {{was supported}} with conservation advice and funding from English Heritage and with {{grants from the}} Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council England. The project added seven layers of soundproofing to the roof, reinstated the glazed <b>roof-lights,</b> and added the steel and glass New Wing which curves around {{the north side of}} the main building, to house the box office, bar and café, an art gallery foyer and offices.|$|R
50|$|Roofs are {{generally}} finished in plain clay tiles with {{extensive use of}} patent glazed <b>roof-lights</b> and ridge lights in the single storey sections. The roof of the Engine House is pitched at around 45 degrees, and is half-hipped at its northern and southern ends. Doors and window frames are in painted softwood. Despite the missing chimney, and some external alterations, the building is still an imposing piece of Victorian industrial architecture.The Marine Engine House is to be repaired and refurbished with further plans for it to become an education and learning centre for visitors to the reserve.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Rhyndarra stable {{is located}} {{to the northwest}} of the house, separated from it by Heritage Close. This brick structure has a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof with a lean-to addition at the northeast end. The building has been adaptively reused as a private residence, with sleeping areas to the loft level and living and bedroom areas to the ground level. <b>Roof-lights</b> have been added, and an internal staircase constructed. A single-storeyed addition has been constructed to the south comprising living, kitchen and bathroom areas. The adaptive reuse has retained a strong visual connection between the stable and the villa.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} extension adds {{a further}} single storey element {{to the front}} elevation creating approximately 20sq/m of new space, the eaves are low which result in a steep cat-slide roof with a roof hip which begins just below the nave entablature. The design shows four windows and 2 heritage style <b>roof-lights.</b> The architects artistic renders show an extension which extends beyond the Nave wall by approximately 1.5 metres, and has a door with a carved white stone frame. Previous to this proposed extension, {{there was a small}} stable building attached in the same area, though this was of a far smaller scale, with a much lower roof hip, and of a lesser architectural quality. It also extended only as far as the nave flank wall. It was demolished in the 1960s due to it being structurally unsound.|$|R
