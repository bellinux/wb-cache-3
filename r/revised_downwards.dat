5|$|Released in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2011, The King's Speech {{was a major}} {{box office}} and {{critical}} success. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later <b>revised</b> <b>downwards</b> after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of £8million, it earned over £250million internationally ($400 million). It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance; his Golden Globe Award for Best Actor was the sole win at that ceremony from seven nominations. The King's Speech won seven British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Actor (Firth), Best Supporting Actor (Rush), and Best Supporting Actress (Helena Bonham Carter).

Based on a detailed narrative of tax changes in Germany covering 40 years of fiscal adjustments, we define and exploit the exogenous variation of tax bills to quantify the effect of tax changes on firm future investment plans {{as well as on}} realized investment. We find that firms in the manufacturing sector <b>revise</b> <b>downwards</b> their planned investment by about 4 % subsequently to a tax increase equal to 1 % of the value added in the total manufacturing industry. On the contrary realized investment growth drops by around 8 % at impact. Furthermore we find that income and consumption taxes are most harmful to investment and that firms base their investment plans considering laws currently under discussion, anticipating future tax changes. Not taking into account this anticipation effect would lead to strongly biased estimates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the determinants of}} macroeconomic forecasts (budget balance, public debt and real GDP growth), of {{the governments of the}} 15 EU countries. We have used the forecasts of the Stability and Convergence Programmes submitted between 1998 / 99 and 2008 / 09 and the European Commission’s. Results show that, in general, economic growth forecasts submitted by European governments are more optimistic than those published by the European Commission. The lack of accuracy of government forecasts is due to “misinformation” regarding the economic situation {{at the time of their}} publication. The differences between observed and forecast changes of budget balance and public debt are explained by the output growth forecast errors and the forecasts of the changes in the two fiscal indicators. These forecast changes tend to <b>revise</b> <b>downwards</b> the changes submitted in the previous Program. Therefore, the governments’ “bad intention” seems to result from their lack of commitment to the objectives of previous programs and it explains the recurrent delays in the implementation of their fiscal consolidation plans...|$|R

25|$|In 1994, Judy Massare {{concluded}} that ichthyosaurs {{had been the}} fastest marine reptiles. Their length/depth ratio was between three and five, the optimal number to minimise water resistance or drag. Their smooth skin and streamlined bodies prevented excessive turbulence. Their hydrodynamic efficiency, {{the degree to which}} energy is converted into a forward movement, would approach that of dolphins and measure about 0.8. Ichthyosaurs would be a fifth faster than plesiosaurs, though half of the difference was explained by assuming a 30% higher metabolism for ichthyosaurs. Together, within Massare's model these effects resulted in a cruising speed of slightly less than five kilometres per hour. However, in 2002, Motani corrected certain mistakes in Massare's formulae and revised the estimated cruising speed to less than two kilometres per hour, somewhat below that of modern Cetacea. However, as the speeds estimated for plesiosaurs and mosasaurids were also <b>revised</b> <b>downwards,</b> ichthyosaurs maintained their relative position.|$|E

40|$|The European Forecasting Network (EFN) is a {{research}} group of European institutions, founded in 2001 {{under the auspices of}} the European Commission. This is the Third Report of the European Forecasting Network on the Euro area. Although on each occasion we started at the pessimistic end of the spectrum of forecasters, we are yet again <b>revising</b> <b>downwards</b> our forecasts for 2002 and 2003. Growth of 0. 8 % in 2002 will be followed by only 1. 2 % in 2003 and 2. 1 % in 2004. This anaemic recovery from the downturn in 2001 has been exacerbated by a series of negative shocks including rising oil prices and the considerable uncertainty about the prospects of the Iraq war that have depressed consumption, investment and world trade. Moreover, the pre-occupation with a ceiling for the inflation rate of 2 % has meant that the ECB has had to be rather cautious in its policy choices. The effects of the mildly expansionary monetary policy are balanced by the behaviour of unit labour costs and the output gap. Overall, our forecast for HICP inflation is 2. 4 % for 2003 and 1. 8 % for 2004, not too far from the recent years’ average of 1. 9 %. A target of 2 % in the HICP with a symmetric error margin of plus or minus 1 % would have allowed the ECB to be more relaxed in its setting of monetary policy and to give greater weight to short run movements of output...|$|R

As Edward Wente of the University of Chicago noted on page 276 of his JNES 35(1976) Book Review of Kitchen's study of the Third Intermediate Period, there is [...] "no certainty" [...] that Shoshenq's 925 BC campaign terminated just prior to this king's death a year later in 924 BC. The English Egyptologist, Morris Bierbrier also dated Shoshenq I's accession [...] "between 945–940 BC" [...] in his seminal 1975 book concerning the genealogies of Egyptian officials who served during the late New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period. Bierbrier based his opinion on Biblical evidence collated by W. Albright in a BASOR 130 paper. This development would also account for the mostly unfinished state of decorations of Shoshenq's building projects at the Great Temple of Karnak where only scenes of the king's Palestinian military campaign are fully carved. Building materials would first have had to be extracted and architectural planning performed for his great monumental projects here. Such activities usually took up to a year to complete before work was even begun. This would imply that Shoshenq I likely lived for a period in excess of one year after his 925 BC campaign. On the other hand, if the Karnak inscription was concurrent with Shoshenq's campaign into Canaan, {{the fact that it was}} left unfinished would suggest this campaign occurred in the last year of Shoshenq's reign. This possibility would also permit his 945 BC accession date to be slightly lowered to 943 BC.|$|E
40|$|The Minsk {{peace process}} {{that was set}} up to address the Ukraine crisis has had a bumpy ride from the start. The current {{conflict}} has its origins in the Kremlin’s reaction to the Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine: Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 and has orchestrated a war in the east of Donbas. In January 2017, some veterans of Ukraine’s volunteer battalions blockaded pro-Russian separatist-held territories in the eastern Donbas, the so-called ‘Donetsk People’s Republic’ (DPR) and ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’ (LPR). After unsuccessful attempts to disperse the veterans and activists blocking several checkpoints, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko gave in to increasing public support for the blockade and transformed a rogue operation into official Ukrainian government policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded with a decree to recognise certain personal identity documents issued by the breakaway ‘republics’, and separatists ‘nationalised’ Ukrainian companies in the eastern Donbas. These events have led the National Bank of Ukraine to <b>revise</b> <b>downwards</b> its previous economic growth forecast for 2017; indeed, the blockade poses a major challenge to companies located in both the eastern and western Donbas due to the interconnection of their production cycles. The blockade exposed the failure of the so-called ‘Rotterdam Plus’ formula − a new methodology for calculating wholesale market prices on electricity, intended to help Ukraine diversify its energy sector. But ultimately, argue the authors, the blockade by Kyiv, the recognition by Russia of the separatist republic’s identity documents, and the ‘nationalisation’ of Ukrainian companies in the eastern Donbas amount to yet another blow for the Minsk peace process. They conclude with recommendations for a more constructive way forward...|$|R

40|$|PPP-based {{national}} accounts {{have become an}} important part of the database for macroeconomists, development economists, and economic historians. Frequently used global data come from the Penn World Table (PWT) and the World Bank’s World Development Indicators; a substantial fraction of the world is also covered in the PPP accounts produced by the OECD and the European Union. This paper provides an overview of how these data are constructed, and discusses both the theory and the practical problems of implementing it. All of these data are underpinned by the International Comparison Program (ICP), which collects data on prices worldwide. The most recent round of the ICP was for 2005 with final results published in early 2008; version 7. 0 of the Penn World Table will soon incorporate these results. The 2005 ICP, like earlier rounds, involved substantial revisions to previous data, most notably <b>revising</b> <b>downwards</b> the size of the Chinese (40 percent smaller) and Indian (36 percent) economies. We discuss the reasons for the revisions, and assess their plausibility. We focus on four important areas: how to handle international differences in quality, the treatment of urban and rural areas of large countries such as China, India, and Brazil, how to estimate prices for government services, health, and education, and the effects of the regional structure of the ICP. All of these affect the interpretation of previous data, as well as the current revisions. We discuss previous revisions of the PWT, and their effects on various kinds of econometric analysis. The paper concludes with health warnings that should be kept in mind when using these data, which are not always suitable for the purposes to which they are put. Some international comparisons are close to impossible, even in theory, and in others, the practical difficulties make comparison exceedingly hazardous. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe tourism {{potential}} of India, {{especially in a}} global context, remains far from being realized. Towards realization of this potential, the Ministry of Tourism envisages a target of 12 % growth rate in inbound as well as domestic tourists for the 12 th Five Year Plan period. Therefore, {{in response to the}} needs of the industry, training providers have established a number of hotel, leisure, travel and tourism degrees. But past references have identified that hotel courses lack the rigor to provide quality manpower. Hotel management students seem to rate the value of their degrees higher than do employees in the. As such there always seem to be a bridge between what the hotel management students and the assumption of the hotel Industry. The Indian hotel Industry is likely to witness only a marginal revenue growth of about 7 % in 2012 - 13 with uncertain economy impacting demand, according to a study by rating agency ICRA. Visibility on the immediate term growth remains clouded with an uncertain economy impacting demand even as lumpy supply additions occur. ICRA <b>revises</b> <b>downwards</b> the revenue growth estimates to 5 - 7 %, with a seasonally stronger second-half partly compensating for the low operating margins in the first half. The hotel Industry hit new lows during the second quarter of 2012 - 13 with falling revenue per available room (RevPARs) and escalating power costs eroding the operating margins, which coupled with increase in fixed costs (interest and depreciation) resulted in many players posting net losses. World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) projects a moderate 2 - 4 % growth in international tourist volumes this year in view of the continued global uncertainties in Europe. In the present economic scenario, this study will benchmark effective teaching techniques to empower students to be managers in the Hotel Industry on successful graduation in a very competitive but stifled recruitment policy. This study will identify: (1) industry perception; (2) managerial employment competency components; and (3) managerial employability opportunities...|$|R

Authority is measured through a social ranking exercise identifying formal and moral leaders within the community.

Leadership effects are stronger when moral authority is made salient within the experiment, in line with the ethical nature of the decision under study.

40|$|This paper relaxes {{a single}} {{assumption}} {{in the standard}} matching framework, by allowing unemployed workers to be uncertain about their relative ability to find a job. This alternative assumption, which is supported by experimental evidence, implies that unsuccessful search induces individuals to <b>revise</b> their beliefs <b>downwards.</b> Once self-confidence is sufficiently low, workers become discouraged and give up on search. Without the need for shocks, this non-stationarity gives rise to structural flows from unemployment to non-participation in equilibrium. The hazard of moving from unemployment to employment declines with unemployment duration, due to erosion of self-confidence in search. Falling self-confidence also leads to equilibrium wages declining with unemployment duration, even with homogeneous productivity of workers. Individual search histories matter for confidence, so discouraged workers may not resume search even after a positive aggregate productivity shock.

Three experiments were conducted describing scenarios where profilers communicated a suspect's probability of guilt to the police. In the first study, a probability estimate is <b>revised</b> upwards or <b>downwards.</b> In the second one, the probability estimate of a speaker is higher or lower than that given by a previous speaker.

We conclude that verbal probability directionality has primarily an argumentative function, where positive phrases are selected when probabilities are contrasted with smaller p values, and negative when contrasted with higher p values...|$|R
