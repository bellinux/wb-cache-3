40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} failure of a <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> <b>shaft</b> of a {{passenger}} car. The shaft failed by brittle fracture across one of the four holes supporting the shaft into the cylinder head. The running distance of the engine just before failure was 40, 626 km. Visual examinations of etched sections of the failed shaft and a new one revealed four distinct zones of darker etching appearance. These zones correspond to the four locations where the rocker arms fit the shaft. Microscopic observations of the failed shaft revealed that the four dark-etching areas are surface hardened zones of martensitic microstructure. Furthermore, scanning the microstructure along the failed shaft showed that the heat treatment was so mistakenly extended by excessive heating so that the structure of the shaft near the supporting holes contains considerable content of martensite phase. This conclusion has been confirmed by the results of hardness measurements along the surface of the shaft. Microscopic investigations of the failed shaft revealed the presence of microcracks close to the supporting holes. These cracks may have been induced in the shaft by the non-uniform cooling during quenching in the course of heat treatment, or may be nucleated by repeated loading during service. This premature failure has occurred by the rapid crack propagation because of the lower fracture toughness of the martensite...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> <b>shaft,</b> main bearing cap, connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the nut runner has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the nut runner and which kind of screw joint that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.

5000|$|All of the D.III series were {{generally}} {{very similar to}} other models, {{with the exception of}} the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIaü. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then. The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> that operated the valves. Early models had square rocker boxes positioned directly over the cylinders with the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the tubular camshaft housing, and the now easily-sealable cylindrical <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> <b>shafts</b> protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, <b>rocker</b> boxes, <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] cam drive system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical [...] "slotless" [...] valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine.|$|R

5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Each exhaust valve on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and twelve secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> However, each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once.

50|$|The primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the {{oil pressure}} {{flowing from the}} exhaust rocker shaft into the primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> thereby locking both exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> together which are locked as a unit.

50|$|For {{car engines}} the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are {{generally}} steel stampings, providing a reasonable balance of strength, weight and economical cost. Because the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are, in part, reciprocating weight, excessive mass {{especially at the}} lever ends limits the engine's ability to reach high operating speeds. For this reason, aluminum is often used for high performance, aftermarket <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> for pushrod engines {{as well as many}} OEM <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> on OHC engines. Aluminum rockers on OHC engines often have a steel pad or roller where the cam contacts the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> in order to reduce wear. Truck engines (mostly diesel) use stronger and stiffer <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> made of cast iron (usually ductile), or forged carbon steel.|$|R
50|$|Advanced VTEC has a {{standard}} camshaft and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> attached as they normally are with camshaft overhead, and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> pushing {{down on the}} poppet valves. The camshaft {{is surrounded by a}} partially open drum which has secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> attached to it via a pivoting point. These secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> which have a varying depth profile (similar to cams), are directly actuated by the camshaft, in a scissor-like manner. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} with the J37A4 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009 Acura TL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and exhaust valves. The intake and exhaust rocker shafts contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> respectively. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the return spring. The term [...] "primary" [...] does not refer to which <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the valve down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, {{it refers to the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the rocker shaft.|$|R
50|$|Some {{overhead}} cam engines employ short <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> {{in which the}} cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> to open the valve. On this type of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> the fulcrum {{is at the end}} rather than the middle, while the cam acts on the middle of the arm. The opposite end opens the valve. These types of <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are particularly common on dual {{overhead cam}} motors, and are often used instead of direct tappets.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> finger, or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact, while pushrod engines use <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>Rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are actuated by a pushrod, and pivot on a shaft or individual ball studs in order to actuate the valves.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{the design}} {{aspects of the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> {{geometry}} has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information exchange to the valve which the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, {{often referred to as}} the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on valve tips, valve guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID-LIFT Patent set a new standard of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its [...] "mid-lift" [...] point of motion.|$|R

50|$|VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift {{intelligent}} system) (also sometimes denoted as VVT-iL or Variable Valve Timing and Intelligence with Lift) is {{an enhanced}} version of VVT-i that can alter valve lift (and duration) {{as well as}} valve timing. In {{the case of the}} 16 valve 2ZZ-GE, the engine head resembles a typical DOHC design, featuring separate cams for intake and exhaust and featuring two intake and two exhaust valves (four total) per cylinder. Unlike a conventional design, each camshaft has two lobes per cylinder, one optimized for lower rpm operation and one optimized for high rpm operation, with higher lift and longer duration. Each valve pair is controlled by one <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> which is operated by the camshaft. Each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> has a slipper follower mounted to the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with a spring, allowing the slipper-follower to freely move up and down with the high lobe without affecting the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> When the engine is operating below 6000-7000 rpm (dependent on year, car, and ECU installed), the lower lobe is operating the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> and thus the valves, and the slipper-follower is freewheeling next to the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> When the engine is operating above the lift engagement point, the ECU activates an oil pressure switch which pushes a sliding pin under the slipper-follower on each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> The <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is now locked into the slipper-follower's movements and thus follows the movement of the high rpm cam lobe and will operate with the high rpm cam profile until the pin is disengaged by the ECU. The lift system is similar in principle to Honda VTEC operation.|$|R
