40|$|Primate lentiviruses (PLV) from closely <b>related</b> primate <b>species</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} to be {{more closely related to}} each other than to PLV from more distantly <b>related</b> primate <b>species.</b> The current explanation for this observation is the codivergence hypothesis; that is, the divergence of a virus lineage results from the divergence of the host lineage. We show that, alternatively, frequent cross-species transmission of PLV, coupled with a tendency for more closely <b>related</b> primate <b>species</b> to exchange viruses "successfully," can result in apparent codivergence. This host-switching hypothesis reconciles several puzzling observations related to the evolution of PLV...|$|R

5|$|A 2007 {{field study}} that used {{molecular}} techniques to survey aquatic fungal taxa {{in a small}} springbrook in Valley Spring, Southern Ontario, Canada discovered many fungal taxa with high genetic affinity to Limnoperdon incarnatum, which suggests that a closely <b>related</b> <b>species</b> may also be common in streams.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption. Some <b>related</b> <b>species</b> such as Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the genus}} Cancer {{formerly}} included most crabs, {{it has since}} been restricted to eight species. Within that set of closely <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> the closest relative of C. pagurus is the Jonah crab, Cancer borealis, from {{the east coast of}} North America.|$|E

5|$|C.maenas is {{native to}} European and North African coasts {{as far as the}} Baltic Sea in the east, and Iceland and Central Norway in the north, {{and is one of the}} most common crabs {{throughout}} much of its range.

5|$|E. O. Wilson is an American biologist, specialising in {{the study}} of ants, social insects on which he is the world's leading expert. He is known also for his {{pioneering}} work on island biogeography, which <b>relates</b> <b>species</b> richness to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|R
5|$|In their 1963 {{monograph}} of the Hygrophorus of North America, American mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith classified H.agathosmus in the subsection Camarophylli, a {{grouping of}} <b>related</b> <b>species</b> {{characterized by a}} dry stem, {{and the absence of}} a gelatinous outer veil.|$|E
5|$|One <b>related</b> <b>species</b> {{has been}} described, Enhydra reevei, from the Pleistocene of East Anglia. The holotype, a lower carnassial, {{was in the}} Norwich Castle Museum but seems to be lost. Only one more specimen, an {{extremely}} worn lower carnassial, is known.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Hesler {{classified}} L.argillaceifolius in subgenus Tristes, in stirps Argillaceifolius. This {{grouping of}} <b>related</b> <b>species,</b> which includes L.fumaecolor, {{is characterized by}} the gelatinous cuticle of the stem.|$|E

5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely <b>related</b> <b>species</b> regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely <b>related</b> <b>species.</b> It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
