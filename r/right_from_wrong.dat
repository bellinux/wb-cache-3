5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong.</b> Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

25|$|Although the defense's expert {{testimony}} agreed that Yates was psychotic, Texas law requires that, {{in order to}} successfully assert the insanity defense, the defendant must prove {{that he or she}} could not discern <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> {{at the time of the}} crime. In March 2002, a jury rejected the insanity defense and found her guilty. Although the prosecution had sought the death penalty, the jury refused that option.

500|$|Churches of Christ are {{strongly}} anti-Calvinist in {{their understanding of}} salvation and generally present conversion as [...] "obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than {{as the result of}} an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion". Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin. There is no set [...] "age" [...] for this to occur; it is only when the child learns {{the difference between right and}} wrong that they are accountable (...)

It said [...] "more than 100 countries and international organisations [...] expressed explicit support of China's position opposing this year's peace prize." [...] However, according to the Nobel Committee, only the 65 countries with diplomatic missions were invited; acceptances had been received from 46 countries, including the previously non-committal India, while China and 19 others—Afghanistan, Algeria, Argentina, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tunisia, Venezuela and Vietnam—declined invitations to the award ceremony [...] "for various reasons". On {{the eve of the}} award ceremony, China continued the rhetoric against the Nobel Committee and the West. A spokesman said: [...] "We hope that those countries who have received invitations can tell <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> and uphold justice. It's not an issue of human rights. It's an issue of interfering in other countries' internal affairs"; the Nobel committee continued to be criticised for [...] "encouraging crime"; the Global Times repeated earlier suggestions that the award was a Western conspiracy against Beijing, a [...] "charge against China's ideology, aiming to undermine the benign surroundings for China's future development." ...|$|E
500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong,</b> but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E

2500|$|As {{assistant}} to Oliver Cromwell, Milton also {{took part in}} drafting a constitution of the Independents (Agreement of the People; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans {{as a consequence of}} democratic tendencies. In his Areopagitica, Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of freedom of speech– [...] "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong.</b> To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in [...] "a free and open encounter", and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.|$|E
2500|$|Repentance {{is also a}} {{prerequisite}} for receiving the Holy Ghost.

It does not bring by itself the full power of salvation, and unless it is followed up with baptism in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of tongues, it may be lost. Also, a child may not be baptized until the child knows <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong,</b> because the child can not repent of the sins they have as a baby. [...] Being that all are born into sin, we all have sin when we are born. Furthermore, the ability to repent is temporary and may only be accomplished while one is alive. Luke 13:3 ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese {{wrote of}} other unicorns, {{such as the}} Xiezhi, but it was less like a real animal and more a {{symbolic}} figure. It {{had the ability to}} discriminate <b>right</b> <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> and therefore a representation of it was placed in the courtrooms of the Han dynasty and, in the 3rd and 4th centuries, on the caps of judges. It looks like a seated or standing lion with a horn rising {{from the top of the}} head. In contrast to this mythical beast, the k'i-lin is presented as an animal actually caught by hunting parties of the past. The Shiji ("Historical Records") of Sima Qian in the 2nd century mentions the capture of a [...] "deer-like" [...] animal with one horn in 122BC. The Chunqin, an encyclopaedia of the 3rd century BC, states that a unicorn was captured in 481BC, but without any description. Chinese representations of unicorns vary quite a lot, but an engraving on a bronze vessel of the Warring States period shows an animal very like the cave paintings supposed to be of Elasmotherium: head down for grazing, horn protruding horizontally from the forehead, neck and shoulders humped.|$|E

Comparisons of answers before and after review within the review condition showed that {{only a small percentage of}} answers was changed (3. 63 %), that more answers were changed <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> to <b>right</b> than <b>from</b> <b>right</b> to <b>wrong</b> (by a ratio of 2. 25 to 1), that a large proportion of examinees (45 %) changed answers to at least some questions, and that most examinees who changed answers improved their per-formance by doing so (by a ratio of 2. 44 to 1).

This {{time it was}} clearly the novel which became the key literary weapon, though it fell into two general genres: the historical one and the so-called novel of manners.

Focused on atrocities of the Carlist commander Samaniego, active during the last war - {{at that time the}} last was the Third Carlist War - it tended to brutal veracity. The same feature marks another novel dedicated to the same protagonist, Vida, hechos y hazañas del famoso bandido y cabecilla Rosa Samaniego (1880); its author remains yet to be identified. Brutality was brought to even higher, naturalistic levels in La sima de Igúzquiza by Alejandro Sawa (1888); at times it might seem that the author was more concerned about dazzling the reader with horrors and atrocities rather than with denouncing the Carlists or telling the <b>right</b> <b>from</b> the <b>wrong.</b>|$|R
