40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{characterize}} the changes in <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> in the 1980 s. A five-variable vector autoregressive model (VAR) is constructed to calculate a <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> series in the foreign exchange market. The <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> series is volatile and time-varying. The hypothesis of no <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is strongly rejected for the entire sample and each of the two subsamples considered.

40|$|The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) {{suggests}} that the market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> should be positively related to the market systematic risk {{as measured by the}} market variance. However, the empirical evidence is conflicting. While some studies find a significantly positive relation, others find an insignificant or a significantly negative relation. This article attempts to resolve the market risk and return relation puzzle by recognizing that the market volatility is stochastic and should be treated as an important source of systematic risk - volatility risk. Investors demand a <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> for bearing the market volatility risk in addition to the market systematic risk. As a result, the market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> consists of two components, both related to the market volatility. After taking into account the volatility <b>risk</b> <b>premium,</b> we find strong evidence of a significantly positive relation between the market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> and the market systematic risk.

40|$|From the 1950 s to the present, the <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> for 10 -year {{corporate}} bonds vis-Ã -vis government bonds has gradually increased. While this long-run upward {{trend in the}} corporate bond <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> is relatively stable, short run movements in the <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> exhibit significant variation.

Moreover, I find that matching the VIX dynamics during the calibration process is crucial when comparing different jump channels. Specifically, a jump-in-growth LRR model generates a good fit of the average variance <b>risk</b> <b>premium,</b> but a poor fit of the dynamics of the VIX or realized stock volatility. In contrast, a jump-in-volatility LRR model generates a smaller variance <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> but better fits the VIX and the realized stock volatility dynamics.

40|$|The market <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters in finance. Its value and the ways to calculate a <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> for the market is a widely debated subject. This thesis examines numerous ways of calculating a <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> for the Swedish market with regard to how good an estimation they make of a real <b>risk</b> <b>premium.</b> Estimations based on historical periods ranging from 20 to 85 years is calculated as well as a premium based on forward-looking estimates.

An examination of these estimates leads to the conclusion that historical estimates of a <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> may be outdated.

40|$|Investors {{and market}} analysts {{generally}} {{believe that the}} yield on a nominal bond includes an inflation <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> to compensate investors for bearing the inflation risk associated with the bond.

For government Treasuries, the size of the <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> represents the potential interest savings for governments when nominal securities are replaced with real, or inflation-indexed, securities.
