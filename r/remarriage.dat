5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her <b>remarriage,</b> was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys {{might not want to}} read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her <b>remarriage,</b> she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E

50|$|With {{support from}} people like Akshay Kumar Dutta, Vidyasagar {{introduced}} the practice of widow <b>remarriages</b> to mainstream Hindu society. In earlier times, <b>remarriages</b> of widows would occur sporadically only among progressive members of the Brahmo Samaj. The prevailing custom of Kulin Brahmin polygamy allowed elderly men — sometimes on their deathbeds — to marry teenage or prepubescent girls, supposedly to spare their parents the shame of having an unmarried girl attain puberty in their house. After such marriages, these girls would usually be left behind in their parental homes, where they might be subjected to orthodox rituals, especially if they were subsequently widowed. These included a semi-starvation, hard domestic labour, and close restriction on their freedom {{to leave the house}} or be seen by strangers.|$|R

He lived in Pune.|$|R
5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of the {{households}} in the parishes were literate. A widow had to remain indoors, practically {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the <b>remarriage</b> of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow <b>remarriage</b> for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E
5|$|Divorcing {{a spouse}} was {{permissible}} {{if there was}} mutual consent, while <b>remarriage</b> {{after the death of}} a spouse was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E

50|$|In a {{study that}} focused on dialectics in second marriages, six {{tensions}} unique to <b>remarriages</b> emerged.

50|$|Most {{wives were}} {{encouraged}} to remarry after either {{the death of the}} husband or a divorce; and a high death rate, low average life expectancy and high divorce rate meant frequent or multiple <b>remarriages.</b> Since children were expected in marriage, each spouse usually brought at least one child to the new marriage. <b>Remarriages</b> thus created a new blending of the family in ancient Roman society, where children were influenced by stepparents and some instances where stepmothers were younger than their stepchildren. Ancient physicians believed that a woman was liable to get very sick if she was deprived of sexual activity and it could even lead to a woman getting ‘'hysteric uterine constriction.’' There was even legislation passed during the rule of Augustus that required widows and widowers to remarry to be able to fully inherit from people outside of their immediate family.|$|R

5|$|On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because <b>remarriage</b> after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen. As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church of England, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings.|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. <b>Remarriage</b> following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E

The divorce was finalized on February 21, 1916. Four days later, Minnie and Brinkley were married again, this time in Liberty, Missouri.

5|$|Because <b>re{{marriage}}</b> {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash {{allowance}} for those under {{the rank of}} lieutenant (or the appropriate service equivalent), {{and in some cases}} a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or <b>remarriage.</b> In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the allowance is paid to his father or mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the allowance is to be paid to his son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension benefits are exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|E
5|$|Charles's wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, {{held the}} ball to honor the <b>remarriage</b> of a lady-in-waiting.

The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated in a number of 15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy.
