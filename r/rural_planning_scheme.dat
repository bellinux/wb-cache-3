40|$|Like in {{the other}} Central-European countries, Romania’s {{industrial}} development model over 1950 - 1989, focused on the accelerated and extensive socialist-type industrialisation, explosive urbanisation and the implementation of urban and <b>rural</b> <b>planning</b> <b>schemes.</b> It was a stage in which the national urban system expanded and consolidated. It might {{be said that the}} aim of post-war industrialisation and urbanisation was largely attained by a gradual transition from the traditional rural-agrarian society to the urban-industrial society of the 1990 s. It was a stagewise evolution that took on different forms, had a dynamics of its own, and developed sociocultural particularities in the course of urbanisation. After 1989, reflected the urban system underwent a deep-going restructuring process that the country’s socio-political changes; urbanisation itself acquring new scope and breadth. This new stage of transition from the industrial to the services town-type mirrored the country’s socio-political transition. The industrial function preserved its importance even more than in the economically developed West European states, modern industry and technology being expected to provide the Romanian urban system a development that would enable it to integrate into the town system of Europe. The urban system is undergoing a process of restructuring now, the urban phenomenon acquiring new characteristics and dimensions. The industrial city – the representative type of urban settlement, is to be gradually replaced by the polifunctional and services town, as part of the country’s economic and social-political development targets for the beginning of the third millennium. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies of}} urban {{regeneration}} describe strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> {{based on the}} experiences of practitioners gleaned {{from a variety of}} projects in several cities of the world. Whilst this literature provides a general understanding of strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes,</b> none explores what is happening and what is planned to happen in the context of South Korea. Our research framework was designed to present formal strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> to support urban regeneration within regional contexts. This paper identifies urban regeneration <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> for Mixed-use development (MXD), based on a literature review of Korean refereed papers, and examines <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> via an expert survey. The literature survey includes 29 papers published by three major institutes in architecture and urban design in South Korea. In terms of strategic <b>planning,</b> the <b>schemes</b> have the potential to impact on MXD. Various urban development experts participated in the survey, and the data collected reflect consensus about strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> in regional contexts. The results generated 41 strategic <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and 12 strategic planning factors via Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The results enable us to explore meaningful directions for the future. This paper provides an understanding of key <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> in urban contexts in South Korea as well as of strategic planning for the future MXD projects...|$|R

40|$|With {{deterioration}} {{and neglect}} of large, centrally <b>planned</b> <b>rural</b> water <b>schemes,</b> alternative institutional arrangements for rural water management {{have focused on}} devolution of authority for decision making, design and operations to local governments. The aims of this reform are, in part, to increase the responsiveness of rural water providers to customers' demand preferences, {{as well as to}} increase transparency of operations, in order to reduce corruption. An in-depth analysis of three devolved rural water schemes under the People's Plan policy framework in Kerala, India provides evidence to suggest that achieving greater responsiveness and transparency is a result of more complex institutional arrangements that are neither purely devolved nor purely central. Localizing decision making holds promise for incorporating beneficiaries in decision making processes, thus providing better demand information to the provider and creating incentives for the provider to respond to this information. Monitoring of local service providers must be a concerted effort of many different sources, including users as well as external bodies, in order to provide a credible deterrent to misconduct. by Paul J.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{institutional}} and organizational foundations of <b>rural</b> <b>planning</b> in the Netherlands. The key {{objective of the}} study was to understand the background to and determining factors in the development of land consolidation (ruilverkaveling) as an instrument of <b>rural</b> <b>planning.</b> Dutch <b>rural</b> <b>planning,</b> as a constituent part of spatial planning in the Netherlands, developed quite separately from urban planning. This article traces the roots of this separate development back to the period 1890 - 1940. At the end of the nineteenth century, reformist liberals argued for a legislative framework for the rational reallocation of land parcels to consolidate fragmented land holdings. The early initiatives came to nothing because of the prevailing rigid distinction between public and private interests. The First World War changed this situation. The decline in world trade forced the government to make the national economy more self-sufficient. Land consolidation was embraced as a means for supporting the agricultural sector by improving land drainage and bringing land into cultivation. From the beginning of the 1930 s agricultural politics and <b>rural</b> <b>planning</b> grew closer together, and took off rapidly in the post-war decades...|$|R

The government amended the Planning and Environment Act 1987 to introduce the Victoria Planning Provisions (VPP).
