50|$|<b>Ringelmann</b> <b>scale.</b> A {{measure of}} smoke color. Invented by Professor Maximilian Ringelmann in Paris in 1888, it is {{essentially}} a card with squares of black, white and shades of gray which is held up and the comparative grayness of the smoke judged. Highly dependent on light conditions and the skill of the observer it allocates a grayness number from 0 (white) to 5 (black) which has only a passing relationship to the actual quantity of smoke. Nonetheless, {{the simplicity of the}} <b>Ringelmann</b> <b>scale</b> means that it has been adopted as a standard in many countries.|$|E
5000|$|In 1897 he {{developed}} a simple set of grids for measuring the density of smoke, the <b>Ringelmann</b> <b>scale.</b> These grids are still used today. [...] During 1900-1905, he wrote a monumental, four-volume study Essai sur l’Histoire du Génie Rural (Essay on the History of Rural Engineering), which traced the progress of rural engineering from pre-history to the modern age.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ringelmann</b> <b>scale</b> is a {{scale for}} {{measuring}} the apparent density of Smoke. It was developed by Maximilien Ringelmann of La Station d'Essais de Machines in Paris in 1888. It has a 5 levels of density inferred from a grid of black lines on a white surface which, if viewed from a distance, merge into known shades of grey.There is no definitive chart, rather, Prof. Ringelmann provides a specification; where smokelevel '0' is represented by white, levels '1' to '4' by 10mm square grids drawn with 1mm, 2.3mm, 3.7mm and 5.5 mm wide lines and level '5' by all black. A popular version is that published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in circular 8333 of 1967. The British Standard version (BS2742:1969) alters Ringelmann's specification to give a chart similar, on modern paper with modern ink, to the probable appearance of charts produced on earlier, possibly darker, paper, with paler ink.|$|E
