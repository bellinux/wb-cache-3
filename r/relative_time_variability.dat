40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> on Material Requirements Planning (MRP) performance. This study attempts to understand the impact of lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> in order to provide insight in dealing with lead time uncertainty in MRP system. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effect of lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> at different production level and examine the effectiveness of safety lead time in dealing with lead time uncertainty. In this study, a series of experiments are conducted. The experiments begin with single lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> at different production level (i. e. bottleneck process/common required component, lowest BOM level, first BOM level and end item) with varying levels of lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> (i. e. low lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and high lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> or moderate lead <b>time</b> <b>variability).</b> Then the experiments are extended to multiple lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> at the same production level (i. e. lowest BOM level and first BOM level). Safety lead time of one day (Safety Lead Time = 1 and Safety Lead Time = - 1) is applied at bottleneck process/common required component in attempt to improve MRP performance. The findings show that common lead time has the greatest impact on MRP performance and therefore it is the first thing manufacturers should deal with. Safety lead time does not improve MRP performance in this case even if optimal safety lead time is applied...|$|R
40|$|Background. Increased step <b>time</b> <b>variability,</b> {{particularly}} on an irregular surface, {{has been associated}} with impaired mobility function and a variety of diseases. However the biomechanical necessity, or advantage, of increasing step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> has not been identified. Methods. We performed a secondary analysis of gait data previously obtained on 42 subjects age 50 or older with neuropathy who walked on smooth and irregular surfaces, the latter with and without three interventions (cane, ankle orthosis and wall touch) that provided frontal plane support. Findings. Step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> on smooth and irregular surfaces was most strongly associated with reduction in step length on the irregular surface as compared to the smooth. More specifically, the greater the decrease in step length on the irregular surface the greater the step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> on both surfaces and the greater the increase in step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> on the irregular surface. The increase in step length on the irregular surface afforded by the interventions coincided with a decrease in step <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> The subjects did not simultaneously demonstrate increased step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and step width range on the irregular surface. Interpretation. Among adults age 50 and older with neuropathy, increased step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> is strongly associated with the need to shorten step length on an irregular surface. Therefore step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> may be a marker for instability during single limb stance which necessitates rapidly placed, shortened recovery steps. Such steps may also offer the advantage of reducing extremes in lateral foot placement of the swing limb, and so assist in maintaining frontal plane stability...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to develop an econometric model that can be used to predict travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> for cost-benefit-analysis (CBA). The model {{explains}} travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> by the size of (mean) delays, as well as by other time-variant and invariant road characteristics. The data set used for the analysis is based on travel time data of 146 Dutch highway links for the year 2008. The resulting relationship between travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and its explanatory variables can be used in transport-related cost-benefit-analyses. Up till now, most CBAs do not account for travel <b>time</b> <b>variability,</b> or only in very rough ways. One reason is the lack of straightforward ways on how to include travel <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> While forecasts of mean travel times can be derived from traffic assignment models, this is usually not the case for travel <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> The regression analysis shows that indeed a very significant relationship between travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and delay can be found. It is also fairly robust against changes in the underlying dataset, for instance in respect to days of the week, months or weather conditions. Explanatory variables other than delay and flow-capacity-ratio contribute only little to the predictive power of the model...|$|R

30|$|Regardless of the {{organization}} of the transport, the benefit of reduced transport <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> is related to the impact on costs of the sender and/or receiver of the goods.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} gait characteristics between two walking conditions, wearing and {{not wearing a}} portable gas analysis system, and assess the relationship between stance <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and energy cost of walking in older adults. Subjects: Forty older adults with preferred walking speeds between 0. 8 - 1. 0 m/s were selected. Methods: Gait characteristics (gait speed, step length, step width, step time, stance time, single-support time, double-support <b>time,</b> step length <b>variability,</b> step width <b>variability,</b> and stance <b>time</b> <b>variability)</b> were recorded (variability derived as standard deviation of all steps) while participants completed eight passes over a computerized walkway, with and without wearing the portable device. Next, concurrent measures of stance <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and oxygen consumption were collected during four walking conditions (Overground, Rollator, Treadmill, Treadmill Slow), additional measures were recorded as potential confounders (gait speed, biomechanics, fear of falling, confidence in walking, co-morbidities) or to describe sample (age, race, gender). Analyses: Paired t-tests {{were used to assess}} differences between gait characteristics with and without a portable device. ICC’s were calculated to describe the agreement between measures. Bivariate analyses were performed to determine association between stance <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and energy cost of walking during overground walking. Regression was used to assess for independent contributors to energy cost; confounders simultaneously entered first, followed by stance <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> Additional bivariate analyses were performed for additional conditions. Individual regressions were performed to assess for independent contributors to cost; confounders simultaneously entered first, followed by stance <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> Mixed-effects models were used to compare stance <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and energy cost between walking conditions. Post-hoc analysis used to estimate differences between paired conditions of interest. Results and Clinical Relevance: Our study showed no evidence suggesting wearing a portable device alters overground gait characteristics. Our study also indicates no direct association between stance <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and energy cost of walking, across any walking conditions. Stance <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> was lower on the treadmill, however, no subsequent changes were observed in energy cost. Continued efforts are needed to investigate multiple contributors to energy cost and assess the unique interactions, modifying, and mediating influences these variables have on energy cost of walking. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and applies {{a practical}} method {{to estimate the}} benefits of improved reliability of road networks. We present a general methodology to estimate the scheduling costs due to travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> for car travel. In contrast to existing practical methods, we explicitly consider the effect of travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> on departure <b>time</b> choices. We focus on situations when only mean delays are known, which is typically the case when standard transport models are used. We first show how travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> can be predicted from mean delays. We then estimate the scheduling costs of travellers, taking into account their optimal departure time choice given the estimated travel <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> We illustrate the methodology for air passengers traveling by car to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. We find that on average planned improvements in network reliability only lead to a small reduction in access costs per trip in absolute terms, mainly because most air passengers drive to the airport outside peak hours, when travel <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> tends to be low. However, in relative terms the reduction in access costs due to the improvements in network reliability is substantial. In our case we find that for every 1 Euro reduction in travel time costs, there is an additional cost reduction of 0. 7 Euro due to lower travel <b>time</b> <b>variability,</b> and hence lower scheduling costs. Ignoring the benefits from improved reliability may therefore lead to a severe underestimation of the total benefits of infrastructure improvements...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of the lateral amplitude and regularity of upper body fluctuation on step <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> Return map analysis was used to clarify the relationship between step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and a history of falling. Eleven healthy, community-dwelling older adults and twelve younger adults participated in the study. All of the subjects walked 25 m at a comfortable speed. Trunk acceleration was measured using triaxial accelerometers attached to the third lumbar vertebrae (L 3) and the seventh cervical vertebrae (C 7). The normalized average magnitude of acceleration, the coefficient of determination ($R^ 2 $) of the return map, and the step <b>time</b> <b>variabilities,</b> were calculated. Cluster analysis using the average fluctuation and the regularity of C 7 fluctuation identified four walking patterns in the mediolateral (ML) direction. The participants with higher fluctuation and lower regularity showed significantly greater step <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> compared with the others. Additionally, elderly participants who had fallen in the past year had higher amplitude and a lower regularity of fluctuation during walking.

40|$|The {{pressure}} to reduce inventory investments in supply chains has increased as competi-tion expands and product variety grows. Managers {{are looking for}} areas they can improve to reduce inventories without hurting the level of service provided. Two areas that man-agers focus on are {{the reduction of the}} replenishment lead time from suppliers and the variability of this lead time. The normal approximation of lead time demand distribution indicates that both actions reduce inventories for cycle service levels above 50 %. The normal approximation also indicates that reducing lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> tends to have a greater impact than reducing lead times, especially when lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> is large. We build on the work of Eppen and Martin (1988) to show that the conclusions from the normal approximation are flawed, especially in the range of service levels where most companies operate. We show the existence of a service-level threshold greater than 50 % below which reorder points increase with a decrease in lead <b>time</b> <b>variability.</b> Thus, for a firm operating just below this threshold, reducing lead times decreases reorder points, whereas reducing lead <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> increases reorder points. For firms operating at these service levels, decreasing lead time is the right lever if they want to cut inventories, not reducing lead <b>time</b> <b>variability...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} {{maintain}} a steady gait rhythm is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This aspect of locomotor dyscontrol, which likely reflects impaired automaticity in PD, can be quantified by measuring the stride-to-stride variability of gait timing. Previous work has shown an increase in both the variability of the stride time and swing time in PD, but the origins of these changes are not fully understood. Patients with PD also generally walk with a reduced gait speed, a potential confounder of the observed changes in variability. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the relationship between walking speed and gait <b>variability.</b> Methods Stride <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and swing <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> were measured in 36 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 – 2. 5) and 30 healthy controls who walked on a treadmill at four different speeds: 1) Comfortable walking speed (CWS), 2) 80 % of CWS 3) 90 % of CWS, and 4) 110 % of CWS. In addition, we studied the effects of walking slowly on level ground, both with and without a walker. Results Consistent with previous findings, increased <b>variability</b> of stride <b>time</b> and swing time was observed in the patients with PD in CWS, compared to controls. In both groups, there was a small but significant association between treadmill gait speed and stride <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> such that higher speeds were associated with lower (better) values of stride <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> (p = 0. 0002). In contrast, swing <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> did not change in response to changes in gait speed. Similar results were observed with walking on level ground. Conclusion The present results demonstrate that swing <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> is independent of gait speed, at least over the range studied, and therefore, that it may be used as a speed-independent marker of rhythmicity and gait steadiness. Since walking speed did not affect stride <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> and swing <b>time</b> <b>variability</b> in the same way, it appears that these two aspects of gait rhythmicity are not entirely controlled by the same mechanisms. The present findings also suggest that the increased gait variability in PD is disease-related, and not simply a consequence of bradykinesia. </p...|$|R
