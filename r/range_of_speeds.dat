To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speeds</b> at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{is aiming}} to {{ameliorate}} {{performance of a}} wind energy conversion systems (WECS), based on double fed induction generator (DFIG), and extract power over wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> variation.

The solution is attractive because it can raise the power density of the generator to twice its nominal power and consequently the size and cost {{of the system is}} reduced, another advantage is that the system is decoupled with electrical network, so the disturbances of the latter do not affect the DFIG. After modeling different parts of WECS, we proceed to the system control using MPPT with optimal operating point (OOP) method.

Next, under a uniform geometric ergodicity assumption, we provide deviation inequalities for the BMC and apply them to derive a second result on the MDP for a bounded functional of the BMC with a larger <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed.</b> As statistical applications, we provide superexponential convergence in probability and deviation inequalities (for either the Gaussian setting or the bounded setting), and the MDP for least square estimators of the parameters of a first-order bifurcating autoregressive process.
