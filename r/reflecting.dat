5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence <b>reflecting</b> concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence <b>reflecting</b> behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence <b>reflecting</b> the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
