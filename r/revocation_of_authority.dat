Save {{for certain}} possible exceptions, discussed below, the principal may summarily revoke the agent’s authority {{to perform a}} juristic act on the principal’s behalf, if the act in question has not already been performed. This is so even if the authority is expressed to be irrevocable. If Arthur, for example, engages Boucher to find a suitable person to buy Arthur’s house, and authorises Boucher to sell the house, Arthur may revoke the authority granted to Boucher. After such revocation, Boucher cannot bind Arthur to a sale of the house, though Boucher may claim damages from Arthur for breach of contract. In order to be effective as against interested third parties, however, the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> must be communicated to such third parties.|$|E
