40|$|Many rural {{communities}} in Alaska rely on large constructed lagoons {{to treat their}} wastewater. The quality of effluent released from these lagoons {{and the ability of}} the <b>receiving</b> <b>bodies</b> to dilute the effluent varies as the thawed season progresses. The <b>receiving</b> <b>bodies</b> tend to have capacity before the effluent has reached levels acceptable for discharge and algae growth degrades effluent quality as capacity in <b>receiving</b> <b>bodies</b> is decreasing, leaving only a short window to discharge effluent with minimal impact. [...] The expansion of an existing facultative lagoon and the addition of a constructed wetland in Galena, Alaska is estimated to increase BOD and TSS removal to levels that will consistently exceed permit levels. The lagoon will be drawn down by discharging to the constructed wetland over a 120 day discharge period. The addition of the constructed wetland will keep TSS within permit levels even when algae drives TSS values over permit levels in the facultative lagoon. [...] While the constructed wetland is expected to reduce fecal coliform concentration in the wastewater treatment facility effluent it may not bring fecal coliform levels down to below permit levels. Additional dilution or disinfection may be required. [...] Unlike BOD, TSS, and fecal coliform, which are expected to improve through the addition of the constructed wetland, dissolved oxygen levels are expected to decrease as a result of treating the wastewater in the constructed wetland. While the dissolved oxygen concentration of the constructed wetland effluent will be low, the decreased BOD concentration will result in an effluent that is more readily able to reaerate over an effluent with a higher BOD concentration. [...] Overall the results of this project suggest that adding constructed wetlands treatment to facultative lagoons prior to discharge to <b>receiving</b> <b>bodies</b> has the potential to create effluent of consistent quality that will meet or exceed ADEC permit requirements...|$|R

Wastewater treatment plants receive effluents containing various chemical pollutants. These chemicals may not be fully removed during treatment and could potentially enter the <b>receiving</b> water <b>bodies.</b> Detection of these chemical pollutants and source identification could be a challenging research task due to the diversified chemical and functional groups, concentration levels and fate and transportation mechanisms of these pollutants in the environment. Chemical markers such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, artificial sweeteners, fluorescent whitening agents, sterols and stanols, and nitrate and nitrogen isotopics {{have been widely used}} by most research as markers. These markers served as indicators of wastewater contamination to the <b>receiving</b> <b>bodies</b> due to their frequent usage, resistance to biodegradability and, more importantly, anthropogenic origin.

40|$|When {{precipitation}} {{occurs in}} undeveloped areas {{a number of}} abstractions catch and absorb the precipitation. Abstractions include plants and trees, which catch {{a portion of the}} water, pervious soils that infiltrate stormwater until saturated and natural changes in topography where stormwater accumulates. During more intense, longer storm evens the abstraction limit in a watershed can be reached and runoff occurs. In the process of developing areas for cities, towns, industrial sites and transportation the watershed characteristics of that area are changed and the quantity of abstraction in the developed area is reduced. Pervious soils are replaced with impervious surfaces and plants that abstract, absorb and release moisture through evapotranspiration are removed. As a result a significantly larger quantity of surface runoff is generated in these areas. There are a number of methods used to manage the quantity of runoff. Two popular options are the combined sewer system and the separate sewer system. The combined sewer system conveys stormwater runoff and sanitary sewage from households to a wastewater treatment plant. After treatment water is released into a <b>receiving</b> <b>body</b> {{and the quality of the}} effluent is monitored to comply with water quality regulations in general, or for water quality regulations at a particular <b>receiving</b> <b>body</b> of water. The separate sewer system, also known as the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS 4) conveys stormwater separate from sanitary waste. The MS 4 generally discharges stormwater to a <b>receiving</b> <b>body</b> of water through a system of outfalls while sanitary sewage is conveyed to a wastewater treatment plant.

Strategic sampling at the inlet of the oxidation pond, at the outlet and in the river before and after the effluent has joined the <b>receiving</b> <b>body</b> (river) was undertaken. Samples from each of these locations were taken three times, in the morning, noon and evening. The sample were then analysed in the laboratory using standard methods of water quality analysis. The results showed that the configuration and or the layout of the oxidation ponds (treatment plant) were not in accordance with the acceptable standards. Thus, the BOD 5 of the effluent discharged into the <b>receiving</b> <b>body</b> (Ruaha River) was in the order of 41 mg/l and therefore not meeting several standards as set out both by Tanzanian and international water authorities.

30|$|Therefore, {{in view of}} the {{composition}} of the liquid effluent of the process proposed (Table  1 (A)), it can be observed that in the event it is poured into a watercourse, it should be first cooled, neutralized, and biologically treated to reduce its organic load.

Further research is needed to investigate whether the effluent liquid may be reused {{to be added to the}} enzymatic hydrolysis stage of must preparation. In this way, it may be possible to avoid the use of water to reduce the cost of correcting the pH, but the ionic strength must be taken into account because it could alter the activity of the biocatalyst. However, emphasizing the parameters in Table  1 (B) and considering that the fat content and odor are suitable, two alternative uses for the liquid effluent were evaluated: as irrigation water or as beverage for livestock.
