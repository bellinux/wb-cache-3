40|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>refractory</b> <b>gunning</b> <b>material</b> and liquid steel in the tundish {{gives rise to}} inclusions in the steel, therefore influencing the steel cleanliness and causing nozzle clogging during continuous casting. This interaction was investigated through laboratory experiments under controlled atmosphere at 1550 °C, in which steel was equilibrated for certain times in shaped crucibles made of gunning mass. Steel was sampled repeatedly during the tests and the crucibles were quenched after interaction. A FeO layer with a thickness of 5 ~ 30 µm was observed at the steel/gunning material interface during the interaction tests. In the steel samples, two types of inclusions were found: (I) Al 2 O 3 and/or AlTiOx inclusions, the number of which decreases with holding time; (II) numerous small Fe-Mn-O-S inclusions, the size of which increases with time. The former inclusions are relatively larger than the latter ones, and {{are believed to be}} originally present in the steel, while the latter inclusions are generated during the interaction tests (reoxidation of the steel) or during the solidification of the samples (secondary inclusions). On the other hand, large inclusions originating from the gunning material (Al 2 O 3 and MgO with impurities), were observed to be located in the steel close to the steel/gunning material interface. The composition and microstructure of the gunning materials affect the inclusion population in the steel. The steel reoxidation rates as traced by the Fe-Mn-S-O inclusions appears to increase with higher SiO 2 and FeO content in the original gunning materials. status: publishe...|$|E

It {{has been found}} that both of adhesion and slag-corrosion resistance are good for the <b>gunning</b> <b>material.</b> It was simple and fiexible to repair by machine.

40|$|Foaming {{practices}} {{are widely used}} in electric arc furnace operations for: - shielding electrode, - longer electrode life, - faster melting time. Besides above, foaming practice is also able to increase furnace yield because by carbon injection into slag of electric arc furnace, (FeO) content in slag descends and thus improves the quality of melting steel. The experiments of foaming slag were carried out in PT. Krakatau Steel - Slab Steel Plant 130 tonne electric arc furnace using the experimental melting procedures involving alternate DRI charging plan, coke breeze injection control, lime or dolomite addition control and slag height control. The results of heats in each of experimental melting procedures, namely: - existing melting procedures, - experimental melting procedure one, two, three and four. Were statistically analysed by using the MINITAB statistical package. The analysis showed that the new melting procedures resulted in : - a decrease in effective melting time, - a significant decrease (28 % to 32 %) in (FeO) content in slag, - a particularly notable decrease (16 % to 28 %) in <b>gunning</b> <b>material</b> consumption per ton liquid steel, - a decrease in electrode consumption per ton liquid steel (7 %) ...|$|R
