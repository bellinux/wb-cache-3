40|$|Export of Visegrad {{countries}} to China {{is not only}} direct but is often realized via third countries. Sometimes this export is simply reexported, sometimes it enters the domestic economy as an input in production of exports of the third country and then we speak about indirect export. Due to data availability, however, {{it is very difficult}} to accurately track these flows for every single product and therefore they must be estimated from national input-output tables. This paper calculates the reexports and indirect exports of Visegrad goods led through Germany, as it is the most dominant export destination of all the Visegrad countries and also the main exporter to China in the whole EU. The results show that the V 4 exports to China in fact more than suggested by the official statistics. Attributing reexports and indirect exports via Germany increases total exports by 68 %. Measured values also show that 55 % of Visegrad exports to Germany are not intended to cover domestic consumption but for further exports.

40|$|The {{globalization}} of population and trade flows yielded {{an increase of}} interactions within the international framework. Accessibility indicators are especially suited to represent spatial interaction since they capture two basic factors that {{determine the amount of}} flows between a set of places: the opportunities available and the infrastructure used to move those flows. While globalization trends contributed to the weakening of borders, several studies confirm that borders still matter in international trade, and {{play a significant role in}} the form of home bias, i. e. a marked preference for domestic products. Still, most studies of international accessibility ignore this fact, thus failing to show realistic results. This paper makes use of gravity equations to calibrate the distance decay parameter as well as a new coefficient to control for the border effect in the market potential indicator. We used official trade data at the country level in the European Union and evaluated different distance metrics in order to obtain a realistic measure of the border effect within the EU. Our results suggest that the border effect in Europe was previously underestimated due to an excessive simplification when measuring distances. While our preliminary results were similar to previous research, once we apply realistic measures of transports cost (either travel time or generalized transport costs) and removed those countries that are highly affected by the <b>Rotterdam</b> <b>effect,</b> we found that European countries trade 15 times more within themselves than with any other European country. Consequently, integrating the effects of borders in accessibility analysis of international scope evidences that the gap between central and peripheral countries is even larger than expected. JRC.

40|$|A {{differential}} {{approach is}} employed to analyze demand for {{meat in the}} United Kingdom during 1989 - 99. Differential demand systems with fixed price <b>effects</b> (<b>Rotterdam</b> and CBS) better explain consumersÂ’ retail purchase allocation decisions for beef, lamb, pork, bacon and poultry compared with models containing variable price effects (NBR and differential AIDS). The real expenditures and the Hicksian demand elasticities are generally found to be quite different from earlier studies using AIDS models. A quality change index of meat consumption is constructed from the estimated CBS model estimation results and decomposed into real expenditure, substitution, trend, seasonal and residual effects. meat demand, differential approach, model selection, UK, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R

Joint non-nested testing of both is applied for the linearized almost ideal and Rotterdam models with and without structural change, incorporated by the gradual transition approach. The test of model choice without structural change is inconclusive; the test of models with structural change shows that, for Canadian meat consumption, the gradual transition almost ideal model is preferred over the gradual transition <b>Rotterdam</b> model. The <b>effect</b> of functional form on demand elasticities for meats is relatively minor but the structural change provision substantially affects these estimates...|$|R

40|$|Background: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is tightly {{associated}} with insulin resistance and obesity and characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic oligo-anovulation and polycystic ovarian morphology when fully expressed. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus proposed that {{two or three}} of these features were necessary to make the diagnosis, which generated four phenotypes. Several studies have suggested that these phenotypes could differ in their metabolic and endocrine characteristics and that they could vary in the same patient when analyzed throughout life. Aim: To determine if the initial classification of PCOS phenotypes is modified by different physiological conditions. Material and Methods: We performed a non-concurrent prospective analysis of 88 women with PCOS according to the <b>Rotterdam</b> criteria. The <b>effect</b> of physiological conditions such as changes in body weight, pregnancy and ageing more than five years on PCOS phenotype expression was analyzed. Results: Twenty four percent of women became pregnant, 37 % decreased and 24 % increased their body weight during follow up. These conditions modified significantly the proportion of the different phenotypes (c 2 = 32. 2, p < 0. 001). For instance, weight reduction was {{associated with}} a change to a better phenotype (p = 0. 047) and even a normalization of the PCOS condition in 27 % of the patients. On the other hand, an increase in body weight modifying body mass index in one unit, conferred an 8 % probability of changing to a worst phenotype. Conclusions: Pregnancy and changes in body weight significantly modify PCOS phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Genetic {{variation}} in SIRT 1 {{has been associated}} with body mass index (BMI) and risk of obesity. SIRT 1 may be influenced by diet. Objective: We studied the gene-diet interaction on BMI at the SIRT 1 locus. Design: In 4575 elderly {{men and women in the}} population-based <b>Rotterdam</b> Study, the <b>effect</b> on BMI of 3 SIRT 1 genetic variants (rs 7895833, rs 1467568, and haplotype 1) was studied in relation to dietary intakes of energy, fat, calcium, milk, antioxidant vitamins, and niacin. Results: There was no difference in energy or fat intakes by SIRT 1 genotype. Significant interactions for BMI were shown between SIRT 1 genetic variants and intakes of fat, vitamin E, calcium, and milk. Only the interactions between vitamin E intake and rs 1467568 and haplotype 1 remained significant (P < 0. 001) after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Further analyses across vitamin E-intake tertiles showed highly significant associations of SIRT 1 genetic variants with BMI in the lowest tertile [effect sizes (in kg/m 2) : 0. 5 - 0. 7 per allele copy; P = 1. 9 × 10 - 4 - 5. 7 × 10 - 7] with no associations in the higher tertiles. Conclusions: Dietary vitamin E intake may modulate the relation of SIRT 1 genetic variants with BMI. Associations of SIRT 1 variants with BMI in the lowest tertile of vitamin E intake may be explained by low intake of this antioxidant vitamin or by other associated dietary or lifestyle habits. These data provide support that gene-diet interactions influence BMI. Replication of our findings and further in-depth studies of dietary patterns that modify SIRT 1 may lead to clinical studies of dietary modification of SIRT 1 to influence obesity...|$|R
