The utility of <b>recasts</b> in face-to-face interaction has been empirically established, and the contingency of <b>recasts</b> is argued to be the key. However, the efficacy of <b>recasts</b> in computer-mediated communication (CMC), text-based online chatting in particular, remains questionable due to the possible violation of this contingency factor in the 'split negotiation routines' commonly observed in CMC discourse.

While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and <b>recasting</b> their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E

This study investigates learners' interpretations of <b>recasts</b> in interaction. Videotapes of task-based interactions including <b>recasts</b> and repetitions were shown to advanced English {{as a second language}} students (N = 34). Although both groups viewed the teacher's feedback (<b>recasts,</b> repetitions, or other), one group saw video clips that had been edited to remove the learners' nontargetlike utterances that had triggered the feedback, and another group saw the same video clips with the initial nontargetlike utterances included. After each clip, learners in both groups were asked to indicate whether they thought they were hearing a <b>recast,</b> a repetition, or something else. A subset of learners (n = 14) provided verbal reports while they evaluated the clips. Results show that learners who did not overhear initial learner utterances were significantly less successful at distinguishing <b>recasts</b> from repetitions. The verbal protocol data suggest that learners were not looking for nonverbal cues from the speakers. A post hoc analysis suggests that morphosyntactic <b>recasts</b> were less accurately recognized than phonological or lexical <b>recasts</b> in this study.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. In the {{previous}} research on <b>recasts,</b> two interesting claims have been made. First, the absence of learners' immediate responses following <b>recasts</b> may limit the effectiveness of <b>recasts,</b> and therefore other interactional feedback moves that encourage uptake, such as prompts or negotiation, would be more beneficial for learners than <b>recasts.</b> In response to this claim, some researchers have argued that <b>recasts</b> might have delayed effects on L 2 development, and thus the efficacy of <b>recasts</b> should not be discounted {{due to the lack}} of immediate responses (Mackey & Philp, 2003; McDonough & Mackey, 2006). The second claim is that, among the many operational definitions of <b>recasts</b> utilized in previous studies, the more explicit ones may be more effective than the more implicit ones (Ellis & Sheen, 2006; Nicholas, Lightbown, & Spada, 2001), since the former lead to a higher rate of learner uptake and repair (Loewen & Philp, 2006; Sheen, 2006) as well as greater noticing of the <b>recasts</b> (Egi, 2007; Kim & Han, 2007). These two issues are investigated in this study examining the effects of explicit (i. e., declarative) and implicit (i. e., interrogative) <b>recasts</b> on L 2 development of Korean relative clauses. In total, 63 KSL/KFL learners at the beginning-high to intermediate level participated in this study. The impacts of explicit and implicit <b>recasts</b> are examined with respect to various learner responses in the discourse (i. e., immediate uptake and primed production) as well as subsequent L 2 development, measured on two different occasions (i. e., immediate and delayed posttests) by employing three different tasks (i. e., an oral production task, a sentence combination task, and a grammaticality judgment task). The results showed that all three groups (i. e., declarative, interrogative, and control groups) significantly improved over time as a result of the interaction they engaged in during the experiments, regardless of the explicitness of the <b>recasts</b> and even the presence or absence of <b>recasts.</b> However, significantly higher repair rates followed declarative <b>recasts,</b> supporting the argument that declarative <b>recasts</b> are more explicit than interrogative ones.

40|$|Hong Kong {{secondary}} school students often lack the procedural knowledge of using English grammar in speaking, though they possess the relevant declarative knowledge from their education. Students' tenseless L 1 and lack of L 2 exposure {{could have been the}} reasons. The present study therefore investigated if individualized feedback on students' use of past tense in their spoken narratives would facilitate their development. <b>Recasts</b> were chosen as the target feedback, because they intertwine with the ongoing speaking flow and provide model reformulation to ease learners' online cognitive load. However, controversies over the effectiveness of <b>recasts</b> lie on their variable explicitness and implicitness. Moreover, research, to date has not sufficiently examined both the explicit and implicit implementation of <b>recasts</b> in the context of Hong Kong. As a result, the present study explored the immediate and overtime effectiveness of implicit and explicit <b>recasts</b> over no feedback on Hong Kong learners' use of past tense in their spoken narratives elicited from cartoon strips. The comparative effectiveness of the two <b>recasts</b> was also probed. Investigation into some students' perception towards the feedbacks was conducted through stimulated recalls, to suggest causes behind the different effectiveness of <b>recasts.</b> The study found that both <b>recasts</b> were more effective than no feedback on past tense in the short term.
