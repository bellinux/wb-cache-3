40|$|When {{multiple}} {{arms are}} used to manipulate a large object, it is beneficial and sometimes necessary to maintain and control contacts between the object and the effector (the contacting surface of an arm) through force closure. Rolling and/or sliding can occur at these contacts, and the system is characterized by holonomic as well as nonholonomic (including unilateral) constraints. In this paper, the control of planar <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts</b> is investigated. Multi-arm manipulation systems are typically redundant. In our approach, a minimal set of inputs is employed to control the trajectory of the system while the surplus inputs control the contact condition. The trajectory includes the gross motion of the object {{as well as the}} rolling motion at the contacts. A nonlinear feedback scheme for simultaneous control of motion as well as contact conditions is presented.

It may therefore be necessary to control contact motion between the object and the effector(s) on one or more arms. This paper addresses the dynamic control of two arms cooperatively manipulating a large object with <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts.</b> In the framework presented here, the motion of the object as well as the loci of the contact point either on the surface of each effector or on the object can be directly controlled. The velocity and acceleration equations for three-dimensional <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts</b> are derived in order to obtain a dynamic model of the system. A nonlinear feedback control algorithm that decouples and linearizes the system is developed.

40|$|Abstract: Kinematic {{synthesis}} {{problems of}} a four-link mechanism with <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts</b> have been studied in the literature. One may imagine a very difficult synthesis problem, {{which is much more}} difficult to solve for a seven-target-point problem. In fact, the kinematic synthesis formu-lation for a four-link mechanism with <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts</b> discussed in the literature is complicated by the improper selection of the design variables, which leads to simultaneous increases in the number of design variables and in the number of synthesis equations. Thus, in this work, an improved formulation for the kinematic synthesis of the four-link mechanism with rolling con-tacts is proposed where the GA–DE hybrid evolutionary algorithm is applied to solve the optimum path synthesis problem. Three examples are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The findings show that the present formulation can reduce the number of design variables for a seven-target-points synthesis problem by 10 when compared with that using the previous formulation discussed in the literature. This reduces the difficulty of a seven-target-point synthesis problem. More accurate results for all examples can be obtained only with the GA–DE algorithm. Thus, the proposed formulation is superior to the previous one discussed in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{role played}} by {{particulate}} contamination in <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts</b> has formed {{the subject of much}} research in recent years. Bearing-steel quality has improved to a level where the long established sub-surface-inclusion based fatigue failures are being replaced by surface or near-surface initiated failures caused by surface defects resulting mainly from rolled-in debris particles.

The full explanation for this has emerged from the realization that inclusion induced sub-surface fatigue, the Lundberg and Palmgren (1, 2) basis of our original life prediction, was often avoided with clean steels and replaced by surface or near-surface initiated fatigue mechanisms.

40|$|Mechanical {{components}} {{subjected to}} cyclic loadings below the ultimate {{strength of the}} material often fail due to a phenomenon known as fatigue. Fatigue failures occur in three stages; crack initiation, crack propagation, and final catastrophic failure. For high cycle fatigue the crack initiation component of the total life usually dominates. Crack initiation in high cycle fatigue originates at the microstructural level often occurring at initial material imperfections or at plastic slip bands that are developed in a few poorly oriented grains. In addition there are applications such as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts</b> where the stressed volume of the material is confined to {{a small number of}} grains. For these reasons in order to properly investigate the origins of high cycle fatigue the effects of the material microstructure must be considered. This work focuses on modeling procedures that include micro-level material features to predict fatigue life and fatigue life scatter in MEMS devices and <b>rolling</b> <b>contacts.</b> Simulated microstructures are used in conjunction with continuum damage mechanics to predict the fatigue life of a component. Two material modeling frameworks are used. The first approach uses a discontinuous representation of the material. The second approach uses a continuum finite element model which incorporates cohesive zone elements. Material disorder in the form of topological variation in the material microstructure, inhomogeneous material properties, and initial internal flaws are included in the model to study their effects on fatigue life scatter. The fatigue lives predicted by the model are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results available in the literature. ...|$|R

For the normal adhesive contact of surfaces with regular relief, an analytical solution, which takes into account the mutual effect of asperities, is presented. The contribution of adhesive hysteresis into the sliding and rolling friction forces is calculated for various values of nominal pressure, parameters of microgeometry, and adhesion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rolling</b> <b>contact</b> {{problems}} are dynamic problems {{in which the}} contacting bodies are continuously moving with respect to each other. A difference to dynamic sliding contact problems {{is that there is}} more variety in the state of different surface particles. Whereas the contact patch in a sliding problem continuously consists of {{more or less the same}} particles, in a <b>rolling</b> <b>contact</b> problem particles enter and leave the contact patch incessantly. Moreover, in a sliding problem the surface particles in the contact patch are all subjected to more or less the same tangential shift everywhere, whereas in a rolling problem the surface particles are stressed in rather different ways. They are free of stress when entering the contact patch, then stick to a particle of the opposing surface, are strained by the overall motion difference between the two bodies, until the local traction bound is exceeded and local slip sets in. This process is in different stages for different parts of the contact area.|$|E
