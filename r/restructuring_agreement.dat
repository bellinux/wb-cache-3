25|$|Debt <b>restructuring</b> <b>agreements</b> with {{assignment}} of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung / concordat par abandon d’actif) {{are aimed at}} the liquidation of the debtor's assets, much like bankruptcy proceedings. They provide for a sale of the debtor's assets to the creditors or to third parties. The liquidation is executed by a liquidator designated in the agreement, who is supervised by a creditors' committee. Since 2001, the liquidation of SAirGroup (the former corporate parent of Swissair) is being executed under this procedure.|$|R
50|$|As of 19 February, Greece {{had managed}} to pass the first two hurdles. The debt <b>restructure</b> <b>agreement</b> {{and the result of}} the debt {{sustainability}} report was however still pending. Some of the newest calculations suggested that Greece would now need an enhanced bailout at €136 billion, and they were still likely to exceed the 120% debt level in 2020. It is now up to the Troika to decide if this can be accepted under the previous terms. Alternatively, the slightly worse outlook for the debt numbers can also be counterfeited, by some further debt restructuring and/or demands for additional austerity measures.|$|R

40|$|We analyze a distressed firm {{indebted to}} many creditors. The firm's owners {{have the option}} of {{choosing}} the sequence of restructuring negotiations with the creditors. We show that sequencing flexibility is beneficial to firm owners, and that the optimal sequencing of restructuring negotiations involves exploiting the firm's liabilities to some creditors so as to moderate the demands of others. Moderately distressed firms will eschew renegotiations with creditors in strong bargaining positions. Severely distressed firms will extract concessions from all creditors. In this case, owners can gain if they can credibly commit to conditional <b>restructuring</b> <b>agreements</b> that link the concessions of one creditor to concessions by others...|$|R
5000|$|The debt <b>restructure</b> <b>agreement,</b> with a debt {{write-off}} worth €107 billion, {{needs to be}} implemented by a bond swap in early March 2012, involving minimum 95% of the private creditors. Under {{the terms of the}} deal, all the holders (banks, pension funds, insurers and others) of €206 billion in Greek government bonds, would have to -if they accept the deal either voluntarily or by a collective action clause- write down the face value of their holdings by 53.5%, by swapping bonds they hold for longer-dated securities that pay a lower coupon. When calculated for the bonds with the longest maturity, the 53.5% haircut of face value, will be equal to a 74% loss on the net present value of the debt.|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{investment}} is typically considered {{an important source}} of growth for developing countries. This article describes the legal protection granted to foreign investors and its enforcement mechanisms. Governments have signed international investment agreements intended to protect foreign investors from the risk of expropriation and have increasingly chosen to issue sovereign debt in international financial centers, which expose defaulting governments to litigations in foreign national courts. In most cases, governments have complied with unfavorable rulings of international arbitration courts, and many recent sovereign default episodes were followed by relatively friendly debt <b>restructuring</b> <b>agreements.</b> But there have been cases in which expropriated investors or holders of sovereign debt in default have not been compensated, which suggests that the actual legal protection granted to foreign investors is limited.

40|$|In 1981 Poland lost {{ability of}} {{servicing}} its debt. Restructuring {{of the debt}} {{seemed to be the}} most important proposal of solution this problem. Restructuring of the debt is an instrument which was used to lessen the burden of the servicing of the debt. It consists in postponing of the payment due in a given year (or after several years - overdue payments) to a new period, with a new schedule being agreed upon. During the years 1981 - 1990 Poland signed five debt <b>restructuring</b> <b>agreements</b> with official creditors (Paris Club) and six agreements with commercial banks. Restructuring did not prove to be successful way of solution to our debt problem. It was only a rescheduling in time of the debt.
