5|$|Whether {{counsel is}} {{retained}} or appointed, the defendant {{has a right}} to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a move must {{be made on the}} board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{properties}} of {{this set of}} <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> sound and complete. Informally this means <b>that</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> correct and <b>that</b> no other <b>rules</b> <b>are</b> required. These claims can be made more formal as follows.|$|R

5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{weight of}} an apothecaries' pound ranged {{generally}} between 300g and 320g, {{slightly less than}} that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the large city of Milan the apothecaries' system based on a pound of 326.8g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in France the système usuel had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.|$|E
5|$|When the Indian flag is flown on Indian {{territory}} {{along with}} other national flags, the general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Indian flag should be {{the starting point of}} all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be {{in front of the other}} flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands {{and ask for a}} new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E
25|$|One major {{misconception}} {{about the}} hearsay <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> hearsay is never admissible in court. While the general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such evidence is inadmissible, {{there are many}} exceptions.|$|E

25|$|Prohibition of {{generalized}} grievances: A plaintiff cannot sue if {{the injury}} is widely shared in an undifferentiated way with many people.

Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner. Heading the ball results in a five-minute penalty.|$|E
25|$|Tyrone caused {{controversy}} in 2007 when they fielded four players {{who had already}} been selected by University teams. The official <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Universities have first choice on players, so in effect, they were fielding ineligible players. Tyrone manager, Mickey Harte, claimed it was the players' own decision to choose {{to play for the}} county team over their University. Tyrone were docked two points as a punishment, but this did not affect their progression into the semi-final stage.|$|E
25|$|The general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> arteries {{from the}} heart branch out into capillaries, which collect into veins leading back to the heart. Portal veins are a slight {{exception}} to this. In humans the only significant example is the hepatic portal vein which combines from capillaries around the gastrointestinal tract where the blood absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading directly back to the heart, the hepatic portal vein branches into a second capillary system in the liver.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} issues in mining {{association}} <b>rules</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> large numbers of <b>rules</b> can <b>be</b> generated from databases, thus making the results hard to examinate by a human analyst. Previous approaches have focused on introducing various measures of interestingness <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> used either to generate only interesting rules or to prune <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> non-interesting. Pasquier et al. have discussed the generation of Guigues-Duquenne-Luxenburger bases (GDL bases) de ned as sets of association <b>rules</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> non-redundant {{with respect to a}} set of inference rules.

25|$|Conversion, being a {{wrongful}} act, cannot {{spring from}} the exercise of a legal right. Such acts include the right of execution on a legal judgment or contesting rights under a contract. The general <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no conversion until some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or rights in the property. To constitute a conversion of a chattel, {{there must be an}} unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have the essence of a tort.|$|E
25|$|The main duty of a heraldic {{device is}} to be recognized, and the dark colours or light metals are {{supposed}} to be too difficult to distinguish if they are placed on top of other dark or light colours, particularly in poor light. Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule. Another reason sometimes given to justify this <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was difficult to paint with enamel (colour) over enamel, or with metal over metal.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian, {{like its}} distant {{relative}} Finnish, {{has the same}} system of front, back, and intermediate (neutral) vowels but {{is more complex than}} the one in Finnish, and some vowel harmony processes. The basic <b>rule</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> words including at least one back vowel get back vowel suffixes (karba – in(to) the arm), while words excluding back vowels get front vowel suffixes (kézbe – in(to) the hand). One vowel words including only the neutral vowels i, í or é are unpredictable (not in case of e which surely gets front vowel suffix).|$|E
