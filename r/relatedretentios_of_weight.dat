40|$|Weight gain as {{a result}} of {{atypical}} anti-psychotic treatment is a common issue with different atypical anti-psychotic treatments causing differing magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> gain. Although differing amounts <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> gain result from different atypical agents {{little is known about the}} temporal course <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> gain in anti- psychotic treatment.

It is evident that all three of these agents exhibit similar although at distinct magnitudes temporal courses <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> gain.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{selection}} of the profiles <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> to be used in cross-efficiency evaluations. In an attempt to prevent unrealistic <b>weighting</b> schemes, one <b>of</b> the issues of main interest that we address here is that <b>of</b> the zero <b>weights,</b> since their use implies that some of the variables considered are excluded from the assessments to be made. In the calculation of cross-efficiency scores, we propose to ignore the profiles <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> the DMUs that cannot make a choice <b>of</b> non-zero <b>weights</b> among their alternate optima. The different units are therefore assessed in a peer-evaluation that does not consider the profiles <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> some inefficient DMUs. This approach is referred to as "peer-restricted" cross-efficiency evaluation. Aside from avoiding zero <b>weights,</b> the choice <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> that we make also seeks to reduce the differences between the weights profiles selected as much as possible. Thus, in the "peer-restricted" cross-efficiency evaluation in the present paper we also try to avoid that the different DMUs attach very different weights to the same variable. Finally, we extend this approach to derive a common set <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> by exploiting the idea of similarity between profiles <b>of</b> <b>weights.</b> Cross-efficiency evaluation DEA <b>Weights</b> Common set <b>of</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose. Abnormality in the {{structure}} of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot is commonly thought to be a predisposing factor to injury. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the reliability and validity of several measurements used to characterize various aspects of the foot, including the medial longitudinal arch. Subjects. One hundred two feet (both feet of 51 subjects) were measured to establish a reference database. From this group, a subset of 20 feet (both feet of 10 subjects) was used to determine intertester and intratester reliability. Radiographs of a further subset of 10 feet (right feet of 10 subjects) were used to determine validity. Methods. Five foot measure-ments were taken in 2 stance conditions: 10 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing and 90 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing. Results. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for intertester and intratester measurements were between. 480 and. 995. The most reliable method of characterizing arch type in 10 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing between testers was dividing navicular height by foot length in 10 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing. However, this measure yielded highly unreliable measure-ments in 90 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing. The most valid measurements were navicular height divided by truncated foot length, navicular height divided by foot length in 10 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing, and navicular height divided by foot length in 90 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing. Dorsum height at 50 % of foot length divided by truncated foot length showed relatively high intertester reliability (ICC 5. 811 in 10 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing, ICC 5. 848 in 90 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing) and validity (ICC 5. 844 in 10 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing, ICC 5. 851 in 90 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing). Conclusion and Discussion. These data suggest that, of the measures tested, the most reliable and valid method of clinically assessing arch height across 10 % and 90 % <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> bearing was dividing the dorsum height at 50 % of foot length by truncated foot length.
