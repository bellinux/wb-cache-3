50|$|Since {{copper pipe}} quickly conducts heat {{away from a}} joint, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the joint is {{properly}} heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens. With a solder <b>ring</b> <b>joint,</b> the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible {{around the edge of the}} fitting and allowed to cool.|$|E

40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> flange of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique. The cracks encompassed approximately 180 deg of circumference and were located at both the inner and outer radius of the flange <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> groove. The crack depth was 1. 0 in. ~ 25. 4 mm! on the innermost radius of the depths located at the base of the <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> groove to evaluate the change in the crack tip driving force.

40|$|When welding {{domestic}} and imported alloys with argonarc welding, unexplored material properties are {{formed in the}} weld, there is no information about the mechanical properties of welded joints, their continuity and uniformity. One {{of the most important}} criteria for working capacity of any construction is a strength of the whole structure and its individual elements. As a comparative characteristics that evaluates the strength of the materials we use tensile strength, that is, the tension corresponding to the greatest efforts preceding the rupture of the sample under static mechanical tests. Tests to identify the ultimate tensile strength of sheet welded joints were carried out on a universal testing machine Inspekt- 50. In the course of studies there was defined tensile strength of welded constructions, obtained by fusing {{domestic and}} imported sheet hire materials. Tensile strength of the welded structure is determined by the characteristics of the least durable material in a pair of connected, which corresponds to conclusions made in the analytical review.

The destruction of the weld was not fixed. The results obtained can be used in the design of welded constructions composed of parts made of domestic and imported materials.

40|$|Because of low hindrances during {{construction}} {{and lack of}} space in populated areas, shield driven tunnels {{are becoming more and}} more popular. Since 1997 these segmented tunnel linings are also constructed in the Netherlands but are difficult to accomplish in soft soils. Because of unexpected damages in the early constructed tunnels a full scale test set up has been build at the Delft University of Technology to obtain knowledge on the lining behaviour. The conducted tests were performed in the SLS in which it became clear that the joints in between the segments play an important role in the global lining behaviour. In order to asses the safety level of a concrete lining, and the ultimate load capacity, failure tests have been performed in the ULS. Generally a lining might fail due to concrete failure or by an ongoing rotation of the segment joints. With the aid of the collected test data a detailed description of the failure mechanisms is obtained. The influence of the segment <b>joints</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>joints</b> on the global lining behaviour is analysed especially at extreme loading conditions. Based on the measured segment joint rotations and lining deformations, interaction forces between adjoining rings are analysed. With the obtained knowledge on lining behaviour a FE model is developed in Diana for predicting internal forces and external deformations for loadings in the ULS. With the aid of this model different loading combinations can be analysed and eventually the influence of soil can be incorporated.

For modeling, the power criterion of stability with use of kinematic possible fields of speeds is applied to receiving the top assessment of effort of deformation. The developed model of kinematics of a plastic current allows to receive power parameters of the main condition of process of calibration by sinking and can be used for the solution of a task on stability of process of deformation by results of comparison of power (power) parameters for the main (steady) and indignant states. Modeling is made in cylindrical system of coordinates by comparison of options of kinematic possible fields of the speeds of a current meeting a condition of incompressibility and kinematic regional conditions. The result of the modeling was selected discontinuous field of high-speed, in which the decrease outer radius (R) occurs only by increasing the thickness of the pipe wall (t). For this option the size of pressure of sinking had the smallest value, therefore the chosen field of speeds closely to the valid. It is established that with increase in a step of giving 1 at calibration by the multisector tool the demanded pressure of sinking of q decreases. At an identical step of giving 1 pipe with the smaller relative thickness of (t/r) needs to be calibrated the smaller pressure of sinking.
