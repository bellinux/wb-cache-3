40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a development of Electromagnetic simulation tool for design of rectangular waveguide filter using inductive-capacitive <b>resonant</b> <b>iris</b> circuit. The simulation is designed and developed {{by using the}} electromagnetic wave propagation and iterative method to calculate the amplitude of waves in the frequency and spatial domain. The developed EM simulation, called WCD (Waveguide Circuit Design) consists of menu, designed, calculating and displayed windows which were designed by using GUI (Graphic User Interface) of MATLAB software. In this paper, the <b>resonant</b> <b>iris</b> circuit in the waveguide are simulated and compared to the CST Microwave Studio. The simulated results present correctly the circuit properties and electric and current distribution on the waveguide iris circuit. The results agree with theory, CST simulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{approximate}} analytical {{solution of}} the integral equation concerning the equivalent magnetic current in the narrow slot, coupling two electrodynamic volumes, has been obtained by the averaging method. The formulas and the plots for currents and the coupling coefficients of longitudinal and transverse slots in the common walls of rectangular waveguides are represented. By means of the induced magnetomotive forces method using basis functions of current distribution, obtained by the averaging method, the following electrodynamic structures have been considered: the electrically long longitudinal slot in the common broad wall of rectangular waveguides; two symmetrical transverse slots in the common broad wall of rectangular waveguides; the transverse slots system in the common broad wall of rectangular waveguides. The problem about the <b>resonant</b> <b>iris</b> with the arbitrary oriented slot in the plane of cross-section of a rectangular waveguide has been solved by the averaging method. The problem about stepped junction of two semi-infinite rectangular waveguides with the impedance slotted iris has been solved by the induced magnetomotive forces method. The analytical formulas for the distributed surface impedance of homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetodielectric coatings of iris surface have been obtained. For {{a greater number of}} the considered electrodynamic structures the calculated values are compared with the results, obtained by numerical methods (also using commercial programs) and the experimental data. 80 Nesterenko et al...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{waveguide}} Windows used {{in most of}} {{the high}} power microwave Tubes are of different types, namely the rectangular single block window, the multilayer window and the thin disc pillbox window. In this paper, the design of all the three types of windows is carried out in the X-band frequency. The design of the single block window has been carried out with inductive, capacitive and <b>resonant</b> type of <b>irises</b> to find their suitability for window applications. The results obtained from the equivalent circuit have been compared with that of results from the Electromagnetic software HFSS and presented for all the RF windows...|$|R
