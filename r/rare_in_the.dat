5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days. However snow is <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation is <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The 1932 {{eruption}} of Cerro Azul's Quizapu Crater reduced {{much of the}} land to a pumice desert. Above , vegetation becomes even more sparse.|$|E

5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E
5|$|Boron is <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universe {{and solar}} system due to trace {{formation}} in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.|$|E
5|$|Crime in Paris {{is similar}} to that in most large cities. Violent crime is {{relatively}} <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously.

5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the deposition of a brown or black radial band called a varix. This appears to be <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subgenus Syndromus, although the shell of A. laevus does show evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E
5|$|In the {{geologic}} record, the K–Pg {{event is}} marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K–Pg boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks.

5|$|The gill {{tissue is}} made of {{thin-walled}} hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to pale yellow, and measure 3–15µm wide. The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25µm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer's reagent.

40|$|Spinal {{subdural}} abscess (SSA) {{is a rare}} entity with unknown incidence. 1, 2 Most of them occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thoracic and lumbar spine, {{and they}} are much <b>rarer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical spine. 1 To date, around nine cases of cervical spine subdural collections have been reported. 1 – 3 Subdural collections comprise both intra-medullary and extramedullary abscesses. Intradural extra-medullary spinal cord abscesses are rare entities and even much <b>rarer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical spine. We hereby report a rare presentation of an intradural extramedullary abscess at the atlantoaxial level. These abscesses {{are associated with a}} high morbidity and mortality, and thus early diagnosis and emergent treatment are vital to prevent progression of neurological deficits and death. Cervical spine intradural abscesses also pose a further diagnostic challenge as their location makes them radiologi...|$|R

However, data of yttrium and <b>rare</b> earth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ge-poor coal of Wulantuga are absent.

5|$|A circovirus—given {{the name}} raven circovirus or RaCV—was {{isolated}} from an Australian raven suffering from feather lesions in 2006. It has affinities with canary circovirus (CaCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Its clinical significance is unknown. Tick infestation is <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian raven, with Ixodes holocyclus and Amblyomma triguttatum recorded. Lice and hippoboscid flies {{have been recorded}} yet little-researched, and an infestation by the fly Passeromyia longicornis was recorded in one nest.|$|E
5|$|Although N. rajah has a {{restricted}} distribution {{and is often}} quoted as a plant in peril, it is not <b>rare</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, N. rajah has a distinctive leaf shape {{making it difficult to}} illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed customs official should be able to identify it.|$|E
