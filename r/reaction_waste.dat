40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the <b>reaction,</b> <b>waste</b> sanitation using supercritical water oxidation controls requires a high level of strategy and design. A programmable logic controller was constructed using an Allen-Bradley 1756 ControlLogix controller and other industrial control components. This controller was chosen for its robustness and ease of integration with a multifaceted process. The supercritical water oxidation reaction has nearly fifty inputs and multiple outputs that are used to monitor and control the entire process. The responsibility of the control system ranges from process security and safety to adjusting mass flows of critical reaction components in order to reach a stoichiometric reaction balance. The controls system uses a sophisticated series of proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers to adjust the various control parameters such as reactor temperatures and reactant mass flows. Using a PID tuning method known as the Ziegler-Nichols method, the supercritical water oxidation reaction can be tuned and controlled to run as a self-sustaining waste sanitation unit. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{original}} synthetic routes devised for the synthesis of U (III) N involved the entire reaction taking place in liquid ammonia. Several experimental reactions were conducted {{in an attempt to}} synthesize the UI 3 (NH 3) x and U(NH 2) 3 (NH 3) x precursors of U(III) N. Each attempt involved cleaning of the uranium metal to remove the oxide coating of the metal reagent with 3 washes of concentrated nitric acid, each followed by a rinse with liquid ammonia. Success of this cleaning procedure was varied, with a majority of cleaned metal oxidizing rapidly once in contact with the liquid ammonia, despite the precautions taken to eliminate oxygen contamination in the reaction flasks. Due to the continual presence of oxide coating of the uranium metal, it was decided to alter the proposed synthetic route to utilize the synthesis of the UI- 3 (THF) 4 precursor, as described in Inorganic Chemistry. This involves the purification of THF through distillation, cleaning of the metal uranium, and slow reaction of U and I 2. Equipment to perform this synthesis was not available for immediate use, but all necessary glassware was purchased. It was discovered that the uranium metal turnings being used for the synthesis had a possibility of containing niobium as well. Waste solutions were analyzed by ICP-AES, and no niobium was identified. Other <b>reaction</b> <b>waste</b> solutions were also analyzed {{in order to determine the}} reactivity of uranium in the liquid ammonia solution. These analyses determined that only a minimal amount of uranium became dissolved, indicating that either there was little reactivity in the liquid ammonia or the reaction was only taking place on the surface of the metal. Neither of these possibilities is desirable, therefore the synthetic route involving THF was selected to avoid these outcomes...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} project we investigated {{the feasibility of}} incorporating organic solvent nanofiltration techniques with peptide synthesis and developed the Membrane Enhanced Peptide Synthesis process – the MEPS process. Two membranes had been identified to be applicable for the MEPS process to separate the peptide building block from post <b>reaction</b> <b>waste.</b> These are the commercially available Inopor ZrO 2 /Al 2 O 3 hydrophobic membrane and the cross-linked polyimide membrane that had been fabricated in our laboratory. Two penta-peptides were synthesized on a soluble polymeric support to demonstrate the principle of MEPS process. The purity and yields of these penta-peptides were excellent when compared with one synthesized using the Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis (LPPS) and Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) processes. To improve the quality and supply of membrane for the MEPS process a number of membrane fabrication parameters were investigated. This investigation demonstrated ways of manipulating {{the performance of the}} cross-linked polyimide membrane which gives engineers the opportunity to tailor make polymeric membrane to meet the requirement of the MEPS process. This membrane optimisation provides the MEPS process with a constant supply of reproducible membrane and allows this process to be further developed into a highly repeatable process. Other soluble polymeric support products were also been investigated in an attempt to avoid product contamination by PEGylated waste. Peptide chains were built onto a degradable polymeric support and once the desired peptide sequence had completed, the polymeric support was then completely hydrolysed in acid to obtain a high purity peptide product. Results showed this simple idea was not as straight forward to perform as expected. It demonstrated that the idea was possible and has great potential but further development is required. A number of recommendations have been suggested for further improvement and optimisation of this newly developed MEPS process. Not only these are related to the enhancement of the membrane stability, improvement in peptide crude purity and product yield, but also other potential applications of the MEPS principle.

40|$|The {{installation}} of complex functional groups {{through the use}} of C-H oxidation methodologies has the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency of synthetic sequences with respect to resources, time and overall steps to key intermediates. This work describes methods that target complex intermediates to show the scope, wide functional group tolerance, and streamlining utility of our allylic C-H oxidation chemistry. In general, functional groups are installed in complex molecules through the advent of sequential C-C bond forming reactions. This chemistry is not only well known, but has been employed for decades, resulting in the wide array of reaction conditions and electrophile/nucleophile pairs seen in the literature today. In contrast, the deliberate {{installation of}} functional groups through unactivated C-H bonds represents a new strategy for the construction of complex intermediates. Previously, we have reported that the use ???-olefins, as an inert and readily available functional group handle, allows for the direct installation of allylic acetates via a Pd(II) catalysis. A clever implementation of this strategy shows its utility and ability to streamline the synthesis of known molecules (e. g. L-galatose). Further exploration of this reaction manifold gives rise to a linear allylic oxidation method requiring only coupling levels of almost any carboxylic acid to render linear (E) -allylic esters. A significant problem with the Pd(II) allylic C-H oxidation reaction is the need for super-stoichiometric amounts of the oxidant benzoquinone. By employing a Co(II) Salophen catalyst, hydroquinone (the byproduct of benzoquinone oxidation) can be converted to benzoquinone using only molecular oxygen as terminal oxidant. This second catalytic system was found to be compatible with our allylic C-H oxidation reaction conditions and allows for the use of only catalytic amounts of the palladium-specific oxidant, thereby greatly reducing <b>reaction</b> <b>waste.</b> This process appears to be a general solution and can also be employed with the intera- and inter-molecular allylic C-H amination reactions developed in our lab...|$|E

This PhD project aims to characterise various aged blended cement grouts utilised in the encapsulation of radioactive wastes. The grouts have been modified by the incorporation of simulant wastes produced to allow comparison with current in-service waste formulations. The grouts were analysed using a multi-technique approach to assess the reactions which have occurred within the cement matrix and their significance for successful encapsulation of the waste. The samples underwent investigation after long-term storage using a variety of techniques including thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This suite of techniques allowed for the identification of various crystalline and amorphous phases produced during the hydration process and thereafter. Comparison was then made with similar samples containing no simulant waste to contrast the findings and possible effects upon the cement matrix and understand the implications for long-term storage. The blended cement samples showed a varying level of modification due to the inclusion of the simulant wastes. It was shown a major controlling factor was the relative solubility of the waste-form.
