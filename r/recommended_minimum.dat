5|$|Hamilton {{completed}} the second Grand Slam {{of his career}} by winning the race, taking pole position, setting the fastest lap and leading every lap of the race. He finished 25 seconds ahead of Vettel, while Felipe Massa finished third for Williams. Rosberg retired with three laps to go due to an engine failure, resulting in Hamilton extending his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 53 points. Hamilton's victory was confirmed {{a few hours after}} the race following an investigation from race stewards after it was discovered that the left-rear tyre on his Mercedes was below Pirelli's <b>recommended</b> <b>minimum</b> tyre pressure standards in a random check but due to procedural inconsistencies, no sanctions were imposed against either Mercedes driver or the team.|$|E
5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} great majority were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the <b>recommended</b> <b>minimum.</b> Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E

25|$|Fluids {{that have}} low {{electrical}} conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine {{as fast as}} they are separated and hence electrostatic charge accumulation is not significant. In the petrochemical industry, 50 pS/m is the <b>recommended</b> <b>minimum</b> value of electrical conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{charging}} mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines—a process called flow electrification.

In non-accumulators, charges recombine {{as fast as}} they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant.

There are five natural gas-fired steam boilers that have rated capacities ranging from 40, 000 lb/hr to 100, 000 lb/hr at an operating pressure of 125 psig.
