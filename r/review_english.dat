40|$|It is a {{challenging}} task to identify sentiment polarity of Chinese reviews because the resources for Chinese sentiment analysis are limited. Instead of leveraging only monolingual Chinese knowledge, this study proposes {{a novel approach}} to leverage reliable English resources to improve Chinese sentiment analysis. Rather than simply projecting English resources onto Chinese resources, our approach first translates Chinese <b>reviews</b> into <b>English</b> <b>reviews</b> by machine translation services, and then identifies the sentiment polarity of <b>English</b> <b>reviews</b> by directly leveraging English resources. Furthermore, our approach performs sentiment analysis for both Chinese <b>reviews</b> and <b>English</b> <b>reviews,</b> and then uses ensemble methods to combine the individual analysis results. Experimental results on a dataset of 886 Chinese product reviews demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach. The individual analysis of the translated <b>English</b> <b>reviews</b> outperforms the individual analysis of the original Chinese reviews, and the combination of the individual analysis results further improves the performance. ...|$|R

50|$|The Act created two Commissions; the Law Commission of England and Wales to <b>review</b> <b>English</b> {{law and the}} Scottish Law Commission {{to review}} Scots law. The English {{commission}} has five Commissioners, including a Chairman, all appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The Commissioners are to have experience working in the legal profession, by legal academics or be members of the judiciary. Each Commissioner sits for five years, although they may resign at any point and still be eligible for reappointment. The Scots Commission has a similar make-up.|$|E
50|$|Instead, a Royal Commission {{was set up}} to <b>review</b> <b>English</b> local {{government}} entirely, and its report (known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report) proposed a much wider Merseyside metropolitan area covering southwest Lancashire and northwest Cheshire, extending as far south as Chester and as far north as the River Ribble. This would have included four districts: Southport/Crosby, Liverpool/Bootle, St. Helens/Widnes and Wirral/Chester. In 1970 the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (which operates today under the Merseytravel brand) was set up, covering Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral and Knowsley, but excluding Southport and St. Helens.|$|E

5000|$|Scholars have {{occasionally}} interpreted Lord Coke's {{ruling in}} Dr. Bonham's Case as implying {{the possibility of}} judicial review, but by the 1870s, Lord Campbell was dismissing judicial review as [...] "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially in Dr. Bonham's Case..., a conundrum that {{ought to have been}} laughed at." [...] Lacking the power of judicial <b>review,</b> <b>English</b> courts possessed no means by which to declare government statutes or actions invalid as a violation of due process. In contrast, American legislators and executive branch officers possessed virtually no means by which to overrule judicial invalidation of statutes or actions as due process violations, with the sole exception of proposing a constitutional amendment, which are rarely successful. [...] As a consequence, English law and American law diverged. Unlike their English counterparts, American judges became increasingly assertive about enforcing due process of law. In turn, the legislative and executive branches learned how to avoid such confrontations in the first place, by tailoring statutes and executive actions to the constitutional requirements of due process as elaborated upon by the judiciary.|$|E
