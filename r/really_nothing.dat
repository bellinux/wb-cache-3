500|$|The Hungry Saw {{contains}} twelve tracks {{with a total}} {{running time}} of forty-six minutes. Critics noted that the music on the album was {{a continuation of the}} sound that Tindersticks had been exploring since 1999's soul-influenced Simple Pleasure, with PopMatters stating that [...] "the revamped band sound(s) much like it has since 1999, when they gave up on grandiosity...the paired-down sound of The Hungry Saw is <b>really</b> <b>nothing</b> new." [...] Reviews for The Hungry Saw described the album as containing [...] "foreboding, compelling soul", and [...] "blue-eyed/black-lung balladry with classic soul touches-- warm Hammond organ tones, tambourine-rattled rhythms, female back-up singers" [...] that were [...] "remarkably in tune with contemporary British pop music's neo-soul slant".|$|E

500|$|The suburb is {{bisected}} principally by the A184. Built in 1959, {{the road}} is {{commonly referred to as}} the Felling bypass though it [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>nothing</b> of the kind" [...] as the road splits residential areas of Felling almost neatly in half. Journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre from the western fringe is approximately seven minutes and twelve minutes into the centre of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, while the journey time from the eastern parts of Felling is approximately ten minutes longer. Until the building of the bypass, the principal road in the settlement was B1426 Sunderland Road; a former turnpike road and tram route where civic and commercial buildings still stand as a testament to the road's past importance. While diminished in stature today, Sunderland Road remains an integral local distributor.|$|E

Morrison sings of lost love, death, and nostalgia for childhood in the Celtic soul that would become his signature." [...] It {{has been placed on}} many lists of best albums of all time. In the 1995 Mojo list of 100 Best Albums, it was listed as number two and was number nineteen on the Rolling Stone magazine's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. In December 2009, it was voted the top Irish album of all time by a poll of leading Irish musicians conducted by Hot Press magazine.|$|E
500|$|... 'Parthian frontality', {{as we are}} now {{accustomed}} to call it, deeply differs both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for {{a small number of}} traditional characters of cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is <b>really</b> <b>nothing</b> but the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even at the expense (as it seems to us moderns) of clearness and intelligibility. So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment de facto of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of things seems to have become established {{in the course of the}} 1st century A.D.|$|E

Billy Johnson, Jr of Yahoo! Music wrote: [...] "Kenzo Digital, who spent a month creating Beyoncé's interactive video, told Yahoo!

It's a technique in video art since the 80s in terms of frontal projection and interactive things. That's <b>really</b> <b>nothing</b> new. It's not even a new technology.

500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was <b>really</b> <b>nothing</b> they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E
500|$|Allgame felt Nuclear Strike [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>nothing</b> {{more than}} a repackaged version of the earlier game". The {{reviewer}} felt there to be limited motivation for owners of Soviet Strike to buy the new sequel other than the FMV. GameFan called Nuclear Strike [...] "a tangible improvement over its predecessor" [...] and [...] "a more satisfying experience all round." [...] The writer felt the increased number of vehicles set the game apart from Soviet Strike, saying they [...] "make for a far richer, more active playing experience." [...] He recommended it to Soviet Strike devotees, while Power Play recommended it for fans of action games. IGN wrote the game was a [...] "fine example" [...] of the series, also citing {{a broader range of}} vehicles over Soviet Strike. Nonetheless it gave Nuclear Strike a lower score than the game's predecessor, saying [...] "at its heart Nuclear Strike is the same game as Soviet Strike [...] It's not a bad game, it's just more of the same." [...] GameFan's reviewers called Nuclear Strike [...] "the definitive strike game" [...] and said it [...] "trounces all other Strikes that have come before." [...] Previewing the PlayStation version, Super GamePower predicted the improved explosion effects, missions and wider range of vehicles would make it the best in the series. In its review, the magazine said the game contained nothing new for fans of the previous games, but felt the control system, explosions, helicopter sound effects to be excellent. Next Generation said: [...] "Those who enjoyed Soviet Strike are certain to like Nuclear Strike even more", but said the games are almost indistinguishable. Game Revolution acknowledged the game is [...] "basically the same rehash of its predecessors, but it stands as a great game on its own. Nuclear Strike is a definite buy for fans who haven't tired of the series, and at least a 'rent me' for those who have been locked in the closet and haven't played any 'Strike' games." [...] Edge said: [...] "Fans of the series lusting after more above-viewed shooting action will naturally welcome this latest regurgitation. The seasoned gamer, however, will no doubt walk away with a feeling of déja vu." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{three and a}} half out of five stars saying that its {{construction}} is [...] "as perfect as it could be." [...] It doesn't [...] "deviate" [...] from Dion's mainstream audience, yet it [...] "dips its toe" [...] into modern music, particularly dance, while [...] "keeping hip" [...] ("Nature Boy"). Although Erlewine described [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] as [...] "bizarre", he wrote that [...] "there's <b>really</b> <b>nothing</b> to fault it on, actually," [...] the album is [...] "more ambitious than it needs to be, covers more stylistic territory than any other Dion record, while never abandoning the middle-of-the-road; it's a balancing act that nobody since Barbra Streisand has been able to pull off." [...] According to Erlewine, the songs aren't [...] "that particularly memorable", [...] "the mood shifts effortlessly, it never seems to stay in one place," [...] but it [...] "never catches hold, either." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave A New Day Has Come three out of five stars. According to him, Dion is great at what she does and [...] "if she ever tried anything too edgy she'd probably just sound foolish." [...] Cinquemani disliked [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] but praised [...] "Sorry for Love" [...] on which Dion [...] "gets the Cher treatment", an unexpected [...] "change of pace that actually works." [...] Among other highlights he mentioned two covers, a [...] "soulful" [...] rendition of [...] "At Last" [...] and a [...] "simple and moving" [...] arrangement of [...] "Nature Boy". He also noticed that the album is [...] "packed" [...] with the usual adult contemporary songs: [...] "I Surrender", a power ballad [...] "only a singer with Dion's voice could pull off," [...] "Ten Days", the guitar-driven [...] "catchy pop-rocker with a surprisingly edgy vocal," [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", a track featuring Shania Twain on backing vocals that [...] "will leave you nauseous or in tears", [...] "I'm Alive", the [...] "uplifting" [...] midtempo number and [...] "A New Day Has Come", the [...] "stirring" [...] title track.|$|E
