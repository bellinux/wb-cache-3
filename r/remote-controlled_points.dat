As before, these were available in either 4.5 V (battery powered) or 12 V (mains powered), but with a much wider variety of accessories, including working lights, <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>points</b> and signals, and decouplers.|$|E

The <b>remote-controlled</b> <b>points</b> were replaced by resetting points, supported by train-controlled entry and distant colour light signals. The station building and goods shed still exist but are used for private purposes.|$|E
