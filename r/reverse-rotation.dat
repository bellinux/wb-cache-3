5000|$|The intake manifold, <b>reverse-rotation</b> turbocharger, jet oil coolers, oil pump, manual transmission, special ecu tuning, {{intercooler}} size, {{and weight}} {{are the only}} differences between those cars. The cast-aluminum 8-row Valeo intercooler is mounted in the front, and the <b>reverse-rotation</b> Mitsubishi TD04LR-16Gk turbocharger has a 6 cm2 turbine inlet. The turbocharger compressor housing features a built-in bypass valve, and the turbo housing is cast into the exhaust manifold with a loop-around flow pattern. The stock SRT-4 has a maximum boost level of [...] But, varies boost level based on knock sensor readings. Higher octane fuel results in less knock and higher boost levels.|$|E
5000|$|Kline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2004) {{confirmed}} {{the observation of}} reversed rotation with regularly spaced dots on a rotating drum. They called this [...] "illusory motion reversal". They showed that these occurred only after a long time of viewing the rotating display (from about 30 seconds to as long as 10 minutes for some observers). They also showed that the incidences of reversed rotation were independent {{in different parts of}} the visual field. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering the entire visual scene. Kline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2006) also showed that reversed rotation of a radial grating in one part of the visual field was independent of superimposed orthogonal motion in the same part of the visual field. The orthogonal motion was of a circular grating contracting so as to have the same temporal frequency as the radial grating. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering local parts of visual scene. Kline et al. concluded that the reverse rotations were consistent with Reichardt detectors for the reverse direction of rotation becoming sufficiently active to dominate perception of the true rotation in a form of rivalry. The long time required to see the reverse rotation suggests that neural adaptation of the detectors responding to the true rotation has to occur before the weakly stimulated <b>reverse-rotation</b> detectors can contribute to perception.|$|E
