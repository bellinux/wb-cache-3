50|$|Sometimes, when {{multiple}} or competing alternative operationalizations for {{the same}} phenomenon are available, one can repeat the analysis {{with all of the}} operationalizations one after the other, to see if the results are impacted by different operationalizations. This is often called conducting a <b>robustness</b> <b>check.</b> If the results are (substantially) unchanged, the results are said to be robust against certain alternative operationalizations of the checked variables. The concept of operationalization was first presented by the British physicist N. R. Campbell in his 'Physics: The Elements' (Cambridge, 1920). This concept next spread to humanities and social sciences. It remains in use in physics.|$|E
5000|$|In a field study, Casella and her co-authors {{tried to}} assess the {{potential}} effect of introducing Storable Votes in actual elections. In the spring of 2006, they attached a short survey to students' election ballots in two different schools at Columbia University, asking students to rank the importance assigned to all binary contests on the ballot, and to indicate where they would have cast an additional bonus vote, had one been available. An identifier connected responses and actual voting choices, allowing the authors to construct distributions of intensities and to propose welfare measures of the electoral outcomes, both without and with the bonus vote. Bootstrapping techniques provided estimates of the bonus vote's probable impact. Because the bonus vote choices indicated by the survey respondents were hypothetical only, as a <b>robustness</b> <b>check,</b> the authors analyzed the bootstrap samples relying {{not only on the}} survey responses but also on three alternative plausible rules for casting the bonus vote. For each of the four cases, they estimated three measures: ...|$|E
