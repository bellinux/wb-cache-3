40|$|The lack of {{coordination}} in the resolution of multinational banks has led to demands for the increased centralization of resolution regimes. However, as this paper argues, the anticipation of resolution procedures affects the incentives of host countries to impose capital standards on their <b>resident</b> <b>banks.</b> Critically, it is shown that overall welfare can even be decreased by introducing a centralized resolution regime without fully centralizing capital requirements. As, {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis, only countries that are not part of a supranational resolution regime unilaterally and significantly increased the capital requirements for their largest <b>resident</b> <b>banks,</b> this paper can help to understand and study the heterogeneity of the observed regulatory approaches...|$|E
40|$|Degree of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) The recent {{crisis has}} {{underlined}} {{the importance of}} sound bank liquidity management. In response, regulators are devising new liquidity standards {{with the aim of}} making the financial system more stable and resilient. In this research, the researcher analyzes the impact of liquid asset holdings on bank profitability for a sample of 5 Sri Lankan <b>resident</b> <b>banks</b> from the period of 2006 - 2010. Results suggest that profitability is improved for banks that hold some liquid assets, however, there is a point at which holding further liquid assets diminishes a banks' profitability, all else equal. Moreover, empirical evidence also suggests that this relationship varies depending on a bank's business model and the state of the economy. These results are particularly relevant as policymakers devise new standards establishing an appropriate level of liquidity for banks. While it is generally agreed upon that banks undervalued liquidity prior to the recent financial crisis, one must also consider the tradeoff between resilience to liquidity shocks and the cost of holding lower-yielding liquid assets as the latter may impact banks' ability to generate revenues, increase capital and extend credi...|$|E

30|$|Many {{studies have}} found that non-interest income derived from {{diversification}} of bank activities increases the bank risk. For example, Delpachitra and Lester (2013) used a sample of nine Australian-owned banks out of the twelve listed banks for the period 2000 – 2009 to study the effects of diversification of bank performance. Empirical results suggest that non interest income and revenue diversifications reduced profitability and did not improve the overall default risk of banks. They have concluded that non-interest income activities would not benefit banks. In another study, Williams and Prather (2010) focused on the effect of noninterest income on the bank risk-return. To this end, they have used 49 banks in Australia, which account for over 65 % of Australian <b>resident</b> <b>banking</b> assets. As major findings, fee-based income seems to be riskier than margin income but offers diversification benefits to bank shareholders.|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of risk to natural hazards {{is a very complex}} topic and there are multiple factors that influence it. However, two factors have generally been overlooked. Through the use of mail-out surveys of residents in Beaufort County and Dare County, North Carolina, this research explores how risk perception varies with location and addresses how changes in the characteristics of a hurricane influence the {{perception of}} their risk to hurricanes. Location is addressed using two definitions. The first definition used the physical location of the <b>resident</b> (either Inner <b>Banks</b> or Outer Banks), while the second definition used the anticipated impacts from the hurricane (flooding, storm surge, wind damage). This created three locational factors that were tested for their association with risk perception. Hurricane Irene provides an interesting case study because of the change in track and intensity prior to landfall.   	Using the Chi Square Test for Association, the results show a significant difference in risk perception with location. Based on location on either the Inner Banks or Outer Banks, risk perception varies with respect to the issued advisories. Based on residing in one of the damage areas, risk perception varies with hazards associated with hurricanes. Results also show that track change and intensity change influence the {{perception of risk}}. Based on track change, Inner <b>Banks</b> <b>residents</b> believed they were at greater risk and had increases in their perceptions of personal risk. However, based on intensity change, Outer <b>Banks</b> <b>residents</b> perceived themselves to be at more risk than did Inner <b>Banks</b> <b>residents.</b> Overall, a majority of respondents believed that the track change increased the hazards associated with hurricanes, while the intensity reduction decreased them. While both location and damage area show their own associations with risk perception, combining location with damage area presents a broader picture of how risk perception varies with location.   M.
