40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyReelwell Riserless {{drilling}} {{concept has}} been proposed to overcome the economic challenge of drilling through the thick salt layer. The concept shall bases on RDM method, which is a new drilling method with the concentric drill string other special design tool such as Rotating control devices and Double float valve. The concentric drill string consists of outer conventional pipe joints an inner string specially designed for RDM that shall allow the “return” through the inner pipe. This shall eliminate the need of marine riser, which results in significant cost savings by exclusion of riser related costs and enables us to use smaller rigs with much lower day rate for ultra deep-water drilling operations. There {{would also be a}} considerable mud cost reduction and rig space saving as there is no riser to be filled up with drilling mud. The study has reviewed the conventional drilling procedure, the case study's working condition and defined the Basic Design of Subsea BOP stack with <b>Rotating</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> for Reelwell-Riserless drilling, to achieve reasonable reliability and performance to mitigate risk in the operation. The BOP control system is also reviewed and proposed a new technology to improve its efficiency in the new working environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploration}} and development {{of oil and gas}} reserves located in harsh offshore environments are characterized with high risk. Some of these reserves would be uneconomical if produced using conventional drilling technology due to increased drilling problems and prolonged non-productive time. Seeking new ways to reduce drilling cost and minimize risks has {{led to the development of}} Managed Pressure Drilling techniques. Managed pressure drilling methods address the drawbacks of conventional overbalanced and underbalanced drilling techniques. As managed pressure drilling techniques are evolving, there are many unanswered questions related to safety and operating pressure regimes. Quantitative risk assessment techniques are often used to answer these questions. Quantitative risk assessment is conducted for the various stages of drilling operations – drilling ahead, tripping operation, casing and cementing. A diagnostic model for analyzing the <b>rotating</b> <b>control</b> <b>device,</b> the main component of managed pressure drilling techniques, is also studied. The logic concept of Noisy-OR is explored to capture the unique relationship between casing and cementing operations in leading to well integrity failure as well as its usage to model the critical components of constant bottom-hole pressure drilling technique of managed pressure drilling during tripping operation. Relevant safety functions and inherent safety principles are utilized to improve well integrity operations. Loss function modelling approach to enable dynamic consequence analysis is adopted to study blowout risk for real-time decision making. The aggregation of the blowout loss categories, comprising: production, asset, human health, environmental response and reputation losses leads to risk estimation using dynamically determined probability of occurrence. Lastly, various sub-models developed for the stages/sub-operations of drilling operations and the consequence modelling approach are integrated for a holistic risk analysis of drilling operations...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringManaged Pressure Drilling (MPD) is a {{relatively}} young technology that has improved some old ideas of Underbalanced Drilling (UBD). According to the IADC, MPD is an “adaptive process used to precisely control the annular pressure profile throughout the wellbore. The goal is to ascertain the downhole pressure environment limits and to manage the annular pressure profile accordingly”. In other words the main aim of MPD is to avoid continuous influx of formation fluids to the surface by maintaining a state of effective overbalance. It’s done by applying surface backpressure during drilling ahead or shut-in to make a connection of jointed pipe. Basic tools required to conduct MPD are: a <b>rotating</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> (RCD), drillstring non-return valves and dedicated choke manifold. MPD allows drilling through the un-drillable in conventional way formations, helps to reduce non productive time (NPT) and to overcome several drilling problems like: drilling with narrow “pressure window” and kick-loss scenarios caused by narrow margins, excessive casing program, low ROP, excessive mud cost caused {{by the loss of}} circulation, failure to reach TD with large enough hole diameter and shallow geohazards both with drilling riserless and with casing or marine riser. This technology enables manage pressures through the wellbore in more precise way than conventional drilling and there are several strong indicators that MPD in marine environments will be a breakthrough technology in offshore industry in the next years. It’s a big chance for MPD to be best solution for drilling in reservoirs with narrow pressure window, drilling with troublesome zones, depleted reservoirs, HP/HT reservoirs and to overcome almost all offshore drilling-related challenges. Therefore the main objective of this Master’s Thesis is to evaluate both technical and economical feasibility of using Managed Pressure Drilling technology from a floating drilling rig on the Skarv/Idun field on the NCS. Furthermore to show which MPD variation is most suitable on this field, equipment needed to conduct MPD operations, evaluates reservoir and drilling related benefits and assess which drilling problems can be avoided using Managed Pressure Drilling technology...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} a dual gradient riser system, adapted for operations in the Gulf of Mexico and subjected to first- and second-order wave forces, current and rig/vessel motion. Deep water drilling in narrow pressure zones pose several challenges for handling well pressure. Using two separate fluid volumes, in {{what is known as}} a dual gradient drilling (DGD) solution, the hydrostatic well pressure can be reduced by managing the return flow. To separate these volumes and control the mud return, the riser must accommodate a device known as a <b>rotating</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> (RCD). The RCD and the well pressure system extends the capabilities of conventional drilling schemes allowing for operations in deeper water and narrower pressure zones. The two volumes are closed off using a sealing element in the RCD, which holds the differential pressure created by the drilling system. The seal operate in a hostile environment resulting in extensive wear originating from abrasive particles, the rotating drillpipe and dynamic forces from the sheltering riser. The abrasion related to friction contact is strongly coupled with the riser and drillpipe contact and prompt the need for a closer analysis of the forces occurring between them. The riser system and RCD is therefore modelled in SIMA/RIFLEX and a dynamic analysis is carried out to obtain the lateral drillpipe/riser contact forces, indirectly finding the forces affecting the seal element. The analysis results indicate that the lateral force is below 4 % of the seal element?s clamp force. The force magnitude is modest and will most likely have no significant impact on the operation. However, local forces and vibrations associated with resonance can create undesirable effects, which over time can lead to fatigue damage of the RCD and its subcomponents. Submerged equipment will be sensitive to range of resonance phenomena originating from the rig motions, second-order wave forces, current and vortex induced vibrations. This will encourage a review of the local dynamics and the potential use of riser control. Motivated by this, a finite element model is developed in Matlab/SIMULINK to study this in more detail. In order to de- tect resonance related vibrations, a modal decomposition model is formulated based on the finite element model. Using the modal model, a weighted estimate of the eigen frequencies active in the response can be provided to evaluate the resonance properties of the riser. To obtain {{a better understanding of the}} riser system and the control potential, a dynamic analysis of the models is carried out, focusing on low frequent rig/vessel motion. Both models are throughly verified using the commercial program RIFLEX, to ensure the sufficient accuracy. Inspired by the results from the analysis, control strategies based on manipulation of the resonance properties (modal con- trol) of the riser are examined, applied to a riser management system framework. The purpose of modal control is to increase safety margins and the operational economy, e. g. by reducing the time spent suspended because of seal element exchange or the risk for well head fatigue. Four different strategies based on manipulation of tension and position are proposed. Followed by a qualitative evaluation of the practical aspects, indicating that setpoint chasing and tension control are the most effective and attainable strategies available. The main contributions in this thesis are assessment of the lateral contact force associated with a deep water pipe-in-pipe dual gradient riser in the Gulf of Mexico, the development and verification of a extensive riser model using Matlab and SIMULINK, and the formulation of modal riser control for resonance vibrations in deep water drilling risers. </p...|$|E

40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated voltage control {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in voltage control mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective voltage control is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and (b) prioritised operation of different voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level. In most of the methods proposed in the literature, the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and DG units are tuned and coordinated online using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation. However, there is no mechanism to operationally minimize the interactions between DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in real-time between any two consecutive control states.
