Not only is {{a husband}} still liable for the wrongs {{committed}} by the wife whom he has no longer the power to restrain from committing them, but in many ways--in one very important way--his obligation to her remains intact after she has had the self-sacrifice to surrender all obligation to him. Moreover, if his wife has a separate estate he has to endure the pain of seeing it hedged about from her creditors (themselves not altogether happy in the contemplation) with restrictions which do not hamper the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> against his own. Doubtless all this is not without a softening effect upon his character, smoothing down his dispositional asperities and endowing him day by day with fresh accretions of humility. And that is good for him.

The charter also usually provide for <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> to the Queen in Council.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the case}} for amendments {{to be made to}} the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (‘the CA’) to afford Australian unitholders the same <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> as Australian shareholders under statutory oppression remedies. Australian unit trusts and companies operate under similar commercial conditions, and the types of disputes that arise concerning shareholders and unitholders are comparable. However, there are distinct structural differences between unit trusts and companies that affect the legal principles that apply to such disputes. Given these differences, the unit trust structure may not adequately protect the interests of the venturers if the business relationship breaks down. One of the most common forms of dispute in such circumstances involves allegations of oppressive conduct. For companies, Part 2 F. 1 of the CA (which contains the statutory oppression remedies) can provide effective relief to oppressed shareholders. In contrast, unit trusts are predominantly subject to traditional trust law principles, which lack tailored oppression remedies that shareholders enjoy under Part 2 F. 1. In particular, this thesis demonstrates that the grounds for securing relief under trust law principles are more difficult for oppressed unitholders to establish. Even where such grounds are successfully established, the remedies available are often inadequate to provide substantive and effective relief to unitholders. Notwithstanding the CA has only limited jurisdiction over unit trusts (especially private unit trusts), oppressed unitholders have sometimes sought relief under Part 2 F. 1 in an attempt to access more effective remedies than those available under trust law. While a number of earlier decisions determined unitholders are entitled to relief under Part 2 F. 1, it is argued that the judicial grounds used to support such relief are debatable, therefore the status of the law remains unclear. In addition, several recent court decisions have rejected these earlier findings. Such contradictory decisions expose the abstruseness of the legislation in this area. Therefore, with inadequate protections against oppression afforded to unitholders under trust law, it is submitted there is a strong argument for legislative reform, ideally by extending the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> unitholders to access statutory oppression remedies under Part 2 F. 1 of the CA...|$|R
5000|$|Struggle {{against foreign}} {{companies}} for natural resources - under {{the presidency of}} Porfirio Díaz, foreign mining and oil companies (chiefly United States companies) had received generous concessions from the government {{in order to develop}} natural resources. On 7 January 1915, Carranza issued a decree declaring his intention to return the wealth of oil and coal to the people of Mexico. The two largest oil companies exploiting Mexico's natural resources were the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company, an English company led by Lord Cowdray and operating mainly in the region of Poza Rica, Veracruz and Papantla, Veracruz; and Mexican Petroleum, an American company led by Edward L. Doheny and operating in the region of Tampico, Tamaulipas. Carranza was constrained in his actions because the region of La Huasteca where they operated was under the control of General Manuel Peláez, who protected the oil companies' interests in exchange for protection money from the oil companies. In terms of mining, Carranza implemented the Calvo Doctrine. He raised taxes on the mining companies, and removed the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> diplomatic <b>recourse</b> for mining companies, declaring their actions subject to the Mexican courts.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of specific features of administrative law and administrative tribunals, which influence the interpretation and application of the constitutional right to turn to a tribunal for a decision in administrative law. The constitutional <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> to court should be, in principle, understood equally in all branches of law, i. e. in the whole legal system. However, administrative law has a specific function and application, {{with the result that}} the activities of the administrative court are only secondary in relation to the activities of the organs of public administration. Moreover, administrative decisions are not of a substantive, but merely regulatory character. Consequently, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> to a tribunal within that branch of law may be construed differently. While a right to instigate administrative proceedings seems to be recognised, or legitimised, on the ground of legal interest, the concept of a claim differs, and the structuring o f the 'dispute' before an administrative tribunal is also different. The need for a different interpretation of the right to turn for an administrative decision does not mean that that right is in any particular way, restricted. Certain limitations do, however, occur, when it comes to more detailed regulations, which are analysed more thoroughly {{in the second part of}} the paper concluding with a proposition that the currently binding regulations should be gradually improved in order to ascertain a full and effective <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> to a court in administrative law...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} {{means of}} extincting a suretyship is constituted by the creditor’ act, {{in this case}} the bank, which allowed the loss of the rights and securities he had against the principal debtor and in which the surety was going to subrogate. The fault of the bank according to the analyzed case-law is that the bankruptcy procedure for the principal debtor was already opened and thus he was too late in lodging claims and did not gain the statute of creditor entitled to participate to the bankruptcy proceedings. The surety’s <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> against the principal debtor, through subrogation, in order to obtain from him the repayment of the amounts paid to the bank-creditor comes in conflict with the creditor’s act. Following the non-registration of the bank on the statement of assets and liabilities of the debtor undergoing bankruptcy, the surety is deprived of the possibility to legally subrogate to his rights and securities. The extinction of the suretyship consequently acts as sanction for the bank that allowed the loss of the rights and securities it had against the principal debtor and blocked the surety’s possibility to exercise the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> and subrogate to the rights of the bank to recover from the bankrupt debtor the amounts paid to the creditor...|$|E

Despite the fact that innovations have been highly successful in the market and generated substantial profits, it has not been uncommon that some of them ended up in a disaster. A treacherous feature of innovations is that they can “bite back” (see (Tenner 1996)). Due to the epistemic bounds on fully recognizing the implications of innovations, the negative effects often only turn out with a considerable time delay. Adopters of the innovation who realize them as diluting their contractual situation may exercise a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> and induce others not to buy the innovation.

40|$|In its case-law, the European Court <b>of</b> Human <b>Rights</b> has usually {{protected}} the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> access to court because of unacceptable legal stands {{taken by the}} courts of the contracting states.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of the international scope {{and nature of the}} problem of refugees, which induced the establishment of UNHCR and the adoption of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, did not result in shared responsibility for the protection of refugees but rather in a strict apportioning of responsibilities between UNHCR on the one hand, and states on the other. Rather than sharing the apportioned part as a collective responsibility, states become individually responsible for refugees who seek refuge in their respective territories, and hence only for part of the problem of refugees. This individual responsibility is triggered by observing the prohibition of refoulement. Since this prohibition is not coupled to a distributive mechanism, its observance may cause huge disparities in terms of numbers of refugees, and hence in the extent of responsibility individual states incur. Remedying these indiscriminate effects would require taking collective responsibility for the problem of refugees, more in particular, a system that would secure joint and several responsibility whereby individual states have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> to other states to recover ‘overpayment’, in short: a non-discretionary burden sharing mechanism that involves all states...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} asked by this thesis is when and why, {{as a matter}} of principle, should there be judicial scrutiny on the merits of administrative decisions on migration status (âmigration status decisionsâ) in the United Kingdom? It argues that this is a moral question, engaging concerns of fair treatment. The first two chapters examine the question theoretically. It is argued that access to justice is not a gift of citizenship and that migration status decision-making should be reviewable on the merits to avoid the appearance and/or occurrence of injustice {{in the light of the}} effects of migration control on individual migrants and the nature of migration status decision-making as âvery imperfect procedural justiceâ (save where a decision is not based on the judgment discretion of an administrator). The latter five chapters apply the normative claims to the United Kingdom constitutional context, including the relevant European regimes (European Convention on Fundamental Rights and European Union). First, as background to the argument, a history <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> from migration status decision-making in the UK from the initial establishment of a review system in 1905 is sketched out. The history demonstrates the absence of a coherent or principled account of migration status appeals. The history is followed by a three-part critique of the current system <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> in the UK. First <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> appeal in three case studies (deportation, offshore visitors and students) are examined. Secondly, the three standards of review available under judicial review (rationality, anxious scrutiny and proportionality) are critiqued, and thirdly, the contribution of European and international norms is considered. In general terms the thesis concludes that the current UK system <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> is deficient in certain respects and suggests reform to the current appeals system...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{questioning}} {{if the state}} as an unsecured creditor in a bankruptcy proceeding, according {{to the principle of}} equal treatment, has the same rights as the other unsecured creditors. The principle of equal treatment means that creditors with unsecured claims are supposed to have mutually equal rights to dividends in a bankruptcy. In the Swedish bankruptcy law from 1987 there are recycling rules which means that some legal actions taken by the bankrupt debtor before the bankruptcy can be recycled to the bankruptcy estate. These rules do not apply on taxes. This essay analyzes whether the state should have this advantage or not. Another issue that’s discussed in this essay {{is whether or not the}} opinion of the Court of Appeal that a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> on a claim for a paid Governmental wage guarantee exists before a bankruptcy should be established by the Supreme Court. This essay also analyzes if the rule which statutes that a company representative can become personally liable for the company tax debts should be abolished or not, since this rule means that the taxes on a larger scale than other claims are paid before the bankruptcy...|$|E
40|$|Tuned up mopeds and light-mopeds {{involved}} in accidents; interview {{study of the}} settlement of such accidents {{by the police and}} insurance companies. Research has shown that many mopedists and light-mopedists ride faster than their speed limit allows. This is often the results of having tuned up their mopeds. This is illegal in The Netherlands. It could work preventatively if insurance companies were to use the so-called ‘right of recourse’, in this case because the vehicle involved had been tuned up. The present study deals with the following research questions: (1) Which procedure does the police follow if a (light-) moped {{involved in}} an accident has been tuned up? We refer specifically to the technical inspection and the summons. (2) How do insurance companies use the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> if it appears that the (light-) moped involved had been tuned up? To answer the first question, the results were used of a 1999 SWOV study of serious accidents involving (light-) mopeds. What makes this study so special is that the policeman who had registered such an accident was telephoned for further information about that accident. For the present further study, a number of police stations were telephoned again, but only concerning the technical inspections. This further study established that the police issues a summons if a (light-) moped involved in an accident had been tuned up. Insurance companies can obtain such summonses together with the appropriate accident registration forms. This means that the insurance companies do not have to conduct a technical inspection to establish whether or not the (light-) moped involved in an accident had been tuned up. To answer the second question, three insurance companies were asked how they usually settled a claim for (material) damages. It was determined that insurance companies sometimes attempt to get the damages paid out to (light-) mopeds repaid, if it appears that the vehicles had been tuned up. This often leads to problems because the (light-) mopedists concerned do not have the money to reimburse the company. Insurance companies are recommended to be more consistent {{with the use of the}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse.</b> Intensive contacts between young people will, anyway, lead to experiences with the rules governing damage payments being discussed in greater depth. It is also recommended that insurance policy terms be explained, using clear examples. This will increase the knowledge of the exclusions in the policy terms. It is desirable that general publicity about this subject be spread, together with attention for the theory certificate. It is further recommended that insurance companies agree uniformly what is meant by ‘tune up’. It can be assumed that the settlement of damages and publicity about this subject will then be more effective...|$|E
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is {{the first}} global market {{mechanism}} in international environmental law. It has been much lauded for its success. However, doubts whether the CDM governance structure is robust enough {{to meet the challenges}} of regulating an international market mechanism in the long term are emerging. The Executive Board (EB) 's decision-making practice is often not predictable and many of its decisions have come as a surprise to project participants and technical project experts. Members of the EB often have multiple responsibilities which result in a complicated situation of conflicting interests. Finally, private sector participants in the CDM who have been aversely affected by EB decisions have no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recourse</b> and essentially little if any due process rights. This article argues that incorporating mechanisms to promote procedural fairness and creating an appeals process for aggrieved CDM participants will promote transparency and accountability in the CDM decision-making processes. This is essential for the sound operation of the CDM regulatory regime which will have a direct positive effect on the international carbon market. After conducting a comparative analysis of other regimes in which international bodies take decisions that directly affect individuals, most notably the system of targeted sanctions of the UN Security Council and the Anti-Doping Regime, as well as examining the World Bank Inspection Panel and the European Ombudsman as models of international review mechanisms, the authors set out proposals for reform of the CDM, including professionalizing the EB and the panels, securing better and more consistent funding, the elimination of political interference, and the introduction of administrative law-like processes. © The European Journal of International Law Vol. 19 no. 2 EJIL 2008; all rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|What power do {{the federal}} courts have to supply tribal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> action when Congress has been silent? This Article answers that {{question}} by linking two seemingly disparate schools of thought: federal Indian law and tort theory. Focusing upon tribal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> action forces us to correct significant misunderstandings about perennial debates concerning corrective justice, distributive justice, reparations, and the law of remedies. My thesis {{is that there is}} a surprising and significant consonance between federal Indian law’s doctrines of federal obligation towards Tribes and the theory <b>of</b> civil <b>recourse.</b> Reflected in Marbury v. Madison’s famous right-remedy principle, civil recourse holds that in some instances the government has a duty to provide the victim of a wrong an avenue for redress. This Article argues that the federal government has a duty <b>of</b> civil <b>recourse</b> towards Tribes, arising from the treaty system and the contemporary constraints that Congress and the courts have imposed upon the exercise of tribal adjudicative authority. The duty to provide civil <b>recourse</b> distinguishes tribal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> action from the United States’ own rights to sue in federal court, as well as federal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> action for states, which can freely vindicate their interests in their own courts without regard to the limits the United States imposes upon the exercise of tribal sovereignty.
