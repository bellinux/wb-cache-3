40|$|Recycling can {{be defined}} as the “act of {{processing}} used or abandoned materials for use in creating new products”. A recycling bin is a container which used to keep garbage or disposed item before being act by the respective authority to bring it the recycling centre. Recycling bins can be found in various forms and sizes. Nowadays, {{there are a lot of}} models of <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> which do not have the correct specification and yet have the disadvantage. The trash was not compacted, so it will requires a lot of space at the landfill. As a result, some of the landfill cannot afford to take all the trash. Part of the objective of this project is to overcome the problems occur nowadays by fabricating and designing the new concept of the <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin.</b> The main scopes of this research are for two type of trasher, which are the 325 ml cans and 600 ml bottles. The design of the new concept of <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> for this project is basically from the research of existing models found in the current market. It comes with the lots of advantages from two major models, which are “separated trash model” and “un separated trash model”. The main materials that being use to fabricate the <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> is metal. The cover of <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> is made from acrylic. In creating and fabricate the <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> it will use a lot of machines. After the fabrication process, this <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> will be able to compact the trash successfully. Compare to the other model that exists in today’s market, this new <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> in more suitable for the use of the household. It is because the size of this <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> is smaller and the specialty is that in one <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin,</b> consumer will found two different containers. So it will able to reduce the space used. The shaft will connect to the compactor and the handle shaft of the <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> can support the load when being use to compress the trash. There are no failures found during compacting the trash. As the conclusion from this project, this new design of <b>recycle</b> trash <b>bin</b> will be able to help and overcome the problems occurs nowadays and give advantages to users...|$|R

50|$|In Australia, every urban {{domestic}} household {{is provided}} with three bins: one for recycling; another for general waste; and another for garden materials, this bin {{is provided by the}} municipality if requested. To encourage recycling, municipalities provide large <b>recycle</b> <b>bins,</b> which are larger than general waste bins. Many American localities have dual-stream recycling, with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case, the recovered materials are trucked to a materials recovery facility for further processing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Recycle</b> <b>Bin</b> has {{a setting}} to {{configure}} {{the amount of}} deleted files it can store. Free disk space allocated for this is not actually used until files are deleted from folders and stored in the <b>Recycle</b> <b>Bin.</b> In versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista, the default configuration of the <b>Recycle</b> <b>Bin</b> is a global setting for all drives to hold 10% of the total capacity of each host hard drive volume to store deleted files. For example, on a volume with a capacity of 20 gigabytes, the <b>Recycle</b> <b>Bin</b> will hold up to 2 gigabytes of deleted files. This can be changed anywhere from 0 to 100% of the drive space, but {{will not be allowed}} to exceed 3.99GB of space, even if the user-indicated % of the drive space is larger than 3.99GB. If the <b>Recycle</b> <b>Bin</b> fills up to maximum capacity, the oldest files will be deleted in order to accommodate the newly deleted files. If a file is too large for the <b>Recycle</b> <b>Bin,</b> the user will be prompted to immediately and permanently delete the file instead.

5|$|Saint Anselm College RECYCLES was a {{greening}} movement {{which started}} on campus in 2009. Up to that time, recycling was limited on campus, and {{students had to}} resort to their own methods of recycling containers and other recyclables in dorms. An impromptu recycling program—Saint Anselm College RECYCLES—was started through the Knights of Columbus and the Club Soccer organization that served the Uppers section of campus, every Saturday, averaging around 650 pounds of material per week. In the 2010 spring semester, this plan funded by Club Soccer and the Knights of Columbus provided over fifty <b>recycle</b> <b>bins,</b> purchased from the city of Providence, Rhode Island. In the spring of 2010, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics installed seven recycling bins throughout its facilities. Inspired by this student-led activity, the college's physical plant purchased 120 bins for all of the apartments in the Uppers, Lowers and Falvey and Collins Houses. In the fall of 2010, Physical Plant installed five Waste Management recycling dumpsters throughout campus. Campus-wide recycling is planned by 2013.|$|R

In this thesis, we create a generic development framework that can help {{in the development and}} deployment of smart city services. The prototype development framework integrates soft real time data with simula- tion system. The motivation for integration with a simulation system is to act as decision support for the real system, understand and estimate how future changes in the real system can affect the current system with its new change. As proof of concept, we applied our proposed system to a specific city and a specific city service. Our target city is Skelleftea, Sweden, while our target service is waste management service. The designed system is tailored to support and optimize waste management operation and the system primarily uses a single metric data acquired from <b>recycle</b> <b>bins,</b> which indicates level of wastes in bins. The designed system consists of components such as data retrieval system, a RESTful web service, simulation system, web based monitoring application system for waste management company and mobile application for city inhabitants.

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1997 This {{research}} discusses some of {{the cultural}} issues that could influence the human computer encounter in a multicultural community. The results of research to determine differences in computer usage caused by cultural differences when using computer user interfaces in simulated and real-world environments are also discussed. Various cultural aspects could possibly influence {{the effectiveness of the}} user interface in a multicultural society. Language is an important factor and studies have shown that simple translation will increase productivity (Bodley, 1993 : 23). However all languages do not contain the necessary technical vocabulary. Mothers from a lower social class typically use a limited language code when communicating with their children (Mussen et aI., 1984 : 206). As this causes the children to think in more concrete and less conceptual terms, it may influence the human computer interaction, particularly where a high degree of abstraction, such as in graphical interfaces, is used. Symbolism is problematic as symbols like light bulbs, <b>recycle</b> <b>bins</b> and VCR controls do not feature in the life of users living in slum and backward rural conditions. Lack of exposure to technology might negatively influence user attitude (Downton, 1991 : 25) with a corresponding inhibition of learning and performance. All external locus of control is common among disadvantaged groups due to the high degree of rejection, hostile control and criticism they experience. As the sense of being out of control is largely associated with the indication to avoid stressful situations, users from these groups might prefer to avoid situations where they do not feel in control. The strong differentiation between the roles of the sexes in certain cultures can also influence the encounter with the computer (Downton, 1991 : 10) It has been shown that the different gender orientations towards problem solving in these cultures can have an important influence on computer usage. The intracultural factors of social class {{play a significant role in}} determining how a person acts and thinks (Baruth & Manning, 1991 : 9 - 1 0). Such differences may sometimes be more pronounced than those resulting from cultural diversity and may influence the orientation of the user towards abstraction and generalization...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of green building {{and sustainable development}} are not new to the property management industry for long. Yet, there is little correlation between the terms “environmental sustainability” and “shopping mall” in the general public’s mind. This mindset maybe built by the mega building structure, bright and air-conditioned indoor environment and ever-changing interior features and decorations of Hong Kong’s shopping malls. Looking at Hong Kong, some shopping malls have already taken initiatives to act green for a long time. From placing <b>recycle</b> <b>bins</b> in the mall to installation of rainwater collection plant and food waste decomposers, shopping malls can contribute to environmental sustainability through adopting different green measures in their operation and management. Since there is no past research or study focusing on the increasing trend on green shopping mall management, this research aims to examine how and why Hong Kong’s shopping malls implement green measures. It also evaluates {{on the role of}} shopping malls in Hong Kong’s environmental sustainable development, as well as to explore the future possibility of shopping malls towards better green management and better social responsibility on environmental sustainability. The research is conducted in the form of case study of four shopping malls. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with shopping mall managers and surveys to shoppers and mall tenants accordingly. Through data analysis and discussions, it is concluded that there are both direct and indirect contributions by shopping malls’ green measures to Hong Kong’s environmental sustainability development. However, it is found that in spite of numerous green measures implemented by some shopping malls, the management is hardly credited by stakeholders, especially the general public, for those green effort they did; also, stakeholders rarely identify the malls as green shopping malls. This may {{due to the lack of}} promotions and disclosure of information to stakeholders, as well as poor awareness and concern of stakeholders on the issue. In such, green achievement of shopping malls is only recognized within the industry itself but not all stakeholders and the general public. At the same time, the indirect impact of green measures (influence to other stakeholders) is not maximized. This is surely not a good phenomenon to both the industry and Hong Kong’s environmental sustainability development as this could hardly create a green culture in Hong Kong. To tackle this phenomenon, it is recommended shopping malls to involve top management’s commitment in green measures, to disclose more information on green effort and achievement to the public, and lastly, to get tenants to involve in green measures in the early stage of tenancy. Meanwhile, the shopping mall management industry should provide practical guide to assist mall managers in starting their green work, and to set up a tutor scheme within company in order to guide the late comers. Finally, the Government should consider having more collaboration and discussion with the industry in future green policy implementation so as to achieve mutual benefits and smoother implementation of green policies. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
