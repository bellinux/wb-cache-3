50|$|The {{house was}} {{inherited}} by their son, Victor Erwin, {{who lived there}} with his wife, Margaret Preston McNeilly, the daughter of Confederate veteran and newspaper publisher J. S. McNeilly. A loggia {{at the back of}} the house was added in 1910, as well as a <b>rear</b> <b>cabinet</b> in 1925. During that time, William Alexander Percy, the author of Lanterns on the Levee, was often invited to the house.|$|E
50|$|The former water castle - {{some of the}} moats {{were laid}} dry in 1827 - has a {{rectangular}} plan. It consists primarily of a west and a south wing. The south wing probably houses the oldest parts of the castle, which {{go back to the}} 14th century. The west wing was given its present appearance mainly in the period from 1611 to 1613. The gateway {{on the east side of}} the schloss was built in 1624. In 1746 the drawbridge was replaced by a stone bridge. On the north side is a wall with buttresses. Until its destruction in the Second Margrave War the so-called <b>rear</b> <b>cabinet</b> (Kemenate) was located here.|$|E
50|$|Medallions {{in the bay}} windows {{represent}} the coats of arms of the four ancient Scottish universities: Glasgow, St. Andrew's, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh. The medallions {{in the front and}} rear windows are of Elgin and Melrose Abbeys which were 13th and 16th century seats of learning. The draperies are of crewel-embroidered linen. The rooms lighting fixtures were inspired by an iron coronet in Edinburgh's John Knox Museum that was retrieved from the battlefield of Bannockburn at which Scotland won its independence from England in 1314. Student's seats resemble a chair that belonged to John Knox. An old Scottish church furnished the pattern for the reading stand. The <b>rear</b> <b>cabinet,</b> based on an aumbry or weapon closet, contain artifacts such as pewter and china used at Soutar's Inn in Ayrshire that was frequented by Robert Burns. The panels in the doors, mantel, and in-the-wall cabinets were carved in Edinburgh by Thomas Good and then shipped to Pittsburgh. The cabinetwork was done in the shops of Gustav Ketterer of Philadelphia. Wrought ironwork was done by Samuel Yellin. Cut into stone above the doorways are the thistle and the Lion Rampant, the Scottish emblem incorporated into Britain's royal arms. The chairman of the original Scottish Classroom Committee was Jock Sutherland.|$|E
50|$|The interior, {{designed}} by Mulliner, features Final Series kick plates, drilled alloy pedals, unique chrome trim, a <b>rear</b> cocktail <b>cabinet</b> and two picnic tables. The model {{also comes with}} four special umbrellas and a premium 1,000 watt audio system by Naim Audio.|$|R
50|$|Diezel offers 4x12 and 2x12 {{cabinets}} {{in front}} or rear loaded configurations. The front loaded cabinets come standard with V30 or G12K100 speakers while the <b>rear</b> loaded <b>cabinets</b> come standard with a Hemp cone speaker. All cabinets are now made in Germany with black grill cloth.|$|R
50|$|On the <b>rear</b> of speaker <b>cabinet,</b> VMPS {{speakers}} included level {{controls to}} attenuate the sound {{level of the}} mid-range and treble (tweeter). These level controls were intended {{to be used in}} concert with PR mass tuning to achieve the desired overall tonal balance.|$|R
5000|$|The Scottish Classroom was {{designed}} by Reginald Fairlie of Edinburgh in the period style of the early 17th century. The woodwork is carefully selected and treated English pollard oak. The names of distinguished Scots are carved in the ribbon bands of the panels and include David Livingstone who was an African missionary and explorer, Robert Louis Stevenson who authored Treasure Island, and Alexander Fleming who discovered penicillin. The inscriptions above the doors and the <b>rear</b> <b>cabinet</b> are from [...] "The Brus" [...] by the 14th-century Scottish poet John Barbour. The room's oak doors were copied from the entrance of Rowallan Castle in Ayrshire. A 16th-century Scottish proverb above the blackboard {{was taken from the}} Cowgate in Edinburgh and is known as [...] "the Scottish Golden Rule" [...] which reads: [...] "Gif Ye did as Ye sould Ye might haif as Ye would." [...] The plaster frieze was adapted from the plaster frieze at Elcho Castle in Perthshire and incorporates symbols of 14 Scottish clans which had members on the room committee, such as the buckle of the Leslie Clan. The thistle, Scotland's national flower, is rendered on the cornerstone as a tree-of-life. The overmantel of the Scottish sandstone fireplace that is flanked by carved kists, or log storage chests, is dominated by a portrait of poet Robert Burns that is copied from an original by Alexander Nasmyth which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland. Above the portrait is the cross of St. Andrew, Scotland's patron saint. The bronze statuettes on the mantel near an arrangement of dried heather are miniature replicas of heroic statues at the gateway to Edinburgh Castle and represent the 13th-century patriot Sir William Wallace and the 14th century freedom fighter, Robert the Bruce, both of whom were popularized in the movie Braveheart.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{aimed to}} create a concept of a {{universal}} vehicle meeting the requirements for safe transportation of patients with risk of environmental contamination including the possibility of repeated use. The vehicle should meet the highest degree of public health protection, namely the Biological safety levels 4 (BSL 4). The questionnaire was used to gather {{the information about the}} current status of Biohazard teams, their material and technical equipment, and the way of transport security, including the possibility of rotating/substitution of the intervening staff. The questionnaire was distributed to the providers of health rescue services in individual regions and in the capital city of Prague. The results of the questionnaire survey formed the basis for processing the concept of the vehicle to ensure the transport of patients suspected of a highly dangerous contagion. The concept of the vehicle should {{serve as the basis for}} the real vehicle construction that will be able to provide protection at the level of BSL 4. It counts on a separate cabin for two drivers, a <b>rear</b> <b>cabinet</b> superstructure with a clean area for storing material and medical equipment, and rest facilities for the staff. At the rear, a separate insulating container consisting of an insulating box for patients, a decontamination area for the needs of the rotating staff, and a transfer box for medical supplies and devices. The proposed vehicle brings numerous improvements that meet BSL 4 protection and thus the highest level of the public health protection. The vehicle can carry up to seven patients at one intervention with the risk of environmental contamination. During the transport, it is possible for the staff to rotate continuously. The separate storage of medical supplies and devices ensures the use and degradation of only the necessary materials and devices. To cover the territory of the Czech Republic, the optimal number of six vehicles would be optimal...|$|E
50|$|A basic {{web frame}} {{consists}} of a front rail which is usually visible {{from the front of}} the cabinet and two side rails which extend from the front to the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet.</b> In many web frames, these side rails also serve as the drawer runners, on which the drawer itself slides. An optional rear rail may also be included.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} Austro-Hungarian forces is {{documented}} {{in detail in}} the Military History Museum in Vienna, which was founded by Emperor Franz Joseph I as the Imperial-Royal Court Armaments Museum (k.k. Hofwaffenmuseum). In a special display cabinet in Hall V (the Franz Joseph Hall) of the museum, several uniforms of the Imperial Royal Landwehr are displayed, a relief on the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet</b> shows the territories from which the Hungarian Honved and Imperial-Royal Landwehr recruited.|$|R
5|$|On 19 December 1983, {{the wooden}} <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet</b> was pried {{open with a}} crowbar and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in {{absentia}} for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and {{it is widely believed}} to have been melted down and sold. Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.|$|R
50|$|Passive {{radiators}} {{are used}} in home stereo speakers, subwoofer cabinets and car audio speaker systems, particularly in cases where {{there is not enough}} space for a port or vent system. While most studio monitor speakers are either ported bass reflex designs, or closed-back without a vent or passive radiator, Mackie sells one small monitor speaker that has a passive radiator installed on the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet.</b> Focal also sells a studio monitor with a passive radiator called the SM9.|$|R
50|$|One method as to {{how this}} {{illusion}} might be achieved is as follows: When the cabinet is closed, the assistant crouches down into the bottom cube. Hidden compartments {{in three of the}} cubes hold fake body parts, which are revealed by simply rotating the relevant cube when it is restacked and opening an inset door in what was originally the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet.</b> The blade or blades dividing the bottom cube from that above have a trap door, allowing the assistant to show her head—apparently disembodied.|$|R
5000|$|Glass door {{construction}} options. Doors {{may have}} glass windows constructed of muntins and mullions holding glass panels (as in exterior windows). Other designs either mimic the divided-light look of muntins and mullions with overlays, or may dispense with them altogether. Cabinets using glass doors sometimes use glass shelves and interior lighting {{from the top}} of a cabinet. A glass shelf allows light to reach throughout a cabinet. For a special display effect, the interior <b>rear</b> of a <b>cabinet</b> may be covered with a mirrors to further distribute light.|$|R
50|$|A {{data center}} can occupy one {{room of a}} building, one or more floors, or an entire building. Most of the {{equipment}} is often {{in the form of}} servers mounted in 19 inch rack cabinets, which are usually placed in single rows forming corridors (so-called aisles) between them. This allows people access to the front and <b>rear</b> of each <b>cabinet.</b> Servers differ greatly in size from 1U servers to large freestanding storage silos which occupy many square feet of floor space. Some equipment such as mainframe computers and storage devices are often as big as the racks themselves, and are placed alongside them. Very large data centers may use shipping containers packed with 1,000 or more servers each; when repairs or upgrades are needed, whole containers are replaced (rather than repairing individual servers).|$|R
5000|$|The 10.2" [...] (260 mm) depth tile chassis is {{equipped}} with precision fittings allowing tiles to be mated to each other side by side both horizontally and vertically, allowing displays of various shapes and sizes to be built. The screen is a matt-finished polycarbonate material mounted on a metal frame which is held onto {{the front of the}} tile cabinet magnetically. The frame is designed so that the seams visible in the picture between each tile in a screen array are kept to a minimum of about 1 mm. The power and signal connectors are on the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet,</b> and once installed, there is no further need to access the rear panel for adjustments or maintenance. All mechanical maintenance is carried out {{from the front of the}} unit, with access gained by detaching the magnetically held screen with a suction grip tool.|$|R
2500|$|Type B1 and B2 {{cabinets}} have {{a minimum}} inflow velocity of 100ft/min, and these cabinets must be hard-ducted to an exhaust system rather than exhausted through a thimble connection. Their exhaust systems must also be dedicated (one BSC per duct run, per blower). In contrast to the type A1 and A2 cabinets, Type B BSCs use single pass airflow (air that does not mix and recirculate) in order to also control hazardous chemical vapors. Type B1 cabinets split the airflow so that the air behind the smoke-split is directed to the exhaust system, while air between the operator and the smoke-split mixes with inflow air and is recirculated as downflow. Since exhaust air is drawn from the rear grille, the CDC advises that work with hazardous chemistry be conducted in the <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet.</b> This is complicated, since the smoke split (demarking the [...] "rear of the cabinet") is an invisible line that extends {{the width of the}} cabinet (approximately 10-14 inches from the front grille) and drifts as the internal HEPA filters load with particulate.|$|R
5000|$|Arcade {{games were}} {{released}} in the 1980s and 1990s which used a multi-monitor configuration. The earliest {{of these is the}} game TX-1, a 1983 driving game developed by Tatsumi and published by Namco/Atari, which used a cockpit cabinet with 3 19" [...] CRT monitors side-by-side to give a wide viewing area. Its successor, TX-1 V8, released in 1984, also used the same 3 monitor configuration. Tatsumi released Buggy Boy in 1985, in both cockpit 3 monitor and upright single monitor cabinets. Darius from 1986 used an upright cabinet which was around half as wide again than a standard arcade cabinet of the time. It used 3 14" [...] FST (flatter squarer tube) monitors but in this case, 2 monitors were mounted on the left and right with the screens pointing upwards and one was mounted in a box at the centre <b>rear</b> of the <b>cabinet,</b> and using a two way mirror a seamless wide image was obtained. A similar effect was seen in Darius II, also known as Sagaia (which was also released in twin larger monitor format) and The Ninja Warriors. The original 1987 arcade version of Tecmo Bowl also used a dual-monitor setup. In 1990, Galaxian 3 used up to 16 projected screens.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{best known}} for his two near life-size copies from the early 1590s of the now-lost Family of Sir Thomas More (1527) by Hans Holbein the Younger at Nostell Priory and the National Portrait Gallery in London - the {{original}} was destroyed by fire in the eighteenth century. [...] These differ considerably, as the London version, Sir Thomas More, his father, his household and his descendants, includes More's descendants in their contemporary dress but omits several of the figures in the Holbein original. This was painted around 1593, probably commissioned by More's grandson, Thomas More II, to commemorate five generations of the family. The four figures wearing ruffs and holding prayer books on the right are Thomas More II, his wife and their oldest and youngest sons. Anne More, née Cresacre (1511-77), was Sir Thomas's daughter-in-law, and appears twice: once copied from the Holbein as a young woman of about sixteen (between Sir Thomas and his father) and also as an older woman in the painting on the <b>rear</b> wall. A <b>cabinet</b> miniature version of this portrait c. 1594 with different details, also likely by Lockey, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. [...] There is also a surviving drawing by Holbein which confirms the general accuracy of the Nostell Priory version.|$|R
5000|$|The first stretched-wheelbase K cars, {{introduced}} in 1983, {{were not given}} their own platform letter, but had stretched wheelbases with New Yorker styling in front: the Chrysler Executive Sedan and Limousine. They were made at the St. Louis assembly plant, and held five and seven passengers, respectively. The pair were powered by a carbureted Mitsubishi 2.6-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to the usual Torqueflite automatic transmission, though {{in the last two}} years of the Limousine, a turbocharged (but not intercooled) Chrysler 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine was added. The stretched platform was not used by Mitsubishi when they upgraded the Mitsubishi Debonair from a rear-drive sedan to front-wheel drive despite engine sharing between Mitsubishi and Chrysler at the time. Standard features included air conditioning, cruise control, power brakes, front and rear cigarette lighters, front/rear divider and <b>rear</b> compartment with <b>cabinet</b> (Limousine), <b>rear</b> defroster, digital instrument panel, electronic voice alert, tinted glass on all windows, hood ornament, lights that went on with the dual horn, illuminated entry, a full lighting package inside, opera lights outside, dual power mirrors, power antenna, locks, windows, and driver's seat, FM stereo, [...] "luxury cloth" [...] seats, tilt steering, leather steering wheel, intermittent wipers, and padded landau roof. The sedan lasted two years, while the limousine lasted four.|$|R
