40|$|The first Polish {{translation}} of the successful Victorian classic Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë was published thirty {{four years after the}} original. The novel translated as Janina by Emilia Dobrzańska was attached in instalments to a weekly periodical “Tydzień” based in Piotrków Trybunalski. Although the subtitle claimed the story was translated from English, the text of the translation inter alia demonstrates a curious preference for French phrases and calques. A close analysis of some features of the translation in comparison to the French translation by Noëmi Lesbazeilles Souvestre dating back to 1854 reveals a striking similarity between the two texts, which can be traced in a variety of contexts explored in this paper. As a result, one may draw the conclusion that the Polish translation was {{as a matter of fact}} translated not directly from English, but relayed from French instead. The paper explores the underresearched topic of <b>relay</b> <b>translation,</b> along with mostly negative scholarly attitudes towards this controversial translation method. The aim is to capture some reasons for its occasional use or even a preference for this translation technique in certain circumstances.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{phenomenon}} of <b>relay</b> in <b>translation.</b> <b>Relay</b> is by nature difficult to discuss and therefore {{it is no surprise}} that even scholars who know of its existence usually do so only in passing. Scholars unaware of relay occasionally come across a <b>relayed</b> <b>translation</b> (namely a translation using a first translation from the language of the original as a relay). When they do so in comparative studies, they tend to consider the relayed rendition as either a poor or heavily manipulated <b>translation.</b> Historically, <b>relay</b> has been an important factor in translational activity. It is obscured by e. g. the delay in the spread of ‘international fame’ of prominent writers in the past as well as the fact that not all translators and publishers informed audiences that the translation they published was based on a translation from another language than that of the original text. The article attempts to differentiate ‘relayed translations’ from other types of non-direct translation. It discusses their occurrence in translation, interpreting, and subtitling, and ends with a few comments on how relay can(not) be tackled in practical translation work...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{many forms of}} {{communication}} which are generally conceived as originals are in fact mediated in various ways and are hybrid in nature. EU parliamentary reports are a case in point. The original oral ST, which is hybrid {{in that it is}} multilingual, is simultaneously interpreted - and thus mediated and recontextualized - by means of a series of <b>relay</b> <b>translations.</b> Speeches delivered in English by non-native speakers are also recontextualized in various ways, which are examined in the paper through a qualitative methodology consisting in the comparison of the verbatim reports and the actual transcription of non-native speakers interventions from the audio-recording of the sitting held on 3 April 2006, the first video-recording available on the EU Parliament website. Findings show that the English of the original oral text is brought to the centre of the written-spoken continuum, thus emphasizing the ideational dimension rather than the interactional one; the language in verbatim reports is made more explicit for the non-participants in the original communicative event and address forms to EU fellow members are normalized. Therefore, in the intralingual mediation process through which the original non-native EU parliamentary discourse is recontextualized in verbatim reports, the translation universal strategies identified by Baker (1996) are clearly recognizable. Such strategies may thus be considered as more general mediation strategies, which are at work not only in translation, but also in intralingual mediatio...|$|R
50|$|Various paper zines on {{constructed}} languages {{were published}} from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as Glossopoeic Quarterly, Taboo Jadoo, and The Journal of Planned Languages.The Conlang Mailing List {{was founded in}} 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as Vortpunoj and Model Languages. The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of conlangers with its own customs, such as translation challenges and <b>translation</b> <b>relays,</b> and its own terminology. Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that {{the demographics of the}} Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.|$|R
40|$|Post-transcriptional {{regulation}} of gene expression {{sits at the}} core of proteomic complexity; trans-acting factors that regulate RNA localization and translation capacity are thus indispensible. In this thesis, I present studies of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), a sequence specific RNA-binding protein important for cell cycle progression and neural synaptic plasticity. I focus on CPEB because the activity of RNA-binding proteins affects the destiny of their mRNA substrates. As presented in Chapter II, CPEB, though mostly cytoplasmic at steady state, shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, the RNA recognition motifs are essential for the nuclear localization. CPEB associates with the polyadenylation machinery in both compartments, suggesting it is involved in both nuclear mRNA processing and cytoplasmic translational regulation. Moreover, the nuclear translocalization is critical to <b>relay</b> a tight <b>translation</b> repression on CPE-containing mRNAs. Chapter III focuses on the {{regulation of}} CPEB dimerization. CPEB dimerizes through the RNA-binding domains to inhibit its own RNA binding ability in a cell cycle-dependent manner. By dimerizing, CPEB has enhanced binding to protein destruction factors so that robust active degradation occurs in the later cell cycle. The degradation of CPEB is required for translation activation of a subset of mRNAs and cell cycle progression. In addition, dimerization protects cells from being overloaded with excess CPEB. In sum, the localization and dimerization status of CPEB is dynamic and highly regulated; they in turn regulate the activity of CPEB, which results in responsive translation control. These studies provide a strong foundation to decipher CPEB-mediated gene expression...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{will explain}} and {{demonstrate}} iMAGs (interactive Multilingual Access Gateways), in particular on a scientific laboratory {{web site and}} on the Greater Grenoble (La Métro) web site. This bilingual presentation has been obtained using an iMAG. Presentation This presentation is an adaptation and update of an article presented as a demonstration only to TALN- 2010. The names of the files have been kept the same, although their contents are slightly different. The iMAG concept has been proposed by Ch. Boitet and V. Bellynck in 2006 (Boitet & al. 2008, Boitet & al. 2005), and reached prototype status in November 2008, with a first demonstration on the LIG laboratory Web site. It has been adapted to the DSR (Digital Silk Road) Web site in April 2009, and then to more than 50 other Web sites. These first prototypes are extensions of the SECTra_w (Huynh & al. 2008) online translation corpora support system. Since the beginning of 2011, we are operationalizing this software {{with a view to}} deploy it as a multilingual access infrastructure, {{in the context of the}} French ANR (National Agency for Research) Traouiero " emergence " project. An iMAG is an interactive Multilingual Access Gateway very much like Google Translate at first sight: one gives it a URL (starting Web site) and an access language and then navigates in that access language. When the cursor hovers over a segment (usually a sentence or a title), a palette shows the source segment and proposes to contribute by correcting the target segment, in effect post-editing an MT result. With Google Translate, the page does not change after contribution, and if another page contains the same segment, its translation is still the rough MT result, not the polished post-edited version. The more recent Google Translation Toolkit enables one to MT-translate and then post-edit online full Web pages from sites such as Wikipedia, but again the corrected segments don't appear when one later browses the Wikipedia page in the access language. By contrast, an iMAG is dedicated to an elected Web site, or rather to the elected sublanguage defined by one or more URLs and their textual content. It contains a translation memory (TM) and a specific, preterminological dictionary (pTD), both dedicated to the elected sublanguage. Segments are pretranslated not by a unique MT system, but by a (selectable) set of MT systems. Systran and Google are mainly used now, but specialized systems developed from the postedited part of the TM, and based on Moses, will be also used in the future. The powerful online contributive platforms SECTra_w and PIVAX (Nguyen & al. 2007) are used to support the TMs and pTDs. Translated pages are built with the best segment translations available so far. While reading a translated page, it is possible not only to contribute to the segment under the cursor, but also to seamlessly switch to SECTra_w online post-editing environment, equipped with proactive dictionary help and good filtering and search-and-replace functions, and then back to the reading context. A <b>translation</b> <b>relay</b> is being implemented to define the iMAGs or other translation gateways used by an elected Web site, select and parameterize the MT systems and translation routes used for various language pairs, and manage users, groups, projects (some contributions may be organized, other opportunistic), and access rights. Finally, MT systems tailored to the selected sublanguage can be built (by combinations of empirical and expert methods) from the TM and the pTD dedicated to a given elected Web site. That approach will inherently raise the linguistic and terminological quality of the MT results, hopefully converting them from rough into raw translations. The demonstration will use some iMAGs created by the AXiMAG startup for various Web sites, such as those of the LIG lab ([URL] and of La Metro (Greater Grenoble) web site ([URL] where access in Chinese and English was enabled in 2010 for the Shanghai Expo...|$|R
