2500|$|Cyclosporin is {{synthesized}} by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. The enzyme {{contains an}} adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, a condensation domain, and an N-methyltransferase domain. The adenylation domain {{is responsible for}} substrate recognition and activation, whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine, and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain. Cyclosporin synthetase substrates include L-valine, L-leucine, L-alanine, glycine, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-methylthreonine, and D-alanine, which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process. With the adenylation domain, cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids, then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage. Some of the amino acid substrates become N-methylated by S-adenosyl methionine. The cyclization step releases cyclosporin from the enzyme. Amino acids such as D-Ala and butenyl-methyl-L-threonine indicate cyclosporin synthetase requires the action of other enzymes such as a D-alanine <b>racemase.</b> The racemization of L-Ala to D-Ala is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent. The formation of butenyl-methyl-L-threonine is performed by a butenyl-methyl-L-threonine polyketide synthase that uses acetate/malonate as its starting material.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that certain neurodegenerative disorders, particularly schizophrenia and epilepsy, may be partially caused by varying levels of gliotransmission and calcium excitability. [...] One theory, called the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, suggests that glutamate deficiency, {{which leads to the}} dysfunction of NMDARs at the presynaptic terminal, {{is believed}} to cause symptoms of schizophrenia. According to research, this hypofunctionality of NMDARs {{has been shown to be}} caused by lower amounts of gliotransmission facilitated by D-serine. More recently, it has been shown that D-serine and serine <b>racemase</b> occur almost exclusively in neurons, which do not support a role of D-serine as a gliotransmitter. The fact that cycloserine, which acts as an agonist for the NMDAR’s binding site, is used in the treatment for patients with schizophrenia further supports the glutamate hypothesis. [...] In the case of epilepsy, it is known that glutamate plays a role in synchronous depolarizations. [...] This has led researchers to believe that excitation of epileptic discharges may be caused by the glutamate-mediated gliotransmission. [...] Although that some studies show that the all excitations caused by gliotransmission lead to epileptic discharges, but it could possibly increase the intensity of length of epileptiform activity.|$|E

50|$|In L. plantarum, L-lactate is {{initially}} produced, which induces {{the activity of}} lactate <b>racemase.</b> Lactate <b>racemase</b> is only expressed {{in the presence of}} L-lactate.

5000|$|The enzyme {{phenylalanine}} <b>racemase</b> ( [...] , phenylalanine <b>racemase,</b> phenylalanine <b>racemase</b> (adenosine triphosphate-hydrolysing), gramicidin S synthetase I) is {{the enzyme}} that acts on amino acids and derivatives. It activates both the L & D stereo isomers of phenylalanine to form L-phenylalanyl adenylate and D-phenylalanyl adenylate, which {{are bound to}} the enzyme. These bound compounds are then transferred to the thiol group of the enzyme followed by conversion of its configuration, the D-isomer being the more favorable configuration of the two, with a 7 to 3 ratio between the two isomers. The racemisation reaction of phenylalanine is coupled with the highly favorable hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PP), thermodynamically allowing it to proceed. This reaction is then drawn forward by further hydrolyzing PP to inorganic phosphate (Pi), via Le Chatelier's principle.|$|E
