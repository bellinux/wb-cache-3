2500|$|As soon as {{the wheel}} is {{released}} by the sear, the longer arm of the mainspring pulls the chain engaged in it. The {{other end of the}} chain being fixed to the cam on the wheel shaft, the latter rotates at high speed, whilst the <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> pushes forward the arm to which the pan cover is attached, thus causing the pan cover to slide forward towards the muzzle of the piece, and the pyrites to fall (under tension of the dog spring) on to the now rotating wheel. That is the second purpose of a sliding pan cover: were the pyrites to engage a stationary wheel, it would almost certainly jam the mechanism: but the built-in delay allows the pyrites to slip off the sliding pan-cover on to an already rotating wheel. A more modern development has been the use of a ball bearing between the wheel and the sear. [...] This design allows a smoother and lighter trigger pull, requiring less force to operate.|$|E

50|$|The Exakta 66 added a TTL metered prism {{coupled to}} the shutter speed dial {{on the camera}} body and the {{aperture}} ring on the lens.

25|$|Functions of two {{variables}} {{were provided by}} three-dimensional cams. In one good design, one of the variables <b>rotated</b> the <b>cam.</b> A hemispherical follower moved its carrier on a pivot axis parallel {{to that of the}} <b>cam's</b> <b>rotating</b> axis. Pivoting motion was the output. The second variable moved the follower along the axis of the cam. One practical application was ballistics in gunnery.|$|R
25|$|The keys operate cams {{that operate}} a {{swinging}} lever to first unlock the pin-positioning cam {{that is part}} of the pinwheel mechanism; further movement of the lever (by an amount determined by the key's <b>cam)</b> <b>rotates</b> the pin-positioning <b>cam</b> to extend the necessary number of pins.|$|R

50|$|Strictly speaking, the tappet, also {{termed a}} cam follower, or lifter, {{is that part}} that runs on the {{camshaft}} and is made to move vertically {{by the action of}} the <b>rotating</b> <b>cam.</b> In an overhead valve engine, this tappet is fitted low down in the engine block. From there it drives a long thin pushrod, {{up to the top of}} the engine, above the cylinder head. Here the rockers, arranged on a rocker shaft beneath the rocker cover, reverse the direction of the valve movement to press the valves downwards to open them.|$|E
50|$|A linear cam is one {{in which}} the cam element moves in a {{straight}} line rather than rotates. The cam element is often a plate or block, but may be any cross section. The key feature is that the input is a linear motion rather than rotational. The cam profile may be cut into one or more edges of a plate or block, may be one or more slots or grooves {{in the face of an}} element, or may even be a surface profile for a cam with more than one input. The development of a linear cam is similar to, but not identical to, that of a <b>rotating</b> <b>cam.</b>|$|E
50|$|From {{that time}} all {{machines}} {{in use in}} the UK were of the electro-mechanical type. This used a standard mechanical coin-weigher unit and mechanical stacking for booklets, but had an electronic arm on a <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> for dispensing the booklets. They were manufactured by Hillday Automation of Attleborough, Norfolk and designated Type B52. Two versions were built with either long or short coin boxes, easily recognised from {{the length of the}} case. Initially set to dispense 4 x 25p stamps in a folded booklet in exchange for a £1 coin, different combinations were later employed as postage rates in the UK continued to rise.|$|E
40|$|In {{studies of}} the effects of {{elevated}} temperature on aquatic organisms, little emphasis has been placed on modeling the fluctuating temperatures to which organisms are exposed in nature. To some extent this may be related to problems of design and maintenance of apparatus for fluctuating temperature control. The complexity of apparatus used to provide cycled temperatures has ranged from manually controlled valves for introducing water of different temperatures into aquariums (Kelso 1972), to a complex and expensive feedback system, regulated by <b>rotating</b> <b>cams,</b> that controls the temperature of influent water (Honeywell Cam Programmer Thermometers, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania). To facilitate {{studies of the}} effects of temperature fluctuation on the growth of fishes, we constructed an apparatus that was easy to use and of moderate cost...|$|R

50|$|Cam Locks: on spudguns with {{interchangeable}} {{barrels a}} cam lock is sometimes used to connect barrels to the cannon as {{it provides a}} quick and simple solution to switching barrels.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Maxim gun employed {{one of the earliest}} recoil-operated firing systems in history. The idea is that the energy from recoil acting on the breech block is used to eject each spent cartridge and insert the next one, instead of a hand-operated mechanism. Maxim's earliest designs used a 360-degree <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> to reverse the movement of the block, but this was later simplified to a toggle lock. This made it vastly more efficient and less labor-intensive than previous rapid-firing guns, such as the Mitrailleuse, Gatling, Gardner, or Nordenfelt, that relied on actual mechanical cranking. It also decreased the gas buildup in the barrel, allowing the gun to fire more bullets {{over an extended period of}} time without overheating the barrel. The Maxim gun design required water cooling, giving it the ability to maintain its rate of fire for far longer than air-cooled guns. The disadvantage of this was that it made the gun less flexible in attack than the lighter air-cooled weapons.|$|E
5000|$|From 1950 he {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} {{the research and development}} of his most important invention, a rotating motor or reaction turbine which he named the [...] "Turbozám", also known as a [...] "criole motor". While a conventional motor is constructed from thousands of parts, the Turbozám only has around 20. It uses a single sparkplug and a single four-cycle chamber, and has no connecting rods, pistons, camshafts, valves, carburetor or crankshaft. It consists of rotating parts on a drive shaft that, on rotating, produces compression and expansion aided by the inertia of a flywheel, based on a pair of blades or [...] "bailadores" [...] that act as pistons, named in honor of his village. These blades replace the <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> of conventional motors and are driven by a planetary gear system which forms a combustion chamber between the two blades. The feasibility of this engine has been proven by engineers at the University of Los Andes interested in the subject, but has not been implemented, due to lack of support for blade construction. It could rotate at 5000 rpm. He could not finish developing it for lack of support for the construction of the blades.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cam lock}} {{is a type}} of latch {{consisting}} of a base and a cam. The base is where the key or tool is used to <b>rotate</b> the <b>cam,</b> which is what does the latching. Cams can be straight or offset; offset cams are reversible. Commonly found on garage cabinets, file cabinets, tool chests, and other locations where privacy and security is needed.|$|R
5000|$|As a twin {{cam system}} relies on each <b>cam</b> <b>rotating</b> independently, {{based solely on}} the force of the string and the {{resistance}} of the bow limbs being absolutely symmetrical, there is room for a twin cam system to [...] "lose tune" [...] through wear and tear, string stretch, or just general age. The effect of a detuned twin cam bow is that the two <b>cams</b> <b>rotate</b> out of sync with each other, causing the bowstring to accelerate in two alternating directions upon release. This causes a number of adverse consequences, the most obvious being unsteady arrow flight.|$|R

50|$|Changing gear {{with the}} Wilson box {{relied on the}} control of the brake bands that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The brake band to be {{selected}} was controlled by a <b>rotating</b> <b>cam,</b> moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the brake band, thus the need for the pedal The actual movement of the brake bands was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the toggles controlling the brake bands themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the brake band in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of engaging and disengaging each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so adjust for wear by taking up any slack.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a general method for finding the contact point between two moving plane curves. After establishing the general relations, these are applied for real examples, met in engineering.

Thus, there are considered the <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> and oscillating curve face follower, of elliptical profiles; the elliptical <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> with flat face –rotating and translating follower mechanism is next analyzed.

5000|$|Whenever {{the clutch}} pedal is {{depressed}} to shift into reverse, the mainshaft continues to rotate {{because of its}} inertia. The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and reverse idler gear produces gear noise grinding.

50|$|The TLS motor {{featured}} a 90° V-twin for perfect primary balance and had hybrid chain/gear driven cams. A traditional cam chain turned a gear {{that in turn}} <b>rotated</b> the <b>cams.</b> This hybrid design eased maintenance immensely and gave the motor additional aural character because of the gear whine.

40|$|For the {{mechanism}} with <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> and knife-edge follower, an optimization criterion {{by means of}} imposed constraints upon cam’s curvature is expressed in a special coordinate system.

The optimization criterion assumes establishing {{the position of the}} characteristic point of the mechanism with respect to this contour. Fulfillment of optimization criterion assumes that the characteristic point is positioned in the same manner with respect to all contours. The optimization criterion is simplified when considering the envelope of the contours. The method is exemplified using two mechanisms, with the cams priori satisfying the criterion...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{coefficients}} were determined for the inlet valve {{of a modern}} air-cooled cylinder during operation of the valve. The cylinder head with valves was mounted on a large tank that could be evacuated. Operating the valve with a <b>rotating</b> <b>cam</b> allowed air to flow through the valve into the evacuated tank. The change of pressure in the tank was {{a measure of the}} amount of air flowing though the valve in a given number of cycles. The flow {{coefficients were}} determined from the pressure across the valve, the quantity of air flowing, and the valve-lift curve. Coefficients were measured with lifts of 0. 1 to 0. 6 inch and speeds of 130 to 1, 200 r. p. m. The results obtained with intermittent flow were compared with the results of tests made with steady flow through this cylinder head. This comparison indicated that steady-flow coefficients can be used for intermittent flow...|$|E
