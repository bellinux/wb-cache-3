40|$|<b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} that undergo self-sustained replication at a constant temperature {{in the absence of}} proteins 1. These RNA molecules amplify exponentially through a cross-replicative process, whereby two enzymes catalyze each other’s synthesis by joining component oligonucleotides. Other <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> have been made to operate in a ligand-dependent manner by combining a catalytic domain with a ligand-binding domain (aptamer) to provide an “aptazyme” 2, 3. The principle of ligand-dependent RNA catalysis now has been extended to the cross-replicating <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> so that exponential amplification occurs in the presence, but not the absence, of the cognate ligand. The exponential growth rate of the RNA depends on the concentration of the ligand, enabling one to determine the concentration of ligand in a sample.

50|$|Researchers {{have made}} a Hammerhead {{ribozyme}} that targets and cleaves the mRNA of essential genes in HSV-1. The hammerhead, which targets the mRNA of the UL20 gene, greatly reduced the level of HSV-1 ocular infection in rabbits, and reduced the viral yield in vivo. The gene-targeting approach uses a specially designed <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> to inhibit strains of the herpes simplex virus.

50|$|The Vg1 {{ribozyme}} is a manganese dependent <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> or ribozyme {{which is}} the smallest ribozyme to be identified. It was identified in the 3' UTR of Xenopus Vg1 mRNA transcripts and mouse beta-actin mRNA. This ribozyme was identified from in vitro studies that showed that the Vg1 mRNA was cleaved within the 3' UTR {{in the absence of}} protein. Studying the Vg1 mRNA 3'UTR a manganese-dependent ribozyme was predicted to exist. This ribozyme was shown to be located adjacent to the polyadenylation site and in vitro studies showed that it catalyzes a first-order reaction where its mechanism of cleavage is similar to the manganese ribozyme present in Tetrahymena group I introns.|$|E

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The RNA world {{hypothesis}} postulates that Ribonucleic Acids (RNA) {{may have}} provided functions of catalysis and genetic information storage during {{the origin of}} life on earth. An RNA based life is hypothesized to have undergone Darwinian evolution to ultimately lead into extant biology, where DNA is used as the repository for genetic information and proteins are used as biological catalysts. The discovery of functional RNAs such as catalytic RNAs, regulatory RNAs, and ligand-binding RNA aptamers further strengthen this hypothesis. These functional RNAs are also used as tools for synthetic biology and therapeutics. This work highlights strategies used by <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> (Ribozymes) for catalysis of chemical reactions, and explores new chemistries catalyzed by ribozymes. We also engineered an in vitro evolved ribozyme to control activities of other functional RNA molecules. Finally, this work explores innovative approaches to discover new <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> that catalyze biologically relevant reactions. Findings from these studies have revealed potential roles of <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> during the primordial earth, and also opened doors to build RNA-based tools that regulate biological processes...|$|R
50|$|Bacterial RNase P has two {{components:}} an RNA chain, called M1 RNA, and a polypeptide chain, or protein, called C5 protein. In vivo, both {{components are}} necessary for the ribozyme to function properly, but in vitro, the M1 RNA can act alone as a catalyst. The primary role of the C5 protein is to enhance the substrate binding affinity and the catalytic rate of the M1 <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> probably by increasing the metal ion affinity in the active site. The crystal structure of a bacterial RNase P holoenzyme with tRNA has been recently resolved, showing how the large, coaxially stacked helical domains of the RNase P RNA engage in shape selective recognition of the pre-tRNA target. This crystal structure confirms earlier models of substrate recognition and catalysis, identifies {{the location of the}} active site, and shows how the protein component increases RNase P functionality.|$|E
50|$|Wagner {{showed that}} {{robustness}} can accelerate innovation in biological evolution, {{because it helps}} organisms tolerate otherwise deleterious mutations that can help create new and useful traits. In this way, robust transcription factor binding sites, for example, can facilitate the evolution of new gene expression. An additional consequence of robustness is that evolving populations of organisms can accumulate cryptic genetic variation, inconsequential variation that may provide benefits in some environments. Wagner’s laboratory showed experimentally that such cryptic variation can indeed accelerate the evolution of an <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> to react with a new substrate molecule. Wagner has argued that robustness can also help resolve the long-standing neutralism-selectionism controversy, which revolves around the question whether frequent neutral mutations - a consequence of robustness - are important for Darwinian evolution. The reason is that neutral mutations are important stepping stones to later evolutionary adaptations and innovations. Robust systems can also bring forth useful traits - potential exaptations - that arise as mere by-products of other, adaptive traits, which can help explain the great abundance of exaptations in life’s evolution.|$|E

The concentration of the ligand determines {{the amount of time}} required for the replication products to reach a threshold concentration. A standardized plot of time to threshold versus ligand concentration can be used to determine the concentration of ligand in an unknown sample. This system is analogous to quantitative PCR, linking rare recognition events to subsequent exponential amplification, but unlike PCR {{can be applied to the}} quantitative detection of non-nucleic-acid ligands...|$|E

40|$|We have {{converted}} {{a bacterial}} tRNA precursor containing a 205 nt self-splicing group I intron into a <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> that catalyzes polymerization of an external RNA substrate. The reaction involves transesterification steps analogous {{to both the}} forward and reverse exon ligation steps of group I splicing; as such it depends entirely on 3 ' splice site reactions. The RNA substrate is a 20 nt analogue of the ligated exons (E 1. E 2), whose 3 ' end resembles the 3 ' terminus of the intron <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> (IVS). The splice junction of the substrate is attacked by the 3 ' end of the intron, then the molecule displaces the original 3 ' terminal guanosine so that the new 3 ' terminus is brought into the active site and used as the attacking nucleophile in the next reaction. Polymerization occurs via a series of covalent enzyme-linked intermediates of the structure IVS. (E 2) n, where n = 1 to > or = 18. The 5 ' exon accumulates {{during the course of}} the reaction and can attack the covalent intermediates to produce elongation products of structure E 1. (E 2) n, regenerating the intron <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> in unchanged form. In this manner, the enzyme converts 20 nt oligoribonucleotides into polyribonucleotides up to at least 180 nt by 10 nt increments.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to evolve RNA enzymes in a continuous manner by employing a simple serial-transfer procedure. This method was previously applied only to descendants of one unusually fast-reacting <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme</b> with RNA ligase activity. The present study establishes a second continuously evolving <b>RNA</b> <b>enzyme,</b> also with RNA ligase activity, but with a completely independent evolutionary origin. Critical to achieving the fast catalytic rate necessary for continuous evolution, development of this enzyme entailed the addition and evolutionary maturation of a 35 -nucleotide accessory domain {{and the application of}} highly stringent selection pressure, with reaction times as short as 15 ms. Once established, continuous evolution was carried out for 80 successive transfers, maintaining the population against an overall dilution of 10207 -fold. The resulting RNA enzymes exhibited ≈ 105 -fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, compared with the starting molecules, and became dependent on a structural feature of the substrate that previously conferred no selective advantage. This adaptation was eliminated by deleting the substrate feature and then carrying out 20 additional transfers of continuous evolution, which resulted in molecules with even greater catalytic activity. Now that two distinct species of continuously evolving enzymes have been established, it {{is possible}} to conduct molecular ecology experiments in which the two are made to compete for limited resources within a common environment...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{types of}} <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> (ribozymes) have been {{identified}} in biological systems and generated in the laboratory. Considering the variety of known <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes</b> and the similarity of DNA and RNA, it is reasonable to imagine that DNA might be able to function as an enzyme as well. No such DNA enzyme has been found in nature, however. We set out to identify a metal-dependent DNA enzyme using in vitro selection methodology. RESULTS: Beginning with a population of 10 (14) DNAs containing 50 random nucleotides, we carried out five successive rounds of selective amplification, enriching for individuals that best promote the Pb(2 +) -dependent cleavage of a target ribonucleoside 3 '-O-P bond embedded within an otherwise all-DNA sequence. By the fifth round, the population as a whole carried out this reaction at a rate of 0. 2 min- 1. Based on the sequence of 20 individuals isolated from this population, we designed a simplified version of the catalytic domain that operates in an intermolecular context with a turnover rate of 1 min- 1. This rate is about 10 (5) -fold increased compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Using in vitro selection techniques, we obtained a DNA enzyme that catalyzes the Pb(2 +) -dependent cleavage of an RNA phosphoester in a reaction that proceeds with rapid turnover. The catalytic rate compares favorably to that of known <b>RNA</b> <b>enzymes.</b> We expect that other examples of DNA enzymes will soon be forthcoming...|$|R
