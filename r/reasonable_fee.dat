When the testing programme was completed in August 1960, control of the mine returned to the Greenside company. The last of the ore was stripped out by April 1961, equipment was sold off, most of the buildings were demolished and the site cleaned up. The final twelve workmen were paid off in January 1962.|$|E
25|$|As {{the volume}} of FidoNet Mail {{increased}} and newsgroups {{from the early days}} of the Internet became available, satellite data downstream services became viable for larger systems. The satellite service provided access to FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups in large volumes at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>fee.</b> By connecting a small dish & receiver, a constant downstream of thousands of FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups could be received. The local BBS only needed to upload new outgoing messages via the modem network back to the satellite service. This method drastically reduced phone data transfers while dramatically increasing the number of message forums.|$|E
25|$|In October 1984, the U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which gave those using TVRO systems {{the right to}} receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and {{required}} those who did scramble to make their signals available for a <b>reasonable</b> <b>fee.</b> Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition. In January 1986, HBO began using the now-obsolete VideoCipher II system to encrypt their channels. Other channels uses less secure television encryption systems. The scrambling of HBO was met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels, claiming that clear signals from cable channels {{would be difficult to}} receive. Eventually HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service for $12.95 per month, a price equal to or higher than what cable subscribers were paying, and required a descrambler to be purchased for $395. This led to the attack on HBO's transponder Galaxy 1 by John R. MacDougall in April 1986. One by one, all commercial channels followed HBO's lead and began scrambling their channels. The Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association SBCA was founded on December 2, 1986 {{as the result of a}} merger between SPACE and the Direct Broadcast Satellite Association (DBSA).|$|E

6000|$|Cordova {{seemed to}} cheer {{up as much}} as we at our going. We had {{undoubtedly}} had the better night's sleep; as often as we woke we found Cordova awake, walking and talking, and coughing more than the night before, probably from fresh colds taken in the rain. From time to time there were church-bells, variously like tin pans and iron pots in tone, without sonorousness in their noise, or such wild clangor as some Italian church-bells have. But Cordova had lived through it, and at the station was lively with the arriving and departing trains. The morning was not only bright; it was hot, and the place babbled with many voices. We thought one voice crying [...] "Agua, agua!" [...] was a parrot's and then we thought it was a girl's, but really it was a boy with water for sale in a stone bottle. He had not a rose, white or red, in his hair, but if he had been a girl, old or young, he would have had one, white or red. Some of the elder women wore mantillas, but these wore flowers too, and were less pleasing than pathetic for it; one very massive matron was less pleasing and more pathetic than the rest. Peasant women carried bunches of chickens by the legs, and one had a turkey in a rush bag with a narrow neck to put its head out of for its greater convenience in gobbling. At the door of the station a donkey tried to bite a fly on its back; but even a Spanish donkey cannot do everything. There was no attempt to cheat us in the weight of our trunks, as there often is in Italy, and the mozo who put us and our hand-bags into the train was content with his <b>reasonable</b> <b>fee.</b> As for the pair of Civil Guards who were to go with us, they were of an insurpassable beauty and propriety, and we felt it a peculiar honor when one of them got into the compartment beside ours.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{the extent}} of {{willingness}} to pay for good quality public health services {{in relation to the}} demographic and socio-economic characteristics of respondents. The analysis was carried out by way of a household survey conducted in Khartoum, Sudan in 2001. We studied willingness to pay by means of a contingent valuation method. A logistic regression model was used for the statistical analysis. The results show that the overall percentage of {{people who are willing to}} pay for good quality public health services is either 80 % or 75 % depending on whether respondents already pay for these services (group 1) or not (group 2). They show that although the two groups are willing to pay for good quality public health services, the demographic characteristics that affect the willingness to pay differ between the two groups. The results of the logistic regression analysis for each group are remarkably similar. We conclude that if the quality of services is improved, <b>reasonable</b> <b>fees</b> could be set. This supports the continuity of the policy to recover costs because virtually the majority of the households would be willing to pay <b>reasonable</b> <b>fees.</b> Keywords: Willingness to pay; Public health services; Good quality; Contingent valuation; LRM; Suda...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the 12 (b) (6) motion to dismiss. The idea works as follows. Defendant moves to dismiss exactly as under current practice. Plaintiff either responds to the motion, thus submitting the matter for decision, or files an affidavit proposing a plan of targeted discovery. After receiving defendant’s response, the court approves, rejects, or revises the proposed discovery plan. If the judge allows discovery, defendant either withdraws the motion or produces the information. If defendant withdraws the motion, the litigation proceeds in the usual way. If defendant continues the motion the parties engage in targeted discovery. The court then reviews the motion taking account of information which either party brings to the court’s attention, including information produced in discovery. If the court grants the motion, the case is dismissed and plaintiff pays defendant’s <b>reasonable</b> <b>fees</b> and costs associated with the motion and associated discovery. If the court denies the motion, the case continues and defendant pays plaintiff’s <b>reasonable</b> <b>fees</b> and costs. Our proposal would incentivize both parties to reveal information pertinent to the court’s decision. It promises to improve the operation of the motion to dismiss regardless of the substantive standard used to evaluate the sufficiency of the claims for relief...|$|R
