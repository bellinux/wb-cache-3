40|$|We {{propose a}} unified {{framework}} {{for studying the}} greenback-gold price during the U. S. suspension of convertibility from 1862 to 1879. The gold price {{is viewed as a}} floating exchange rate, with a fixed destination given by gold standard parity because of the prospect <b>of</b> <b>resumption.</b> We test this perspective using daily data for the entire period, and measure the effect of news during and after the Civil War. New evidence of a decline in the volatility of gold returns after the <b>Resumption</b> Act <b>of</b> 1875 provides statistical support for the importance <b>of</b> expectations <b>of</b> <b>resumption.</b> greenbacks, gold standard, regime switching...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>resumption</b> and the syntax of relative clauses. Its aim is to provide a coherent account <b>of</b> <b>resumption</b> patterns in Slavic relative clauses, identifying the mechanisms that give rise to resumption and establishing what the analysed empirical data can tell us about the syntactic structure and derivation of relative clauses. Slovene, Polish, and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian data form the core of the empirical basis of this research. When we consider the four possible relative clause constructions varying in the choice between relative pronouns and complementizers and the presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>resumption,</b> we see that all of them are actually attested in Slavic languages. The dissertation teases apart the properties of the different constructions, establishes under which conditions they are available, and provides a derivation analysis for each of them. The approach furthermore demonstrates the necessity of maintaining a distinction between different types <b>of</b> <b>resumption,</b> despite their superficial similarities. While one of the types is driven by a morphosyntactic recoverability requirement, the presence of another is shown {{to be the result of}} processing constraints, rather than grammatical ones. In terms <b>of</b> <b>resumption</b> typology, resumption in Slavic relative clauses with an invariant complementizer represents a new example <b>of</b> <b>resumption</b> as spell‑out <b>of</b> copies, a type only rarely identified in the literature previously. This study is of interest to linguists researching resumption, recoverability, the syntax of relative clauses, and Slavic languages, as well as to the general syntactic audience...|$|R
50|$|Following the <b>resumptions</b> <b>of</b> {{hostilities}} {{between the}} government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE since early 2006, the navy took up {{an active role in}} limiting the LTTE's use of the seas. This resulted in several major sea battles curring the course of 2006, 2007 and 2009. Most significant of the events during this time were the interception and sinking of several large cargo ships that were bringing illegal arms shipments to the LTTE in the Indian Ocean in international waters. These naval operations have proven the blue water capability of the Sri Lankan Navy.|$|R

After his death in 1883 Robertson's executors consolidated Ballandean run concurrently with further government <b>resumptions</b> <b>of</b> the lease in March 1886. In 1889 they transferred the homestead and leasehold rights to James Fletcher, who erected a dingo proof fence on the property and cleared much of the run.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} a feedback operator, in {{the form}} of a monoidal trace, to the theory of coalgebraic, state-based modelling of components. The feedback operator on components is shown to satisfy the trace axioms of Joyal, Street and Verity. We employ McCurdy’s tube diagrams, an extension of standard string diagrams for monoidal categories, for representing and manipulating component diagrams. The microcosm principle then yields a canonical “inner” traced monoidal structure on the category <b>of</b> <b>resumptions</b> (elements <b>of</b> final coalgebras / components). This generalises an observation by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott...|$|R

5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial {{to the success of}} High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy.

50|$|In 1892, Elderslie {{was divided}} into two parts, one of {{approximately}} 4,400 square kilometres leased to Wilson and approximately half that amount intended to be subdivided for closer settlement, but over which Wilson had a lease to occupy. On Wilson's death, both sections were transferred to the Ramsay family. By 1912, the Ramsays had stocked the property with sheep, established horse studs and sunk three artesian bores. The additions to the house which created its present form probably occurred during this time. Although {{the period in which}} the Ramsays occupied Elderslie was a difficult one, coinciding with severe droughts and large <b>resumptions</b> <b>of</b> land, they managed to sell the property debt free to the Queensland Stock Breeding Company Limited in 1912.|$|R
40|$|Anaphora and resumption, {{phenomena}} which intuitively seem {{to challenge}} resource sensitivity, have been argued {{to support its}} role in Glue. The resource deletion treatment <b>of</b> <b>resumption</b> in LFG Glue presented by Asudeh (2004) was designed to work together with the Glue resource duplication treatment of anaphora (Dalrymple et al., 1999). However, as `resumptive pronouns' are mere pronouns, {{the choice of a}} treatment of anaphora that has long been found to be inadequate creates an issue. A modular treatment of pronouns using LFG, Glue, and #-DRT (Kokkonidis, 2005) is the most promising alternative. A treatment <b>of</b> <b>resumption</b> for this treatment of pronouns is presented together with new insights about resource management, the new and the old treatment <b>of</b> <b>resumption,</b> and the intuitions behind them...|$|R

25|$|Ada {{tells the}} life {{story of a}} man named Van Veen, and his lifelong love affair with his sister Ada. They meet when she is eleven (soon to be twelve) and he is fourteen, believing that they are cousins (more precisely: that their fathers are cousins and that their mothers are sisters), and begin a sexual affair.

Both are wealthy, educated, and intelligent. Van goes on to become a world-renowned psychologist, and the book itself takes the form of his memoirs, written when he is in his nineties, punctuated with his own and Ada's marginal notes, and in parts with notes by an unnamed editor, suggesting the manuscript is not complete.|$|R
40|$|Control-flow graphs (CFG) are {{a common}} {{intermediate}} representation (IR) for a program and all the paths that might be traversed through its execution. But they are restricted to the intraprocedural case. For sensor programs, {{it is important that}} the IR models the whole programs possible paths of execution, covering the interprocedural cases as well, because the programs are small enough to allow an analysis of the whole program and thorough testing is very important because changes after deployment are usually impossible. Recently, Lai, Cheung, and Chan introduced the inter-context flow graph (ICFG), which does model preemptions and <b>resumptions</b> <b>of</b> execution through interrupt handlers and covers the transitions of control-flow between tasks but does not cover the transitions of control-flow when normal functions are called and some of the transitions between tasks.

50|$|The {{arrival of}} the bubonic plague in Sydney in 1900 was cause for alarm on the docks. It also {{provided}} convenient grounds for mass <b>resumptions</b> <b>of</b> houses in preparation for reshaping the landscape of The Rocks, Dawes Point and Millers Point. Mass areas of Sydney were fenced off and people deported to North Head to be quarantined. Shipping operations were shut down {{for a period of}} time while Council decontaminated the area and exterminated disease ridden rats. During this time the ownership of the port was shifted from individually owned private wharfs to the Sydney Harbour Trust. The trust dismantled the inadequate and unsafe docks and built finger wharfs large enough to facilitate large modern ships. By the end of the 1930s construction was complete, the wharfs dominated the waterfront from Millers point down to Darling Harbour.|$|R
