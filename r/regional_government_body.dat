Research institutes were the basic units for the conduct of research and the employment of scientists, who were assigned to institutes by government personnel bureaus. Scientists usually spent their entire working careers within the same institute. Research institutes functioned as ordinary Chinese work units, with the usual features of lifetime employment, unit control of rewards and scarce goods, and limited contact with other units not in the same chain of command. Each research institute attempted to provide its own staff housing, transportation, laboratory space, and instruments and to stockpile equipment and personnel. The limited channels for exchanges of information with other institutes often led to duplication or repetition of research.|$|R

50|$|Ecosystem-based {{management}} {{is seen as}} a critical planning and management framework for conserving or restoring ecosystems though it is still not widely implemented (Tallis et al. 2010). An ecosystem approach addresses many relationships across spatial, biological, and organizational scales and is a goal-driven approach to restoring and sustaining ecosystems and functions (Szaro et al. 1998). In addition, ecosystem-based management involves community influence as well as planning and management from local, <b>regional</b> and national <b>government</b> <b>bodies</b> and management agencies. All must be in collaboration in order to develop a desired future of ecosystem conditions, particularly where ecosystems have undergone radical degradation and change (Szaro et al. 1998).

40|$|Though many jurisdictions {{have adopted}} {{competition}} laws in recent decades, {{none of these}} laws has engendered the level of interest sparked by China 2 ̆ 7 s proposed Anti-Monopoly Law (2 ̆ 2 AML 2 ̆ 2). Several factors have combined to inspire an unprecedented flow of commentary and consortia on each iteration of China 2 ̆ 7 s draft AML. These factors include the sheer scale and astounding growth of China 2 ̆ 7 s markets, the vast amounts of foreign capital recently invested in China, the burgeoning sales of Chinese goods abroad, the substantial growth in the participation of Chinese firms in foreign markets, and {{a recognition of the}} significant challenge posed by the establishment of free market competition in China 2 ̆ 7 s socialist market economy. To China 2 ̆ 7 s great credit, the State Council, the Ministry of Commerce (2 ̆ 2 MOFCOM 2 ̆ 2), the National Development and Reform Commission (2 ̆ 2 NDRC 2 ̆ 2), and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (2 ̆ 2 SAIC 2 ̆ 2) have solicited and studied numerous sets of comments from public and private organizations, companies, and academic experts around the world. The language of the draft AML pending before the National People 2 ̆ 7 s Congress (2 ̆ 2 NPC 2 ̆ 2) has incorporated many of these useful comments. However, concerns about the current draft remain. Broadly speaking, China 2 ̆ 7 s economy presents three principal features raising competition concerns: so-called local blockage or regional monopolies; sectoral monopolies by Chinese firms, including state-owned enterprises (2 ̆ 2 SOEs 2 ̆ 7); and a perception of alleged abuses of dominant positions by some foreign multinationals. Earlier drafts of the proposed AML contained a chapter prohibiting so-called administrative monopolies, which are typically large 2 ̆ 2 local champions 2 ̆ 2 protected from competition by local and <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> <b>bodies.</b> The elimination of that chapter from the November 11, 2005 Draft AML (2 ̆ 2 Current Draft AML 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 November 2005 Draft AML 2 ̆ 2) essentially exempts such anticompetitive conduct from the reach of the Anti-Monopoly Law.

Although Spain’s regulatory framework for telecommunications grants the Spanish government sole authority in this field, it also allows Catalonia’s <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> and local <b>bodies</b> to have indirect influence through their regulation of related issues within their purview, such as land use, public health, and the environment.
