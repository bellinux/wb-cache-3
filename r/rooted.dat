40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} were to 1) examine the ecological adaptability of Potentilla acaulis to grassland degradation {{from the perspective}} of <b>root</b> architecture, 2) reveal why it can be a dominant species in extremely degraded grassland and 3) discuss its important roles in vegetation restoration or succession and preventing grassland fromdesertification. Methods We collected relatively complete P. acaulis <b>roots</b> by trenching. The numbers of first vertical <b>roots,</b> length of horizontal <b>root</b> tillering and number of plant tillers were recorded in the field. The <b>root</b> analysis system of WinRHIZO was used to determine total <b>root</b> length, <b>root</b> surface area, total <b>root</b> volume, <b>root</b> average diameter, number of furcations, average branching angle, number of <b>root</b> axes, length of <b>root</b> axes, number of <b>root</b> tips, number of first lateral <b>roots,</b> length of first lateral <b>roots,</b> number of secondary lateral <b>roots,</b> length of secondary lateral <b>roots,</b> <b>root</b> diameters along <b>root</b> length, <b>root</b> surface area and <b>root</b> volume. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis. Important findings In degraded grassland typified by Stipa grandis, the function of P. acaulis became more important in the community and its <b>root</b> range, <b>root</b> depth, the number of first vertical <b>roots,</b> the number of plant tillers and the length of horizontal <b>root</b> tillering increased significantly. The parameters of <b>root</b> surface area, length of secondary lateral <b>roots,</b> total <b>root</b> length and the number of furcations explained the adaptability of P. acaulis to grassland degradation. <b>Roots</b> with a diameter < 2 mm had a significant effect on <b>root</b> surface area and total <b>root</b> length of single plants of P. acaulis. The three-dimensional <b>root</b> architecture of a broad-waist-inverted centrum was an advantageous configuration for P. acaulis to adapt for grassland degradation and can explain P. acaulis as a constructive species in extremely degraded grassland...|$|R

40|$|The <b>root</b> cap is {{increasingly}} appreciated {{as a complex}} and dynamic plant organ. <b>Root</b> caps sense and transmit environmental signals, synthesize and secrete small molecules and macromolecules, and in some species shed metabolically active cells.

We report the identification of a <b>root</b> cap-specific promoter and describe its use to genetically ablate <b>root</b> caps by directing <b>root</b> cap-specific expression of a diphtheria toxin A-chain gene. Transgenic toxin-expressing plants are viable and have normal aerial parts but agravitropic <b>roots,</b> implying loss of <b>root</b> cap function. Several cell layers are missing from the transgenic <b>root</b> caps, and the remaining cells are abnormal. Although the radial organization of the <b>roots</b> is normal in toxin-expressing plants, the <b>root</b> tips have fewer cytoplasmically dense cells than do wild-type <b>root</b> tips, suggesting that <b>root</b> meristematic activity is lower in transgenic than in wild-type plants. The <b>roots</b> of transgenic plants have more lateral <b>roots</b> and these are, in turn, more highly branched than those of wild-type plants. Thus, <b>root</b> cap ablation alters <b>root</b> architecture both by inhibiting <b>root</b> meristematic activity and by stimulating lateral <b>root</b> initiation.

30|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>root</b> systems in plants, defined by their {{developmental}} origin and branching patterns: taproot systems and fibrous <b>root</b> systems. The taproot system occurs in dicot plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and pea (Pisum sativa), while fibrous <b>root</b> systems occur in monocots such as rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays) (Atkinson et al. 2014). In taproot systems, the primary <b>root</b> is the main <b>root,</b> and branching consists of secondary, smaller lateral <b>roots</b> (LRs) and <b>root</b> hairs. A fibrous <b>root</b> system, by contrast, consists of a dense mass of adventitious <b>roots</b> (also called crown <b>roots</b> in cereals) that arise from the stem, which are distinct from the primary <b>root,</b> LRs, and <b>root</b> hairs (Coudert et al. 2010). Because the primary <b>root</b> (embryonic <b>root)</b> dies as the monocots age, the adventitious <b>roots</b> are the main <b>root</b> tissues in the fibrous <b>root</b> system of monocot plants.|$|R

30|$|Later, {{adventitious}} postembryonic crown <b>roots,</b> {{also called}} nodal <b>roots,</b> {{emerge from the}} nodes on the stem and tillers arranged {{in one or two}} rows (Fig.Â  1 b). For example, more than 100 crown <b>roots</b> are present 40 Â days after germination in cv Nipponbare plants grown under hydroponic conditions, forming a fibrous <b>root</b> system (Fig.Â  1 b). <b>Root</b> ramification is also partially responsible for this fibrous architecture. Indeed, lateral rice <b>roots</b> can appear on any primary <b>root,</b> including embryonic and crown <b>roots,</b> and can be classified into two main anatomical types [77] (Fig.Â  1 a, c). Thin small lateral <b>roots</b> exhibiting determinate growth are by far the most numerous (Fig.Â  1 a). A few large lateral <b>roots,</b> which are thinner in diameter than primary <b>roots,</b> can also be observed. They display indeterminate growth and can also bear small lateral <b>roots</b> (Fig.Â  1 c). Moreover, the small lateral <b>roots</b> elongate laterally, whereas the large lateral <b>roots</b> elongate downward, suggesting that the small lateral <b>roots</b> do not respond to gravity. Higher orders of branching can also be observed in the large lateral <b>roots</b> of the crown <b>roots</b> that emerge at later growth stages [55]. Small lateral <b>roots</b> exhibit determinate growth and never bear lateral <b>roots,</b> whereas all other <b>root</b> types have indeterminate growth and bear numerous lateral <b>roots,</b> suggesting a different function for these two types of lateral <b>roots.</b>|$|R

These results were reproducible in rhizoboxes under greenhouse conditions. Synchrotron-based in situ analysis of <b>root</b> hairs in intact soil further confirmed this pattern of <b>root</b> hair formation. In contrast, plants grown in nutrient solution produced more and longer <b>root</b> hairs in low P conditions, but these were unequally distributed among the different <b>root</b> types.
