50|$|On May 20, 2009, the Driscoll Bridge {{project was}} completed.

I have replaced the existing π intersection with the roundabout. On the whole <b>route,</b> <b>lanes</b> should be expanded to 2. 75 m. The entire route contains reconstructed pedestrian walkway along the left edge of the carriageway, roadside lighting, and drains to drain rainwater. I have placed two bus stops and two bus waiting places with a roof {{on each side of the}} roadway. Given the level of alignment in the horizontal plane, a road permits higher speeds than the permissible. Therefore, I have put traffic-calming measures with the splitter island on a flat route section. The entire route has got traffic signs and markings on the road...|$|R
