5000|$|In a fixed matrix regenerator, {{a single}} fluid stream has cyclical, {{reversible}} flow; {{it is said}} to flow [...] "counter-current". This regenerator may be part of a valveless system, such as a Stirling engine. In another configuration, the fluid is ducted through valves to different matrices in alternate operating periods resulting in outlet temperatures that vary with time. For example a blast furnace may have several [...] "stoves" [...] or [...] "checkers" [...] full of <b>refractory</b> <b>fire</b> <b>brick.</b> The hot gas from the furnace is ducted through the brickwork for some interval, say one hour, until the brick reaches a high temperature. Valves then operate and switch the cold intake air through the brick, recovering the heat for use in the furnace. Practcial installations will have multiple stoves and arrangements of valves to gradually transfer flow between a [...] "hot" [...] stove and an adjacent [...] "cold" [...] stove, so that the variations in the outlet air temperature are reduced.|$|E

40|$|Individual <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> {{domestication}} is {{not widely}} practiced; yet the <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> has played {{and will continue}} to play an immense role in the global built environment. Its pivotal task of creating and sustaining architectural structures is ancient and has permeated through to contemporary times courtesy of clay’s colossal vitality. Clay exploration and exploitation are perhaps most apparent in <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> production, particularly in first-world countries with a diverse range of clayware such as bricks and tiles. This development has not been fully maximized in Nigeria {{as a result of the}} small number of refractory plants whose total production capacity is beneath the nation’s building requirements. This scenario makes <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> procurement costly and limits its accessibility; consequently, it promotes socio-built inequality among viable <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> prospectors. In view of the aforementioned, this paper advocates individual <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> domestication in Nigeria’s rural and suburban settlements, providing concise practical details, from materials identification and mould fabrication to brick production. When fully harnessed, this is hoped to create jobs, alleviate the country’s <b>fired</b> <b>brick</b> deficit, boost individual economic standing, communal economies and ultimately the national economy. Possibly it could serve as a template in similar settings around the world...|$|R
