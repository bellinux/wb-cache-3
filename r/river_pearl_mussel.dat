These chronologies have so far been derived from living bivalves and corals. Here we demonstrate the possibility of constructing the sclerochronology from a suite of <b>river</b> <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> (Margaritifera margaritifera (L.)) shells with unknown but at least partly overlapping geological age. Subsequent to measuring of the annual shell growth increments, the sample series were iteratively compared {{to each other and}} to the mean series of other samples. This comparison forms the basis of the applied procedure, termed cross-dating, in which more inter-correlative sample series can be progressively added into the mean chronology in step-wise fashion. After cross-dating, the correlation of the 16 sample series (0. 52) indicated that the subfossil sclerochronology bore common growth signal that was comparable to previously recorded chronologies from modern samples. The cross-dated sclerochronology represented growth variations over a time window of 91 years. Variability in chronology was found to be statisticall...|$|E

40|$|The {{decline of}} {{freshwater}} <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> (Margaritifera margaritifera L.) populations is globally well documented, {{but there is}} a lack of knowledge concerning the status of the species and its interaction with host fishes in the rivers of the White and Baltic Seas. This study aimed to identify the host fish of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> in four <b>rivers</b> of Karelia (Northwest Russia), to analyse the duration of the parasitic phase, and the susceptibility of fish hosts to the infestation. Juvenile sea-migrating and land-locked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) were identified as the most important hosts. In the Keret’ River, reduced numbers of juvenile Atlantic salmon are likely to result in a decline of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel.</b> This problem does not appear to be present for the other three studied <b>rivers.</b> <b>Pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> glochidia were mostly found in yearlings (0 +), whereas older fish were infected less, suggesting a more complex pattern of host use than commonly expected. The remote location of Karelian <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> <b>rivers,</b> the high number of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> in them, and their rather pristine state all suggest that these rivers have a high conservation priority. The importance of Atlantic salmon as a host fish and the emerging declines of Atlantic salmon populations, e. g., in the Keret’ River, suggest that the sustaining of this host species should have a high conservation priority...|$|R

Six streams in Aš region (Rokytnice, Lužní potok, Pekelský potok, Újezdský potok, Perlový potok, Bockbach) including 15 profiles were evaluated {{throughout the season}} (1. 6. 31. 8. 2015). One year old <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> (n = 580) sized from 700 1400 ?m. Mean survival of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> was 63 % in all streams.

40|$|The {{freshwater}} <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> Margaritifera margaritifera (L.) {{has attracted}} a large human interest, since the mussel is fascinating from biological, cultural andenvironmental perspectives. The mussel has a complicated life cycle dependingon host fish, and has great demands on its habitat. Furthermore, the mussel is anenvironmental indicator, and is used as an umbrella and flagship species. Pearl fishing has been described in Sweden as early as in the 16 th century and by Carl Linnaeus in the 18 th century. Many freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> populations have insufficient recruitment and therefore decrease in numbers, and many populations are even extinct. Therefore, conservation work on the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> is going on all over Europe. Actions to preserve the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> will also favour other aquatic species – freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> conservation is aquatic biodiversity conservation! WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) Sweden implemented the project “The Freshwater <b>Pearl</b> <b>Mussel</b> and its habitats in Sweden” during 2004 - 2009 (LIFE 04 NAT/SE/ 000231). The overall objective was to improve the habitats of juvenile freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> and the host fish brown trout Salmo trutta in 21 streams. The actions were improvements of the biotopes, re-introduction of mussels, information to the stakeholders, and development of planning methods. An international conference “Aquatic Conservation with Focus on the Freshwater <b>Pearl</b> <b>Mussel</b> Margaritifera margaritifera” was held in Sundsvall 12 – 14 August, 2009.

It will describe the main factors affecting its reproduction and presence in the watercourse - the fresh <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> is to be found among the endangered species and its presence and survival in a certain location depend primarily on the hosting fish which is the brown trout here in the Czech Republic. Generally, the main stress lays on {{the temperature}} and its influence on the ecology of the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel.</b> This thesis contains a research part which describes the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> and impacts on it, and a practical part where you can find an assessment of the temperature and qualitative impact on growth and death of the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> during bioindications. The temperature influences all age stages of the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel.</b> The temperature changes thanks to a variety of different aspects such as surrounding flora in the watercourse, atmospherical factors, anthropogenic activity or altitude. You will be able to find all these aspects along with a percentage of their potential effect on the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> in this thesis as well as the assessment of the average summer temperature and its possible impact on any specimen of any stage. The thesis is also based on the impact of surroundings on the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> which are discovered during bioindications that are also described here and have been partially used in the appraisal. The practical part of the thesis is focused on the growth and death of the species in the bioindication in five profiles of the watercourse.

50|$|The {{freshwater}} <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel,</b> {{which is}} completely protected in all European countries, {{has been the}} focus of a significant amount of conservation efforts. Measures have included the transfer of adult mussels to areas where it had gone extinct, the culture of juvenile mussels, and the release of juvenile trout, which have been infected with glochidia, into small rivers, but mainly the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> has benefited from habitat restoration projects in some areas. Due to the essential role salmonid fish play in the life of the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel,</b> the conservation of salmon and trout is also central in the survival of this endangered freshwater mussel.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on {{oligotrophic}} rivers and their communities are almost unknown, albeit these ecosystems are the primary habitat of the critically endangered freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> and its host fishes, salmonids. The distribution and abundance of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> have drastically decreased throughout Europe over the last century, particularly within {{the southern part of the}} range, but causes of this wide-scale extinction process are unclear. Here we estimate the {{effects of climate}} change on <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> based on historical and recent samples from 50 rivers and 6 countries across Europe. We found that the shell convexity may be considered an indicator of the thermal effects on <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> populations under warming climate because it reflects shifts in summer temperatures and is significantly different in viable and declining populations. Spatial and temporal modeling of the relationship between shell convexity and population status show that global climate change could have accelerated the population decline of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> over the last 100 years through rapidly decreasing suitable distribution areas. Simulation predicts future warming-induced range reduction, particularly in southern regions. These results highlight the importance of large-scale studies of keystone species, which can underscore the hidden effects of climate warming on freshwater ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this present}} study was to {{determine}} and evaluate whether the presence of brooktrout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and sediment load may be a threat against the reproduction anddistribution of freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> (Margaritifera margaritifera) in a creek located innorthern Sweden. Freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> is an endangered species and is dependent ofbrown trout (Salmo trutta) to reproduce. Therefore there are concerns of indirect effects onthe population of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> by competition between brown trout and brook trout. Ditchesfrom a nearby gravel road have been fixed to lower the sediment load into the creek. I tried toevaluate this action plan. Electrofishing, mussel- and habitat inventory was carried outwithin each locality to reveal results of the glochidia abundance on both brown trout andbrook trout. Data of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> dispersal and habitat use were collected. I found glochidiaon both brown trout and brook trout, but in much smaller numbers on brook trout. The pearlmussel is present in frequent numbers in {{the upper part of the}} creek, but downstream thenumber of mussels decrease, probably because of the previous ditch influence from thenearby gravel road. The creek cross the gravel road in one place and on the stretchdownstream no living mussels were found. The result suggest that sediment load might stillinfluence the <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> population in some parts of the creek and that this effect is greaterthan the presence of brook trout...|$|R

40|$|The {{freshwater}} <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> Margaritifera margaritifera L. {{is one of}} {{the most}} endangered freshwater mussels in the world. Effective conservation of threatened species requires not only ecological, but also genetic information from the target species and populations. Since low genetic diversity can reduce the ability of a species to adapt to environmental changes, maintaining genetic diversity has been identified as one of the key elements in successful conservation programs. We examined genetic variation of the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> from the <b>River</b> Vuokkijoki, Karelia, Russia. We sequenced a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) from 22 individuals and compared the data to 32 previously published COI sequences available in GenBank. We identified 10 different COI haplotypes in the sequenced samples, three of which had not been previously reported. Our results show that the River Vuokkijoki has high genetic diversity and suggest that the colonization of this northern freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> population might have occurred from multiple and even distant refugia. Therefore, the freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> population of the River Vuokkijoki is valuable for the conservation of the whole species...|$|R

Basic and essential precondition to support populations of freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> is the presence of viable populations of brown trout, which represents the only suitable host glochidia. There are five locations with the biggest occurrence of <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> in the Czech Republic - river basins the Blanice, the Teplá Vltava, the Malše, the Rokytnice and the Jankovský potok.

The average length of shells was 95. 8 mm, thickness 27. 9 mm, height 43. 4 mm. The ligament was eroded from 57 % and index (ration between thickness and length x 50) was on average 32 %. Thickness of the shells and the percentage of eroded ligament differed between the two areas. Both of these parameters were higher in Aš area. Other morphological parameters (length and height of the shells and the above mentioned index) were similar in both areas. Assessment of age according to the growth lines in the ligament was significantly higher than the evaluation using growth lines on the surface of the shells. Mean age of freshwater <b>pearl</b> <b>mussels</b> determined using growth lines in the ligament was 36 years old and on the surface of the shells was 30 years old.

40|$|The giant <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> Margaritifera auricularia, {{previously}} {{widespread in}} Western Europe, still survives {{in a few}} aging core populations, which have not been recruiting for several decades. The extirpation of its main host-fish, the European Sturgeon Acipenser sturio, {{is believed to be}} the main cause of its rarefaction. A few decades seem to be left to save the giant <b>pearl</b> <b>mussel</b> from extinction. A European Sturgeon restoration plan is ongoing, but given the late sexual maturity of this species, we cannot expect a return of sexually mature individuals in rivers in France before ca. 15 years. In order to restore ecosystems’ functionality and save the Giant <b>Pearl</b> <b>Mussel</b> from extinction, we suggest the reintroduction of a similar species: the Atlantic Sturgeon A. oxyrinchus. This species is the least threatened of the Acipenseridae and was present in France at least between 3 000 BC and 200 AD.
