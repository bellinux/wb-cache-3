25|$|Throughout {{its service}} time, the Panel system was {{upgraded}} as new features became available or necessary. Starting in the mid-1920s, such upgrades improved the initial design. Major attention was initially focused on improving the sender. Early two- and three-digit type senders stored dialed digits on <b>rotary</b> <b>selector</b> switches. The senders employed translators {{to convert the}} dialed digits into the appropriate brush and group selections needed to complete the call. As better technology became available, Panel senders were upgraded to the all-relay type. These were more reliable, and in addition, replaced the translator equipment with decoders, which also operated entirely with relays, rather than with motor-driven apparatus, which yielded faster call completion.|$|E

5000|$|On 15 January 2009, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive No 2009-0012-E {{to address}} the above A330 and A340 Northrop-Grumman ADIRU problem of {{incorrectly}} responding to a defective inertial reference. In {{the event of a}} NAV IR fault the directed crew response is now to [...] "select OFF the relevant IR, select OFF the relevant ADR, and then turn the IR <b>rotary</b> mode <b>selector</b> to the OFF position." [...] The effect is to ensure that the faulted IR is powered off so that it no longer can send erroneous data to other systems.|$|R

5000|$|Pickups are {{designed}} and wound in-house. While {{most of the}} pickups are humbuckers, some are actually a pair of single coils wound in opposing directions, one intended for the neck {{and one for the}} bridge position. Through the use of a unique <b>rotary</b> pickup <b>selector</b> switch, PRS pickups offer 5 different sounds: a combination of thick humbucking Gibson-like tones, and thinner single-coil Stratocaster-like tones. The standard treble and standard bass pick ups use magnetic pole pieces in the non-adjustable inner coil, and a rear-placed feeder magnet in order to achieve a more authentic single-coil tone when split by the rotary switch ...|$|R
5000|$|Hardware and {{electronic}} component differences aside, {{the configuration of}} the Fender variant was almost identical to that of the Squier, with the only notable differences being the use of a full thickness Stratocaster alder body instead of a thinner (by approximately one quarter of an inch) basswood body, and a string-through-body hardtail Stratocaster bridge instead of a top-load bridge. The '51's signature features were all retained, including the Telecaster neck and headstock style, the Stratocaster body shape, and the original Precision Bass pickguard and control plate, humbucking bridge and single coil neck pickups, as well as the <b>rotary</b> pickup <b>selector,</b> single volume control with push-pull coil-tap switch, and absent tone control.|$|R
50|$|The XK {{received}} a facelift in 2009,with minor alterations to {{front and rear}} lighting and bumper designs, together {{with the introduction of}} a new 5.0-litre V8 for both the naturally aspirated XK and the supercharged XKR. The interior also received some changes, in particular the introduction of the XF style <b>rotary</b> gear <b>selector</b> mated to the new ZF automatic transmission. In 2010, Jaguar added the Speed Pack option, with aerodynamic bodykit and speed limiter increased to 174 mi/h km/h, and the Black Pack, with black wheels and trim. The XK {{received a}} second and more minor facelift in 2011 with new front bumper and light design,which was presented at the New York Auto Show.|$|R
50|$|Some radio users had {{selected}} the wrong channels. For example, on the Repeater 7 channel, a unit was heard to call Manhattan dispatch and Citywide. Although {{the circumstances that}} lead to the user selecting the wrong channel are not known, this can occur when the user is trapped in darkness or smoke and cannot see the radio. Users will typically try to count steps in a <b>rotary</b> switch channel <b>selector</b> starting {{from one end of the}} switch's travel.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the F-Pace features several existing Jaguar design cues, including the <b>rotary</b> gear <b>selector</b> which rises when the car is started. The central console, when equipped with the upgraded InControl Touch Pro system, features a 10.2 inch (26.5 cm) touch screen allowing access to in-car entertainment, satellite navigation and various vehicular settings, such as the G-Meter and engine/gear shift/steering/suspension parameters. Navigation can also be shown full-screen, in 3D on an additional 12.3-inch HD virtual instrument cluster. The F-Pace features smartphone connectivity with Wifi Hotspot and some models allow the owner to control the vehicle remotely, pre-heating the interior or unlocking the car using a smartphone application.The F-Pace is also the first vehicle in Jaguar's range to feature the Activity Key, a waterproof wrist band that unlocks the F-Pace allowing the main keys to be left inside, thus preventing possible water damage.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1961, the EB-3 (based on {{an earlier}} model, the EB-0)was one of the bass guitar {{equivalents}} of the popular Gibson SG. It featured a slim SG-style body, a short 30.5" [...] scale, and two pickups (a large humbucking pickup in the neck position and a mini-humbucker pickup in the bridge position). The electronics consisted of a four-way <b>rotary</b> pickup <b>selector</b> switch (for Series 1 basses; neck pickup with midrange notch, bridge, bridge and neck with low end rolled off neck pickup, neck pickup with choke) and volume and tone knobs for each pickup. The standard finish was cherry red (like the SG guitar models), though EB-3s were also produced in other finishes such as Polaris White, Pelham Blue, Walnut, and Ebony. By the time production ceased in 1979, a total of 14167 instruments had been built.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a series winding. They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type series winding and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two <b>rotary</b> tap <b>selector</b> units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter switch assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil. The current line entries for the 132 kV switch house are North Greetwell - Lincoln 1, Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 2, North Greetwell - Lincoln 2 and Retford - Worksop - Checkerhouse 1 ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Phased arrays improve B 1 {{homogeneity}} {{for head}} imaging up to 9. 4 T (1). Tight fit arrays further improve transmit performance (2). However, due to close proximity loading {{of the elements}} depends on the head size. Therefore, tuning and matching are necessary before each experiment. Automatic tuning/matching (3, 4) is a valid but complicated approach. In case of well decoupled arrays and moderate subject motion a multi-channel mechanical switch can be used (5) for tuning and matching. These switches, however, often contain magnetic components and are expensive. In this work we have developed a low cost electronic tuning/matching selector box using solid state integrated switches (Mini-circuits, USA) for an 8 -channel 9. 4 T (400 MHz) phased array. Subjects and Methods: A major component of the tuning/matching selector box (Fig. 1), i. e. an 8 -way absorptive switch, consists of two 4 -way absorptive switches (GSWA- 4 - 30 DR+) and a 2 -way reflective switch (SWM- 2 - 50 DR+). Control electronics in combination with a <b>rotary</b> channel <b>selector</b> allows easy and quick connection of the RF input {{to one of the}} 8 outputs of the ODU socket (Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows the final setup for array tuning/matching. All 8 array channels are combined together using an ODU connector, which is plugged into the box. An RF sweeper is connected to the RF input and can be sequentially connected to each of the array elements using the channel selector. The only magnetic component, the power supply providing + 5 V, - 5 V (Fig. 1 a), has to be placed outside of the magnet room and connected by the extension cord. Results: Using this setup the 8 -channel transceiver array can be tuned and matched within 2 min with the subject present directly at the scanner. Usually it takes less since some elements doesn’t have to be readjusted. In comparison to mechanical switches solid state switches are lossy, which does not cause any issue since their VSWRs are sufficiently good. In our case the tuning/matching box introduced - 2. 1 dB loss (from the ODU plug to the BNC RF input) with input and output VSWRs measuring 1. 2 and 1. 13, respectively. Discussion/Conclusion: As an alternative to a complicated automatic tuning/matching of multi-channel transceiver arrays we have developed a low cost 8 -channel tune/match selector, which allows quick adjustment of arrays inside the magnet room. The design allows an easy extension to a larger number of channels...|$|R
