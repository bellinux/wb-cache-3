Her instructor is a strict looking woman in black with thin glasses and hair ever so tightly pulled back. Ossi bathes the doll and shakes it off to dry it. She is yelled at for <b>not</b> <b>holding</b> it <b>correctly,</b> and Ossi snaps back at the teacher and continues {{to shake off the}} doll. Then, she is instructed to powder the baby, but unknowingly powders its face. Ossi is so confused about why she should powder its bottom that she exclaims, “that’s funny.” She goes to touch the bottom but disgusted, tosses the naked doll behind her, across the room, and proceeds to throw powder puff at the instructor.|$|R
40|$|A test of {{directional}} entailment {{properties of}} classical quantifiers {{defined by the}} theory of generalised quantifiers (Barwise and Cooper, 1981) is described. Participants had to solve a task which consisted of four kinds of inference. In the first one, the premise was of the type Q - hyponym - verb - blank predicate, where Q is a classical quantifier, (e. g., some cats are []), and the question was to indicate what, if anything, can be concluded by filling up the slots in [...] - hyperonym - verb - blank predicate (e. g., [...] animals are []). The second kind of inference was the same, except that the hyperonym was in the premise and the hyponym in the conclusion. The third and fourth kinds of inference differed from the first two by {{the position of the}} hyperonym (resp. hyponym) which occupied the place of the predicate (e. g., some [] are animals). It was observed that when the directional entailment holds people respond accorddingly in most cases and that when the entailment does <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> they <b>correctly</b> fail to produce it. These results provide elementary, but essential empirical support to this semantic approach to quantification, as well as a prerequisite for its application to the study of reasoning with quantifiers. The implications for the psychology of reasoning are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of agents in financial markets often displays biases or errors; for example, agents frequently do not compute probabilities correctly. However, {{we argue that}} these biases/errors are not always reflected in prices. In particular, we hypothesize that agents who make errors in computing probabilities lose confidence in their probability estimates when they face market prices that are inconsistent with their calculations; they then perceive (relevant) uncertain events as ambiguous (rather than risky), and hedge against this perceived ambiguity by holding a portfolio that generates unambiguous returns. These agents are price insensitive – they do not adjust their portfolio with changes in prices – and do not (directly) influence market prices. We identify price insensitive agents in an asset market experiment, and we test implications of our hypothesis: (i) agents who do <b>not</b> update <b>correctly</b> <b>hold</b> more balanced portfolios; (ii) the difference between portfolio holdings of agents who do not update correctly and agents who do update correctly increases as aggregate risk in the economy increases; (iii) prices {{are determined by the}} behavior o...|$|R
