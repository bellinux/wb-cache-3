5000|$|The {{benefits}} from <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> depend {{directly on the}} relative market behavior. This is explained as follows: If we compare two markets and when demand from both markets {{are more or less}} than the average demand, we say that the demands from the market are positively correlated. Thus the benefits derived from <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> decreases as the correlation between demands from the two markets becomes more positive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract onlyIndividual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) in {{multispecies fisheries}} create incentives for fishermen to avoid bycatch of species for which quota is scarce. However, when bycatch is highly uncertain, individual quota demand and prices may be volatile creating substantial financial risk for fishermen. The US Pacific Groundfish fishery recently introduced an ITQ system with low quotas for several overfished species with highly uncertain bycatch rates. Some fishery participants formed <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> where bycatch quota is pooled and {{available to all}} <b>pool</b> members. <b>Risk</b> <b>pools</b> can reduce financial risk and transactions costs for individuals, but they also create moral hazard and adverse selection problems. We present an empirical analysis of bycatch risk that informs several issues of <b>risk</b> <b>pool</b> design including which bycatch species to include, pools size, and how to evaluate and mitigate adverse selection and moral hazard problems. The analysis suggests that <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> can achieve substantial risk reduction and lower adverse selection and moral hazard issues by limiting the species included in <b>risk</b> <b>pools,</b> by keeping <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> relatively small and by specifying monitorable practices that reduce expected bycatch...|$|R
50|$|Although {{assumptions}} of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, {{there are important}} deviations. Many states have created <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidise {{the care of the}} rest. Insurers must cope with adverse selection which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the <b>risk</b> <b>pool.</b> Features of insurance market <b>risk</b> <b>pools,</b> such as group purchases, preferential selection ("cherry-picking"), and preexisting condition exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>pooling</b> is an {{important}} concept in supply chain management. [...] <b>Risk</b> <b>pooling</b> suggests that demand variability is reduced if one aggregates demand across locations because as demand is aggregated across different locations, it becomes more likely that high demand from one customer will be offset by low demand from another. This reduction in variability allows a decrease in safety stock and therefore reduces average Inventory.|$|E

50|$|To {{overcome}} the problem, some governments have made basic health insurance compulsory and {{also created a}} <b>risk</b> equalization <b>pool</b> {{to even out differences}} in risks carried by insurance companies in the health market. Thus, the younger and healthier people must pay into the <b>risk</b> equalization <b>pool,</b> and the older and sicker people will receive money from the equalization pool.

50|$|Insurance {{functions}} on {{the concept}} of <b>risk</b> <b>pooling,</b> and likewise, regardless of its small unit size and its activities at the level of single communities, so does microinsurance. Microinsurance links multiple small units into larger structures, creating networks that enhance both insurance functions (through broader risk pools) and support structures for improved governance (i.e. training, data banks, research facilities, access to reinsurance etc.). This mechanism is conceived as an autonomous enterprise, independent of permanent external financial lifelines, and its main objective is to pool both risks and resources of whole groups for the purpose of providing financial protection to all members against the financial consequences of mutually determined risks.|$|E

40|$|State high-risk {{insurance}} pools serve {{people who}} have been denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or who don’t have access to employer based coverage. There are 35 state high-risk insurance pools across the country serving approximately 200, 000 people. The U. S. Congress is considering various proposals to expand high <b>risk</b> <b>pool</b> coverage as part of health care reform to cover people with pre-existing conditions. However, data suggest that high <b>risk</b> <b>pools</b> as currently proposed will not adequately meet the needs of those with potentially serious health conditions. Many <b>risk</b> <b>pool</b> enrollees fall into a gray area between being chronically ill, but able to work at least part-time, and being disabled to the point of qualifying for federal disability programs and their accompanying health care coverage. As Congress astutely noted in its 1999 Ticket to Work legislation, moving just one half of one percent of people off of disability programs and back into the workforce would result in $ 3. 5 billion in federal savings. Preventing one-half of one percent of people from being added to the disability rolls would result in an additional net savings of $ 3. 5 billion to the federal government. 1 Current High <b>Risk</b> <b>Pool</b> Costs and Coverage In 2008, lawmakers called for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the abilit...|$|R

40|$|In most markets, it is {{considered}} desirable for consumers to have more choices. But health insurance regulation is different. When it comes to health insurance, giving consumers more choices can result in the market collapsing — leaving the sickest and most needy consumers without any good choices at all. To mitigate this problem, the Affordable Care Act’s Exchanges were designed around maintaining a single exchange-based <b>risk</b> <b>pool.</b> However, one problem with this approach taken by the Affordable Care Act is that the regulations designed to maintain the single exchange-based <b>risk</b> <b>pool</b> have the side effect of limiting some potentially positive aspects of consumer choice and provider competition. Might there be a {{way for us to}} have our cake and eat it too? Could reforms limit adverse selection while also fostering more innovation through market incentives? Our tentative answer is yes.

5000|$|The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers {{has great}} divergences on the {{fundamental}} operating principles {{with the government}} in the scheme. They believe that the suggested premium level at $3600 is unrealistic and misleading, because it fails {{to take into account the}} effect of medical inflation. The one-off funding to the HRP and Guaranteed Acceptance is insufficient and unsustainable without the government’s long-term commitment. [...] In addition, there are several uncertainties, such as the lack of proper definition of high risk and the transparency of medical fee by the hospitals. The Hong Kong Women Professional & Entrepreneurs Association has strong reservation towards the proposed VHIS as they think the scheme is not favorable to the majority middle class in Hong Kong. The VHIS is not cost effective to induce citizens to purchase, specifically to the young generation. The Institute of Financial Planners of Hong Kong questioned the effectiveness of <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> with a voluntary scheme and the coordination with private healthcare sectors if there is no effective control on costs and quality of services.|$|E
50|$|Under the Bachelet government, {{the pension}} system was {{reformed}} {{again in the}} year 2008. Andrés Velasco, the leading economic adviser to the government, addressed the two main problems as {{the coverage of the}} population and the amount of the administrative costs. Too many people are outside the pension system, and capital accumulation by using the pension funds is quite expensive The reform follows a recommendation by the World Bank, who has found in the 1980 pension system a strong redistributive component at the expense of low paid or occasionally unemployed workers. A big part of the Chilean population is not able to finance meaningful pensions, because many workers are not able to regularly contribute a higher amount of money. Additionally many workers have difficulties to achieve the 20 years of contributions to at least qualify for minimum pension. Since the pension funds charge high fixed administrative costs per insured person and {{only a small portion of}} the administrative costs depend on the amount of the capital account, capital accumulation by pension funds is very unprofitable for workers with lower incomes. The World Bank therefore recommended that the minimum pension and the Pensiones Asistenciales should be abolished and instead introduced a public <b>risk</b> <b>pooling</b> device financed by VAT tax revenue.|$|E
