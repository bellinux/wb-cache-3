Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.'

500|$|Supervising {{animator}} Glen Keane designed Rapunzel {{under the}} tutelage of veteran animator Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. Johnston advised Keane to attempt to capture what Rapunzel is thinking as opposed to simply animating what the character is doing after reviewing one of his early pencil tests. Keane compared receiving this advice to receiving a [...] "slap that I never forgot, so when I was drawing over people's work, I <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> to get into the head of the thinking of the character". Co-director Byron Howard was inspired by the appearance of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), a character who was also animated by Keane. Howard elaborated that [...] "Ariel was the first character that I ever thought there was a soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to". Meanwhile, Keane observed that Ariel and Rapunzel also share [...] "irrepressible" [...] spirits while encountering barriers that prevent them from pursuing their dreams. Keane was inspired by a book about the idea of feminine beauty; the book cited [...] "strangeness" [...] as [...] "the key to beauty ... in a woman's face." [...] Taking this into consideration, Keane maintained a sense of asymmetry while drawing Rapunzel, incorporating into her face several subtle imperfections, specifically her bucked teeth. The character was also drawn with freckles, making her the first Disney princess to have this feature. Keane designed Rapunzel with large eyes in order to convey her [...] "irrepressible quality", a trait her also discovered in Mandy Moore's voice. The animators created nine different versions of Rapunzel before finally settling on a design with which they were satisfied. Although Moore has observed some physical similairites between the character and herself, she maintains that Rapunzel's appearance was developed long before she became involved with the project, dismissing any similarities as [...] "coincidental".|$|E

500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we <b>really</b> <b>tried</b> to be faithful to." ...|$|E
