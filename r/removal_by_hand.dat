50|$|Removal of old mortar between joints is done {{carefully}} {{to avoid damage}} to masonry units. On buildings with soft materials, such as under-fired brick and lime mortar, <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> is often the most effective to avoid damage. Hard Portland cement mortar is usually removed with a grinder or power circular masonry blade, {{taking care not to}} damage the masonry units. Vertical joints are done by hand or with small power chisels.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason this}} weed {{is so hard}} to control is its ability to {{reproduce}} in such great numbers, and the damage it does when removed. Seeds of the yellow soldier are next to impossible to see in the soil or on the shoes of removalists, and germinate easily, negating the effect of the removal program. <b>Removal</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> is labour-intensive, with only 4m² (42 square feet) being removed in a 6-hour period (Weed Management Guide). The ability to grow back from its root system means that the entire plant must be removed from the ground, allowing other weeds to germinate.|$|E

40|$|Chorizanthe robusta var. hartwegii (Scotts Valley spineflower, Polygonaceae) is {{a narrow}} endemic plant {{restricted}} to a specialized microhabitat (exposed bedrock in California prairie) in Santa Cruz County, California. This taxon and the nominate variety were listed as endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act in 1994. Three occurrences of C. robusta hartwegii exist on four properties in a {{recently urbanized area}} at {{the northern edge of}} the city of Scotts Valley. Ten of 80 known colonies are now likely extirpated. In 2014 the primary threats are habitat alteration due to adjacent land uses and developments, and invasive plant species (non-natives) and accumulation of thatch. Using international standards, C. robusta hartwegii is critically endangered: area of occupancy, 0. 39 ha; extent of occurrence, 1. 3 km 2; landscape, severely fragmented; and quality of the habitat, continuing to decline. With these attributes, C. robusta hartwegii faces an extremely high risk of extinction. As a matter of urgency, we recommend reducing and controlling invasive plant species and thatch using a combination of methods: mowing with biomass <b>removal,</b> cutting <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> tools with biomass <b>removal,</b> pulling <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> with biomass <b>removal,</b> controlled grazing, prescribed mini-burns (testing 1 m 2), and spot-treating invasive grasses with a grass-specific herbicide...|$|R

Tubers may be broken up by tractors or road graders and each fragment {{may be able to}} regrow; they can also be difficult to find with <b>removal</b> of plants <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> Acetosa sagittata may grow and smother other plants it covers.|$|R
50|$|The {{new plant}} also {{included}} two elevators of steel construction and a 30 feet by 4 feet picking belt. The picking belt {{was used to}} facilitate the <b>removal,</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> of rock from the coal. Oversized pieces of coal could also be manually crushed with hammers. Elsewhere, skip haulage and hand-picking became obsolete but at Acland these methods continued to be used until the mine's closure. The elevators were used to convey the processed coal {{to the top of}} the hoppers for loading into train wagons. The picking belt and elevators survive intact at the mine.|$|E
50|$|C. monilifera is {{potentially}} susceptible {{to a range}} of control strategies, however Burgman and Lindenmayer recommended that the strategy chosen be responsive to the local situation and available resources. Due to its relatively shallow root system <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> is an ideal method of control. Where manual removal is impractical many common herbicides can be used, in which case the herbicide is commonly applied directly to the wood of the plant via a cut notch or {{at the end of a}} pruned stump. Mechanical removal of C. monilifera by tractor or other machinery can also be effective, however this can be extremely indiscriminate and is only recommended in areas of poor environmental values and minimal erosion risk.|$|E
50|$|A wet season's paddy harvest may clog {{the screens}} and grain will be lost. Cleaning is {{essential}} before milling. On the farm, cleaning {{is usually a}} combination of winnowing and <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> of heavier items such as stones. Losses can be low when the operation is done carefully but high with carelessness. With correct equipment, cleaning losses should be low in mills, but grain may be separated together with dirt or, alternatively, dirt may be carried forward into the milling stages. In drying, grain that is dried in yards or on roads, as is common in parts of Asia, may be partially consumed by birds and rodents. Wind, either natural or from passing vehicles {{in the case of}} road drying, can blow grain away.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the fourth}} level down, the coal was further cleaned of impurities. This was {{originally}} done primarily <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> but hand picking was gradually supplanted after 1910 by improved screens and jigs. Although breaker boys worked {{at all levels}} of the coal breaker, most of the <b>removal</b> of impurities <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> occurred on this level. (Some picking did occur on the ground level of the coal breaker, where boys would locate good pieces of coal in the culm and return it to the [...] "clean" [...] coal stream.) Some coal might travel to this level directly from second level, if small enough, as at this level the screens and jigs were only capable of handling egg-grade coal and smaller. This area of the coal breaker was also where most dry screens and wet jigs operated. At this level, the use of conveyor belts (with or without paddles or scoops) was necessarily in order to move the smaller grades of coal, with most belts moving at about 33 feet per minute for pea coal and 50 feet per minute for larger grades. Multiple sorting and picking levels might exist in a single coal breaker, depending on the amount of coal to be processed.|$|R

5000|$|Dramatically {{increasing}} {{commodity prices}} {{has led to}} shortages of new tires. As a consequence, multimillion-dollar trucks can be idled for lack of tires, costing mines {{millions of dollars in}} lost productivity. This has led to a stronger effort to recycle old OTR tires. As of 2008, a new OTR tire can cost up to $50,000; retread tires are sold at half the price of new tires, and last 80% as long. Retreading an OTR tire is labor-intensive. First, the retreading technician must place the old tire in a buffing machine to remove what remains of the old tread; [...] "skiving" [...] follows this, which is the <b>removal,</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> of material the buffing misses. Next, the technician must inspect the tire, repairing defects. Lastly, the technician fills holes in the tire with rubber, applies a cement gum adhesive, and places the tire on a machine that will apply a new tread.|$|E
40|$|Bovine embryos {{produced}} by {{in vitro maturation}} (IVM). fertilization (IVF) and culture (IVC) were used to produce aggregation chimeras. An aggregated chimera was {{produced by}} combining bovine IVF embryos (Holstein x Japanese Black and Japanese Brown x Limousin breeds) which were cultured in vitro without the zonae pellucidae. Forty-eight hours after IVF. embryos at the 8 cell-stage were used to produce aggregation chimeras. In Experiment I, the zonae pellucidae was removed by a microsurgical method using a microblade or by treatment with 0. 25 % pronase. Holstein x Japanese Black embryos were aggregated with Japanese Brown x Limousin embryos after zonae <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> manipulation in culture medium. In Experiment II. {{the viability of the}} aggregated embryos developing into blastocysts was examined by measuring the extent of development. The number of aggregated embryos and embryos developed into blastocysts was 34 (91. 9 %) and 24 (70. 6 %), respectively, when the zonae pelluci-dae was removed by the microsurgical method; and 12 (92. 3 %) and 6 (50. 0 %), respectively, when the zonae pellucidae was removed using the 0. 25 % pronase treatment. The size of the aggregated embryos was significantly different'from that of the normal embryos when cultured in vitro until Day 10, but not different thereafter.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that species interactions such as granivory are more intense in the tropics. However, this {{has rarely been}} tested. A global dataset of post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> invertebrates and vertebrates for 79 native plant species from semi-natural and natural terrestrial habitats ranging from 55 ° N to 45 ° S, was compiled from the global literature {{to test the hypothesis}} that post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> invertebrates and vertebrates is more intense at lower latitudes. We also quantified the relationship between post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> vertebrates and by invertebrates to global climatic features including temperature, actual evapotranspiration (AET) and rainfall seasonality. Linear mixed effect models were applied to describe the relationships between seed removal and latitude, hemisphere and climatic variables controlling for the effect of seed mass. Post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> invertebrates was negatively related to latitude. In contrast, post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> vertebrates was positively but weakly related to latitude. Mean annual temperature and actual evapotranspiration were positively related to post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> invertebrates, but not to post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> vertebrates, which was only marginally negatively related to rainfall seasonality. The inclusion of seed mass improved the fit of all models, but the term for seed mass was not significant in any model. Although a good climatic model for predicting post-dispersal seed predation by vertebrates at the global level was not found, our results suggest different and opposite latitudinal patterns of post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> invertebrates vs vertebrates. This {{is the first time that}} a negative relationship between post-dispersal seed <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> invertebrates and latitude, and a positive relationship with temperature and AET have been documented at a global-scale. These results have important implications for understanding global patterns in plant-animal interactions, and the factors that shape plant reproductive ecology, and also for predicting how this plant-animal interaction might respond to climate change...|$|R

40|$|The first {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the effect of leaf <b>removal</b> either <b>by</b> grazing or <b>hand</b> cutting on the photosynthetic ability of the Salix species. The second aim was to investigate any change of leaf quality to feeding insect larvae which occurred {{as a consequence of the}} removal. Thirdly, the selectivity of the larvae between different Salix species and its effect on the larval development were studied. The leaf <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> grazing or <b>hand</b> cutting did not decrease the leaf fresh weight in Salix viminalis (submitted to two intensities of treatment) or in S. vitellina, after a period of recovery. The total leaf production in both species was similar to the control. In S. cinerea the grazing reduced the leaf weight and the total leaf production. The leaf size was reduced also. The leaves of previously grazed or hand cut Salix viminalis plants had no depressive effect on the growth of the Geometridae larvae "G". A similar result was obtained with the larvae of the sawfly Amauronematus sagmarius feeding on S. rotundifolia. The Geometridae larvae "G" selected Salix viminalis (58 % of the total food consumption) rather than S. cinerea in a choice experiment. S. viminalis promoted a faster growth of the larvae "G" when transferred to it from their previous food plant S. cinerea. The growth of the sawfly larvae was faster on S. fragilis, the species selected by the female for oviposition, than on S. rotundifolia. The death rate of the larvae of Amauronematus sagmarius was higher on both S. viminalis and S. cinerea than on S. vitellina, selected by the adult female for egg laying. Finally, the young leaves of S. rotundifolia promoted a higher death rate in the first generation of Amauronematus sagmarius larvae than the old leaves. The time required for pupation was shorter on the diet of young leaves in the first and second larval generations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the changes {{observed}} {{in the first year}} of conversion to organic and biodynamic cultivation in a vineyard growing Rhine Riesling and Pinot blanc grafted onto SO 4 and trained using the simple pergola system in a hilly area in Trentino (Italy). Three farming methods were compared: conventional (CONV; chemical weeding under the rows, grass mowing between rows, mechanical topping and airoperated leaf removal, cluster thinning with gibberellic acid), organic (ORG; soil working under the rows, grass mowing between rows, rolling up the canopy along the furthest wire, air-operated leaf removal and hand fining) and biodynamic (BIOD; soil working under the rows, deep ripping between rows, side-shoot <b>removal</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> green manure in alternate rows, 2 soil treatments with horn manure 500, 3 leaf treatments with horn silicate 501). The cluster weight, real fertility, yield/vine and Ravaz index were measured. Sugars, total acidity, pH, tartaric and malic acids, K and the assimilable nitrogen of grapes harvested from 10 parcels for each variety at ripeness were measured. In both varieties, BIOD farming showed a higher cluster weight, yield/vine and Ravaz index, while the differences between ORG and CONV were significant in terms of cluster compactness in both varieties and cluster weight and botrytis attack only in the case of Riesling. As regards grape composition, technologically speaking the main differences observed were in pH - slightly lower in the ORG and BIOD plots - and above all in yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), while no statistically significant differences were found for °Brix.
