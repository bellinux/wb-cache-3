25|$|Soil {{deposits}} {{are affected}} by the mechanism of transport and deposition to their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual soils—they exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated. Decomposed granite is a common example of a <b>residual</b> <b>soil.</b> The common mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, ice, water, and wind. Wind blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and gravel and sand collect {{at the bottom of a}} river bed. Wind blown soil deposits (aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles down from the top of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base; soil deposits transported by gravity are called colluvium.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provided}} some basic {{information on the}} morphology, genesis and classification of some soils in AI-Sawdah, South-Western Saudi Arabia for better soil surveying and land use planning in future. Four soil profiles developed in residuum, alluvium and/or colluvium parent materials were described.

40|$|Partially {{saturated}} {{soils are}} often dense {{with a high}} bearing capacity and will subsequently only suffer small amounts of compression under normal foundation loads. However, when wetted under load many such soils undergo a marked and sudden increase in settlement, the phenomenon that is known as collapse settlement. It was originally assumed that the collapse phenomenon is largely restricted to loose aeolian deposits, {{with the result that}} most of the research and work dealt almost exclusively with such deposits. However, the collapse phenomenon has since been identified {{in a number of different}} transported soils as well as <b>residual</b> <b>soils,</b> most notably the <b>residual</b> granitic <b>soils</b> associated with the Basement Complex of South Africa.

50|$|Although a {{solution}} for overpopulated tropical countries where subsistence agriculture may be the traditional method of sustaining many families, the consequences of slash-and-burn techniques for ecosystems are almost always destructive. This happens particularly as population densities increase, {{and as a result}} farming becomes more intensively practiced. This is because as demand for more land increases, the fallow period by necessity declines. The principal vulnerability is the nutrient-poor soil, pervasive in most tropical forests. When biomass is extracted even for one harvest of wood or charcoal, the <b>residual</b> <b>soil</b> value is heavily diminished for further growth of any type of vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Surveys of {{the seabed}} under the planned route were {{conducted}} before the bridge design commenced. The marine geology underneath the bridge consists of basalts, volcanic tuffs and breccias with some intertrappean deposits.

The weathered rock beds are further overlain by transported soil, calcareous sandstone and thin bed of coarse grained conglomerate.

40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>soils</b> show a {{specific}} mechanical behaviour classified as on-conventional {{when compared with}} sedimentary transported soils, since {{the presence of a}} cemented matrix plays an important role on their strength and stiffness. Moreover, suction is frequent in natural profiles, which in <b>residual</b> <b>soils</b> creates several problems on the interpretation of in-situ test results. These two factors, cementation and suction, are contributing simultaneously as structuring factors. Correlations to deduce strength parameters in Portuguese granitic <b>residual</b> <b>soils</b> by Marchetti Dilatometer were previously establishedunder a data base obtained in careful triaxial testing programs executed on ¿undisturbed¿ samples. However, the reference results were affected by sampling disturbance and space variability, and therefore somehow deviated from in-situ conditions. To solve these problems, a large calibration box was constructed to work with artificially cemented soils where DMT blades could be pre-installed and pushed-in. Water level, suction and seismic velocities were monitored during the experiment and a triaxial program was established in parallel on the same artificially cemented mixtures. As a result specific correlations to derive the cohesion intercept value and the angle of shearing resistance in saturated and unsaturated conditions were developed and subsequently tested in a well characterized experimental site. Herein, the results of that experimental framework are presented and discussed...|$|R

50|$|Saprolite is a {{particular}} example of a <b>residual</b> <b>soil</b> formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic {{and other types of}} bedrock into clay minerals. Often called granite, saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: hydrolysis, chelation from organic compounds, hydration (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include freezing and thawing. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary bedrock material, its physical features, including grain size and degree of consolidation, and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called arenization, resulting in the formation of sandy soils (granitic arenas), thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite (micas, amphiboles, feldspars).|$|E

50|$|Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi, {{previously}} Phaseolus calcaratus, is a warm-season annual vine legume {{with yellow}} flowers and small edible beans. It is commonly called ricebean or rice bean. To date, {{it is little}} known, little researched and little exploited. It {{is regarded as a}} minor food and fodder crop and is often grown as intercrop or mixed crop with maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or cowpea (V. unguiculata), as well as a sole crop in the uplands, on a very limited area. Like the other Asiatic Vigna species, ricebean is a fairly short-lived warm-season annual. Grown mainly as a dried pulse, it is also important as a fodder, a green manure and a vegetable. Ricebean is most widely grown as an intercrop, particularly of maize, throughout Indo-China and extending into southern China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the past it was widely grown as lowland crop on <b>residual</b> <b>soil</b> water after the harvest of long-season rice, but it has been displaced to a great extent where shorter duration rice varieties are grown. Ricebean grows well on a range of soils. It establishes rapidly and has the potential to produce large amounts of nutritious animal fodder and high quality grain.|$|E

The changes to the pore pressure regime with the progression of the rainfall and consequent reduction of the safety margin of the slope was modeled with SEEP/W and SLOPE/W software. Both the deterministic approach and the probabilistic approach were used in the evaluation of stability. With the continued rainfall, matric suctions depleted, perched water table developed and the safety margins reduced. The presence of a moderately weathered rock layer at a shallow depth was found to be more critical...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} more recent {{findings}} {{in the interpretation of}} different in-situ tests, such as SPT, CPT, PMT, SBPT, DMT and PLT to obtain geotechnical parameters of significant use in engineering practice. It concerns mainly shearing resistance properties and stiffness properties with special emphasis on the importance of stress and strain dependency. In this context some practical rules are presented for using parameters at two levels of design: routine and advanced levels. These practical rules concern transported soils (unaged and uncemented) are compared with those established in this paper for <b>residual</b> saprolitic <b>soils</b> from granite from different regions of Portugal. lt was noticed that the bonded structure and fabric of <b>residual</b> saprolitic <b>soils</b> from granite have a significant influence on their geomechanical behaviour. Consequently, the structural peculiarities of these <b>residual</b> <b>soils</b> influence the pattern of their non-linear constitutive behaviour. Deformability modulus derived from robust but relatively crude tests, such as SPT, CPT, DPT or even PMT, are compared with reference values taken from seismic survey (CH) and load tests, such as PLT. They can be situated on stress-strain levels defined from laboratory triaxial tests over high quality undisturbed samples. Several parametric correlations were established, which agree well with other correlations proposed for <b>residual</b> <b>soils</b> of the same nature. Significant differences are apparent between those correlations and the ones established for transported soils with identical grading curves, which may be explained by the weak bonded structure, inherited from the parent rock...|$|R
