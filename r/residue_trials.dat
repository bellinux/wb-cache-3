40|$|Pesticide residue {{assessments}} are conducted to establish legal limits, called Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). MRLs {{are derived from}} the results of these pesticide <b>residue</b> <b>trials,</b> which are performed according to critical Good Agricultural Practice. Only one residue value per residue trial may be selected for the MRL derivation. Here, a proposal is described for the selection and presentation of residue values in advisory reports, drafted in the Netherlands either by order of the Dutch Board for the Authorisation of Pesticides or the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. In these advisory reports, residue values from each submitted residue trial are presented in a table. Independent and replicate <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> are distinguished. <b>Residue</b> <b>trials</b> conducted at the same location and same point in time with the same equipment are considered as one residue trial with several replicates (when the area of application, formulation, dose rate, number of applications and crop variety are the same). For a residue trial consisting of replicate trials, all individual residue values are presented, but only the maximum residue value is selected. Furthermore, one or more field samples can be taken per residue trial and each field sample can be subdivided into one or more laboratory samples, which in turn can be subdivided into one or more analytical portions. For a residue trial consisting of repeated field samples, all individual residue values are presented, but only the mean residue value is selected. Finally, for a residue trial consisting of repeated laboratory samples or repeated analytical portions, only the mean residue values are presented and selected...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Portugal, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from the company Agriphar to lower the existing MRL for dodine in apricots to reflect a less critical European use. The applicant also submitted additional <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> on apples and a new freezer storage stability study in high oil content matrices to confirm the MRLs derived for pome fruit and olives in the previously issued EFSA reasoned opinion. The lowering of the MRL for apricots is justified as for the existing MRL acute consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded. According to EFSA, the submitted data are sufficient to confirm the MRL proposal of 0. 9 mg/kg for pome fruits as derived in the previous EFSA reasoned opinion. The MRL proposal of 0. 09 mg/kg for apricots has been derived, in {{accordance with}} the provisions of the EU guidance document on extrapolation from <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> on peaches and apples. Although the data are compliant with the data requirements, EFSA recommends performing additional trials on apricots to confirm that the MRL is sufficient to cover the use on apricots. The new freezer storage stability study submitted for dodine in high oil content matrices confirms the validity of the <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> on olives. Thus, the data gap identified in the previous opinion with regard to the MRL for olives (20 mg/kg) is sufficiently addressed. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the new intended less critical uses on pome fruit and apricots which result in lower MRL proposals compared to the existing MRLs, will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore are unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance thiacloprid in spinach and similar leaves crop group. In order to accommodate the intended indoor and outdoor uses of thiacloprid in Belgium, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiacloprid in spinach and similar leaves group or only in spinach and beet leaves to 0. 15 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> data on lettuce are not sufficient to support the residue data extrapolation to the whole group of spinach and similar leaves. Alternatively, the EMS proposed to extrapolate four outdoor <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> data on open leaf lettuce to spinach and beet leaves only. Although this extrapolation is not explicitly mentioned in the European guidance document, EFSA is of the opinion that the proposal is acceptable, considering the morphological similarities between spinach/beet leaves and open leave varieties of lettuce and taking into account that spinach and beet leaves are minor crops. Thus, a MRL proposal of 0. 15 mg/kg is derived. Based on the risk assessment results EFSA concludes that the intended use of thiacloprid on spinach and beet leaves will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E

In order to accommodate for the intended indoor use of 8 -hydroxyquinoline, Spain proposed to raise the existing MRL in tomatoes to 0. 1 mg/kg. Spain drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 1 mg/kg for 8 -hydroxyquinoline in tomatoes which reflects the analytical LOQ of the method used to analyse <b>residue</b> <b>trial</b> samples.

Wettable powder (WP) formulation containing 25 % thiram was applied at 2320 [*]g active gradient hm− 2 (a. i. [*]hm− 2) dosage for the dissipation study. The decline rate in potato leave and soil followed first-order kinetics equation, and the half-life ranged from 2. 8 to 5. 4 days and 2. 6 to 9. 9 days, respectively. In terminal residue, the thiram was sprayed at 580 [*]g[*]a. i. [*]hm− 2 (low concentration, recommended dosage) and 1160 [*]g[*]a. i. [*]hm− 2 (high concentration, double of recommended dosage). The residues of thiram in potato and soil samples collected in the field at preharvest interval of 21 days and 30 days were all below 0. 02 [*]mg[*]kg− 1.

40|$|Background The wide use of {{pesticides}} raises concerns on the health risks associated with pesticide exposure. For developing countries, like Thailand, pesticide monitoring program (in vegetables and fruits) and also the maximum residue limits (MRL) regulation have not been entirely implemented. The MRL is a product limit, not a safety limit. The MRL is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue (expressed as mg/kg) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted in or on food commodities and animal feeds (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2015; European Commission, 2015). MRLs are based on supervised <b>residue</b> <b>trial</b> data where the pesticide has been applied in accordance with GAP (Good Agricultural Practice). This study aims at providing comparison data on pesticide residues found in three commonly consumed vegetables (Chinese kale, pakchoi and morning glory) purchased from some local markets and supermarkets in Thailand. Methods These vegetables were randomly bought from local markets and supermarkets. Then they were analyzed for the content of 28 pesticides by using GC-MS/MS. Results Types {{of pesticides}} detected in the samples either from local markets or supermarkets were similar. The incidence of detected pesticides was 100 % (local markets) and 99 % (supermarkets) for the Chinese kale; 98 % (local markets) and 100 % (supermarkets) for the pakchoi; and 99 % (local markets) and 97 % (supermarkets) for the morning glory samples. The pesticides were detected exceeding their MRL {{at a rate of}} 48 % (local markets) and 35 % (supermarkets) for the Chinese kale; 71 % (local markets) and 55 % (supermarkets) for the pakchoi, and 42 % (local markets) and 49 % (supermarkets) for the morning glory. Discussion These rates are much higher than those seen in developed countries. It should be noted that these findings were assessed on basis of using criteria (such as MRL) obtained from developed countries. Our findings were also confined to these vegetables sold in a few central provinces of Thailand and did not reflect for the whole country as sample sizes were small. Risk assessment due to consuming these pesticide contaminated vegetables, still remains to be evaluated. However, remarkably high incidence rates of detected pesticides give warning to the Thai authorities to implement proper regulations on pesticide monitoring program. Similar incidence of pesticide contamination found in the vegetables bought from local markets and supermarkets raises question regarding the quality of organic vegetables domestically sold in Thailand. This conclusion excludes Thai export quality vegetables and fruits routinely monitored for pesticide contamination before exporting...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Spain, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State Spain, received an application from Syngenta Agro S. A. to raise the existing MRL for lambda-cyhalothrin in persimmon from the LOQ (0. 02 mg/kg) to 0. 1 mg/kg in support of a new intended SEU use. Belgium (hereafter the EMS Belgium) compiled an application to raise the existing MRL for lambda-cyhalothrin in azarole from the LOQ to 0. 2 mg/kg based on a new intended NEU use on kiwi berries (Actinidia arguta). The EMS Spain and the EMS Belgium drafted evaluation reports according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which were submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted supervised <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 09 mg/kg for persimmon. The MRL proposal of 0. 2 mg/kg for azarole (including kiwi berries) is derived as an extrapolation from the available residue data on black currant. According to the EMS Belgium, the intended spray concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin on kiwi berries is identical to that in the black currant <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> and thus these trials were considered appropriate to estimate residue levels in azarole (including kiwi berries). Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of lambda-cyhalothrin on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Syngenta Agro S. A. S. to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance cyproconazole in mustard seed and gold of pleasure. In order to accommodate for the intended use of cyproconazole in France, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs in these crops to 0. 4 mg/kg. France drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the proposed extrapolation of residue data from rape seed to mustard seed and gold of pleasure is acceptable and a sufficient number of <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> has been submitted to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 4 mg/kg in the crops under consideration. The submitted <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> data support the NEU use only. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of cyproconazole on mustard seed and gold of pleasure will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. EFSA emphasizes that the above assessment does not take into consideration triazole derivative metabolites (TDMs). Since these metabolites may be generated by several pesticides belonging to the group of triazole fungicides, EFSA recommends that a separate risk assessment is performed for TDMs as soon as the confirmatory data requested for triazole compounds in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 have been evaluated and a general methodology on the risk assessment of triazole compounds and their triazole derivative metabolites is available...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of food safety is the control of pesticide residues on food. Pesticide residue assessments are conducted to establish legal limits, known as maximum residue limits (MRLs), for pesticide residues in plant and animal commodities. In the EC guidelines for pesticide residue assessment, the so-called Lundehn document, agricultural crops are classified into groups in which results {{are considered to be}} comparable. Within these groups, the results for one crop may be extrapolated, either to another group or to the crop group as a whole. Because only examples of crops are given per assessment item in the Lundehn document, there is a probability that crops not mentioned in this document will be classified differently by different users of the classification. The classification documented here, however, contains an extended classification for agricultural crops grown in or imported into European Union countries that are either intended for human consumption or for livestock feed. Each crop is classified under relevant items of the pesticide residue assessment process. These are: plant metabolism, crop sampling, supervised <b>residue</b> <b>trials,</b> livestock feed, storage stability of analytical samples, validation of analytical methods and rotational crops...|$|E
40|$|Consumer risk {{assessment}} {{is a crucial}} step in the regulatory approval of pesticide use on food crops. Recently, an additional hurdle {{has been added to}} the formal consumer {{risk assessment}} process with the introduction of short-term intake or exposure assessment and a comparable short-term toxicity reference, the acute reference dose. Exposure to residues during one meal or over one day is important for short-term or acute intake. Exposure in the short term can be substantially higher than average because the consumption of a food on a single occasion can be very large compared with typical long-term or mean consumption and the food may have a much larger residue than average. Furthermore, the residue level in a single unit of a fruit or vegetable may be higher by a factor (defined as the variability factor, which we have shown to be typically × 3 for the 97. 5 th percentile unit) than the average residue in the lot. Available marketplace data and supervised <b>residue</b> <b>trial</b> data are examined in an investigation of the variability of residues in units of fruit and vegetables. A method is described for estimating the 97. 5 th percentile value from sets of unit residue data. Variability appears to be generally independent of the pesticide, the crop, crop unit size and the residue level. The deposition of pesticide on the individual unit during application is probably the most significant factor. The diets used in the calculations ideally come from individual and household surveys with enough consumers of each specific food to determine large portion sizes. The diets should distinguish the different forms of a food consumed, eg canned, frozen or fresh, because the residue levels associated with the different forms may be quite different. Dietary intakes may be calculated by a deterministic method or a probabilistic method. In the deterministic method the intake is estimated with the assumptions of large portion consumption of a ‘high residue’ food (high residue {{in the sense that the}} pesticide was used at the highest recommended label rate, the crop was harvested at the smallest interval after treatment and the residue in the edible portion was the highest found in any of the supervised trials in line with these use conditions). The deterministic calculation also includes a variability factor for those foods consumed as units (eg apples, carrots) to allow for the elevated residue in some single units which may not be seen in composited samples. In the probabilistic method the distribution of dietary consumption and the distribution of possible residues are combined in repeated probabilistic calculations to yield a distribution of possible residue intakes. Additional information such as percentage commodity treated and combination of residues from multiple commodities may be incorporated into probabilistic calculations. The IUPAC Advisory Committee on Crop Protection Chemistry has made 11 recommendations relating to acute dietary exposure...|$|R

40|$|Crop {{growth and}} yield {{are the result}} of the {{efficiency}} of the chosen agricultural management system within the boundaries of the agro-ecological environment. Linking spatial variability in crop performance to differences in soil attributes could identify the limiting factors driving the system, since patterns of crop performance will follow the spatial variability of the underlying limiting soil attributes. The Greenseeker handheld NDVI sensor was used to determine the within-plot spatial variability of crop performance in the different management treatments of a long-term (started 1991) tillage and <b>residue</b> management <b>trial.</b> Soil quality was measured spatially in the same plots. Under zero tillage with residue removal, soil quality and crop performance followed micro-topography with higher values where elevation was lower. Under zero tillage with residue retention soil quality was high throughout the field, ensuring uniform crop growth and under conventional tillage, soil quality was intermediate. Crop performance followed the same pattern as soil moisture and the related attributes infiltration, soil structure and organic matter. Thus soil moisture is the main limiting factor of the system and it is essential for the sustainability of any management practice developed for the subtropical highlands that soil water capture and storage are optimal. Zero tillage with residue retention is therefore the practice that will result in the most sustainable management and the most stable yields for this target area. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{focus of}} Schick et al.’s 2017 [1] paper is field trials {{initiated}} over 10  years ago (2005 – 2008) by Syngenta {{in collaboration with}} Eurofins Contract Research Organisation.

The samples were extracted with acetonitrile, partitioned by n-hexane, purified using Florisil column, and de-termined by HPLC {{equipped with a}} variable wavelength detector(VWD). The results showed that when the spiked levels were 0. 05 mg·kg- 1 to 2. 5 mg·kg- 1, the average recovery of sulfoxaflor ranged from 76. 81 %to 94. 43 %with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0. 54 %to 7. 20 %;the limit of detection(LOD) of sulfoxaflor was 1 ng, and the limit of quantification(LOQ) was 0. 05 mg·kg- 1 in soil, cotton seeds and cotton leaves.

Tricyclazole is a non-included active substance and no EU uses are currently authorized. Thus, the existing EU MRL of 1 mg/kg in rice should be lowered to the LOQ. The applicant requested to maintain the existing EU MRL to allow the import of rice treated with tricyclazole from third countries. The EMS confirmed that the MRL should be set provisionally at the level 1 mg/kg to accommodate the Brazilian GAP. EFSA is of the opinion that {{on the basis of the}} currently available studies, the toxicological reference values for tricyclazole cannot be set, since the genotoxic potential of tricyclazole could not be totally disregarded. In addition, uncertainties regarding the carcinogenic potential of tricyclazole were identified by EFSA.

Removal of ethanol and drying of the left - over <b>residue.</b> Feeding <b>trial</b> was conducted in white albino rats before and after reconstitution of apple pomace feed in the choice and no choice study. Feeding of apple pomace feed in the rats before reconstitution indicated that neither in fermented nor in unfermented form it was acceptable. In the no choice study both in 100 % fermented and unfermented apple pomace group feed intake decreased continuously resulting in death of rats apparently due to decreased digestibility owing to high fibre content. Further, fermented or unfermented apple pomace based feed had lower digestibility and efficiency of conversion than the standard rat feed. Compared to the standard feed group, growth rates in all the feed groups were negative. The results of choice study of different feeds corroborated with the no-choice study mentioned earlier. Incorporation of fermented apple pomace into standard rat feed in the ratio of 1 : 1 gave better acceptability and digestibility. Reconstituted feed with 10 % jaggery, 2 % groundnut oil, 0. 01 % mixed flavour and 1 % salt was the most acceptable. The post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial revealed generalized oedema, probably due to some hepatotoxin in the feed. The blood glucose level in the apple pomace feed group except that was reconstituted with jaggery, showed a general hypoglycemia, though falling in the range. The increased ALT and AST levels in the serum also suggest damage to the liver. The mortality rate, post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial and blood biochemical analysis of rat serum suggest a more elaborative study for extended period of time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Results from an {{international}} stationary field trial (ISDV) have been analyzed for effects of increasing nitrogen doses on yield of corn. Effects of increasing nitrogen doses and harvest residues on corn yield were assessed in a three-crop rotation of corn, soybean and wheat. The trial had nine variants, six with and three without plowing under of harvest <b>residues.</b> The <b>trial</b> {{had been established}} on a calcareous chernozem soil, at Rimski Šančevi experiment field of Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad. This paper reviews 3 -year average yields (one rotations) of two currently tested corn hybrids, NS 510 and NS 6010. The average yield of grain obtained in the variants with plowed under harvest residues was 9. 80 t ha- 1. It was higher by 3. 28 t ha- 1 than the average yield obtained in the fertilized variants that received no harvest residues. On average for both analyzed hybrids, the highest average yield (11. 67 t ha- 1) was achieved in the fertilization variant with 150 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen combined with plowing under of harvest residues. The hybrid NS 6010 had a statistically highly significant yield {{in relation to the}} other hybrid, NS 510. In the case of individual hybrids and their average, in variants both with and without plowed under harvest residues, the increase of grain yield in response to the increasing nitrogen doses created a quadratic regression curve. On average for the two hybrids, plowed under harvest residues increased the yield of corn grain in the control variant by 2780 kg ha- 1. In the comparable variants, the effect of long-term plowing under of harvest residues on grain yield of corn ranged from only 2450 kg of grain (in the case of the hybrid NS 510 in the variant with 90 kg N ha- 1) to a amount of 4180 kg ha- 1 (in the case of the hybrid NS 510 fertilized with 150 kg N ha- 1).

40|$|AbstractGlyphosate is a {{herbicide}} used {{to control}} broad-leaved weeds. Some uses of glyphosate in crop production can lead to residues of the active substance and related metabolites in food. This paper uses data on residue levels, processing information and consumption patterns, to assess theoretical lifetime dietary exposure to glyphosate. Initial estimates were made assuming exposure to the highest permitted residue levels in foods. These intakes were then refined using median <b>residue</b> levels from <b>trials,</b> processing information, and monitoring data to achieve a more realistic estimate of exposure. Estimates were made using deterministic and probabilistic methods. Exposures were compared to the acceptable daily intake (ADI) —the amount of a substance that can be consumed daily without an appreciable health risk. Refined deterministic intakes for all consumers were at or below 2. 1 % of the ADI. Variations were due to cultural differences in consumption patterns {{and the level of}} aggregation of the dietary information in calculation models, which allows refinements for processing. Probabilistic exposure estimates ranged from 0. 03 % to 0. 90 % of the ADI, depending on whether optimistic or pessimistic assumptions were made in the calculations.

The lowering of the MRLs for the crops mentioned is justified as for the existing MRLs for apples, pears, peaches and apricots acute consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{illustrate}} {{the use of}} two different methodologies to investigate the presence of pesticide metabolites in parent pesticide-positive food samples, using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (UHPLC–QTOF) mass spectrometry. First, a common fragmentation pathway between the parent pesticide and its metabolites has been considered to search for metabolites in two positive market samples (imazalil in lemon, chlorpyrifos in grape). Secondly, olive oil samples from field <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> were used for automated application of comparative software (MetaboLynx), which was used with treated and untreated samples to search for expected and unexpected metabolites of phosmet. One of the main objectives when using these approaches was to avoid the tedious manual searching for potential metabolites within the huge amount of information contained in the total ion chromatogram acquired by TOF MS. The common fragmentation approach applied to TOF MS full-acquisition data, considering an enhanced fragmentation in the collision cell, has allowed the discovery of two metabolites of imazalil (1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 2 -hydroxyethyl]- 1 H-imidazole and 1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 2 -oxoethyl]- 1 H-imidazole) in a lemon positive sample, as well as another two metabolites of chlorpyrifos (chlorpyrifos-oxon and 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol) in a grape positive sample. Moreover, MetaboLynx application to TOF MS data, without promoting fragmentation, from treated and untreated olive oil samples has been helpful in detecting the metabolite phosmet-oxon. In both strategies, every metabolite detected by TOF MS was confirmed using QTOF and/or triple quadrupole instruments. Accurate masses given by TOF MS together with the valuable information on product ions given by QTOF MS/MS experiments were crucial for the unambiguous identification of metabolites...|$|E

According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive the following MRL proposals: 0. 6 mg/kg in strawberries, 0. 4 mg/kg in tomatoes and cultivated fungi, 2 mg/kg in peppers, 0. 15 mg/kg in cucurbits with edible peel and 0. 1 mg/kg in cucurbits with inedible peel. The intended use on aubergines is not supported by GAP compliant <b>residue</b> <b>trials.</b> EFSA derived a MRL proposal of 0. 3 mg/kg from the overdosed trials on tomatoes by applying the proportionality approach. Risk managers should decide whether this tentative MRL proposal is acceptable since the use of the down-scaling of overdosed trials is not common practice in the EU. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of metrafenone in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of metrafenone on strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, aubergines, cucurbits and cultivated fungi will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

40|$|It is {{essential}} to have {{an indication of the}} sustainability of an agricultural system in addition to the potential, immediate benefits well before the catastrophic consequences of non-sustainability become apparent. Long-term experiments are best suited to test sustainability of a given system. This paper has a dual objective: (1) evaluate the Greenseeker handheld NDVI sensor as a tool for measuring within plot spatial variability, (2) address the question whether different management practices affect spatial within-plot crop growth variability and what this spatial variability tells us about the cropping system performance. Therefore, spatial and time variability of crop performance were measured during the 2004 and 2005 crop cycle for all plots of the different management treatments of a long-term (started 1991) tillage and <b>residue</b> management <b>trial.</b> The NDVI readings measured with the handheld sensor correlated well with the visual scoring in the field. The hand-held sensor is time-efficient and gave reproducible results. The potential for using this tool to detect spatial crop variability, both within and between plots/treatments, is promising. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the NDVI measurement sequence in each plot was determined. The CV's throughout the crop season reflected the canopy expansion and senescence curve of maize and wheat. The CV was high {{at the beginning of the}} crop season, however, once the canopy began to close, leaves from larger plants covered the leaves and whorl of smaller plants, extending further into the linear row. Measurements to investigate spatial variability related to crop performance should thus be done after this initial stage at the end of the vegetative period when the vegetative biomass of the crops is fully established. Zero tillage systems without surface residue retention produced high CVs of the NDVI sequence and high spatial crop variability throughout the season, even after the vegetative period. As the only factors differing between the different plots are the tillage/residue/rotation practices and as similar patterns were found for all plots representing repetitions of the same management practice (zero tillage without residue retention), increased variability is an indicator of agronomic mismanagement or, conversely, of sound agriculturally production practices. status: publishe...|$|R

In order to accommodate the intended use of fludioxonil, France proposed to raise the existing MRLs from 0. 05 * and 1. 0 mg/kg {{at the time of the}} application, to 1. 5 and 3 mg/kg respectively. In addition, The Netherlands herewith {{referred to as the}} evaluating Member State, The Netherlands (EMS-NL), received an application from LTO Groeiservice to modify the existing MRL in radishes. In order to accommodate the intended use of fludioxonil in the Netherlands, EMS-NL proposed to raise the existing MRL from the limit of quantification of 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 08 mg/kg. France and The Netherlands drafted evaluation reports in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which were submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 1. 5 mg/kg on celery (stem).

Spain drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. The submitted <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> lead to MRL proposals of 0. 3 mg/kg for rapeseed and 0. 4 mg/kg for sunflower. These proposals are already covered by the existing EU MRL of 0. 5 mg/kg for rapeseed and by the proposals of 0. 7 mg/kg made by EFSA for sunflower in an application related to the ester variant quizalofop-P-tefuryl. EFSA is therefore of the opinion that the uses of quizalofop-P-ethyl on oilseed rape and sunflower do not necessitate any change to the existing EU MRLs or to the proposals done in a previous MRL application. The extrapolations to cotton and soybean are not recommended, since not in line with the rules defined in the current EU guideline. An enforcement method referenced AN 34 validated to control quizalofop-P-ethyl residues in oily matrices has been submitted. This method is however an outdated method using techniques no longer in use in laboratories for routine analyses. Considering that a LC-MS/MS method corresponding to the current analytical standards has been developed to analyse the samples from the trials performed from 2007, EFSA is of the opinion that validation data, including an ILV, have to be requested for such an analytical method.

40|$|Anticoagulant {{rodenticide}} (AR) {{resistance in}} Norway rat populations {{has been a}} problem for fifty years, however its impact on non-target species, particularly predatory and scavenging animals has received little attention. Field trials were conducted on farms in Germany and England where resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides had been confirmed. Resistance is conferred by different mutations of the VKORC 1 gene in each of these regions: tyrosine 139 cysteine in Germany and leucine 120 glutamine in England. A modelling approach was used to study the transference of the anticoagulants into the environment during treatments for Norway rat control. Baiting with brodifacoum resulted in lower levels of AR entering the food chain via the rats and lower numbers of live rats carrying residues during and after the trials due to its lower application rate and efficacy against resistant rats. Bromadiolone and difenacoum resulted in markedly higher levels of AR uptake into the rat population and larger numbers of live rats carrying <b>residues</b> during the <b>trials</b> and for long periods after the baiting period. Neither bromadiolone nor difenacoum provided full control on any of the treated farms. In resistant areas where ineffective compounds are used there is the potential for higher levels of AR exposure to non-target animals, particularly predators of rats and scavengers of rat carcasses. Thus, resistance influences the total amount of AR available to non-targets and should be considered when dealing with rat infestations, as resistance-breakers may present a lower risk to wildlife...|$|R

Liquid ethyl formate was applied as a split dose (a first dose of 85 g t - 1 and after 4 h another dose of 85 g t - 1) {{to the top of}} the grain through a PVC probe (4 cm i. d. × 1. 2 m). This method of application was chosen to maintain ethyl formate concentrations below the flammability level, reduce vaporisation, maintain an effective concentration of ethyl formate for > 10 h and to avoid liquid ethyl formate accumulating at the bottom of the bin. With wheat, the concentration of ethyl formate was maintained at effective levels for about 2 days, all insects at all stages were killed rapidly, and in 5 - 7 days the residues were reduced to natural levels without aeration. Split faba beans sorbed ethyl formate strongly, the residues persisted longer and complete insect control was achieved.

40|$|Factors {{thought to}} improve gain of cattle grazing corn and grain sorghum {{residues}} are improvement of residue quality and quantity. Nine grazing trials conducted in 1987 and 1988 fall-winter seasons evaluated these factors. ^ To improve forage quality, two corn hybrids {{were chosen for}} high and low in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) of leaves and husks, planted in irrigated and non-irrigated fields, grazed for two trials and compared. Selection for higher quality residue did not improve cattle gains (P 3 ̆c. 01 and P 3 ̆c. 10). Grazing calves selected the highest quality fractions of residue, particularly residual grain and husks. ^ Animals grazing residue of three corn hybrids at low and high stocking rates, gained more (P 3 ̆c. 01) at the low rate. Fields stocked at low rates had more (P 3 ̆c. 01) total available OM and digestible OM for all hybrids. Stocking rate and hybrid interacted (P =. 15) because forage quality was expressed at high stocking rate and not low. Quality or quantity of corn residue alone do not predict animal gain. ^ Quality of grain sorghum residue increased in one trial (P 3 ̆c. 01) by selection of high IVDMD hybrid compared to low, {{but not in a}} second. Animal gain was not improved by high IVDMD <b>residue</b> in either <b>trial.</b> ^ Calves grazing corn residue gained more (P 3 ̆c. 01) than calves grazing sorghum residue. Selective grazing of residual corn grain and husk by calves was thought to be the determinant for improved gain. ^ In winters with little snowfall, calves grazing corn residue performed better than calves grazing residue of a corn and grain sorghum combination. In a winter with heavier snowfall, incorporation of sorghum residue into a grazing system gave animal gains equal to corn residue. ^ Selectivity of grazing animals and the environment seem to be major factors in determining gain of calves grazing crop residues. ...|$|R

3000|$|In {{response}} to the increasing call for industry to be more transparent, Syngenta took the decision to publish the pivotal honeybee field studies that supported the honey bee safety of thiamethoxam. These field studies included 12 separate pollen and nectar field <b>residue</b> <b>trials</b> and five long-term (4 consecutive years) field effects studies on honeybees carried out in four geographically widespread locations in France. The primary purpose of these field trials was to investigate and test the bee safety of thiamethoxam. As such these studies have to be carefully designed to avoid as far as is possible any other potential confounding factors, e.g. exposure to other insecticides. In {{response to}} the criticism of Hoppe et al. (2105) that the “design and adherence to the protocol was described inadequately” {{and that it was}} “doubtful whether the study was implemented in a traceable way”, {{it should be noted that}} these studies also have to comply with the strict, legally enforceable, quality control requirements of Good Laboratory Practice (OECD [1]) and comply with relevant international guidelines, e.g. in this case EPPO 170, 2010 [2]. One of the challenges faced during the drafting of the publication of these field trials was how to summarise in a concise publication manuscript the extensive methodology information from effectively 13 separate field trials as well as the vast amount of data that were generated. Initially two separate papers were drafted to summarise the data on residues in pollen and nectar and the other on effects on honeybee colonies. However, PLOS One insisted that they be combined into a single manuscript. In the end, the final Pilling et al.’s [3] paper was 13 pages long with a substantial supplementary information section. Whilst many of the criticisms made by Hoppe et al. [4] can be addressed by a more thorough reading of the original Pilling et al.’s [3] paper, the other criticisms, particularly of the methodology used, are fully addressed in the original study reports for these field studies which were submitted to EFSA and other Regulatory Authorities. One of the comments made by this EFSA evaluation (EFSA 2013, [5]) of these field studies was “The study was well performed and was to GLP.

Removal of ethanol and drying of the left - over <b>residue.</b> Feeding <b>trial</b> was conducted in white albino rats before and after reconstitution of apple pomace feed in the choice and no choice study. Feeding of apple pomace feed in the rats before reconstitution indicated that neither in fermented nor in unfermented form it was acceptable. In the no choice study both in 100 % fermented and unfermented apple pomace group feed intake decreased continuously resulting in death of rats apparently due to decreased digestibility owing to high fibre content. Further, fermented or unfermented apple pomace based feed had lower digestibility and efficiency of conversion than the standard rat feed. Compared to the standard feed group, growth rates in all the feed groups were negative. The results of choice study of different feeds corroborated with the no-choice study mentioned earlier. Incorporation of fermented apple pomace into standard rat feed in the ratio of 1 : 1 gave better acceptability and digestibility. Reconstituted feed with 10 % jaggery, 2 % groundnut oil, 0. 01 % mixed flavour and 1 % salt was the most acceptable. The post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial revealed generalized oedema, probably due to some hepatotoxin in the feed. The blood glucose level in the apple pomace feed group except that was reconstituted with jaggery, showed a general hypoglycemia, though falling in the range. The increased ALT and AST levels in the serum also suggest damage to the liver. The mortality rate, post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial and blood biochemical analysis of rat serum suggest a more elaborative study for extended period of time. Para utilizar bagaço de maçã de uma maneira econômica e eficaz, foi desenvolvido um processo por fermentação no estado sólido (SSF) que utiliza uma co-cultura interativa seqüencial de Cândida utilis e Kloechera. Remoção do etanol foi realizado através da secagem do bagaço de maçã. Os testes com o bagaço de maçã fermentado ou não foram feitos em ratos brancos em um experimento delineado. Os resultados mostraram que o bagaço de maçã fermentado ou não se mostraram aceitáveis sendo que os mesmos apresentaram uma digestibilidade inferior a ração comum. Quando o estudo alimentando os ratos utilizando 100 % de bagaço de maçã fermentado e não fermentado e alterando a concentração progressivamente, observou-se a morte dos ratos aparentemente devido a uma redução da digestibilidade em razão da alta concentração em fibras. Em comparação com o grupo padrão, as taxas de crescimento foram negativas em todos os grupos estudados. A mistura da ração padrão com o bagaço de maçã fermentado na proporção 1 : 1, proporcionou maior aceitabilidade e digestibilidade.

Four trials {{were conducted to}} investigate the use of Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) as a fast and non-destructive method for evaluating shell quality and measuring the components of broiler breeder eggs. In Trial 1, 180 eggs were scanned with a GE Lunar Prodigy DXA. The eggs were also evaluated by traditional methods that required breaking the eggs for shell quality evaluation and egg components (shell, albumen and yolk) weighed. Values obtained from the DXA scans were subjected to stepwise regression analysis to develop prediction equations. Prediction equations were developed for the weight of egg components (egg, yolk, albumen and shell) and parameters of shell quality (shell weight, thickness and calcium content). In Trial 1, the r 2 values for the prediction equations using DXA values were 0. 9961, 0. 9692, 0. 9843, 0. 6891, 0. 8499 and 0. 5738 for the total egg weight, shell weight, shell calcium content, shell thickness, albumen weight and yolk weight, respectively (P>F, F, < 0. 0001). In Trial 3, 250 hatching eggs were scanned to determine the affect of scanning on hatchability. DXA scanning had no negative effect on hatchability, hatch chick weight or hatch <b>residue</b> breakout. In <b>Trial</b> 4, the specific gravity of 400 hatching eggs was determined by flotation in salt solutions. The eggs were then scanned with the DXA and values obtained from these scans were used to calculate SWUSA and shell:egg weight ratios. The SWUSA and shell:egg weight ratios determined by DXA scan were useful in predicting eggshell quality and correlated closely with actual specific gravity values (r = 0. 7849, p< 0. 0001). A SWUSA of 75. 1 and specific gravity of 1. 081 corresponded to a shell:egg weight ratio of 0. 0895 and 0. 0924, respectively.
