He gave his running horses out during hunts. <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> had four wives; two put up Sun Dances.

50|$|Due to his {{intelligence}} and kindness, <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> was often looked upon {{to settle disputes}} within the band and nation. One incident happened during the early 1870s along the Oldman River where {{a man from the}} biters band accidentally killed one of Crowfoot's daughters with a loaded gun. The man hid from Crowfoot who sought to kill him in retaliation in <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit's</b> teepee. <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> stressed to Crowfoot that the killing was an accident and gave Crowfoot some horses as added compensation. Though usually peaceful in settling disputes <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> resorted to violence when the well being of his family was threatened, a noted incident involved <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> shooting a fellow Indian for beating his blind brother with a whip.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> {{was born}} into a {{prominent}} family. His older brother Many Swans, who took their father's name, was chief of Biters band of Siksikas to which they belonged. As a teenager and young warrior, <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> had not performed any great deeds worthy of recognition until his brother lent him an amulet said to have spiritual powers made from a mirror decorated with eagle feathers, ermine skins, and magpie feathers. <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> was successful during his first ever raid as a warrior, gaining himself two enemy horses which he captured and gifted to Many Swans. Similar success during following expeditions resulted in Many Swans giving <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> the amulet as a gift. Word of <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit's</b> success spread throughout the Biters band and many referred to him as the [...] "young chief" [...] before he earned or was appointed any leadership position in the band.|$|R
50|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1871, chief Many Swans, {{the chief of the}} Biters band of the Siksika nation and brother of <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit,</b> died {{resulting}} in <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> being appointed as chief of the biters. During his career as a band chief he was noted for his kindness, generosity and intelligence.|$|R

50|$|<b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> signed Treaty No.7 {{with the}} Canadian {{government}} alongside other Siksika nation chiefs including Crowfoot and Old Sun. The treaty promised the Blackfoot Confederacy reserve lands, hunting rights, trapping rights, and annual provisions/and or payments from the Queen {{in exchange for}} all of the traditional territory of the confederacy with the exception of lands set aside for reservations. <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> was recognized as a minor Siksika chief and was listed as having 90 followers. <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> and his band continued to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle until the last bison herds within the area were destroyed in 1881, resulting in his band and others of the Siksika nation settling on their previously set aside reserve 60 miles east of Calgary Alberta. On the reservation <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> was noted for trying to adapt to a new lifestyle which was forced upon them, becoming a noted farmer in 1887.|$|R
50|$|In 1892 {{after the}} death of head chief No-okska-stumik (Three Bulls), <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> was {{appointed}} as one of the two head chiefs of the Siksika nation alongside fellow chief Old Sun. He remained known for his wisdom, kindness and progressiveness. In 1898 he had made enough money harvesting hay to buy a high top buggy. <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> died in 1911.|$|R

5000|$|Aatsista-Mahkan or <b>Running</b> <b>Rabbit</b> (c. 1833 [...] - [...] {{probably}} 24 January 1911) was a {{chief of}} the Siksika First Nation.

He was known for his generosity and kindness, and for his loyal protection of his family.|$|R
50|$|This breed {{was used}} for hunting creatures like hare, deer, wild rats, iguana and squirrels. Generally Kanni breed run very fast and catches its prey. It smells and traces the hare. While hunting it can quickly respond to the hand signals and {{gestures}} towards a <b>running</b> <b>rabbit.</b> They take timely decision while hunting. Its running style generally looks like flying in air like that of Cheeta.|$|R

5000|$|In {{configurations}} {{that include}} sequenced flashing lights, {{the lights are}} typically strobes mounted {{in front of the}} runway on its extended centerline. These lights flash in sequence, usually at a speed of two consecutive sequences per second, beginning with the light most distant from the runway and ending at the Decision Bar. RAIL are similar to sequenced flashing lights, except that they end where the white approach light bars begin. Sequenced flashing lights and RAIL do not extend past the Decision Bar to avoid distracting the pilot during the critical phase of transitioning from instrument to visual flight. [...] Sequenced flashing lights are sometimes colloquially called the <b>rabbit</b> or the <b>running</b> <b>rabbit.</b>|$|R
