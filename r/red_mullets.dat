It was the fig-season, and we passed through several alleys encumbered with long rows of fig-dressers, children and women for the most part, who were packing the fruit diligently into drums, dipping them in salt-water first, and spreading them neatly over with leaves; while the figs and leaves are drying, large white worms crawl out of them, and swarm over the decks of the ships which carry them to Europe and to England, where small children eat them with pleasure--I mean the figs, not the worms--and where they are still served at wine-parties at the Universities.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{identifying}} the food web of the <b>red</b> <b>mullet,</b> Mullus barbatus {{in order to understand}} how it is affected by trawling disturbance. To achieve this objective: a) the main features of the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> habitat were investigated; b) the food web of this habitat was studied in two no-trawl areas and in two areas open to trawling. The working hypothesis is that trawling affects the biochemistry of the sediment and the trophic structure of the benthic assemblage. It was predicted: a) less biomass, smaller size and higher production rate in the benthic assemblages of protected gulfs; b) higher average trophic level for both the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> and its predators in protected gulfs; c) a diet shift driven by the mechanical disturbance of trawling. The results achieved confirmed our hypotheses and allowed us to characterize {{for the first time the}} trophic web structure in the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> habitat in the study area. Results also allowed us to compare the trophic level of <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> of different sizes using two independent techniques, stable isotopes of nitrogen and gut contents. The average trophic level of the <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> was higher and the energy consumption per unit of biomass larger in the protected gulfs.

ANN-based models of demersal fish distribution outperformed conventional models and attained better recognition and prediction performance. Results indicated the ability of ANN's to predict presence more accurately than DFA when tested against independent field data. More precisely, sensitivity values obtained using DFA were 62. 1 % for anglerfish, 5. 8 % for hake and 59. 8 % for <b>red</b> <b>mullet</b> whereas using ANN were 75, 71 and 72. 9 % respectively.
