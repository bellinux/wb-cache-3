5|$|The Borodino {{class were}} {{originally}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric <b>rangefinders</b> that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He then transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. While fitting out, these <b>rangefinders</b> were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud coincidence <b>rangefinders</b> that used two images {{that had to be}} superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{the use of}} radar made {{camouflage}} {{generally less}} effective. However, camouflage may have helped to protect US warships from Vietnamese shore batteries using optical <b>rangefinders.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} were refitted {{several times}} during the interwar period to remedy these issues, although no comprehensive modernisation was ever planned. These included installation of director control mounted in new tripod foremasts, replacement of the <b>rangefinders</b> by larger units, the addition of more <b>rangefinders,</b> the alteration of the main gun turrets to allow elevation up to 23°, partial replacement of the coal-fired boilers by oil-fired units, the replacement of the direct-drive turbines by geared turbines, the removal of the bow armour to reduce the weight forward, and the addition of more modern anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
50|$|A {{coincidence}} <b>rangefinder</b> (stereoscopic, parallax, or split-image <b>rangefinder)</b> {{is a type}} of <b>rangefinder</b> {{that uses}} mechanical and optical principles to allow an operator to determine the distance to a visible object.|$|R
50|$|A {{coincidence}} <b>rangefinder</b> or parallax <b>rangefinder</b> {{can be used}} to find {{distance to}} a target.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>rangefinder</b> had {{significant}} mass and inertia, the crosslevel servo normally was only lightly loaded, because the <b>rangefinder's</b> own inertia kept it essentially horizontal; the servo's task was usually simply {{to ensure that}} the <b>rangefinder</b> and sight telescopes remained horizontal.|$|R
5|$|Additional nine-foot <b>rangefinders,</b> {{protected}} by armoured hoods, were added for each gun turret in late 1914. Furthermore, {{the ship was}} fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables by early 1916 in each transmission station that combined {{the functions of the}} Dumaresq and the range clock.|$|E
5|$|Additional nine-foot <b>rangefinders,</b> {{protected}} by armoured hoods, were added for each gun turret in late 1914. Furthermore, the ships were fitted with Mark II or III Dreyer Fire-control Tables, in early 1914, in each transmission station. It combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock.|$|E
5|$|Full {{ammunition}} loads were 1,440 rounds for the 12-inch guns (120 per gun), 3,600 rounds for the 6-inch (300), 5,600 rounds for the 4-inch (350), and 16 torpedoes {{manufactured by}} Whitehead. To assist the main battery with targeting during a battle, the two ships were equipped with two Barr & Stroud <b>rangefinders</b> that were located above the conning towers.|$|E
50|$|Olympus 35SP is a 35 mm <b>rangefinder</b> camera made by Olympus in Japan. It is {{the only}} 35mm <b>rangefinder</b> with a dual center-weighted average {{metering}} and spot metering system. Metering is also available in manual mode, which is quite unusual amongst Japanese <b>rangefinder</b> cameras of this era.|$|R
500|$|Hood was {{completed}} with two fire-control directors. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and was {{fitted with a}} [...] <b>rangefinder.</b> The other was fitted in the spotting top above the tripod foremast and equipped with a [...] <b>rangefinder.</b> Each turret was also fitted with a [...] <b>rangefinder.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{about this}} time, plans were started {{to produce a}} new {{high-quality}} <b>rangefinder</b> 35 mm film camera, complete with wide and ultrawide lenses for the Leica screw mount, and also a standard 35 mm film camera for the amatuer film photography sector — similar to a <b>rangefinder</b> camera, but without a <b>rangefinder</b> or viewfinder — for mounting these lenses.|$|R
5|$|However {{effective}} dazzle camouflage {{may have}} been in World War I, it became less useful as <b>rangefinders</b> and especially aircraft became more advanced, and, {{by the time it was}} put to use again in World War II, radar further reduced its effectiveness. However, it may still have confounded enemy submarines.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence <b>rangefinders</b> used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such <b>rangefinders.</b> Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two British Barr and Stroud {{coincidence}} <b>rangefinders</b> that used two images {{that had to}} be superimposed to derive the range. The gunnery officer then calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target and transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each turret.|$|E
50|$|Hood was {{completed}} with two fire-control directors. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and was {{fitted with a}} 30 ft <b>rangefinder.</b> The other was fitted in the spotting top above the tripod foremast and equipped with a 15 ft <b>rangefinder.</b> Each turret was also fitted with a 30 ft <b>rangefinder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The clever Don Elbie has {{invented a}} new <b>rangefinder</b> {{that he hopes}} to have adopted by the army. General Rosewater hopes to test the new <b>rangefinder</b> in war games with a rival general. A pair of Fifth columnists hope to steal the <b>rangefinder</b> but are {{defeated}} by Snuffy's wife Lowizie, Snuffy's invisible dog and his hillbilly neighbours.|$|R
50|$|Note: Some 35 mm <b>rangefinder</b> {{cameras were}} also partly {{inspired}} by the Zeiss Ikon Contax. Among these belong the 1935 Canon and the 1948 Nikon <b>rangefinder</b> camera.|$|R
5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better <b>rangefinders</b> and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{received}} a lengthy refit from 10 November 1916 to 29 January 1917 at Rosyth where her deck and turret roof armour were reinforced and additional <b>rangefinders</b> were added over her conning tower and {{the rear of}} 'X' turret. For {{the remainder of the}} war, Tiger uneventfully patrolled the North Sea, as both fleets were essentially forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces. The same year saw her undergo a minor refit during which a flying-off platform for a Sopwith Camel was mounted on 'Q' turret and a searchlight platform was added to her third funnel. She underwent a more extensive refit in 1918 which saw her topmast shifted {{to the top of the}} derrick-stump and a more substantial observation platform added to the foremast. Some of her short <b>rangefinders</b> were replaced by longer ones as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric <b>rangefinders</b> that used the angle between two {{vertical}} points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret.|$|E

50|$|The first {{camera to}} feature through-the-lens light {{metering}} was by Japanese company Nikon, with a prototype <b>rangefinder</b> camera, the SPX. The camera used Nikon 'S' type <b>rangefinder</b> lenses.|$|R
50|$|Today the CL is a superbly {{compact and}} quite cheap camera {{on which to}} mount M-mount lenses, {{but it does not}} have a <b>rangefinder</b> as precise as that of any Leica M body. The <b>rangefinder</b> base of the CL is 31.5 mm and the {{viewfinder}} magnification is 0.60, leading to a small effective <b>rangefinder</b> base of 18.9 mm. This is too short for accurate focusing with lenses longer than 90mm and fast lenses used at full aperture. Some users report the camera is rather fragile, especially the <b>rangefinder</b> alignment and meter mechanism.|$|R
5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various <b>rangefinders,</b> especially the fifteen-foot rangefinder above the aft torpedo control tower, and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the torpedo TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the lower deck. However the Dreyer table was removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} torpedo control position in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional camouflage generally less effective, {{and led to}} development of stealth ships, a form of radar camouflage. However, camouflage may have helped United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical <b>rangefinders.</b> Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however {{said to be the}} first U.S. Navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the <b>rangefinders</b> were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the port side of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
5000|$|The Olympus XA was a 35 mm <b>rangefinder</b> camera {{built by}} Olympus of Japan. It {{was one of}} the {{smallest}} <b>rangefinder</b> cameras ever made, together with the Contax T.|$|R
50|$|Interchangeable-lens <b>rangefinder</b> cameras with focal-plane {{shutters}} {{are greatly}} outnumbered by fixed-lens leaf-shutter <b>rangefinder</b> cameras. The most popular {{design in the}} '50s were folding designs like the Kodak Retina and the Zeiss Contessa.|$|R
50|$|The G Series was {{a unique}} 35 mm {{autofocus}} <b>rangefinder</b> system with interchangeable lenses. Rather than displaying a typical <b>rangefinder</b> focusing patch and brightlines, the first G1 had a zooming viewfinder with a focus confirmation light activated by the autofocus system if manual focus was required. The actual AF system, unlike AF for SLR cameras, used a twin-window <b>rangefinder,</b> but the alignment determination was electronic.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the <b>rangefinders</b> were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric <b>rangefinders</b> that used the angle between two {{vertical}} points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. Oslyabya {{and the rest of}} the Second Pacific Squadron were also fitted with Perepelkin telescopic sights for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its life, the platform's {{software}} {{has been}} upgraded {{several times and}} although these upgrades were due to be stopped as part of plans to retire the A-10 in February 2014, Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James ordered that the latest upgrade, designated Suite 8, continue in response to Congressional pressure. Suite 8 software includes IFF Mode 5, which modernizes the ability to identify the A-10 to friendly units. Additionally, the Pave Penny pods and pylons are being removed as their receive-only capability {{has been replaced by}} the AN/AAQ-28(V)4 LITENING AT targeting pods or Sniper XR targeting pod, which both have laser designators and laser <b>rangefinders.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Olympus 35RC is a 35 mm <b>rangefinder</b> camera {{manufactured}} by Olympus in Japan in the 1970s. It {{claimed to be}} the smallest 35 mm <b>rangefinder</b> with automatic exposure control and manual override.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{majority}} of 135 cameras in the 1960s, the Rollei 35 is a viewfinder camera, a <b>rangefinder</b> was not included. Around 1970, Rollei experimented with adding an integrated <b>rangefinder,</b> but {{there was not enough}} room in the camera. They experimented with an external <b>rangefinder</b> mechanism with a turning prism as used in Zeiss Ikon Super Ikontas, but as the production shifted to Singapore this idea was abandoned.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMobile {{robotics}} often uses both {{cameras and}} range finders for applications like environment perception. In this paper, we propose {{a method to}} calibrate such sensors {{to be able to}} match their respective informations. To do that, we present to the camera and to the <b>rangefinder</b> a test card in several different positions. Once we know the position of this test card in both reference frames of the camera and the <b>rangefinder,</b> we are able to determine the position and orientation of the <b>rangefinder</b> wrt. the camera. Then, we project some laser points from the <b>rangefinder</b> to the image plane of the camera to determine the system precision...|$|R
