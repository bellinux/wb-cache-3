5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, {{and in the case}} of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E

5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has played an important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{remained}} {{confined in}} a palace at the Harbour of Eleutherios {{in the capital}} and retained her formal title as empress. Then, on 15 January 792, for reasons not clear, she was recalled to the imperial palace with her title as empress and co-ruler confirmed and her name restored in the imperial acclamations. Staurakios too {{seems to have been}} recalled and, along with Irene, again took {{an active role in the}} governance of the state. This turn of events drove the Armeniacs once again to mutiny, but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> overthrow in 790.|$|E

Few slaves had formal education and those who did were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests.

5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E

5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck may play a <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E

However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he {{was called for}} a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber.

5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Victor B.2s {{had been}} {{converted}} for Strategic Reconnaissance missions following the retirement of the Valiant in this capacity. In service, this type was primarily used in surveillance of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas, capable of surveying 400,000 square miles in an eight-hour mission; they were also used to sample the fallout from French nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific. Originally reconnaissance Victors were equipped for visual reconnaissance; however, it {{was found to be}} cheaper to assign Canberra light bombers to this duty and as such the cameras were removed in 1970. Subsequently, radar-based reconnaissance was emphasised in the type's role. The reconnaissance Victors remained in use until 1974 when they followed the standard bombers into the tanker conversion line; a handful of modified Avro Vulcans assumed the maritime radar reconnaissance <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> place.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

5|$|The nectar of B.sessilis is an {{important}} component of the diet of a number of species of honeyeater. In one study, B.sessilis was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied, namely the tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris), and black honeyeater (Certhionyx niger). Moreover, B.sessilis played {{an important}} <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> distributions, with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where B.sessilis occurs, and remaining for longest at sites where B.sessilis is most abundant. Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on B.sessilis include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), western wattlebird (A.lunulata), and New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). Furthermore, a study of bird species diversity in wandoo woodland around Bakers Hill found that honeyeater species and numbers were much reduced in forest that lacked a Banksia sessilis understory; the plant is a key source of nectar and insects during the winter months. A field study in jarrah forest 9km south of Jarrahdale, where B. sessilis grows in scattered clumps, found that western wattlebirds and New Holland honeyeaters sought out groups of plants with the greatest numbers of new inflorescences, particularly those one or two days after anthesis, where nectar yield was highest. The birds likely recognises these by visual clues.|$|E
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E
