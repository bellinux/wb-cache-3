40|$|Cellulosic fibres (flax, hemp, {{regenerated}} cellulose) possess decent {{mechanical properties}} {{and they are}} gaining interest {{as an alternative to}} synthetic reinforcement (e. g. glass fibres) in polymers to reduce the petroleum consumption and pollution. In particular, manmade Regenerated Cellulose Fibres (RCF) have been extensively studied as potential reinforcement in polymer composites. For high performances where stability is highly required, RCF among the cellulosic fibres are well qualified due the advantage of being continuous with <b>regular</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> However, the hydrophilic character and the sensitivity to moisture reduce the use of fibres based cellulose in composite applications. Indeed, the moisture absorption and the low compatibility leading to weak fibre/matrix interface are major factors behind the less interest of utilizing cellulosic fibres in composite intended for high performances. The short term objective of this thesis was to improve the resistance to moisture and the adhesion of regenerated cellulose fibres (RCF) commercialized under the trade name CORDENKA 700 super 3 to Epoxy matrix through chemical treatments by cellulose nano-crystals via silane coupling agents. In Paper I chemical treatments of cellulose nano-crystals using (CNC) esterification and amidification to attach long aliphatic chains is studied. The treatment was successfully achieved as confirmed by spectroscopic characterisations and led to a decrease of the moisture absorption. Contact angle measurement showed hydrophobic of CNC after treatment. In Paper II, CNC extracted from wastes of date palm tree were grafted on RCF fibres to create hierarchical structure. The effect of grafting CNC on RCF was evaluated by tensile tests both in static and loading-unloading. In fact, treatments were revealed to change slightly the microstructure where the orientation of both crystalline and amorphous phases where re-oriented as X-ray analysis showed. Grafted fibres based unidirectional composite were manufactured and transversally tested. Both mechanical properties and resistance to crack were significantly increased by fibre modification. Another approach for chemical modification of RCF fibres was developed in Paper III. In this paper, the process of modification of RCF by CNC is more environmentally friendly. The γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as coupling agent to attach the CNC onto the fibres. This treatment involves a mixture of water and ethanol as solvents and was run at relatively low temperature. The impact of the treatment on fibres was scrutinised after each treatment basically by MPS and after grafting CNC. Results showed that the modification by silane decreased the stiffness and strength of fibres while the strain at failure was increased. However, after grafting CNC, stiffness and strain at failure were recovered while the strength remained at the same order of magnitude as for fibres treated only by the coupling agent. The effect of these treatments on moisture absorption and on the adhesion with epoxy matrix was the focus of the Paper IV. In this paper, it was shown that at high relative humidity (RH= 64 %) the treatment by CNC decreased water uptake by factor of two compare to untreated fibres. Besides, the treatments by CNC at different concentrations lessened the impact of moisture on stiffness and strength of fibres after exposure to the same humidity level (RH= 64 %). Moreover, the pull-out test performed on fibre bundles showed that the adhesion between fibre and matrix is less affected by moisture (samples conditioned at RH= 64 %) for CNC grafted fibres compare to untreated fibres. The treatment process by MPS was Scaled-up to Non-Crimp Fabric in Paper V and the interlaminar properties of composites reinforced with RCF were studied. Double cantilevered beam (DCB) test was used to characterize fracture toughness, under static and fatigue loading. Regenerated cellulose fibres exhibit highly nonlinear behaviour and strongly influence the performance of their composites. The obtained fracture toughness values were significantly high compared to those of synthetic fibre reinforced composites. However, due to the high nonlinearity, a concrete conclusion was not easy to make on the effect of fibre treatment on the materials performance. Thus, scanning electron microscopy studies were carried out on fracture surfaces which confirmed the treatment effect, qualitatively, on the improvement of interfacial adhesion.

It is shown that these tubular ZnO micro/nanostructures exhibit <b>regular</b> hexagonal <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> and smooth outer and inner surfaces. Optical studies of ZnO micro/nanotubes reveal characteristic coherent intensity modulations of their emission spectra which reflect the excitation of either whispering gallery modes or wave-guided modes.

40|$|Constraints {{are placed}} on the spin-independent {{interaction}} <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of dark matter with regular matter by refining two methods. First, dark matter [...] cosmic ray interactions are considered, wherein cosmic ray protons collide with dark matter {{to contribute to the}} gamma ray sky. This constraint is developed using the NFW and Moore dark matter density profiles and new data from the Fermi gamma ray space telescope. Second, the Earth capture scenario is considered, wherein particles that are captured self-annihilate at Earth's center, thus adding to its internal heat flow. The constraint presented here is developed based on analysis of the drift time of dark matter particles through Earth, modeled as a core composed of iron and a mantle composed of oxygen with linear density gradients between layers. An analysis of the cosmic ray constraint (which rules out dark matter [...] <b>regular</b> matter interaction <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> greater than its value) shows that it overlaps significantly with the Earth drift time constraint (which rules out <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> smaller than its value), closing the window on strongly interacting dark matter particles up to a mass of about 10 ^{ 17 } GeV when combined with other exclusions.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{existence}} of periodic orbits around a fixed homogeneous cube is investigated, and the results have powerful implications for examining periodic orbits around non-spherical celestial bodies. In the {{two different types of}} symmetry planes of the fixed cube, periodic orbits are obtained using the method of the Poincaré surface of section. While in general positions, periodic orbits are found by the homotopy method. The results show that periodic orbits exist extensively in symmetry planes of the fixed cube, and also exist near asymmetry planes that contain the <b>regular</b> Hex <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> The stability of these periodic orbits is determined {{on the basis of the}} eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix. This paper proves that the homotopy method is effective to find periodic orbits in the gravity field of the cube, which provides a new thought of searching for periodic orbits around non-spherical celestial bodies. The investigation of orbits around the cube could be considered as the first step of the complicated cases, and helps to understand the dynamics of orbits around bodies with complicated shapes. The work is an extension of the previous research work about the dynamics of orbits around some simple shaped bodies, including a straight segment, a circular ring, an annulus disk, and simple planar plates.

The US ITER Project Office developed {{two different types of}} interpancake joints with some variations in details in order to find a better design, qualify the joints, and establish a fabrication process. We built and tested four samples of the sintered joints and two samples with butt-bonded joints (a total of eight joints). Both designs met the specifications.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the general torsion problem of the regular prismatic bar was introduced, based on extensive and meticulous experimental evidence, indicating that the twisted prismatic bars, except the cylindrical ones, present, a longitudinal warping, following a sinusoidal type of curves for the warping displacements with their extrema displaced towards the corners. As a guide {{for the establishment of}} the method the solutions of the elliptical and the equiangular triangular bars were used. It was found that the regions inside the inscribed circles tangent to the sides of their undeformed cross-sections constituted regions whose warped surfaces constitute undulated forms following sinusoidal surfaces. This property was proved exact for the exact solutions for the elliptic and triangular cross-sections and it is assumed by induction valid for any regular cross-section. Comparing the warping displacements along the inscribed circle to a square or <b>regular</b> polygon <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> with the classical Timoshenko solution for the square bar it was found an exact coincidence in these displacements. It was further shown that these circles and all concentric full circles constitute the initial curves of the caustics formed from reflections of the warped cross-sections of the twisted bars. The differences between the stresses and displacements between the existing approximate solutions and the {{new approach}} appear in the partly curved triangles lying outside the inscribed circles. For the square cross-section it was shown that the w-displacements between Timoshenko's solution and the present one were less than 5 percent. Experimental evidence with the Moiré method and comparison with the exact solution for the equiangular triangular <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> proved that the present approach is closer to reality and therefore presents higher accuracy than any approximate method. Furthermore, it presents the advantage that the full circles inscribed inside the cross-section constitute the initial curves forming caustics in space when a parallel light beam is reflected on the warped cross-section of the twisted bars. interesting properties of caustics, proved in this paper, help down-rightly for a thorough study of the form and properties of the twisted bars. © 1989 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with developing an adequate Performance-Based Wind Engineering (PBWE) framework for tall building design. The focus is to introduce advanced modelling and simulation techniques to improve key analysis stages, namely by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM). The clearly defined five stage PBWE framework is realised and implemented using both existing and newly developed simulation components. The performance of the developed process is explored by comparative PBWE analyses to assess the wind-induced behaviour of two tall building designs with distinctly different <b>cross</b> sections; a <b>regular</b> rectangular <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> and an irregular „L‟-shaped <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> The performance of CFD was primarily dependent on the turbulence model. On {{the basis of an}} extensive validation study, the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model was able to adequately compute the mean pressure coefficients acting on the benchmark CAARC tall building. However, its inability to sustain the atmospheric turbulence resulted in a significant under-estimation of the top floor accelerations. Hence, it was concluded that the RANS model is not suitable for competent PBWE studies. The results showed that the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model offered the closest alternative to wind tunnel testing. However, full LES was too computationally expensive to be used for the PBWE framework, and hence a hybrid RANS-LES simulation strategy was formulated as a compromise. This was considered to offer an appropriate representation of the wind-induced pressure field without prohibitive complexities emanating from a full LES model. The response of the regular tall building was compared for both the RANS and the LES computed wind loads. This identified that the atmospheric turbulence had a much greater affect on the response of a regular prismatic tall building than the structure-induced turbulence. Despite an increase in structure-induced turbulence, the results suggested that the response of an irregular L‟-shaped tall building would also be governed by atmospheric turbulence in the incident wind field.

40|$|The worst {{structural}} defect of a masonry wall {{can be the}} lack of monolithic behaviour and this can happen in case of poor quality and morphology, for instance when the wall is made by multiple leaves even well ordered but not mutually connected. In case of a seismic event, external forces act in horizontal direction, causing the wall to become more vulnerable with separation of the leaves. Therefore it’s important to verify from the beginning the masonry quality in an existing building and to carry out properly this work. The present Italian seismic code (NTC 14. 01. 2008 and annexes) requires, for existing buildings, different levels of knowledge; the lowest, named LC 1, requires only to classify the masonry among the typologies reported in a table and allows {{the use of the}} mechanical parameters in a range of values related to each typology. Serious mistakes can be made in the structural evaluation of a historic stone masonry if the definition of the masonry typology is incorrect. In several cases a masonry texture can appear externally good and <b>regular</b> while the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> is poor with non-connected multiple leaves, or, on the contrary, the masonry texture appears to be irregular from the prospect with small irregular stones of different dimensions while the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> shows a well interlocked masonry with long stones used as connection among the leaves.

5000|$|The nuclear <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of {{a nucleus}} {{is used to}} {{characterize}} {{the probability that a}} nuclear reaction will occur. The concept of a nuclear <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> can be quantified physically in terms of [...] "characteristic area" [...] where a larger area means a larger probability of interaction. The standard unit for measuring a nuclear <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> (denoted as σ) is the barn, which is equal to 10−28 m² or 10−24 cm². <b>Cross</b> <b>sections</b> can be measured for all possible interaction processes together, in which case they are called total <b>cross</b> <b>sections,</b> or for specific processes, distinguishing elastic scattering and inelastic scattering; of the latter, amongst neutron <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> the absorption <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> are of particular interest.|$|R
