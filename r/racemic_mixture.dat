5|$|Warfarin {{consists}} of a <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture</b> of two active enantiomers—R- and S- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways. S-warfarin is 2-5 times more potent than the R-isomer in producing an anticoagulant response. Both the enantiomers of warfarin undergo CYP-mediated metabolism by many different CYPs to form 3',4',6,7,8 and 10-hydroxy warfarin metabolites, major being 7-OH warfarin formed from S-warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10-OH warfarin from R-warfarin by CYP3A4.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam {{exists as}} a <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture.</b> Early {{attempts}} to isolate enantiomers were unsuccessful; the corresponding acetate has been isolated {{as a single}} enantiomer. Given the different rates of epimerization that occur at different pH levels, {{it was determined that}} there would be no therapeutic benefit to the administration of a single enantiomer over the <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture.</b>|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, from the {{standpoint}} of statistics, small fluctuations in the ratio of the two enantiomers are expected to be present in <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> of chiral molecules [1, 34, 35]. We envisaged that when the reaction system involves asymmetric autocatalysis with amplification of ee, the initial small imbalance of enantiomers in <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> that arises from the reaction of achiral reactants becomes overwhelming to afford a highly enantiomerically enriched product [36 – 44].|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous Mirror-Symmetry and {{appearance}} of chiral self-assembled superstructures in non-chiral systems represents a fascinating field of contemporary research with potential applications. For long time {{the formation of}} helical superstructure was associated with enantiomeric chiral molecules. Later on Pasteur showed that that the <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> of chiral molecules can resolve spontaneously into two chiral forms. Such deracemization or symmetry breaking in <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> was observed during crystallization. In recent years interest in mirror-symmetry breaking extended to soft matter systems...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two major}} {{medications}} derived from methylphenidate's isomers: a <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture</b> of half d-threo-methylphenidate and half l-threo-methylphenidate called methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), and an enantiopure formulation containing just d-threo-methylphenidate called dexmethylphenidate (Focalin).|$|E
25|$|Ketorolac acts by {{inhibiting}} {{the bodily}} synthesis of prostaglandins. Ketorolac in its oral (tablet or capsule) and intramuscular (injected) preparations is a <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture</b> of both (S)-(−)-ketorolac, the active isomer, and (R)-(+)-ketorolac.|$|E
40|$|Positron lifetimes in the {{isotropic}} {{phases of}} chiral nematic liquid crystal formulations and their mixtures {{up to the}} racemic level were measured. The lifetime spectra for all liquid crystal systems were analyzed into three components. Although the individual spectra in the left- and right-handed components are identical, their <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> exhibit much larger orthopositronium lifetimes; these larger lifetimes indicate the presence of larger microvoids. This result {{is consistent with the}} reportedly higher thermodynamic stability and color play range in the <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> of chiral nematic liquid crystals...|$|R
40|$|Single {{enantiomer}} molecules {{are important}} for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries and increasingly so in materials science. Most strategies to obtain enantiomerically enriched molecules rely on either generating new stereogenic centres from prochiral substrates or resolving <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> of enantiomers. Dynamic asymmetric processes are poweful methods that use <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> of chiral substrates as starting material. This Feature Article focuses on asymmetric additions to racemic substrates using non-stabilized sp 2 - and sp 3 -hybridized nucleophiles. These reactions bear considerable resemblance to traditional sp 2 –sp 2 cross-coupling reactions {{in terms of the}} starting materials used and the products obtained, but the reaction mechanisms are necessarily different...|$|R
50|$|As the helices are interconnected, all helices in {{a crystal}} {{must have the}} same {{molecular}} handedness. This is determined when the crystal is nucleated and can thus be forced by seeding. The resulting crystals {{have been used to}} separate <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures.</b>|$|R
25|$|Thalidomide is {{provided}} as a <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture</b> of two enantiomers; {{while there are}} reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Most complex natural {{products}} are chiral, and the bioactivity of chiral molecules {{varies with the}} enantiomer. Historically, total syntheses targeted racemic mixtures, mixtures of both possible enantiomers, after which the <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture</b> might then be separated via chiral resolution.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} {{virtually}} all other simple phenylethanolamines (β-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (R)-(−)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (S)-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, {{but not all}} preparations studied. However, the majority of {{studies have been conducted}} with a <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture</b> of the two enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the synephrine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists {{in the form of}} two enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, or as the <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture,</b> d,l- synephrine. The dextrorotatory d-isomer corresponds to the (S)-configuration, and the levorotatory l-isomer to the (R)-configuration.|$|E
50|$|Its sodium-ammonium salt {{is unusual}} among <b>racemic</b> <b>mixtures</b> in that during {{crystallization}} it can separate out into {{two kinds of}} crystals, each composed of one isomer, and whose macroscopic shapes are mirror images of each other. Thus, Louis Pasteur was able to separate the two enantiomers by picking apart the crystals.|$|R

Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in the {{synthesis}} of Taxol, the material was a <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture.</b> To obtain the desired enantiomer, allylic alcohol 4.9 was acylated with (1S)-(−)-camphanic chloride and dimethylaminopyridine, giving two diastereomers.

The desired enantiomer was then isolated when one of the separated disatereomers was treated with potassium bicarbonate in methanol.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} understood that autocatalysis {{alone does not}} yield to homochirality, {{and the presence of}} the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture.</b> However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis {{in the absence of the}} mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.|$|E

25|$|Salbutamol is {{sold as a}} <b>racemic</b> <b>mixture.</b> The (R)-(−)-enantiomer (CIP nomenclature) {{is shown}} in the image at right (top), and is {{responsible}} for the pharmacologic activity; the (S)-(+)-enantiomer (bottom) blocks metabolic pathways associated with elimination of itself and of the pharmacologically active enantiomer (R). The slower metabolism of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer also causes it to accumulate in the lungs, which can cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation.|$|E
