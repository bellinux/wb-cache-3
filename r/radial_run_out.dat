40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} comfort disturbances in heavy vehicles can often be related to the wheels. In those cases, the vibration of the vehicle is excited by for example force variations within the tire, ovality of the tire or imbalance in the wheel. The disturbances are dependent on vehicle speed and are often perceived as most unpleasant at cruising speed on a motorway, at around 90 km/h. Truck manufacturers want to increase the robustness against this type of disturbance, since this results in an improved operator comfort. But it also makes it possible to lower the requirements on the suppliers of tires and rims, and thereby there is a financial gain for both customer and manufacturer. The aim with this project is to increase the understanding of wheel induced vibrations. In order to achieve this a literature survey has been performed on the subject. Furthermore, the phenomenon has been studied analytically by using a quarter car model which includes a brush tire model. The model is scripted in MATLAB. Simulations have been performed to analyse the effect on the chassis when forces excited by mass imbalance and <b>radial</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> are introduced. When looking at the second harmonic <b>radial</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> imperfection the unsprung mass, i. e the wheel, starts to bounce during the settling time. Also when comparing two different weights of a mass imbalance the power increase of the vibration in the sprung mass is much larger than the power increase of the unsprung mass at the specific frequency. This implies that the excitation frequency, the wheel rotation frequency in this case, is a harmonic repetition of the sprung mass undamped natural frequency. To avoid this phenomenon the undamped natural frequency of the sprung mass must change either by adding a damper or by changing the weight or the spring stiffness. The simulation is run with a damper although without it the power increase would be much larger...|$|E

At BESSY II a new UV and XUV optics beamline [1] has {{recently}} been setup with an in house developed versatile reflectometer [2], [3], [4] for at wavelength metrology on reflective and diffractive optical elements up to 4 kg mass. High precision measurements of the reflection and polarization properties are feasible by a 360 azimuthal rotation of the sample around the beam of light, where samples can be adjusted reproducibly with a novel UHV Tripod within arc sec and amp; 956;m precision. The azimuthal rotation requires an extremely high precision adjustment of the goniometer axis {{with respect to the}} incident light beam. Here we describe sophisticated methods with which we achieve nearly perfect agreement of the azimuthal rotation axis and the synchrotron beam in the 30 arc sec range. By using geodetic instruments lasertracker, theodolite, autocollimator the quality of the reflectometer UHV mechanics has been characterized with respect to stiffness and <b>radial</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> with highest precision [5...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} global three dimensional accretion disk simulations {{carried out in the}} cylindrical limit in which the vertical component of the gravitational field is neglected. The simulations use a cylindrical pseudo-Newtonian potential, / 1 =(R Γ R g), to model the main dynamical properties of the Schwarzschild metric. The <b>radial</b> grid domain <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> to 60 R g to minimize the influence of the outer boundary on the inner disk evolution. The disks are initially constant density with a Keplerian angular momentum distribution and contain a weak toroidal or vertical field which serves as the seed for the magnetorotational instability. These simulations reaffirm many of the conclusions of previous local simulations. The MRI grows rapidly and produces MHD turbulence with a significant Maxwell stress which drives accretion. Tightly-wrapped low-m spiral waves are prominent. In some simulations radial variations in Maxwell stress concentrate gas into rings, creating substantial spatial inhomogeneities. As in previous global simulations, there is a nonzero stress at the marginally stable orbit. The stress is smaller than seen in stratified torus simulations, but nevertheless produces a small decline in specific angular momentum inside the last stable orbit. Detailed comparisons between simulations are used {{to examine the effects of}} various choices in computational setup. Because the driving instability is local, a reduction in the azimuthal computational domain to some fraction of 2 does not create large qualitative differences. Similarly, the choice of either an isothermal or adiabatic equation of state has little impact on the initial evolution. Simulations that begin with vertical fields have greater field amplification and higher rat [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the percentage of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits made by patients who recently <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of their inhaled short-acting beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids and to characterize this understudied patient population. A secondary analysis was performed of data from four ED-based multicenter studies of acute asthma during 1996 – 1998 (n 64 EDs). In each study, consecutive adult patients, aged 18 – 54 years, with acute asthma underwent a structured interview that assessed running out of inhaled medications. The analytic cohort comprised 1095 adults. Overall, 324 patients (30 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 27 – 32 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of either of their inhaled beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids during the week before their index ED visit; 311 (28 %; 95 % CI, 26 – 31 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled beta-agonists per se. Among a subset of 518 patients on inhaled corticosteroids, 55 patients (11 %; 95 % CI, 8 – 14 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled corticosteroids. In the multivariable model, predictors of running out of an asthma medication were male sex, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, no insurance, lower household income, and use of EDs as the preferred source of asthma prescriptions (all p 0. 05). Among patients who <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of medications, 49 % (95 % CI, 43 – 55 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled beta-agonists and 72 % (95 % CI, 58 – 84 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled corticosteroids, before onset of their acute asthma symptoms.

40|$|Landslide often {{occurs in}} {{tropical}} hills area, such as Indonesia. Research on landslide hazard evaluation {{is necessary to}} decrease the impact in affected and surrounding areas. Empirical-statistical methods {{can be used to}} predict landslide <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance in an effort to avoid the danger of landslide occurrences. This study aims to determine the correlation between landslide <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance against high, slope, and volume based on mechanisms and causes of soil or rock mass movement. Data mainly from 106 landslides in Indonesia has been analyzed to search for possible correlations and empirical correlations, there are 34 rotational slides, 54 translational slides, 8 debris flows, and 10 rock falls. Analysis begins by studying the characteristics of the data (explanatory data analysis) and then analyzed by using empirical methods such as geomorphological assessment and geometrical approaches. Then the data is processed by simple linear regression and multiple linear regression method using the R software. The results obtained from the analysis of the general empirical equation form of the correlation between height (H) and <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance (L) is 1. 066 H 1. 093, respectively. This results indicate the higher altitude slopes, the greater distance will happen. The results of the analysis correlation between height and <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance for the type of mass movements for rotational is L= 1. 346 + 1. 788 H, translational is L=- 3. 88 + 1. 578 H, debris flow is L= 0. 682 H 1. 29, and rock fall is L= 2. 223 H 0. 897. This result shows debris flows landslide <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance is greater than rotational, translational and rock fall. The results of the analysis correlation between height and <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance of the trigger due to the rain is L= 1. 267 H 1. 027, and by an earthquake is L= 0. 574 H 1. 38. This results show <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance caused by an earthquake is larger than caused by rain. The correlation between the <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance and volume (V) yields empirical equation which is V= 0. 772 L 2. 108. This results indicate that greater <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance is affected by the growing volume of mass movement. The results of the analysis correlation between height and slope (θ) to <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance is L= 1. 448 H 1. 062 tan θ- 0, 482. This results indicate that slope has {{a significant impact on the}} value of landslide <b>run</b> <b>out</b> distance...|$|R
