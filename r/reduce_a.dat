5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>a</b> high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff.

5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to <b>reduce</b> <b>a</b> person to ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E

A survey of psychiatric practice in the late 1980s found that an estimated 100,000 people received ECT annually, with wide variation between metropolitan statistical areas.|$|E

Barcode verifiers are primarily used by businesses that print and use barcodes. Any trading partner in the supply chain can test barcode quality. It is important to verify a barcode to ensure that any reader in the supply chain can successfully interpret a barcode with a low error rate. Retailers levy large penalties for non-compliant barcodes. These chargebacks can <b>reduce</b> <b>a</b> manufacturer's revenue by 2% to 10%.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of copper fungicide {{has been shown}} to significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>a</b> great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria.

On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October.|$|E
25|$|A {{boattail}} {{can greatly}} <b>reduce</b> <b>a</b> vehicle's total drag.

It is created {{as an extension of}} the rear of the vehicle, moving the rear backward at a slight angle toward the bumper of the car. This can reduce drag as well but a boattail would reduce the vehicles drag more. Nonetheless, for practical and style reasons, a kammback is more commonly seen in racing, high efficiency vehicles, and trucking.|$|E
