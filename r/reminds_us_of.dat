As an earnest student, and ardent lover of liberty, an enthusiast in the cause of virtue, and a man of unblemished life and untiring beneficence, Shaftesbury probably had no superior in his generation. His character and pursuits are the more remarkable, considering the rank of life in which he was born and the circumstances under which he was brought up.

Later that year, she co-starred with Shahid Kapoor in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Kismat Konnection. Faring poorly at the box office, the film and her performance generated a negative response; critic Sonia Chopra commented, [...] " [...] is made to look downright drab.

500|$|The five [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{are often}} {{interpreted}} as representing Wordsworth's opposing views {{of nature as}} well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature. For example, Lucy {{can be seen as}} a connection between humanity and nature, as a [...] "boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> the traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence." [...] Although the poems evoke a sense of loss, they also hint at the completeness of Lucy's life—she was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others. She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer David Ferry (b. 1924), [...] "not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature", while [...] "her death was right, after all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Strange Days {{polarized}} film critics. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and described it as [...] "a technical tour de force... The pacing is relentless, and the editing, by Howard Smith, creates an urgency and desperation". He also highlighted the film's astute use of SQUID technology, stating that [...] "Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening; she forces her audience {{to deal with the}} screen reality, instead of allowing us to process it as routine 'action.'" [...] In a mixed review, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating, concluding that Strange Days [...] "has a dazzling atmosphere of grunge futurism, but beneath its dark satire of audiovisual decadence lurks a naggingly conventional underworld thriller." [...] Edward Guthmann of San Francisco Chronicle criticized the film for failing to commentate its violence, saying that [...] "Bigelow's style is so visceral [...] that her movie <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> a snuff film, rather than a well-reasoned cautionary tale about our animal instincts." [...] New York magazine writer David Denby stated similar cons and called the rape scene [...] "the sickest sequence in modern movies".|$|E

Carlos Macias from Terra USA, however, gave it a negative review and criticized its use of a [...] "cheap keyboard that drives the tune <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> music played at weddings and quinceañeras". In 2013, Latina included [...] "Addicted to You" [...] on their list of [...] "The 13 Best Songs in Spanglish" [...] and commented that [...] "If non-Spanish speakers can’t pick up the language after listening to this track, then we feel bad for you, son".

According to Variety Brian Lowry, [...] "Kevin Spacey’s showy performance as an unscrupulous politician" [...] is foremost among the show's strengths, but the show's weakness is the [...] "failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes". Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him". Goodman says [...] "Spacey {{is nothing if not}} constantly magnetic". The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever. Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that [...] "Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano, Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power, and <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> the fact in his asides to the camera...he may be a ruthless sociopath, but there's something to admire there".

There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone." [...] All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said it was beautiful, and noted that [...] "the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon felt that it was [...] "unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting", and noted that it was [...] "yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups." [...] Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an [...] "A", and said that it was a [...] "vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners." [...] Flandez commented that the song [...] "floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up that <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> what Glee is at its heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time {{magazine}} considered McConaughey's portrayal to be a [...] "bold, drastic {{and utterly}} persuasive inhabiting of a doomed fighter", remarking that [...] "if the camera occasionally suffers a fashionable {{case of the}} jitters, the movie transcends its agitated verismo to impart dramatic and behavioral truth". Chris Bumbray reviewed the film for JoBlo.com and gave it 9 out of 10, and said, [...] "Like Woodroof, the film never wants your pity, and while tears {{will no doubt be}} shed while watching it, they're well-earned." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea talked about McConaughey's role, [...] "Just about everything is right with Dallas Buyers Club, beginning with Matthew McConaughey's literally transformative portrayal. McConaughey's performance isn't just about the weight loss. It's about gaining compassion, even wisdom, and it's awesome." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "Dallas Buyers Club" [...] takes audiences back to the worst of the AIDS crisis, where the disease was a death sentence, and the public's terror and hostility were at its height." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper reviewed the film for his own website, and talked about McConaughey: [...] "Once we get past McConaughey's stunning transformation, we're transfixed by a performance that <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> why this guy became a movie star in the first place." [...] Ann Hornaday gave the film 4 out of 4 ratings, and then gave her remarks on McConaughey's remarkable performance for The Washington Post, [...] "McConaughey delivers the performance of his career, characterized not just by an astonishing physical transformation but by a wellspring of deep compassion and fearlessness." ...|$|E

500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy called Doctor Strange [...] "an engaging, smartly {{cast and}} {{sporadically}} eye-popping addition" [...] to the franchise, adding [...] "this action movie ostensibly {{rooted in the}} mind-expanding tenets of Eastern mysticism is different enough to establish a solid niche alongside the blockbuster combine's established money machines." [...] McCarthy, in addition to praising the acting, felt that there were certain sequences that [...] "go far beyond [...] in visual spectacle" [...] and that the time manipulation sequences, [...] "seen to outstanding advantage in 3D, [...] mind-trip-seeking audiences back in Doctor Strange's origin days would have called 'far-out' but today's fans will simply deem 'amazing'." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety called the film [...] "Marvel’s most satisfying entry since Spider-Man 2," [...] and wrote that despite having [...] "the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen" [...] as the other MCU films, it [...] "boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late." [...] Debruge also praised the casting along with the multitude of visual effects the film was able to achieve. Alonso Duralde, reviewing for TheWrap said, [...] "True, Doctor Strange is an origin story, and occasionally hemmed in by the genre's narrative requirements, but it's smart enough to bring in great British actors to make the predictable paces and life lessons feel fresh and fascinating." [...] Regarding the film's visuals, Duralde praised them, exclaiming, [...] "In a year where bloated, empty spectacles have induced a crushing level of CG fatigue, this funny, freaky adventure <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "The giddily enjoyable Doctor Strange... is part of Marvel's strategy for world domination, yet it's also so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Within the familiar narrative contours of the origin story, writer-director Scott Derrickson crams in enough out-of-body experiences, spatial-temporal shenanigans and dazzlingly kaleidoscopic visuals to make you wonder if he and his co-writers ... were dropping acid behind the scenes." ...|$|E
