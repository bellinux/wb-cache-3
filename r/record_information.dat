5|$|Monte Testaccio has {{provided}} archaeologists {{with a rare}} insight into the ancient Roman economy. The amphorae deposited in the mound were often labelled with tituli picti, painted or stamped inscriptions which <b>record</b> <b>information</b> such as {{the weight of the}} oil contained in the vessel, the names of the people who weighed and documented the oil {{and the name of the}} district where the oil was originally bottled. This has allowed archaeologists to determine that the oil in the vessels was imported under state authority and was designated for the annona urbis (distribution to the people of Rome) or the annona militaris (distribution to the army). Indeed, some of the inscriptions found on mid-2nd century vessels at Monte Testaccio specifically record that the oil they once contained was delivered to the praefectus annonae, the official in charge of the state-run food distribution service. It is possible that Monte Testaccio was also managed by the praefectus annonae.|$|E

Archivists {{long have}} been distressed at non-use of archival {{resources}} by those who, as archivists see them, could benefit readily and substantially from {{making use of}} this category of <b>records</b> <b>information.</b> Write an essay in which you: (1) define and exhibit a strong {{understanding of the nature}} and purpose of <b>records</b> <b>information</b> and archives, and (2) indicate the ways in which concepts of non-use of information might be applied effectively in the archival environment with the goal of achieving greater benefit to the public for its investment in archives. Knowing that {{the devil is in the}} details, please suggest concrete applications, not simply comfortable generalizations. Question 1, part 1 : Define and exhibit a strong understanding of the nature and purpose of <b>records</b> <b>information</b> and archives. Overview of the nature and purpose of <b>records</b> <b>information</b> and archives The nature and purpose of <b>records</b> <b>information</b> and archives derive directly from their development. In 1547, Spain saw the establishment of archives as an office, but the principles of archival practice came later. In 1794, the French Revolution established accountability of government through its archives and the citizen's right of access to government documents...|$|R

25|$|A tectonic {{earthquake}} begins by an initial rupture {{at a point}} on the fault surface, {{a process known as}} nucleation. The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than 100 m while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to <b>record</b> <b>information</b> close to a nucleation zone.|$|E
25|$|Symbolic {{communication}} systems are distinguished from writing systems {{in that one}} must usually understand something of the associated spoken language to comprehend the text. In contrast, symbolic systems, such as information signs, painting, maps, and mathematics, often do not require prior knowledge of a spoken language. Every human community possesses language, a feature regarded by many as an innate and defining condition of mankind (see Origin of language). However the development of writing systems, and their partial supplantation of traditional oral systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven, and slow. Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts and often preserve features and expressions that no longer exist in the spoken language. The greatest benefit of writing is that it provides the tool by which society can <b>record</b> <b>information</b> consistently and in greater detail, something {{that could not be}} achieved as well previously by spoken word. Writing allows societies to transmit information and to share knowledge.|$|E

Later more appeared in Nichols' Literary Anecdotes, and then finally his complete letters were published in three volumes by the Surtees Society along with letters from his brother Samuel and brother-in-law William Stukeley. Nichols in 1781 declared that Gale was [...] "one of the most learned men of his age", but later scholars have been less full of praise. D. C. Douglas, writing in the 1950s, contrasted Gale with his father, and felt that the younger Gale was given a greater reputation than he deserved. Notwithstanding Douglas' opinion, Gale's work did much to preserve important historical information, as {{he was a member}} of the new style of antiquary, who instead of working just with manuscripts, turned to the topography and other relics in the countryside.

500|$|In Pokémon Red and Blue, {{the player}} learns of Mewtwo's {{existence}} by reading research notes {{left in the}} ruined Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island. The notes say that the island's scientists discovered a new Pokémon in a Guyana jungle, that they named it Mew, and that it later {{gave birth to a}} creature they called Mewtwo; the game's Pokédex entry states that Mewtwo was [...] "created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments". Mewtwo proved too mighty to control, destroying the laboratory and escaping. The player is later given an opportunity to capture Mewtwo in the Cerulean Cave, which is accessible only after defeating the game's final bosses, the Elite Four and Blue; in the remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen this prerequisite was expanded, requiring the player to explore more thoroughly and <b>record</b> <b>information</b> on sixty Pokémon species before access to the cave would be granted. Mewtwo is catchable in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver in the same location as before after defeating all of the gym leaders in Kanto. The character was also the focus of a promotion and downloadable content giveaway for Pokémon Black and White. Mewtwo also reappears in Pokémon X and Y after completing the main story, {{and is one of the}} handful of Pokémon capable of using the new Mega Evolution mechanic, as it can become either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y.|$|E

2500|$|During the Roman Republic, several abbreviations, {{known as}} sigla (plural of siglum = symbol/abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they {{increased}} in number during the Roman Empire. Additionally, {{in this period}} shorthand entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian Xenophon in the memoir of Socrates, and it was called notae socratae. In the late Roman Republic, the Tironian notes were developed possibly by Marcus Tullius Tiro, Cicero's amanuensis, in 63BC to <b>record</b> <b>information</b> with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the Latin minuscule hand and square and rustic capital letters. The notation was akin to modern stenographic writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, {{and it could be}} used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the Carolingians, who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a [...] "murky existence" [...] (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by Johannes Trithemius, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (notae benenses).|$|E
