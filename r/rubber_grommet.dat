5000|$|J-hook (Claw hook) system. {{a type of}} {{mounting}} system where the ceiling fan hangs on a metal hook, attached to the ceiling. A <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> is used to keep the fan in place and helps avoid vibration on the ceiling.|$|E
5000|$|A D-ring on an M16 or variant type rifle {{is used to}} {{increase}} {{the pressure on the}} extractor and reduce malfunctions. This D-ring is a <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> shaped like a [...] "D" [...] and fits over the extractor spring adding tension to it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid microphonism, {{particularly}} in the input stages of high-gain amplifiers, design engineers used to shock-mount the tube-socket assemblies in these stages by means of small <b>rubber</b> <b>grommets</b> placed in the screw holes, leaving them in a [...] "floating" [...] situation.|$|R
50|$|Mated <b>rubber</b> <b>grommets</b> {{provide a}} {{positive}} seal. Joined halves separate automatically when depressurized. Gladhand couplers are typically genderless or hermaphroditic, {{allowing them to}} be freely connected to each other, for example allowing either end of a railcar {{to be connected to}} the end of a train. North America has a system of standardized gladhand sizes.|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteriological}} {{investigation of}} {{an outbreak of}} Legionnaires' disease in Glasgow Royal Infirmary affecting 16 patients is described. Most of the patients had been treated in high-dependency areas on two floors of the hospital supplied by the same two air-conditioned ventilation systems. The source of infection was traced to contamination of a cooling tower from which a plume of spray discharged into the intake vents of the two ventilation systems. <b>Rubber</b> <b>grommets</b> within the cooling tower probably provided a nidus of infection there. The control {{and management of the}} outbreak are discussed: a policy of frankness about the course and progress of the investigations was adopted and helped to allay anxiety {{on the part of both}} staff and media...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> [...] {{is made of}} a {{resilient}} material (typically rubber), with the molding designed {{to hold it in}} place, so as to help to absorb vibrations, for example, between a tandem radio and the chassis or between microphone and its tripod, keeping the two components [...] "floating" [...] mechanically decoupled one from another to prevent a characteristic coupling called microphonism [...]|$|E
50|$|Pressure cookers {{usually have}} two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, {{one is a}} nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a sealed <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> which is ejected in a {{controlled}} explosion if the first valve gets blocked. On newer generation pressure cookers, if the steam vent gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan. Also, newer generation pressure cookers have a safety interlock which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which {{would happen if the}} lid were to be removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pan is still pressurised).|$|E
50|$|Kenyon {{failed to}} qualify for his first Indianapolis 500 in 1965. Kenyon's tenth career race in a USAC IndyCar was at Langhorne Speedway in Langhorne, Pennsylvania on June 20, 1965. Mel's engine blew up sending oil all over the car, his firesuit and the track. He {{lost control of the}} car, hit the wall and was knocked unconscious. Jim Hurtubise and Ralph Liguori slid in the oily track and ran {{straight}} into Mel's fuel tank. Joe Leonard, also involved in the crash, rescued Kenyon from the burning car. Because of severe burns, Kenyon went through multiple operations at the San Antonio Burn Center, and he lost nearly all of his fingers on his left hand. Mel, his brother Don and their father Everett designed a special glove with a <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> sewn into the palm. The glove fit on Mel's hand and hooked into the steering wheel. The trio formed a racing team called 3-K Racing, with Don as the crew chief.|$|E
25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used {{nut and bolt}} fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with <b>rubber</b> <b>grommets,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} March 2012, MVG {{announced}} that damage had occurred to the wheels of nine cars, where the <b>rubber</b> <b>grommets</b> between the tire and the wheel had cracked {{after a few weeks}} and had to be replaced. A commissioned report mentioned errors in the composition and the production of the rubber elements as a cause. The issue of definitive authorization, planned on April 1, 2012, was thereby halted. In order to keep the lines running , the planned conversion of the predecessor R series trains was delayed, and plans were drafted to borrow trams from other companies. The rubber parts were finally replaced in summer 2012, with the provisional approval extended by nine months, to approve the new parts. Following further software changes to the doors and air-conditioning systems, the final approval of the trams was postponed again from 31 May to 30 September 2013, when the trams received their final approval. On 10 May 2016 the trams received approval to operate lines 17, 27 and 28.|$|R
5000|$|Isolate {{hard disk}} noise, either by using {{anti-vibration}} mounts (generally <b>rubber</b> or silicone <b>grommets),</b> or by suspending the hard disk to fully decouple {{it from the}} computer chassis by mounting it in a 5.25 inch drive bay with viscoelastic polymer mounts.|$|R
5000|$|For first {{generation}} pressure cookers with a weighted valve or [...] "jiggler", the primary safety valve or regulator {{is usually a}} weighted stopper, commonly called [...] "the rocker" [...] or [...] "vent weight". This weighted stopper is lifted by the steam pressure, allowing excess pressure to be released. There is a backup pressure release mechanism that releases pressure quickly if the primary pressure release mechanism fails (e.g., food jams the steam discharge path). One such method is {{a hole in the}} lid that is blocked by a low melting point alloy plug and another is a <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> with a metal insert at the center. At a sufficiently high pressure, the grommet will distort and the insert will blow out of its mounting hole to release pressure. If the pressure continues to increase, the grommet itself will blow out to release pressure. These safety devices usually require replacement when activated by excess pressure. Newer pressure cookers may have a self-resettable spring device, fixed onto the lid, that releases excess pressure.|$|E
40|$|The {{abnormal}} noise of an outdoor domestic air-conditioner operating {{at low speed}} is experimentally analyzed. The structure-borne noise which passes through the mounting system is confirmed {{to be the main}} source of the {{abnormal noise}} due to the large low frequency vibration on compressor foot. Then the characteristic of low frequency vibration of rotary compressor including the dynamic model, exciting forces and dynamic response is researched. Based on this, mounting system including compressor foot and <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> is optimized to solve this problem, more than 8 dB reduced...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{stability}} {{screening tests}} {{were performed on}} the Apollo 15 Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay nonmetallic materials {{in accordance with the}} NASA document SP-R- 0022. The testing was necessary to support the evaluation to determine the effect material outgassing contamination would have on the SIM bay optical lenses and sensing devices. The Apollo 15 SIM experiments were highly successful, therefore, it is assumed that contamination due to the outgassing of nonmetallic materials did not affect equipment operation. A related problem, the reversion of a silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> which affected an electrical motor switch operation is also reported...|$|E
2500|$|The stripes {{are about}} four inches wide. The tent itself is {{about four feet}} wide by three feet deep, and inside {{headroom}} is well over six feet. A long white zipper runs up {{the middle of the}} front, while the back is open and contoured to fit the bus. The frame consists of four metal poles which fit into pockets inside the top of the tent and lock together to form a square. Legs on two of the poles fit into brackets which were bolted to the camper's roof. Two additional poles dogleg into the top frame and have small chain-hooks to hold the doors open. The lower ends of these poles fit into holes in the jack supports. <b>Rubber</b> <b>grommets</b> help protect the paint on the doors and the jack points. The lower edge of the tent is secured to the ground with about a dozen metal stakes. Each stake is about six inches long and is formed from hardened 1/4" [...] rods with a loop at one end. Two storage bags made of (usually matching) canvas with leather straps are supplied for the tent and poles.|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{is a very}} {{important}} characteristic of inverter compressor, and itâ€™s critical for refrigerator running speeds selection. First, the reasons why the compressor vibrates are discussed, unbalanced forces of comprssor moving parts are the source of the vibration. The flexible parts in the vibration transmission route are also very critical, they are inner discharge tube, suspension springs, <b>rubber</b> <b>grommets,</b> and so on. When the natural frequencies of the system are similar to the source excitation frequencies, resonance will happen, vibrations will be very large. Second, one inverter compressor vibrations were tested, and the results show that the vibrations varied a lot in different speeds and directions. Then the reasons why the inverter compressor vibrations are very large in some speeds are analyzed in the third part. The natural frequencies of shell and grommets system and inner discharge tube were got by experiment or simulation. The results show that those natural frequencies are too close to the soure excitation frequencies in some speeds, that is the reason why the compressor vibrates so large. By the grommets and inner discharge tube redesigns, the natural frequecies are moved far away from excitation frequencies, the compressor vibrations are reduced. The methods suggested in this research are helpful in reducing inverter compressor vibrations...|$|R
50|$|Skate trucks have a {{rigid axle}} {{and a top}} hanger, with a single bolt and bushings, also called <b>rubbers</b> or <b>grommets,</b> that provide the cushion {{mechanism}} for turning the mountainboard. The bushings cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the mountainboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, {{the easier it is}} to turn. A bolt called a kingpin holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning and tighter for more control. Skate-style mountainboard trucks are similar to skateboard trucks but more robust and with a longer axle.|$|R
40|$|Dermal {{substitutes}} {{are widely}} used in Plastic surgery {{for the treatment of}} partial and full thickness skin defects. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a promising biomaterial for tissue engineering due to its versatile mechanical properties. In the current study, host cell integration and angiogenesis were evaluated in PCL fabricated with electrospinning and freeze-dry methods and compared with those in Integra and Pelnac, two of the dermal regeneration templates. To this end, a mouse model of non-healing wound that reflected medium and large full-thickness skin injuries in humans was established. This model incorporated a splint around the wound using a <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet.</b> No reduction in the splinted wound was observed {{until the end of the}} study. Using this mouse model, Angiogenesis was assessed using IHC for CD 146. In collagen-PCL, no CD 146 positive cell was detected in freeze-dried PCL and only 26...|$|E
40|$|Once {{a process}} cycle has been completed, glass condom molds {{are removed from}} {{spindles}} that connect them to the process equipment. Currently, glass molds are removed by destroying the glass around the spindle, resulting in safety hazards from glass shards, monetary loss due to replacement cost, and also loss of money due to the labor cost associated with time spent cleaning up the glass shards and breaking the molds. To solve the dilemma, the sponsor demanded a safe, cost efficient method or addition that would not harm the process during the cycle nor damage the spindle and glass molds at any moment. Two routes were concocted, chemical (lubricants, <b>rubber</b> <b>grommet</b> specifications) and mechanical (rotational torque puller). After experimentation with both chemical and mechanical options, a purely mechanical option was decided upon once the cost effectiveness and the simplicity of use for the proposed device were noticed. A working prototype was constructed and experimented with success trials in {{the removal of the}} glass condom molds from the spindles within given constraints. Currently, the only issues remaining with the project are making sure that the mechanical puller becomes automated, and making sure that it is completed by the Senior Design Expo. This project will impact Church 2 ̆ 6 Dwight Co., Inc. by saving them a minimum of 13, 000 per year in labor, and will enable them to increase the safety and efficiency of their manufacturing plant while eliminating most of the replacement cost of the glass molds. Society would greatly benefit from this project due to the increased production of various condoms causing further evolution of condoms and ultimately protected sex. [URL]...|$|E
5000|$|Penny {{trucks are}} made from high quality cast aluminium. The purpose of the trucks is to connect the board's wheels and {{bearings}} to the deck. The trucks are composed of two parts; the baseplate, which is screwed to the top part of the deck, and the hanger, which the axle runs through. Between the baseplate and the hanger are bushings (also {{commonly referred to as}} <b>rubbers</b> or <b>grommets</b> or cushions) which function as a cushion for the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the Penny board will be to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. A kingpin bolt holds these parts together, and fits inside the bushings. By tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning, and tightened for more stability.|$|R
50|$|The ARS is {{essentially}} {{set up to}} create a fingerprint for different samples by constructive and destructive interferences. Figure 1 is a schematic of the quartz rod ARS which illustrates {{the path of the}} sound through the quartz rod. A function generator is the source though any device that is capable of outputting sound in voltage form could be used (i.e. CD player, MP3 player or sound card). White noise is generated and the voltage is converted into a sound wave by a piezoelectric disc coupled to the quartz rod. The sound resonates down the quartz rod which is shown as a blue sinusoidal wave and two key interactions occur. A portion of the energy (red) is introduced into the sample and interacts in a specific manner dependent of the sample and another portion of the energy (blue) continues unaltered through the quartz rod. The two energies will still have the same frequency though they will have changes in their phase and possibly amplitude. The two waves recombine after the sample and constructive or destructive interference occurs depending on the phase shift and amplitude change due to the sample. The altered combined energy is converted to an electrical voltage by another piezoelectric disc {{at the end of the}} quartz rod. The voltage is then recorded onto a computer by a sound card. The sample is coupled to the quartz rod at constant pressure which is monitored by a pressure transducer which also acts as the sample holder. <b>Rubber</b> <b>grommets</b> are used to secure the quartz rod to a stable stand minimizing coupling of the rod to the surroundings. Broadband white noise is used to obtain a full spectrum; however, most sound cards only pick up between 20 and 22,050 Hz. The waveform that is sent to the computer is a time-based signal of the interactions of white noise with the sample. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed on the waveform to transform the time-based signal into the more useful frequency spectrum.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pressurised}} {{cabin was}} used to counter the physiological problems encountered by pilots at high altitudes. The cabin was not like the fully pressurised cabin of a modern airliner; the pressure differential provided by the modified cockpit of the VI was only two {{pounds per square inch}} (which was double the Air Ministry requirement). To achieve this, the forward and rear cockpit bulkheads were completely enclosed, with all control and electrical cables exiting though special <b>rubber</b> sealing <b>grommets.</b> In addition, the side cockpit door was replaced with alloy skin and the canopy was no longer a sliding unit: externally there were no slide rails. Once the pilot was in, the canopy was locked in place with four toggles and sealed with an inflatable rubber tube. It could be jettisoned by the pilot in an emergency. The windscreen of production Mk VIs was the same as the type fitted to the Mark III and some Mk Vs although it was fitted with an inward opening clear-view panel on the port quarter pane. The effect was to make [...] seem like [...] to the pilot, who would still have to wear an oxygen mask. Pressurisation was achieved by a Marshall-manufactured compressor located on the starboard side of the engine, fed by a long intake below the starboard exhaust stubs. Mk VIs were built with the Coffman cartridge starter, with a small teardrop fairing just ahead of the compressor intake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{top part}} of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the {{baseplate}}, and beneath it is the hanger. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are bushings, also <b>rubbers</b> or <b>grommets,</b> that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The bushings cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, {{the easier it is}} to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as durometers, which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a kingpin holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning and tighter for more stability (useful when landing tricks). Standard kingpin nut size is 3/8" [...] - 24tpi. The position of the hanger respect to the baseplate is also determined by the pivot, a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a pivot cup, a plastic part that will take most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assist in centering the hanger.|$|R
