5000|$|A {{live axle}} is {{probably}} the most common axle setup used on mini choppers. The [...] "live" [...] term indicates that the axle spins along with the <b>wheel,</b> <b>sprocket,</b> and other pieces anchored to the axle. Since the axle spins, bearings are mounted to the swing arm frame. This is a very simple axle setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel hub, disc brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the axle and are held in place by set screws or locking collars. The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the axle spins, the <b>wheel,</b> brake, and <b>sprocket</b> components must be locked to the axle. This is accomplished by using a square key that fits into a groove on the axle and the components.|$|R

5000|$|De Vivie {{imported}} machines from England. In 1889 {{he made a}} bike of his own, called La Gauloise. It had {{a diamond}} frame, chain and a single gear. De Vivie was riding the col de la République (10 km south east of St Etienne) in 1889 {{when one of his}} readers overtook him - smoking a pipe. De Vivie felt challenged but also trapped: if he lowered his gear, he would go slower on the flat. But on the gearing that he had, he could not climb hills fast enough either. British thinking favoured epicyclic and planetary gears, concealed in the rear hub. De Vivie created the derailleur. His first had two chain wheels; the chain had to be lifted by hand from one to the other. He then placed two <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> on the left side. The combination gave him four gears. [...] In 1901 Velocio combined his invention with the four-speed proteon gear of the English Whippet, which used a split <b>chain</b> <b>wheel.</b> Pedalling backwards made the two halves of the <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> open.

By using engine and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>sprockets</b> the gear ratio can be adjusted as required for track conditions.
