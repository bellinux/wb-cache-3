Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot?</b> <b>and</b> a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June.

[...] "We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E
500|$|Trump {{ended his}} {{relationship}} with Melania Knauss in January 2000, removing a key figure of the campaign entourage. [...] According to the New York Daily News, an associate of Trump said the move was meant to appease Reform Party leaders. [...] Roger Stone denied the suggestion. [...] In addressing the matter, Trump complimented Knauss and commented, [...] "she will be missed." [...] Shortly thereafter, {{in an attempt to}} bring the two Reform Party factions together, Trump invited party leaders to the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Addressing the 170 party members, who attended the event (including former chairman Russ Verney), Trump proclaimed [...] "I'm very proud to be in the party of <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>and</b> Jesse Ventura." [...] Verney appreciated the gesture and in shifting from his once-chilly reception to the Trump candidacy, he welcomed Trump into the race. [...] After opening the event to questions, one attendee asked Trump whether he would appear at the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Trump said he would consider it [...] "very seriously." [...] Concerning Buchanan, Trump repeated he could not support Buchanan as the party's nominee. [...] Despite the retreat, the intra-party dispute over the location of the convention continued. [...] Citing scheduling conflicts, Trump did not attend the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Reports suggested that Trump insiders believed Buchanan had packed the convention with supporters and would embarrass Trump by winning all the state's delegates. [...] There were also growing indications Trump was considering withdrawing from the race, commenting that he was [...] "deeply concerned" [...] about the conflict within the party. [...] In another attempt to unite the party's factions, Trump wrote letters to Ventura and Perot, requesting the two make peace. [...] Trump believed the instability of the party would hinder his chances of presidential success. Stone commented that [...] "the [...] party is melting down before our very eyes." [...] On the final day of January, Trump was removed from the New York primary ballot after a judge determined that Trump's supporters had failed to obtain the required 5,000 signatures from registered Reform Party members. [...] This marked a victory for Buchanan's supporters, including leftist activist Lenora Fulani, who had hoped to prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot in his home state.|$|E
