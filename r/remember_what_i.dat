Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
500|$|... "If U Seek Amy" [...] {{integrates}} [...] "glam-rave" [...] elements {{with traditional}} pop styles; it gained controversy for its double entendre, where the title sounds phonetically like [...] "F-U-C-K me". The electropop track [...] "Unusual You" [...] {{deals with a}} woman finding unexpected love. It {{has been compared to}} musical themes from the 1980s and 1990s, and has been noted as a [...] "pulsating ballad", with the song also drawing comparisons to the [...] "shimmering waterfall mood first popularized by Janet Jackson". [...] "Blur" [...] sees the inclusion of urban influences, and lyrically recalls the morning after a party with lyrics [...] "Can't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did last night/I gotta get my head right, where the hell am I? Who are you? What'd we do last night?"; it drew similarities to Spears's prior song [...] "Early Mornin". [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] draws elements from a 1960s go-go rock guitar and Latin-pop dance hall themes. Despite its [...] "fun" [...] nature, it was criticized for appearing to [...] "revisit the Lolita persona of [...] "…Baby One More Time". It has been suggested that its lyrics deal with either Spears's father Jamie or paparazzi Adnan Ghalib. [...] "Mannequin" [...] is a dance-pop song with a trip hop influence; while being noted for its [...] "risky" [...] and [...] "futuristic" [...] nature, it has also been suggested that Spears's vocals sounded [...] "lifeless". [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] gained comparisons to [...] "Control era Janet Jackson", Prince, and Vanity 6's works from the 1980s and featured a then-unknown Kesha as a backing vocalist. [...] "My Baby", described as having a [...] "faux-Janet Jackson vocal", was written by Spears about her two sons Sean Preston and Jayden James Federline, and closes the album.|$|E

My eyes saw, my ears heard, and my understanding was touched, and I know that whereof I testified is true. It was no dream, no vain imagination of the mind—it was real".|$|E
2500|$|During the {{excavation}} {{of the rubble}} of Scopas' dining hall, Simonides was called upon to identify each guest killed. Their bodies had been crushed beyond recognition but he completed the gruesome task by correlating their identities to their positions (loci in Latin) at the table before his departure. He later drew on this experience to develop the 'memory theatre' or 'memory palace', a system for mnemonics widely used in oral societies until the Renaissance. According to Cicero, Themistocles wasn't much impressed with the poet's invention: [...] "I would rather a technique of forgetting, for I <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would rather not remember and cannot forget what I would rather forget." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, as {{he spoke}} these words, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had just heard, my blood boiled in me, but I thought it wise to control myself, and {{therefore}} only answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have made her--you {{ought to have}} made her," [...] said Mr. Carteret. Nick was about to plead some reason when he continued: [...] "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> told you I'd give you if you did?

6000|$|... "Next day," [...] she uttered distinctly, [...] "I didn't think. I remembered. That was enough. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{should never}} have forgotten. Never. And Captain Anthony arrived at the cottage in the evening." ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>I,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} in the blue parlour, was silent--for I could not lie. So she flung my hand away with a bitter laugh, and picked lightly from the table anear a small dagger with a jewelled handle.|$|R

60|$|I {{began to}} wish that I had never left Germany. The one course to take now {{was to tell}} the lawyer <b>what</b> had happened. <b>I</b> turned away to get back, and drive at once to the town. The servant <b>remembered,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten--the five pound note.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Quick {{in a new}} {{and more}} respectful voice, [...] "and however big a rascal you may be, you've got pluck.

6000|$|... "I {{said more}} than that. I bade you ask your father. Now you have come again. You cannot {{understand}} a girl's fears and doubts. How should you? I thought perhaps you would not come.
