5000|$|Due {{to safety}} and {{maintenance}} concerns, Air Koryo {{was added to}} the list of air carriers banned in the European Union in March 2006. The European Commission found evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of Air Koryo during <b>ramp</b> <b>inspections</b> in France and Germany. Air Koryo persistently failed to address these issues during other subsequent <b>ramp</b> <b>inspections</b> performed by the EU under the SAFA programme, pointing to blatant systemic safety deficiencies at Air Koryo operations. The airline failed to reply to an inquiry by the French Civil Aviation Authority regarding its safety operations, pointing to a lack of transparency or communication on the part of Air Koryo. The plan by Air Koryo for corrective action, presented in response to France's request, was found to be inadequate and insufficient. The EC also held that North Korean authorities did not adequately oversee the flag carrier, which it was obliged to do under the Chicago Convention. Therefore, {{on the basis of the}} common criteria, the Commission assessed that Air Koryo did not meet the relevant safety standards.'''' ...|$|R
