40|$|The {{incidence}} of involuntary part-time work surged during the Great Recession and has stayed unusually high during the recovery. This may reflect more labor market slack than is {{captured by the}} unemployment rate alone. Analysis across states and over time indicates that {{a substantial part of}} the increase is related to the business cycle. However, structural factors such as changes in industry composition, population demographics, and labor costs have also contributed. This suggests that involuntary part-time work may remain significantly above its pre-recession level as the labor market continues to recover. People who work part time but would prefer to work full time make up a small but important portion of the labor force. The prevalence of such involuntary part-time work has remained unusually high {{in the aftermath of the}} Great Recession.

Expenditure per capita on fresh fin fish and other marine products comprising of invertebrates,molluscs and seaweeds, is declining in real terms (both in urban and rural areas), while the proportion of thepopulation consuming marine products is declining amongst all ethnic groups. Urban consumption of other marineproducts remains low, compared to that for rural Fijians.

40|$|As we {{approach}} the 40 th anniversary of the landmark Humphrey-Hawkins Act, this report underscores how the Federal <b>Reserve's</b> full <b>employment</b> mandate has made the Fed more accountable to working people. The report first traces the historical origins of the full employment mandate and highlights the pivotal but little-known role racial justice activists played in its creation. From the 1930 s and through {{the rise of the}} civil rights movement, racial justice activists including Coretta Scott King, called for a coordinated federal effort to attain full employment. They envisioned an economy where every person who seeks employment can secure a job. King joined Congressional leaders Augustus Hawkins and Hubert Humphrey in eventually passing the landmark 1978 Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act (Humphrey-Hawkins) which legally required the Fed to pursue maximum employment. The report then turns to Federal Reserve monetary policy in the 1990 's which offers an instructive model of what a full employment economy can look like. This real-world case study from our recent history shows that when labor markets tighten, workers begin to see broad-based wage gains, and persistent economic inequalities are reduced. Finally, the report underscores the continued importance of the full employment mandate today while providing an overview of proposed policies to eliminate or significantly curtail its effectiveness. In light of these findings, this report calls on Federal Reserve policymakers to use all tools at their disposal to fully realize the Fed's full employment mandate. Members of Congress must publicly affirm the importance of full employment while committing to reject any efforts to weaken or eliminate the full employment mandate. In particular, the Senate must reject nominees to the Board of Governors who have called for the narrowing of the Fed's mandate or who support policies that would undermine the Fed's ability to pursue full employment...|$|R

The decline in factory jobs has been uneven across the country. Factory jobs have declined most dramatically in the eastern United States, but by less in the Great Plains region. Among Federal <b>Reserve</b> Districts, factory <b>employment</b> in the Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts has outperformed all other Districts {{in each of the last}} three business cycles. As policymakers increasingly look to manufacturing as a source of highpaying jobs, understanding the sector’s evolution is important. Using Federal Reserve Districts to define regional boundaries, this article examines why factory employment has consistently held up better in Federal Reserve Districts in the Great Plains (Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis) than in Districts in other regions. The article also examines whether regions with large factory job losses have had worse overall economic outcomes. It finds that since 2000, nearly half of the better factory jobs performance in the Great Plains has been due simply to Chad R.
