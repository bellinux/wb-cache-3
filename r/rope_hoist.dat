50|$|For a given {{rated load}} wire rope is lighter in weight {{per unit length}} but overall length {{is limited by the}} drum {{diameter}} that the cable must be wound onto. The lift chain of a chain hoist is far larger than the liftwheel over which chain may function.

50|$|The basic hoist has two {{important}} characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, {{wrapped around a}} drum, or load-chain, raised by a pulley with a special profile to engage the chain. The power can be provided by different means. Common means are hydraulics, electrical and air driven motors. Both the wire <b>rope</b> <b>hoist</b> and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of an electric hoist did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be built as one integral-package unit, designed for cost-effective purchasing and moderate use, {{or it can be}} built as a built-up custom unit, designed for durability and performance. The built-up hoist will be much more expensive, but will also be easier to repair and more durable. Package units were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate usage, but since the 60s this has changed. Built-up units are designed for heavy to severe service, but over the years that market has decreased in size since the advent of the more durable packaged hoist. A machine shop or fabricating shop will use an integral-package hoist, while a Steel Mill or NASA would use a built-up unit to meet durability, performance, and repairability requirements. NASA has also seen a change in the use of package hoists. The NASA Astronaut training pool, for example, utilizes cranes with packaged hoists.|$|E
5000|$|In 1876 Sampson Moore in England {{designed}} and supplied {{the first ever}} electric overhead crane, which was used to hoist guns at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, London. Since that time Alliance Machine, now defunct, holds an AISE citation {{for one of the}} earliest cranes in the USA market. This crane was in service until approximately 1980, and is now in a museum in Birmingham, Alabama. Over the years important innovations, such as the Weston load brake (which is now rare) and the wire <b>rope</b> <b>hoist</b> (which is still popular), have come and gone. The original hoist contained components mated together in what is now called the built-up style hoist. These built up hoists are used for heavy-duty applications such as steel coil handling and for users desiring long life and better durability. They also provide for easier maintenance. Now many hoists are package hoists, built as one unit in a single housing, generally designed for ten-year life, but the life calculation is based on an industry standard when calculating actual life. See the Hoists Manufacturers Institute site [...] for true life calculation which is based on load and hours used. In today's modern world for the North American market there are a few governing bodies for the industry. The Overhead Alliance is a group that represents Crane Manufacturers Association of America (CMAA), Hoist Manufacturers Institute (HMI), and Monorail Manufacturers Association (MMA). These product counsels of the Material Handling Industry of America have joined forces to create promotional materials to raise the awareness of the benefits to overhead lifting. The members of this group are marketing representatives of the member companies.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain Jacks and Stud Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire <b>rope</b> <b>hoist</b> by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|E

50|$|UDD {{stands for}} Universal-Dig-Dump. It {{represents}} the first fundamental change to draglines {{for almost a}} century, since {{the invention of the}} 'miracle hitch'. Instead of using two <b>ropes</b> (the <b>hoist</b> <b>rope</b> and the drag rope) to manipulate the bucket, a UDD machine uses three <b>ropes,</b> two <b>hoist</b> and one drag. This allows the dragline operator to have much greater selectivity in when to pick up the bucket, and in how the bucket may be dumped. UDD machines generally have higher productivity than a standard dragline, but often have greater mechanical issues. Within the mining industry, there is still much debate as to whether UDD improvements justify their costs.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the physical demands of a simulated firefighting circuit and to establish the relationship between job performance and endurance and strength fitness measurements. On four separate days 41 professional firefighters (39 ± 9 yr, 179. 6 ± 2. 3 cm, 84. 4 ± 9. 2 kg, BMI 26. 1 ± 2. 8 kg/m) performed treadmill testing, fitness testing (strength, balance and flexibility) and a simulated firefighting exercise. The firefighting exercise included ladder climbing (20 m), treadmill walking (200 m), pulling a wire <b>rope</b> <b>hoist</b> (15 times) and crawling an orientation section (50 m). Firefighting performance during the simulated exercise was evaluated by a simple time-strain-air depletion model (TSA) taking the sum of z-transformed parameters of time to finish the exercise, strain in terms of mean heart rate, and air depletion from the breathing apparatus. Multiple regression analysis based on the TSA-model served for the identification of the physiological determinants most relevant for professional firefighting. Three main factors with great influence on firefighting performance were identified (70. 1 % of total explained variance) : VO, the time firefighter exercised below their individual ventilatory threshold and mean breathing frequency. Based on the identified main factors influencing firefighting performance we recommend a periodic preventive health screening for incumbents to monitor peak VO and individual ventilatory threshold...|$|E
40|$|This project {{includes}} a thesis performed at Karlstad University in spring 2013. The thesis {{is included in}} the mechanical engineering program and contains 22. 5 university points, which is equivalent to 480 hours of work including self-study.   This work has implemented by the student Luiz Ferreira in cooperation with the firm Camatec Industriteknik AB in Karlstad.   The purpose of this project has been that the company Camatec wants to offer their customers a standard vertical transporter. This transporter must be able to transport paper rolls, which can weigh up to 5 tons, between two floors. The objective with this project has been to prepare a complete set of drawings for a vertical transporter and a price estimate of all its components. This transporter must fit into a given elevator shaft but also be able to adapt into different dimensions.   A vertical transporter has been developed with help of different methods including 3 D-modeling, Finite Element Method and strength calculations.   The total development of the transporter has been divided into several areas of constructions: Receiver for paper rolls An existing receiver for paper rolls has been redesigned and adapted into the new construction. Frame A frame has been developed including I-beams, flat bars and hollow structural sections which have been connected with welding and bolts to hold the receiver. Mechanism A mechanism of shaft and bearings, which allow the receiver to rotate so the paper rolls can relief in a facility way, has been designed. Guiding A guiding section has been developed, in which t-grids have been used to guide the transporter along the given elevator shaft. Vibration damper Two ANB 100 vibration dampers with a hardness of 70 Shore have been used to suppress one side of the receiver so it can rotate. Hoist An appropriate <b>rope</b> <b>hoist</b> for this transporter has been discussed with the firm ABUS Kransystem AB in Karlstad. This hoist carries almost the entire transporter.   Standard components are used through the entire project and these have been estimated at an amount of about 306   000 Swedish crowns, where prices for the existing solution of receiver, processing and installation are not included...|$|E
