40|$|Conventional {{views of}} legal change {{emphasize}} {{the values of}} certainty and reliance, and are therefore hostile to explicitly retroactive laws. Contemporary scholarship, however, allows that a policy of aggressive legal change, with no compensation for 2 ̆ 2 new losers, 2 ̆ 2 can encourage socially useful steps in anticipation of change. Professor Levmore argues that the anticipation-oriented approach logically extends to embrace anticipation by 2 ̆ 2 new winners 2 ̆ 2 and governments {{as well as new}} losers. If all parties 2 ̆ 7 anticipatory incentives are considered, familiar rules, ranging from statutes of limitations to retroactivity and to compensatory payments for government takings, seem quite sensible. And if these rules are drawn correctly, few parties should find it worthwhile to stand against progress. Professor Levmore then considers reparations. He argues that these payments by governments are made when the potential anticipation effects normally associated with <b>retroactive</b> <b>compensation</b> are absent. The transfers are then redistributive, and best understood through interest group analysis...|$|E

Imagined interactions are a type of social cognition and mental imagery theoretically grounded in symbolic interactionism and cognitive script theory, in which individuals imagine conversations with significant others {{for a variety of}} purposes (Honeycutt, 2003; 2010). Honeycutt and Bryan (2011) have discussed how cognitive scripts are a type of automatic pilot providing guidelines for how to act when encountering new situations. Scripts are activated mindlessly and created through imagined interactions, as people envision contingency plans for actions. In contrast to mindless processing, engaging in imagined interaction requires conscious cognitive processing.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to reexamine the dispute settlement procedures under the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{from the viewpoint}} of incentive design. The WTO dispute settlement procedures are aimed not only to resolving disputes but also at securing compliance of obligations under WTO agreements. It is therefore necessary to analyze the dispute settlement procedures focusing on their aspect as a mechanism for deterring non-compliance with WTO rules. In this regard, Warren F. Schwarz and Alan O. Sykes (2002) distinguish between two types of non-compliance: "efficient breaches," or non-compliance that increases the total sum of benefits to all WTO members, and "inefficient breaches," or non-compliance that decreases the total sum of benefits to all WTO members, defining the WTO dispute settlement procedures as a mechanism for encouraging the former and deterring the latter. Yet in doing so, they did not conduct detailed substantive analysis of the WTO dispute settlement procedures. In this paper, a simple game theoretic model has been used to analyze the current framework of the WTO dispute settlement procedures. It has been found that not only effective breaches but also ineffective breaches cannot be deterred under the existing framework. In this sense, the procedures are not functioning in the manner postulated by Schwarz and Sykes. In other words, under the current framework, WTO member countries have an incentive to intentionally engage in conduct that might or would constitute an ineffective breach, and would remove or correct the questioned measure if and only after it {{has been found to be}} inconsistent with the relevant WTO agreement. Such an incentive is not weakened by criticism from other members of the international community or by retaliatory measures. Furthermore, the fact that <b>retroactive</b> <b>compensation</b> - remedies for previously incurred damages - is not allowed under the current system, which increases the incentive for non-compliance, particularly, inefficient breaches. In this sense, the current WTO dispute settlement system is insufficient at deterring violations. There have been discussions about increasing the level of retaliation winning parties are allowed to take in the event of non-implementation. However, addressing the problem described above would require other measures, which may include allowing winning parties to seek, at the stage of implementation, monetary compensation for past damages, the grant of interlocutory injunction, or approval for limited retaliation. Yet each of these measures is not without problems and further study will be required. ...|$|E
40|$|Air {{ventilation}} {{is one of}} the top energy {{users in}} residential buildings. Smart ventilation equipment and controls help to reduce the amount of energy use attributable to ventilation in homes while maintaining high indoor air quality. Ventilation can also be used as a resource for utility grid demand response if done intelligently. A key component of the smart ventilation concept is the use of controls to ventilate more when doing so provides an energy or air quality advantage and/or a resource to the power grid, and less when it provides a disadvantage. Unlike demand-controlled ventilation, other smart ventilation concepts involve the addition of several new inputs into control algorithms—namely measured or modeled concentrations of pollutants and signals from the electricity grid. And, unlike demand-controlled ventilation, smart ventilation uses the “equivalent ventilation” principle in the selection of the control strategy, which allows anticipation of future ventilation needs and <b>retroactive</b> <b>compensation</b> for previous ventilation needs. To determine the best means of controlling ventilation in residences, this study first reviewed literature relating to the: Suitability of common environmental variables (pollutants of concern, humidity, odors, CO 2, occupancy) for use as input variables in smart ventilation applications Availability and reliability of relevant sensors Different control strategies used for a smart ventilation approach. Results of the review showed that the suitability of each environmental variable is specific to each smart ventilation application, and also that pollutant sensors are currently not robust or accurate enough to be relied upon for residential ventilation controls. Next, this research assessed the regulatory context in which smart ventilation strategies might be implemented most effectively. The assessment showed that many countries already have a regulatory structure that is favorable for the development of smart ventilation strategies. These countries have regulations and standards in place that propose “equivalence methods” that offer a path to compliance including the use of smart ventilation strategies. These compliance paths have allowed for the development and availability of demand-control ventilation systems in the marketplace; more than 30 such systems have been approved and are available in countries including Belgium, France, and the Netherlands. It seems likely that the more complex smart ventilation strategies would follow a similar path to market acceptance. Results of the review of smart ventilation in residential buildings is used to: Determine and discuss performance of smart ventilation in terms of energy and indoor air quality Gather data on occupant behavior Assess the suitability of automatically controlled ventilation systems Assess the applicability of a multi-zone approach for ventilation. This meta-analysis of 38 studies of various smart ventilation systems with controls (on either CO 2, humidity, combined CO 2 and TVOC, occupancy, or outdoor temperature) shows that ventilation energy savings of up to 60 % can be obtained without compromising IAQ—and sometimes even improving it. In some cases, the smart ventilation strategies did not reduce energy use (showing an increase in energy use of up to 26 %). Occupant behavior was also examined in the review. The examination showed that occupants are rarely aware of the quality of their indoor air, particularly with regard to health issues, and do not necessarily operate the ventilation systems when recommended for optimal indoor air quality or energy efficiency. The applicability of a multi-zone approach is also demonstrated by studies showing a disparity in concentrations between different rooms of a home, and differences between single-zone and multi-zone modeling in residential buildings. Finally, this report summarizes ongoing developments in smart ventilation strategies and applications, including research into indoor air quality metrics, feedback on the lack of quality in ventilation installations, and source control (filtration and air cleaning) issues...|$|E
