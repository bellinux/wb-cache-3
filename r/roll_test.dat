Ward engineers noted that many of their competitors were using far fewer rivets. This resulted in new attention by all body manufacturers to the number and quality of fasteners. To Wayne engineers, simply {{increasing the number of}} fasteners (rivets, screws, and huckbolts) was not satisfactory. In their own tests, the joints were always the weak point under high stress loads regardless of the number of fasteners. They also noted how the continuous guard rails used on the sides tended to spread the stress away from the point of impact, allowing it to be shared and dissipated at portions of the body structure further away. Instead of {{trying to figure out how}} to make the fasteners do a better job, the engineers stood back and wondered how the design features of the guard rails could be expanded. The result was a revolutionary new design in school bus construction: continuous longitudinal interior and exterior panels for the sides and roofs.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} centres on surface initiated damage on back-up rolls whereby rolling contact fatigue cracks can propagate into the rolls potentially reaching the internal stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure and {{has sought to}} establish design criteria for avoiding such failures. The project objectives have been achieved by examining field evidence, determining the loading and tribological conditions at the work roll/back-up roll interface and investigating both theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms involved in rolling contact fatigue in this case. The presented rolling contact, fatigue and fracture mechanics model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards (i. e. relative safety) or downwards (i. e. potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases is related, quantitatively, to {{the properties of the}} roll material. After linking mechanics to microstructure, the influence of work <b>roll</b> <b>test</b> disc surface roughness on both the surface wear of and the interaction between wear and rolling contact fatigue at the surface of back-up <b>roll</b> <b>test</b> discs has been quantified using the results obtained from experimental simulations carried out on a rolling–sliding testing machine.

Motions were recorded for the free <b>roll</b> decay <b>tests</b> with and without the mainsail hoisted, in very light winds. The irregular wave tests were conducted again in very light winds with the vessel anchored. Motions were recorded with and without the mainsail hoisted, and with sails down for a range of wave headings. Wave direction was altered by roping the vesssel across the waves.

40|$|Surface {{thermal damage}} to hot mill work roll {{materials}} was investigated using twin-disc high-temperature laboratory test rig under {{conditions that are}} relevant to those of the early stands of a hot strip rolling mill. Two typical roll grades were tested: high speed tool steel and high-carbon high-chromium steel. Mill data were scaled down to suit the test sample dimensions and used to calculate the thermal cycle, contact times and contact pressure. A coupled thermomechanical model based on the finite element method was developed to predict the temperature distribution within the core and at the surface of the <b>roll</b> <b>test</b> samples. The predictions of the model showed good agreement with the temperatures measured using embedded thermocouples at several depths in the sub-surface of the <b>roll</b> <b>test</b> sample. After high temperature testing, the test samples were sectioned and prepared by conventional metallography for microscopic analysis. The thermally induced surface damage in the test samples were found to exhibit similar features to those observed in actual mill work rolls during service, especially the high-carbon-high-chromium steel, which showed a greater extent of surface thermal damage than the high speed tool steel test samples. Based on the results, it is concluded that the new test rig was proven capable of producing thermal damage in a consistent and reproducible manner and, thus, it can be regarded as a valuable off-line test resource to assist in further understanding the work roll surface deterioration phenomena...|$|E
