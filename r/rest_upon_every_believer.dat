[...] "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do righteous judgment?" [...] (Gen. 28:25). Great catastrophes as Noah's flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the earthquake that swallowed up Korah and his followers, the plagues of Egypt and the evil that came upon other oppressors of Israel are represented in the Bible as Divine judgments. The end of history, therefore, was conceived to be the execution of the divine judgment upon all the nations. This divine judgment is to take place, according to the Biblical view, on earth, and is intended to be particularly a vindication of Israel.|$|R

2500|$|Before Milton, [...] "the {{sense of}} regular rhythm... had been knocked into the English head so {{securely}} {{that it was}} part of their nature". The [...] "Heroick measure", according to Samuel Johnson, [...] "is pure... when the accent <b>rests</b> <b>upon</b> <b>every</b> second syllable through the whole line The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable", Caesural pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle {{and the end of the}} line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no enjambed endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included hypermetrical syllables (trisyllabic feet), inversion or slighting of stresses, and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line. Milton deemed these features to be reflective of [...] "the transcendental union of order and freedom". Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: “The English... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit”. Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did Oliver Goldsmith, Henry Pemberton, and Scott of Amwell, whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was [...] "displeasing to a nice ear". It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with Gray) began to appreciate [...] "the composition of Milton's harmony... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification".|$|R

The Vineyard worship style has also had a wide influence on the church.|$|R

50|$|Baptists {{say their}} only creed is the Bible. Historically, Baptists have tenaciously defended the {{privilege}} of <b>every</b> <b>believer,</b> with the illumination of the Holy Spirit, to interpret Scripture according {{to his or her}} own conscience.

2500|$|While {{there are}} a number of differing views amongst Christianity with regard to the {{significance}} or the requirement of a third temple being built in Jerusalem, according to the writers of the New Testament, the New Covenant (spoken of in Jeremiah [...] ) is marked by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the believer (Ezekiel [...] ) and that therefore <b>every</b> <b>believer's</b> body and <b>every</b> gathering of <b>believers</b> comprise the temple, or that the temple has been superseded.

5000|$|In the {{treatise}} [...] "Predestination Calmly Considered" [...] Wesley {{observed that}} believers might infer {{from their own}} experience of grace {{that it is impossible}} to finally fall away. Nevertheless, whatever assurance God might give to particular souls [...] "I find no general promise in holy writ, that none who once believes shall finally fall." [...] Scripture, and not personal experience or inferences drawn from it, states Wesley, must be decisive in the matter. In his treatise [...] "Serious Thoughts on the Perseverance of the Saints" [...] Wesley allows that the apostle Paul—and many believers today—were fully persuaded of their final perseverance. Nevertheless such an assurance does not prove that <b>every</b> <b>believer</b> will persevere or that <b>every</b> <b>believer</b> enjoys such assurance. Based on his reading of Hebrews 6:4, 6; 10:26-29; 2 Peter 2:20-21 and other NT texts, Wesley is persuaded that a true believer can make shipwreck of his faith and perish everlastingly.|$|R
