50|$|Clearance sales {{typically}} {{occur on}} clearance racks in brick-and-mortar stores. Stores typically place merchandise on a clearance <b>rack</b> and <b>mark</b> the price down until someone purchases the item. This clearance sale {{can be further}} enhanced by using banners and signs, both on the interior and exterior of the store. This process has been replicated on the internet. The defunct drop.com was the first clearance website to mimic a retail store clearance rack by allowing sellers to automatically mark down their items to a pool of consumers.|$|R

50|$|Tile {{tracking}} is {{a technique}} most commonly associated with the game of Scrabble and similar word games. It refers {{to the practice of}} keeping track of letters played on the game board, typically by crossing letters off a score sheet or tracking grid as the tiles are played. Tracking tiles can be an important aid to strategy, especially during the endgame when there are no tiles left to draw, where careful tracking allows each player to deduce the remaining unseen letters on the opponent's final <b>rack.</b> The <b>marking</b> off of each letter from a pre-printed tracking grid as the tiles are played is a standard feature of tournament play.|$|R
50|$|In {{his more}} than thirty years of artistic {{production}} he has become a joiner of painting, engraving and other facilities, using different mediums ranging from the simple canvas up tolarge <b>racks</b> of plaster, <b>marked</b> by brilliant combinations of painting and engraving. His assemblages are creations of three-dimensional pieces with knots and tensions that are interwoven in the area. His style is marked by an exquisite combination of colors and textures.|$|R
40|$|The Onsala Space Observatory has {{installed}} a modern digital backend for geodetic and astronomical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). This system {{consists of a}} Digital Base-Band Converter (DBBC) and a Mark 5 B+ recorder. From 2011 until late 2014 this new system was run for geodetic VLBI observations in paral- lel with the old system consisting of a <b>Mark</b> 4 <b>rack</b> and <b>Mark</b> 5 A recording system. Several of these observed ses- sions were correlated at the correlator in Bonn including both data sets. We present results from the analysis and comparison of these sessions. Both the original observed delays and corresponding geodetic parameters are com- pared. No significant differences are detected, for either the raw observations or for the geodetic parameters. This shows that the digital backend can be used operationally for geodetic VLBI observations...|$|R
2500|$|In {{each round}} {{at least four}} hands are played, with each player taking the {{position}} of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players don't physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a <b>rack</b> may be <b>marked</b> differently to denote the dealer.) ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{tests to}} observe signals {{transmitted}} by GLONASS (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System) satellites {{have been performed}} using the VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) technique. The radio telescopes involved in these experiments are Medicina and Onsala. The satellites transmit artificial radio signals that were considered {{in a similar way}} as natural radio signal that are emitted by natural radio sources. The signal strength of satellite signals is much stronger than the signal strength of natural radio signals, so in order to avoid overload of the telescope frontends, corresponding signal attenuation was applied. Observations at the stations were performed using the standard Mark 4 VLBI data acquisition <b>rack</b> and <b>Mark</b> 5 A disk-based recorders. The goals of the observations were to develop and test the scheduling, signal acquisition and processing routines to verify the full tracking pipeline, foreseeing the cross-correlation of the recorded data on the baseline Onsala-Medicina. The natural radio source 3 C 454. 3 was used as a calibrator before the beginning of the satellite observation sessions. We present results of a detailed analysis of the signal recorded at the Onsala telescope together with a first attempt of cross-correlation of data recorded on the baseline Onsala–Medicina. Further plans to perform new GNSS observations are in preparation, and a study to develop the VLBI dela...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} downstream migrating nonsalmonid fish to hydraulic conditions associated with river infrastructure is poorly understood. The response of downstream migrating adult European eels (Anguilla anguilla) to bar racks (12 ?mm bar spacing) angled on the {{vertical and horizontal}} planes under different flow regimes and during periods of darkness was assessed. Eels predominantly moved along the channel floor and wall, tending to follow routes where turbulence intensity was high. Time taken to approach the racks was greater than expected if fish had moved passively with the flow. Eels did not exhibit clear avoidance behaviour prior to encountering the <b>racks,</b> instead <b>marked</b> changes in behaviour occurred only after physical contact was made with the structure. No impingement or passage through the racks occurred, and passes per approach were high (98. 3 %), when vertical racks were angled 15 °, 30 ° or 45 ° relative to the flow. Impingement and passage through the racks only occurred when horizontally inclined racks were placed perpendicular to the flow. The time eels were impinged on the racks was negatively related to discharge when angled at 30 ° relative to the channel floor, and positively related when upright. Frequency of impingement was higher under low discharge (132. 9 ?±? 16. 6 ?l·s? 1). Impinged eels escaped from racks at approach velocities of 0. 90 ?±? 0. 05 ?m·s? 1. Passage through the upright rack was common under high discharge (278. 9 ?±? 36. 2 ?l·s? 1). The information presented will improve current fish passage criteria for European eels that are required to develop more effective fish passage facilities. <br/...|$|R
