40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} done to {{evaluate}} pacemaker therapy for severe <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> Background. Nonrandomized {{studies have suggested that}} permanent pacing might help control the symptoms of <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> The study goal was to evaluate the effect of permanent pacemaker implantation on syncope in patients with frequently <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> Methods. Patients with ≥ 6 lifetime episodes of syncope and with a tilt-table test that induced syncope or presyncope, as well as a relative bradycardia, were randomized to receive a dual-chamber pacemaker or not. The pacemaker prevented bradycardia and provided high-rate pacing if a predetermined drop in heart rate occurred (rate-drop response). The primary outcome was the first recurrence of syncope. Patients also completed a detailed diary recording presyncopal episodes. Results. A total of 284 patients was originally planned and a pilot study of 60 patients was initiated. At the planned first formal interim analysis of efficacy of the pilot study, an unanticipated large treatment effect was observed which fulfilled the prespecified criteria for early termination of the study. At that time, there were 54 patients enrolled, randomized evenly to no pacemaker or to pacemaker. In the no-pacemaker and pacemaker groups the mean ages were 40 and 46 years; 74 % and 70 % patients, respectively, were female. The baseline tilt-table test showed a slowest heart 1000 ms in 60 % of no-pacemaker patients and 72 % of pacemaker patients. There was a marked reduction in the postrandomization risk of syncope in pacemaker patients (relative risk reduction 85. 4 %, 95 % confidence interval 59. 7 % to 94. 7 %; 2 p = 0. 000022).

40|$|<b>Vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> is {{a common}} condition, usually {{associated}} with a benign prognosis. Most sufferers experience only occasional symptoms, and can be treated with reassurance and lifestyle advice. However, a minority of patients are debilitated by frequent fainting that can infringe on daily living, or even mimic sudden death. This has been termed "malignant" <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> because of the associated falls and physical injury. In these cases, a more interventional approach may be appropriate.

In the present study, we used short-term spectral analysis to evaluate autonomic control {{in subjects with}} <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> We assessed the ability of spectral indices of HR (heart rate) variability to predict tilt-test responses. A series of 47 outpatients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> and with positive responses to head-up tilt testing underwent a further study of RR variability during controlled breathing at rest and during tilt testing. During controlled breathing, RR interval variability of total power (TPRR; P < 0. 001), low-frequency power (LFRR; P < 0. 05), high-frequency power (HFRR; P < 0. 001) and HF expressed in normalized units (HFnu(RR); P < 0. 001) were all higher, and LF expressed in normalized units (LFnu(RR)) and LF/HF ratio were lower in subjects with vasovagal syncope than in controls (P < 0. 001). To assess the ability of spectral components of RR variability to predict tilt-test responses, we prospectively studied 109 subjects with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> The two normalized measures, HFn(RR) and LFnu(RR), determined during controlled breathing alone predicted a positive tilt-test response (sensitivity, 76 %; specificity, 99 %; positive predictive value, 96 %; and negative predictive value, 90 %). During tilting, subjects with vasovagal syncope had lower SBP (systolic blood pressure; P < 0. 05), LF component of peak SBP variability (LFSBP) and Unu(RR) than controls, and higher TPRR, HFRR, HFnu(RR) and alpha HF (P < 0. 001).

The primary hypothesis was that atenolol is not superior to placebo for the treatment of vasovagal syncope. BACKGROUNDThere is no definitive well-controlled analysis of the efficacy of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> METHODSThis is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Fifty patients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> were included (at least two episodes in the last year). A baseline tilt test was performed. Twenty patients (40 %) had a positive tilt test. Intravenous atenolol prevented a second positive tilt in five patients. The patients were randomized to receive either atenolol or a placebo (26 patients atenolol 50 mg/day, 24 patients placebo). The follow-up procedure lasted one year. The primary end point of the study was the time to first recurrence of syncope. RESULTSIn the intention-to-treat analysis, the group treated with atenolol had a similar number of patients with recurrent syncopal episodes as the placebo group. The Kaplan-Meier actuarial estimates of time to first syncopal recurrence showed that the probability of remaining free of syncope drops similarly in both groups {{and that there was no}} statistical difference between both curves (patients treated with atenolol vs. the placebo) with a log-rank test p value of 0. 4517.

40|$|Background—Etilefrine is an a-agonist {{agent with}} a potent {{vasoconstrictor}} effect, which is potentially useful in preventing vasovagal syncope by reducing venous pooling and/or by counteracting reflex arteriolar vasodilatation. The present multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled {{study was designed}} to evaluate the efficacy of this drug for the long-term management of patients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> Methods and Results—In the 20 participating centers, 126 patients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> (at least 3 episodes in the last 2 years) and a positive baseline head-up tilt response were randomly assigned to placebo (63 patients) or etilefrine at a dosage of 75 mg/d (63 patients) and were followed up for 1 year or until syncope recurred. The primary end-point of the study was the first recurrence of syncope. There were no differences between the 2 study groups in the patients ’ baseline characteristics. During follow-up, the group treated with etilefrine had a similar incidence of first syncopal recurrence to that of placebo group both in the intention-to-treat analysis (24 % versus 24 %) and in on-treatment analysis (26 % versus 24 %). Moreover, the median time to the first syncopal recurrence did not significantly differ between the 2 study groups (106 days in the etilefrine arm and 112 days in the placebo arm). Conclusions—Oral etilefrine is not superior to placebo in preventing spontaneous episodes of vasovagal syncope.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether the electrocortical activity underlying the anticipation and processing of emotional stimuli is enhanced in individuals with <b>recurrent</b> episodes of <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> (VVS). Methods: Fifteen fainters and 15 age-matched healthy controls were presented a S 1 –S 2 task, where {{the content of}} high-arousal pleasant and unpleasant, and neutral pictures (S 2) was forecasted by word cues (S 1).

The event-related potentials (ERPs) to S 1 and S 2 were measured to assess the processing of emotional warning stimuli and pictures. Results: Relative to controls, fainters showed smaller P 300 to warning cues anticipating emotional (and, particularly, unpleasant) pictures, and smaller SPN during anticipation of unpleasant pictures. No differences between groups were found with regard to ERP amplitudes during picture processing. Conclusions: These results suggest that the anticipation, rather than the processing, of aversive stimuli is altered in syncopal patients.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pacing therapy in treatment of patients with <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope,</b> to determine contribution of new therapeutic models in increasing its success, and to identify risk factors associated with a higher rate of symptoms after pacemaker implantation. Methods. A retrospective study included 30 patients with pacemaker implanted due to <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> in the Pacemaker Center, Clinical Center of Serbia, between November 2003 and June 2014. Head-up tilt test was performed to diagnose <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> Patients with cardioinhibitory and mixed type of disease were enrolled in the study. Results. Mean age was 48. 1 ± 11. 1 years and 18 (60 %) patients were men. Mean follow-up period was 5. 9 ± 3. 0 years. Primarily, implantable loop recorder was implanted in 10 (33. 3 %) patients. Twenty (66. 7 %) patients presented cardioinhibitory and 10 (33. 3 %) mixed type of <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> After pacemaker implantation, 11 (36. 7 %) patients had syncope.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial, which included 223 patients age 38. 6 (+/- 15. 4) years with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> and recognizable prodromal symptoms. One hundred and seventeen patients were randomized to standardized conventional therapy alone, and 106 patients received conventional therapy plus training in PCM. RESULTS: The median yearly syncope burden during follow-up was significantly lower in the group trained in PCM than in the control group (p = 0. 004). During a mean follow-up period of 14 months, overall 50. 9 % of the patients with conventional treatment and 31. 6 % of the patients trained in PCM experienced a syncopal recurrence (p = 0. 005).

40|$|Background—The {{effect of}} orthostatic stress on dynamic {{cerebral}} autoregulation (CA) in normal subjects and patients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> (VVS) is unclear. This study assessed the dynamic CA responses {{of both groups}} to head-up tilt. Methods and Results—Seventeen patients with recurrent VVS and 17 pair-matched control subjects underwent 70 ° head-up tilt for up to 30 minutes. Bilateral middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (CBFV) were measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound along with noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and transcutaneous and end-tidal CO 2 concentrations. Indices of dynamic CA were derived for periods before, during, and after tilt. Eight normal subjects who developed VVS in an identical protocol but who had no previous clinical history of syncope were also studied. CBFV and transcutaneous and end-tidal CO 2 levels declined significantly during head-up tilt in all groups (P, 0. 0001). Dynamic CA indices were unchanged throughout tilt in nonsyncopal control subjects and were initially unchanged in patients but deteriorated significantly in patients and syncopal control subjects in the minutes before (P 50. 027 and P 50. 012, respectively) and after (P 50. 002 and P 50. 007, respectively) syncope. Conclusions—Dynamic CA is preserved in patients and control subjects initially after head-up tilt.

40|$|During standing, {{both the}} {{position}} of the cerebral circulation and the reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output challenge cerebral autoregulatory (CA) mechanisms. Syncope is most often associated with the upright position and can be provoked by any condition that jeopardizes cerebral blood flow (CBF) and regional cerebral tissue oxygenation (cO(2) Hb). Reflex (vasovagal) responses, cardiac arrhythmias, and autonomic failure are common causes. An important defense against a critical reduction in the central blood volume is that of muscle activity ("the muscle pump"), and if it is not applied even normal humans faint. Continuous tracking of CBF by transcranial Doppler-determined cerebral blood velocity (V-mean) and near-infrared spectroscopy-determined cO 2 Hb contribute to understanding the cerebrovascular adjustments to postural stress; e. g., MAP does not necessarily reflect the cerebrovascular phenomena associated with (pre) syncope. CA may be interpreted as a frequency-dependent phenomenon with attenuated transfer of oscillations in MAP to V-mean at low frequencies. The clinical implication is that CA does not respond to rapid changes in MAP; e. g., there is a transient fall in V-mean on standing up and therefore a feeling of lightheadedness that even healthy humans sometimes experience. In subjects with <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope,</b> dynamic CA seems not different from that of healthy controls even during the last minutes before the syncope.

Immunoglobulin G activation of α 1 AR and β 1 / 2 AR was significantly higher in POTS compared with VVS and controls in cell-based assays. Eight, 11, and 12 of the 17 POTS patients possessed autoantibodies that activated α 1 AR, β 1 AR and β 2 AR, respectively. Pharmacological blockade suppressed IgG-induced activation of α 1 AR and β 1 / 2 AR. Eight of 17 POTS IgG decreased the α 1 AR responsiveness to phenylephrine and 13 of 17 POTS IgG increased the β 1 AR responsiveness to isoproterenol irrespective of their ability to directly activate their receptors. Postural tachycardia syndrome IgG contracted rat cremaster arterioles, which was reversed by α 1 AR blockade. The upright heart rate correlated with IgG-mediated β 1 AR and α 1 AR activity but not with β 2 AR activity. Conclusion These data confirm a strong relationship between adrenergic autoantibodies and POTS. They support the concept that allosteric-mediated shifts in the α 1 AR and β 1 AR responsiveness are important in the pathophysiology of postural tachycardia...|$|E
50|$|Many {{people who}} suffer from fainting during needle {{procedures}} report no conscious fear of the needle procedure itself, but a great fear of the <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> reaction. A study in the medical journal Circulation concluded that in many patients with this condition (as well as patients with the broader range of blood/injury phobias), an initial episode of <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> during a needle procedure may be the primary cause of needle phobia rather than any basic fear of needles. These findings reverse the more commonly held beliefs about the cause-and-effect pattern of needle phobics with <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b>|$|R

40|$|Neurocardiovascular {{diseases}} (NCVD) are {{the leading}} cause of death in the developed world and will remain so till 2020. In these diseases the pathologically changed nervous control of cardiovascular system has the central role. The actual NCV syndromes are neurogenic hypertension, representing the sympathetically mediated disorder, and <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope,</b> which is the vagally mediated disorders. <b>Vasovagal</b> <b>syncope,</b> the disease far from its etiological treatment, could benefit from recruiting and application of antimuscarinic drugs used in other parasympathetic disorders. The informational spectrum method (ISM), a method widely applied for the characterization of protein-protein interactions in the field of immunology, endocrinology and anti HIV drug discovery, was applied for the first time in the analysis of neurogenic hypertension and <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> therapeutic targets. In silico analysis revealed the potential involvement of apelin in neurogenic hypertension. Applying the EIIP/ISM bioinformatics concept in investigation of drugs for treatment of <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> suggests that 78 % of tested antimuscarinic drugs could have anti <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> effect. The presented results confirm that ISM is a promissing method for investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying pathophysiological proceses of NCV syndromes and discovery of therapeutics targets for their treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the {{relative}} therapeutic efficacy of propranolol, nadolol and placebo in <b>recurrent</b> <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope</b> (VVS). BackgroundCentral and peripheral mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of VVS. Propranolol, nadolol and placebo have different sites of action on central and/or peripheral mechanisms. It {{has not yet been}} clarified whether one of the aforementioned treatments is more efficient than the others in reducing clinical episodes and exerting a beneficial effect on patients’ well-being. MethodsWe studied 30 consecutive patients with recurrent VVS and a positive head-up tilt test. All were serially and randomly assigned to propranolol, nadolol or placebo. Therapy with each drug lasted three months. On the day of drug crossover, patients reported the total number of syncopal and presyncopal attacks during the previous period. They also gave a general assessment of their quality of life, taking into account: 1) symptom recurrence; 2) drug side effects; and 3) their personal well-being during therapy (scale 0 to 4 : 0 = very bad/discontinuation; 1 = bad; 2 = good; 3 = very good; 4 = excellent). At the end of the nine-month follow-up period, they reported whether they preferred a specific treatment over the others. ResultsSpontaneous syncopal and presyncopal episode recurrence during each three-month follow-up period was reduced by all drugs tested (analysis of variance [ANOVA]: chi-square = 67. 4, p < 0. 0001 for syncopal attacks; chi-square = 60. 1, p < 0. 0001 for presyncopal attacks) No differences were observed in the recurrence of syncope and presyncope among the three drugs. All drugs improved the patients’ well-being (ANOVA: chi-square = 61. 9, p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsPropranolol, nadolol and placebo are equally effective treatments in VVS, as demonstrated by a reduction in the recurrence of syncope and presyncope, as well as an improvement in the patients’ well-being...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Vasovagal</b> <b>Syncope</b> {{is a very}} {{frequent}} pathology; however, its physiopathology is {{not well}} known. Objectives: To verify the association between polymorphism T 102 C 5 HT- 2 A and <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> Methods: This casecontrol study included 106 patients, selected between March 2007 and December 2008. Fifty-three patients with history of syncope and positive head-up tilt test were compared to 53 patients without history of syncope, {{in relation to the}} presence of the polymorphism. Results: Of the patients studied, 11 (22 %) of the case group and 4 (8 %) of the control group had familiar history in first degree of syncope (p= 0. 03). In the analysis of the logistic regression, the homozygote 102 C (OR 4. 54; IC 95 %: 1. 14 [...] 0. 97; p= 0. 02) and the familiar history (OR 2. 86; IC 95 %: 0. 97 [...] 8. 39; p= 0. 03) were independently associated to a higher chance of developing <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope.</b> Conclusions: Patients with familiar history of syncope and homozygote 102 C have more chance of presenting <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope...</b>|$|R
