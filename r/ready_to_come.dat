5|$|The King and his {{advisers}} {{were concerned about the}} rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{shortly after}} {{becoming}} a United States citizen, Navratilova gave {{an interview to}} New York Daily News sports reporter Steve Goldstein, coming out as bisexual and revealing {{that she had a}} sexual relationship with Rita Mae Brown, but asked him not to publish the article until she was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out publicly. However, the New York Daily News published the article on July 30, 1981. Navratilova and Nancy Lieberman, her girlfriend at the time, gave an interview to Dallas Morning News columnist Skip Bayless, where Navratilova reiterated that she was bisexual and Lieberman identified herself as straight. Navratilova has since identified herself as a lesbian.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} through injury of Carr for {{the visit to}} Maribor, Ridgewell assumed the captaincy. Early in the game, Maribor had several shots off target, but they took a 29th-minute lead when Spector looped a casual back-pass which Colin Doyle missed entirely when {{attempting}} to clear. Dalibor Volaš picked up the loose ball and tapped into an empty net. The manner of the goal had a dampening effect on both players and fans. In the second half, Nikola Žigić and Wood were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on as substitutes when King used his strength to hold up a ball in midfield and played it through to Burke, who rounded Martin Milec and shot low past Jasmin Handanović. Only Žigić came on, to replace King. Both he and Wade Elliott missed chances, Žigić heading over the bar from close range and Elliott shooting straight at the goalkeeper when clean through. In the 79th minute, a long clearance was controlled by Morgaro Gomis who touched the ball to Elliott, possibly via a defender's arm. Elliott scored what proved the winning goal, hitting a clean volley from outside the area, which Handanovič partly blocked, {{but was unable to}} stop creeping underneath him.|$|E

25|$|Until Dieppe, LCAs {{had only}} been used in small numbers. The part of the naval plan, 'Outline for Operation' (JNO 1), for the Dieppe Raid that {{involved}} LCAs, and other minor landing craft, was {{much more complicated than}} any previous combined operations plan. In all other sizable raids beforehand coxswains had groped in the darkness and spent extra time while finding the correct landing beaches. Now a large number of flotillas of various landing craft types needed to coordinate their activities. The endless working-up practices and landing exercises carried out prior to the Dieppe assault were not confined to training infantry; they were also designed to shake down the crews of the landing craft flotillas. This was necessary because officers and ratings with LCA experience were not left idle after operations, but were reassigned to other pressing duties throughout the Navy. This massive raid required more trained crews and more flotilla coordination. The few experienced LCA hands available had to be supplemented by dozens of new crewmen collected by the RNVR. These {{had to learn how to}} approach a beach, ground on it, disembark troops, ease off the beach, and remain off shore within instant call, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> when necessary.|$|E
500|$|With reports speculating that Costa {{wanting to}} leave Chelsea, Costa affirmed on 2 June 2015 after Chelsea's post-season tour {{that he had}} no desire to leave London, saying, [...] "It's always a bit more {{difficult}} in the first season for adaptation, but I have no reason to leave this place, I love it, the fans love me, and I want to stay. It’s really good to come in the first season [...] and win two things [...] Next year I’ll be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back and, hopefully, win a couple more trophies." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{developments}} {{in the relationship between}} Brittany and Santana received considerable attention. John Kubicek of BuddyTV thought the plot was pointless, and said it [...] "boiled down to: I'm not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out. I'm ready. Now I'm not again." [...] He added, [...] "If you're going to have Santana question herself, at least show it and don't have it all happen off screen." [...] Both Hankinson and Respers France were impressed by the acting of both Morris and Rivera. Hankinson wrote, [...] "It feels like their relationship is developing organically", while Respers France commended Morris for Brittany's breakup scene with Artie, and Rivera for far surpassing her expectations.|$|E
60|$|This {{answer was}} so well managed; {{though there was}} not one word of truth in it, that one of the three ships, for the other two were not <b>ready,</b> {{resolved}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> away with us, and, in an evil hour for them, they did so.|$|R

500|$|When Paul is {{tormented by}} a group of {{homophobic}} men, Ivan steps in to rescue him. Brocklebank told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Ivan tells the men that if they have a problem they should take it out on him, not his boyfriend. This is the first time Ivan [...] "actually vocalises it" [...] and he is shocked because [...] "he has ever considered anyone to be his boyfriend before". Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father, but Ivan is not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out. The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation. Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew. Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because [...] "he's become scared about opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers' reaction." ...|$|E
500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2006, Led Zeppelin was {{inducted}} into the UK Music Hall of Fame. The television broadcasting of the event consisted of an introduction to the band by various famous admirers (including Roger Taylor, Slash, Joe Perry, Steven Tyler, Jack White and Tony Iommi), a presentation of an award to Jimmy Page and then a short speech by the guitarist. After this, rock group Wolfmother played a tribute to Led Zeppelin, playing the song [...] "Communication Breakdown". [...] During an interview for the BBC in connection with the induction, Page expressed plans to record new material in 2007, saying: [...] "It's an album that I really {{need to get out of}} my system...there's a good album in there and it's <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out" [...] and [...] "Also there will be some Zeppelin things on the horizon." ...|$|E

The aged Colonel {{was on his way to}} preach in a small church of the village and had just stepped from a Pacific Electric street car when these men knocked him down and ran over him, killing him through their careless driving, his death, occurring within twenty-four hours afterwards without his regaining [...] consciousness, was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky to the people of the State.

2500|$|The Comintern was {{involved}} in the revolutions across Europe in this period, starting with the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader, Béla Kun. Soon an official [...] "Terror Group of the Revolutionary Council of the Government" [...] was formed, unofficially known as [...] "Lenin Boys". The next attempt was the [...] "March Action" [...] in Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train from Halle to Leipzig. After this failed, the Communist Party of Germany expelled its former chairman, Paul Levi, from the party for publicly criticising the March Action in a pamphlet, which was ratified by the ECCI prior to the 3rd congress. A new attempt was made {{at the time of the}} Ruhr Crisis in spring and then again in selected parts of Germany in the autumn of 1923. The Red Army was mobilized, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the aid of the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where 200-300 Communists attacked police stations but were quickly defeated.
