5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E

5|$|The {{southbound}} carriageway of {{the bridge}} was closed on 1 December 2015 after steelwork defects had been discovered during routine inspections and traffic was restricted 7.5 tonne or less (public service vehicles excepted). On 23 December the Road Bridge reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). On 4 February, it was announced this had been pushed back to March, due to further problems with the truss end link pins in the southern towers, which required additional <b>remedial</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} quickly, but disaster almost struck {{when the}} aqueduct was first {{filled with water}} {{and one of its}} three arches began to buckle under the weight. <b>Remedial</b> <b>work</b> took several months, but the aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed, on 17 July 1761. It remained in use for more than 100 years, until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893, replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E

5|$|The lords of {{the manor}} of Swakeleys resided at Swakeleys House, though {{the house that}} stands today {{was not the first}} on the site. The {{original}} dated to around the 14th century and was probably constructed of wattle and timber. It was subject to extensive <b>remedial</b> <b>work,</b> much lamented at the time, while under the ownership of John Bingley. Bingley later sold the estate to Sir Edmund Wright, a future Lord Mayor of London, in 1629, and the current house was built of brick in 1638.|$|E
5|$|Though the M32 {{has a small}} traffic flow, {{it is one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} motorways in the region as it connects a number of key areas. As well as providing one of the few high-quality routes into the centre of Bristol, it is the only significant link from the M4 to the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. Parts of the M32 are reaching the end of their intended lifespan, leading to reduced speed limits and occasional closures for <b>remedial</b> <b>work.</b> Local residents have criticised the M32, complaining that it has severed communities and has an unacceptable noise level.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built for Sir Edmund Wright, who became Lord Mayor of London in 1640. The brick {{structure}} dates from between 1629 and 1638. In 1629, Wright purchased the grounds from John Bingley, who had undertaken extensive <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> on an existing 13th century structure in the grounds—probably timber-framed and wattle filled. Bingley's alterations {{were said to have}} been detrimental to the condition of the house and grounds. He was accused of driving away almost all the birds in the dovehouse, and of pulling up many healthy fruit-bearing trees from the orchard. The house had a moat, which Bingley filled in, believing the water to be unhealthy, at which point he also had a defensive brick wall built around the house.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{constructed}} following World War I {{in order to}} provide improved access to the ports at Avonmouth Docks, which had replaced Bristol Harbour as the major local centre for commercial shipping. Upon opening on 2 July 1926, it was the single most expensive road project in Britain, costing £800,000 (now about £ million). The construction posed a number of significant engineering challenges, including long and deep rock cuttings, a viaduct over the River Trym, and retaining walls against the gorge adjacent to the River Avon. Falling rocks have since been a problem along the Portway, particularly at the southern end close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, with concrete canopies constructed to prevent loose rock and assist with <b>remedial</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from donors, {{instead of being}} placed on static display {{it was decided to}} use the locomotive for charter trains out of York, {{as well as on the}} Scarborugh Spa Express, (York to Scarborough), although problems with its condition soon became apparent. Having failed on the delivery trip to Railfest, arriving on tow, after considerable <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> it then proceeded to fail numerous times in the following months, with the museum's engineering staff kept constantly busy effecting running repairs, but failed to spot critical faults that would delay the subsequent overhauls and restoration. From September 2004 until May 2005 it was put into the workshops for a heavy intermediate repair, the intention being to improve reliability and allow operation until its heavy general repair (overhaul) and restoration. The intermediate repair failed to improve reliability, and so the decision was taken to go ahead with the overhaul and restoration.|$|E
5|$|The Tameside Archaeology Survey {{began in}} 1990, {{carried out by}} the University of Manchester Archaeology Unit with more than £500,000 of funding from Tameside Council; £300,000 of this was {{directed}} towards the excavations at Buckton Castle. A topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record the castle earthworks and examine the possible outer bailey. As a result, the possible outer bailey was revealed to be a 20th-century feature and was probably related to nearby mining activity. On two occasions (1999 and 2002) illegal digging by unknown parties necessitated <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> and test pitting. In 2007 full-scale excavations at Buckton Castle began with the aim of establishing the date and history of the site. Across three seasons 2007, 2008, and 2010 trenches were opened across the ditch, the northern entrance, the gap in the circuit of earthworks on the south side, the interior, and the curtain wall.|$|E
50|$|A {{concrete}} berm {{was constructed}} {{along the north}} side of the rapids as <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> to protect fish spawning habitat from lower outflow through the rapids. This was due, in part, to an increase of water outflow from the three hydroelectric dams.|$|R
50|$|On 1 April 2015, {{passenger}} services were suspended indefinitely following {{a series of}} safety breaches where boom gates failed to drop for an approaching train. After three months of <b>remedial</b> <b>works,</b> a full passenger service returned to the line on 30 June 2015.|$|R
50|$|In {{the heavy}} rains of late July 2007 the Cole burst its banks and flooded the Covingham area of Swindon and Covingham Drive {{immediately}} {{to the south of}} the river. Extensive <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> were carried out {{to reduce the risk of}} future flooding.|$|R

25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{built with}} concrete girders was not built {{to withstand the}} use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. <b>Remedial</b> <b>work</b> had to be applied starting in the 1990s {{at a cost of}} $8 million per year. The <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was sand-blasted and repainted.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} findings of structural assessment and conditional monitoring of Light Rail Transit (LRT) Line. The assessment was aimed to measure the present condition in order to update the structure inventory including further detailed inspection and <b>remedial</b> <b>works.</b> The LRT elements investigated are stations, viaducts, piers, guideways and tunnels. The detailed investigation consist of test carried out includes petrographic, carbonation; electrode potential measurement, half cell testing, and concrete cover depth. The methodology of this study carried out through a study of project documents, a routine of preliminary structure assessment, detailed inspection, {{an analysis of the}} results of testing conducted upon the sample material from the affected structure and <b>remedial</b> <b>works.</b> The preliminary assessment shows that 10 Piers, an internal viaduct, 3 tunnels stretch, 6 stations and an abutment require further detailed inspection. The findings indicate {{that the majority of the}} defects monitored and tested at the viaduct structures, station and tunnels can be dealt with as part of routine maintenance with the exception of the defects noted at the Abutment P 21 / 40. All these elements have been subjected to design review and suitable <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> are recommended to be undertaken immediately to maintain the integrity of the structures. The study concluded the main causes of the extensive cracking and efflorescence on the abutment pilecap due to construction issues and detailing of abutment extension due to replacement piles, poor curing practices lead to early age plastic and thermal cracking, heat of hydration peak temperature rise during the concrete pour resulting in Delayed Etringite Formation (DEF) and cover provision beyond code recommendations.

25|$|In 1802 {{there was}} a partial failure, {{probably}} due to the sides bowing and transferring too much weight to the base where they joined to the deck. After <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> it failed again in 1812 and was reinforced with timber baulks. Although plans were prepared for replacement in stone, it survived until 1930, when the bottom plates were replaced by a wooden base, which was sealed by puddling.|$|E
25|$|Leeds 399 was {{the second}} {{passenger}} tram to arrive at Crich (being superseded only by Cardiff 131 a works car, and Leeds 345), however it faced a lengthy restoration, returning only to service in 1991.
