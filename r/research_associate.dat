40|$|Clinical {{research}} is often time-consuming {{and difficult to}} conduct in busy academic institutions. Previous studies have proposed methods to integrate undergraduate students {{as a means to}} increase research productivity. The authors aimed to describe the possibility to enhance emergency department research productivity at an academic emergency department in the United States, using undergraduate students in an Emergency Medicine <b>Research</b> <b>Associates</b> Program. The authors described the Emergency Medicine <b>Research</b> <b>Associates</b> Program curriculum and its implementation. We also conducted a retrospective study at a university-based emergency department from January 2005 to December 2014 to demonstrate the benefit of having an established Emergency Medicine <b>Research</b> <b>Associates</b> Program. The primary outcomes were number of Emergency Medicine <b>Research</b> <b>Associates</b> Program-related studies, number of enrolled patients, extramural/intramural funding, abstract presentations, and peer-reviewed publications. The authors analyzed the data using descriptive statistics. Over the 10 -year period, 110 Emergency Medicine <b>Research</b> <b>Associates</b> Program-assisted <b>research</b> studies were conducted, with <b>research</b> <b>associates</b> enrolling 46, 219 patients. These studies yielded a total of 31 peer-reviewed publications and 77 abstract presentations (13 international, 27 national, 37 state/regional). The Emergency Medicine <b>Research</b> <b>Associates</b> Program-related studies were used as pilot studies to obtain US$ 1, 751, 036 in extramural grant funding and US$ 31, 047 in intramural grant funding. The implementation of Emergency Medicine <b>Research</b> <b>Associates</b> Program can enhance emergency department clinical research productivity, and the inclusion of supplemental academic programs enhanced the undergraduate students' research experience...|$|R

The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, {{the head of the}} university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon (carbon-14 and carbon-11) from the cyclotron. While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that plant cells had the capacity to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis, through carbon fixation.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to the United States, Urey received an offer of a National Research Council fellowship to Harvard University, and also received an offer to be a <b>research</b> <b>associate</b> at Johns Hopkins University. He chose the latter. Before taking up the job, he traveled to Seattle, Washington, to visit his mother. On the way, he stopped by Everett, Washington, where he knew a woman called Kate Daum. Kate introduced Urey to her sister, Frieda. Urey and Frieda soon became engaged. They were married at her father's house in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1926. The couple had four children: Gertrude Bessie (Elisabeth), born in 1927; Frieda Rebecca, born in 1929; Mary Alice, born in 1934; and John Clayton Urey, born in 1939.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{they moved}} to St. Louis, Missouri, as Washington University offered both Carl and Gerty positions, {{although}} Gerty's rank and salary were much lower than her husband's. Despite her research background, Gerty was only offered a position as a <b>research</b> <b>associate</b> at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might harm her husband's career. Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a special allowance for Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the ISMB conference lie in a {{workshop}} for artificial intelligence researchers {{with an interest in}} molecular biology held in November 1991. The workshop was organised by American researcher Lawrence Hunter, then director of the Machine Learning Project at the United States National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NLM) in Bethesda, Maryland. A subsequent workshop on the same topic held in 1992, hosted by the NLM and the National Science Foundation, made it clear that a regular international conference for the field was required. Such a conference would be dedicated to molecular biology as a rapidly emerging application of artificial intelligence. Having successfully applied for grants from AAAI, NIH and the Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research, the first ISMB conference was held in July 1993, at the NLM. The conference was chaired by Hunter, David Searls (<b>research</b> <b>associate</b> professor at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and Jude Shavlik (assistant professor of computer science at University of Wisconsin–Madison) and attracted over 200 attendees from 13 countries, submitting 69 scientific papers.|$|E

She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981, and returned as a full professor two years later (staying 1983–87). In addition, she was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan (1985) and <b>research</b> <b>associate</b> at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin (1983–87). Early in her career, Warren became a proponent of on-the-ground research based on studying how people actually respond to laws in the real world.
