40|$|Mine {{design and}} {{operating}} practices in European countries may {{differ significantly from}} those accepted in Australian mines. This paper describes work carried out to review longwall productivity and gas management at one European mine extracting multiple seams 900 - 1000 metres below the surface. The longwall panel {{that is the subject}} of this paper is extracting a 215 metre wide face in the 1. 5 metre thick B seam, which is extracted prior to the main 3. 0 metre thick A seam to assist with degassing. Gateroads developed to access the B seam longwall are single entry, developed using road headers and supported with steel arches. Additional timber cog support is installed in an attempt to reduce <b>roadway</b> <b>closure</b> due to abutment loading. Due in part to statutory limits on gas concentration and air velocity, longwall production at this mine is presently restricted to an average rate of approximately 700 t/d. Mine management were reluctant to consider significant mine design changes, such as two heading gateroads, therefore the investigation focused on determining the extent to which ventilation and gas emission impacted on longwall production performance and recommending actions to improve ventilation and gas management to support increased longwall production. Ventilation and gas emission modelling was used to evaluate the impact of changes to the longwall ventilation arrangement and partial pre-drainage of the B seam. Modelling demonstrated that increase in longwall production rate to 2200 t/dis easily achievable. A range of additional actions that support further increases in longwall productivity are listed...|$|E

They {{may be used}} to provide information, such as delay and alternate route guidance, {{in the event of an}} incident, construction or a <b>roadway</b> <b>closure.</b> The effectiveness of CMS in managing freeway traffic, however, is a function of many factors including the number of CMS installations, the location of CMS, the messages displayed, varied traffic network characteristics, and drivers' response to incident conditions and CMS information. The objective of this thesis is to develop a CMS location planning model that can be used by transportation agencies to develop a CMS location plan that could achieve the largest long-term benefit to the system. This research is mainly motivated by the lack of systematic, robust and practical methods for locating CMS. State-of-practice methods rely mostly on the practitioner's experience and judgement. Other methods fail to incorporate reasonable driver behaviour models, consider time-varying demand, allow for computational efficiency on large networks, or consider the spatial variation of incidents on a traffic network. A new CMS location optimization model has been developed that is unique in both model realism and computational efficiency. The model incorporates several components to estimate incident delay, predict driver response, estimate network-wide benefit, and choose those CMS locations that would provide the most benefit. Deterministic queuing methods are used in conjunction with historic incident characteristics to approximate the delay impact of an incident with and without CMS. A discrete choice model is used to predict the rate at which drivers would switch from the incident route to a less congested alternative under CMS information. A network traffic assignment model is then incorporated in an attempt to estimate the resulting traffic induced by incidents. Genetic algorithms are utilized as an optimization technique to choose a set of CMS that would provide the most benefit. An extensive computational analysis was performed on both a hypothetical network and a segment of Highway 401 through Toronto. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the model's response to parameter and data estimation errors. The model was found to be most sensitive to the diversion model parameters. The model produced reasonable results with locations selected upstream of major freeway interchange diversion points. Considering the additional components included in the proposed model, and its ability to consider more location schemes, the proposed model may be considered superior to previous CMS location models...|$|E

50|$|Other {{temporary}} <b>roadway</b> <b>closures</b> included State Route 111, {{which was}} closed {{until the following}} evening, and State Route 74 and State Route 243 that were reopened later in the day. State Route 62, which crosses the Banning and Mission Creek Faults, was not immediately reopened due to buckled pavement. The California Aqueduct was damaged at several locations and water had to be diverted into a lake bed, and up to 80,000 people lost power {{for a portion of}} the day. Two fires in Riverside County caused serious damage, including a glass company that sustained $45,000 in damage, and several other brush fires.|$|R
50|$|In August 2010, in Medford, a 25 x 7 ft {{section of}} bridge deck on the {{northbound}} side partially collapsed due to age-related structural fatigue. The collapse forced the Massachusetts Department of Transportation {{to evaluate the}} remaining bridges along the corridor, eventually deciding to replace several bridges along the highway in a plan called 93 Fast 14. MassDOT {{set in motion a}} plan to replace the superstructure and concrete decks on 14 overpass bridges along that section of the interstate, using rapid bridge replacement methods. The $98.1 million project replaced bridges originally built in 1957 with a set of prefabricated modular concrete bridges in a series of weekend <b>roadway</b> <b>closures.</b> Traffic was diverted into a series of crossover lanes during construction. The main part of the project took place each weekend from June through August 2011,with the exception of the July 4th holiday weekend. One or two bridges were replaced each weekend during the construction time frame. The project was part of the Commonwealth's Accelerated Bridge Program.|$|R
40|$|Transportation Commission, {{is proposing}} to extend Metrolink {{regional}} passenger rail service approximately 1 mile east {{from its current}} terminus at the existing San Bernardino Metrolink Station/Santa Fe Depot (Depot) located at 1170 West 3 rd Street to new Metrolink commuter rail platforms proposed near the intersection of Rialto Avenue and E Street in the City of San Bernardino (City), San Bernardino County, California. The primary features of the Downtown San Bernardino Passenger Rail Project (DSBPRP or Project) include: construction of a second track, rail platforms, parking lots, a pedestrian overpass at the Depot, and an Omnitrans Bus Facility (bus facility); grade crossing improvements; railroad signalization; and <b>roadway</b> <b>closures.</b> The proposed Project’s secondary features include: construction of drainage improvements, utility accommodation, and implementation of safety controls. An Environmental Assessment (EA) /Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) was prepared for the Project and circulated for a 45 ‐day public review period from June 5, 2012, through July 19, 2012. The purpose of the EA/DEIR was to provide decision makers, public agencies, {{and the general public}} with an objective and informational document that fully discloses the potential environmental effects of the proposed Project. This document constitutes the Revised EA/Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Project. Thi...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} herein addresses traffic modelling and optimization of roadway infrastructure rehabilitation {{for urban}} roadway networks and travels of approximated origins and destinations, {{by means of}} an entropy-based formulation of their vehicular movements and the impact caused by scheduled <b>roadway</b> <b>closures.</b> The perceived level of disorder (entropy metric) caused by the numerous vehicle-traveller trips in the domain under examination is subsequently utilized for the formulation of a multi-year scheduled maintenance policy in order to minimize the entropy in the system. The entropy-based analysis takes into consideration not only vehicular movements and traffic counts between multiple origins and destinations, but also annual maintenance budgets and costs, maintenance priority rules, and resource constrains. The optimization goal is to improve on maintenance schedules and minimize the impact of road closures on travellers subject to preset annual budgetary and road closure constraints. The proposed entropy-based model is shown to perform particularly well and to be an effective tool for evaluating the distribution of traffic loads and for appraising the level of disorder caused in a network. Furthermore, the entropy-based method is shown to be an excellent metric for evaluating fluctuations in traffic and/or resource assignment distributions (especially equiprobability). These properties can in turn be used for devising annual maintenance schemes and for reducing traffic loads and maintenance impacts on traffic arteries of interest. The work presented is also compared to agent-based infrastructure impact analysis (most notably Ant Colony Optimization) previously reported on by the researchers...|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} to build Stage 1 of the envisaged Woden Parkway, which stretched from Adelaide Avenue to the Carruthers Street interchange, {{was awarded to}} Leighton Constructions in May 1966. By this stage, plans required 2 lanes per carriageway to be built instead, with provision for a third. The construction of the <b>roadway</b> required partial <b>closure</b> of Adelaide Avenue, with traffic diverted through existing thoroughfares in nearby suburbs.|$|R
40|$|The 2011 {{floods in}} Southeast Queensland had a devastating impact on many sectors {{including}} transport. Road and rail systems across all flooded areas of Queensland were severely affected and significant economic losses occurred {{as a result}} of <b>roadway</b> and railway <b>closures.</b> Travellers were compelled to take alternative routes because of road closures or deteriorated traffic conditions on their regular route. Extreme changes in traffic volume can occur under such scenarios which disrupts the network re-equilibrium and re-stabilisation in the recovery phase as travellers continuously adjust their travel options. This study explores how travellers respond to such a major network disruption. A comprehensive study was undertaken focusing on how bus riders reacted to the floods in Southeast Queensland by comparing the ridership patterns before, during and after the floods. The study outcomes revealed the evolving reactions of transit users to direct and indirect impacts of a natural disaster. A good understanding of this process is crucial for developing appropriate strategies to encourage modal shift of automobile users to public transit and also for modelling of travel behaviours during and after a major network disruption caused by natural disasters...|$|R
40|$|This project {{explores the}} user costs and {{benefits}} of winter road closures. Severe winter weather makes travel unsafe and dramatically increases crash rates. When conditions become unsafe due to winter weather, road closures should allow users to avoid crash costs and eliminate costs associated with rescuing stranded motorists. Therefore, the benefits of road closures are the avoided safety costs. The costs of road closures are the delays that are imposed on motorists and motor carriers who would have made the trip had the road not been closed. This project investigated the {{costs and benefits}} of road closures and found that evaluating the benefits and costs is not as simple as it appears. To better understand the {{costs and benefits of}} road closures, the project investigates the literature, conducts interviews with shippers and motor carriers, and conducts case studies of road closures to determine what actually occurred on <b>roadways</b> during <b>closures.</b> The project also estimates a statistical model that relates weather severity to crash rates. Although, the statistical model is intended to illustrate the possibility to quantitatively relate measurable and predictable weather conditions to the safety performance of a roadway. In the future, weather conditions such as snow fall intensity, visibility, etc., can be used to make objective measures of the safety performance of a roadway rather than relying on subjective evaluations of field staff. The review of the literature and the interviews clearly illustrate that not all delays (increased travel time) are valued the same. Expected delays (routine delays) are valued at the generalized costs (value of the driver’s time, fuel, insurance, wear and tear on the vehicle, etc.), but unexpected delays are valued much higher because they result in interruption of synchronous activities at the trip’s destination. To reduce the costs of delays resulting from road closures, public agencies should communicate as early as possible the likelihood of a road closure...|$|R
