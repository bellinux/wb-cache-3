5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} financial difficulties after having not received a significant <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, Centroid. However, the game helped set Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of financial difficulties, shifted its focus, and dropped the game. 2K Games stepped up and acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's development cycle, and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The Darkness was released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the company}} {{wanted to be}} sure that Greenside Mine {{contained}} sufficient reserves of ore to enable the large-scale mining operation which would make it profitable. They proposed taking a two-year option on the mine, during which they would refurbish the property and prove its resources, paying the landowners a dead rent of £90 per year. Many terms of the old leases they rejected as inappropriate to a large, modern mining company. They proposed a fixed <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> of 1/40th (5%) {{of the value of the}} lead concentrates, arguing that if the mine was worked on a large enough scale, these royalties would be quite satisfactory to the landowners.|$|E

According to author and music journalist Peter Doggett, neither the proposed EP format nor an expanded soundtrack album (containing other previously issued Beatles songs that appear in the 1968 film) was possible at the time, since [...] "both options would have denied George Martin his contractual right to appear alongside The Beatles – and robbed him of potentially the largest <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> of his career." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2003, Arsenal gave fans the {{opportunity}} to register their interest in a relaunched bond scheme. The club planned to issue 3,000 bonds for between £3,500 and £5,000 each for a season ticket at Highbury, then at Ashburton Grove. Supporters reacted negatively to the news; AISA chairman Steven Powell said in a statement: [...] "We are disappointed that the club has not consulted supporters before announcing a new bond scheme." [...] Though Arsenal never stated how many bonds were sold, they did raise several million pounds through the scheme. The club also extended its contract with sportswear provider Nike, in a deal worth [...] £55million over seven years. Nike paid a minimum of £1million each year as a <b>royalty</b> <b>payment,</b> contingent on sales.|$|E
500|$|Black Beauty was {{originally}} released only in Japan in 1973. It contained four side-long tracks spread across a double album, grouping the songs as medleys titled [...] "Black Beauty Part I", [...] "Black Beauty Part II", and so on, {{all of which}} credited Davis as the composer. He {{did not want the}} actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, [...] "Miles really felt that critics and people spent too much time in their mental mind, analyzing and talking for hours about something that really just is." [...] Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> for the actual composers. The Japanese release also mistakenly credited Michael Henderson—Davis' other bassist during this period—rather than Holland in the liner notes.|$|E
500|$|Simone {{was known}} for her temper and {{frequent}} outbursts. In 1985, she fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she [...] "tried to kill him" [...] but [...] "missed". In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with an air gun after the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration. According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on. All this was only known to {{a small group of}} intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography Break Down and Let It All Out written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this in 2004, after her death. [...] Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography, Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier, at gunpoint, to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.|$|E

500|$|Two {{years after}} signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near {{collapse}} of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors {{to call in}} their loans to W.E. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, {{if he did not}} meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to [...] "deal with the bankers" [...] to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison, and Thompson-Houston).|$|E
500|$|Rumors of {{a multimillion-dollar}} bidding war over Jackson's {{recording}} contract began to circulate in spring 1991. Jet magazine reported: [...] "A recording company has offered {{in excess of}} $50 million to sign superstar Janet Jackson to a recording contract, making the 24-year-old singer/songwriter/dancer/actress the key player {{in one of the}} hottest bidding wars among today's major record companies." [...] Reports indicated that Capitol, Virgin and Atlantic were all bidding for Jackson's contract, as her ties to A would soon expire; by March, she had signed with Virgin. The New York Times declared [...] "Janet Jackson has signed what {{is believed to be the}} most lucrative contract in the history of recording. The 24-year-old singer, songwriter and actress signed an exclusive contract with Virgin Records it was announced yesterday." [...] Her new contract guaranteed a twenty-two percent <b>royalty</b> <b>payment,</b> in addition to her then-historic signing bonus. Chuck Philips of the Los Angeles Times reported that it had been the largest bidding war in recent memory and that [...] "ne reason the bidding was so heavy, various industry observers have noted, was that Jackson-at just 24-is still a relatively fresh face on the pop scene and that her dance-pop style is ideal for today's pop/video climate." [...] In addition, her potential as an international superstar proved to be the primary motivation for the label's investment. Jeff Ayeroff, co-managing director of Virgin in the US stated: [...] "Janet is a world-class artist and we expect her growth to be enormous." [...] Chairman Richard Branson spoke with Jackson privately to seal the deal. He commented: [...] "A Rembrandt rarely becomes available... When it does, there are many people who are determined to get it. I was determined." ...|$|E

[...] In April 1857, Bogardus sued the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of New York, claiming a patent infringement (#7,337). [...] He cited that he was entitled to a <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> of $289, plus actual damages of $20,000.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how technology transfer within U. S. multinational firms changes {{in response to}} a series of IPR reforms undertaken by 16 countries over the 1982 - 1999 period. Analysis of detailed firm-level data reveals that <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> for technology transferred to affiliates increase at the time of reforms, as do affiliate R&D expenditures and total levels of foreign patent applications. Increases in <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> and R&D expenditures are concentrated among affiliates of parent companies that use U. S. patents extensively prior to reform and are therefore expected to value IPR reform most. For this set of affiliates, increases in <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> exceed 30 percent. Our results collectively imply that U. S. multinationals respond to changes in IPR regimes abroad by significantly increasing technology transfer to reforming countries. ...|$|R

Gas <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> are determined by multiplying the gross sales value by a royalty rate. Disagreement over the interpretation of key values in the formula has led to several lawsuits between MMS and the gas industry. With the deregulation of the gas market, determining the sale of gas produced and sold from OCS leases has become more difficult. To help resolve these pricing issues, MMS is pilot-testing a royalty-in-kind program.
