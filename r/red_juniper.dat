Before ranchers and farmers began altering the landscape, the area was once part of a vast grassland. Bison, deer, and pronghorn grazed on tall native grasses. However, because of overgrazing, land clearing, and the suppression of wildfires, these native grasses have been mostly replaced by invasive weeds and tough, woody trees, including Texas live oak, Texas red oak, <b>red</b> <b>juniper</b> (red cedar), and mesquite.|$|E

5000|$|The main form {{of shelter}} {{used by the}} Kiowa was the tipi or skin lodge. Tipis were made from bison hides shaped and sewn {{together}} in a conical shape. Wooden poles called lodge poles from [...] in length are used as support for the lodge. Lodge poles are harvested from <b>red</b> <b>juniper</b> and the lodgepole pine. Tipis {{have at least one}} entrance flap as well as smoke flaps at the top, allowing the construction of a fire pit within. The floor of the tipi is lined with animal pelts and skins for warmth and comfort. The tipi is designed to be warm inside during the cold winter months and cool inside during the warm summer. Tipis are easily collapsed and can be raised in only minutes, making it an optimal structure for a nomadic people like the Kiowa and other great plains Indian nations. The poles of the tipi were used to construct a travois during times of travel. Hide paintings often adorn the outside and inside of the tipis, with special meanings attached to certain designs.Before the introduction of the horse to North America, the Kiowa and other plains peoples used domestic dogs to carry and pull their belongings. Tipis and belongings as well as small children were carried with the use of travois, a frame structure utilizing the tipi poles and pulled by dogs and later horses. The introduction of the horse to Kiowa society revolutionized their way of life. Horses were acquired by raiding rancheros south of the Rio Grande into Mexico as well as from raiding other Indian peoples who already had horses such as the Navajo and the various Pueblo people. The horse allowed them to pull larger loads, hunt more game, hunt game easier, and travel longer and farther. The horse also transformed the Kiowa into powerful and skilled mounted warriors who performed long distance raids on their enemies. The Kiowa were considered among the finest horsemen in history along with other plains Indians such as the Comanche and Cheyenne. Horses became {{a vital part of the}} Kiowa economy and a man's wealth was measured primarily by size of his horse herd with particularly wealthy individuals having herds numbering in the hundreds. Horses became a much targeted object during raids, capturing and stealing horses from enemies was considered a great honor to Kiowa warriors and often served as a rite of passage for young warriors. Horses were adorned with body paint from the medicine man for ritual and spiritual purposes such as good fortune and protection during battle. Kiowa horses were often decorated with beaded masks (sometimes with bison horns attached to the sides) and feathers in their manes. In addition to horses, mules and donkeys were also used as means of transportation and wealth however they were not as esteemed.|$|E

40|$|The {{ecosystem}} of {{the mountain}} Ivan i Madh, with an altitude of 1768 m, is encompassed by Qafa e Zvezdes at an elevation of 1099 m and Zaroshka's hills with a height of 890 m to the north, by Mount Ivan I Vogel with an altitude of 1365 m to the east, by the river of Devoll and the Pojan field to the west, and by the Dumbrava hills to the south. Prespa {{is located in the}} sub zone of the eastern mountainous Mediterranean climate, characterized by cold winters with relatively long freezing periods and not very dry summers. Some key indicators of the climate are: annual average temperature 11. 2 ° C, maximal temperature in the summer ranges 32 °C whereas the minimal 1 - 2 °C. Absolute minimum temperature is found in January and ranges at around - 16 °C. Commonly there are snow-covered areas for over 4 months in the eastern and northern regions. Precipitation in the form of rain reaches values of up to 750 - 800 mm per year. Snowfall values range from a few cm to over 1 m, with a duration of several days in the western slope and up to several weeks in eastern and northern slopes. A wide variety of forests, bushes and grasses lie in the phytoclimatic areas of Castanetum, Fagetum and Alpinetum. Flora, represented by the area of Castanetum, starts from the lake shore (altitude of 850 m) to a height of 1. 250 m, in which forest territory lies mainly in hills. The main types of trees are oaks such as: Bunga (Quercus petraea), Qarri (Q. cerris), bulgeri (Q. Trojan), shparthi (Q. frainetto), and bungebuta (Q. pubescentis); also accompanied by Frashëri, panja {{of the mountain}}, mëlleza, and a large prevalence of shkaza. There is also a rare existance of caraci plants (Celtis tournefortii) as well as venja (Juniperus excelsa). Specific of the area are the soft Chestnut, cultivated in the village of Golloberde, acacia, an introduced plant with relatively low areal, as well as Bush and the following types of oak: (Quercus Petrea, Quercus cerris, Quercus pubescens etc. In forests, there can be found plants endemic to the Balkans, such as: Centaurea prespana, Dianthus perviformis, Centaurea rudifula, and other endangered ones. Bushes that go along with oaks are: first of all hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and less juniper, hazel, cornel, and hawthorn. Bushi (Bucsus semprevirensis) is characteristic of the ecosystem of mount Ivan. It is found in groups and covers an enormous area. Also it is located at the borders of 45 % of the surface vegetation area. In the area of Fagetum, beech (Fagus sylvatica) can be found, as well as mountain maple, mellezë, etc. at a lesser rate. Special value this is given to this vegetation by the presence of wild hazelnut (Corylus colurna). Beech forests extend up to a height of 1. 700 m on Ivan Mountain. The mountain is covered with rich medical plant resources such as: red flowers (Papaver rhoeas), orchids (Orchis mascula), mullaga (Malva sucvestris), <b>red</b> <b>juniper</b> (Juniperus ohycedrus), ballsani flower (Hyperikum perforatum), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), chamomile (Chamomolla recutita), birch (Betula pendula), mountain tea (Sideritis roeseri), wild rose (Rosa Kanina), blackberries (Rubus fruticosus), gorica (Pyrrus amygdaliformis), and nettles (Urtica dioica).
