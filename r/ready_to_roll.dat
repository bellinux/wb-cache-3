[...] "Previously, I had {{painstakingly}} rehearsed the actors so there was complete understanding as to what each was to accomplish in each scene. This is most important; there is nothing worse than to be on the set and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll,</b> only to find that director and actor have different views as to how the scene is to be done. Thanks to pre-production planning and rehearsals, there was no time wasted on the set in haggling and making decisions." ...|$|E

She added that Meredith, [...] "has gone through so much that she’s earned an entire hour of TV completely focused on just her." [...] Furthermore, the site praised Washington noting {{the portion of the}} episode, that goes on in complete silence as seen through Meredith’s point of view, calling it [...] "especially powerful {{because of the lack of}} sound". Lauren Hoffman from Cosmopolitan lauded the episode for its [...] "amazingly effective storytelling" [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between Meredith and Alex. She further wrote that, [...] "if nothing else, Grey's reminds us that there's no upper limit to the amount of suffering a single person can go through, so just grab your people and get <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> with it" [...] Praising Washington she noted that, [...] "Denzel and Grey's despite being disparate, could bring each other to new creative heights." ...|$|E

[...] "We've got a government in a box, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> in", said American commander Stanley McChrystal. The capture of Marjah was intended {{to serve as a}} prototype for a new type of military operation. The Afghan government had pledged to hold any territory seized in the Taliban heartland during the assault. Utilities engineers were on hand to ensure power and water supplies were maintained.|$|E

60|$|Xerxes, after ravaging {{and burning}} the town, {{took up a}} {{position}} upon a hill opposite to the citadel, and there he had engines constructed to throw enormous arrows, on which tow that had been dipped in pitch was wound. This combustible envelopment of the arrows was set on fire before the weapon was discharged, and a shower of the burning missiles thus formed was directed toward the palisade. The wooden walls were soon set on fire by them, and totally consumed. The access to the Acropolis was, however, still difficult, being by a steep acclivity, up which it was very dangerous to ascend {{so long as the}} besiegers were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> down rocks upon their assailants from above.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{some of you}} {{may have}} read a book called 'Kenneth; or the Rear-Guard of the Grand Army' of Napoleon. If so, you will {{remember}} how the two Scotch children found in Russia were taken care of by the French soldiers and prevented as far as possible from suffering from the horrors of the terrible Retreat. One of the soldiers, a Breton, often tried to make them forget how cold and hungry they were by telling them tales of his native country, Brittany, which is full of wonderful things. The best and warmest place round the camp fire was always given to the children, but even so the bitter frost would cause them to shiver. It was then that the Breton would begin: 'Plouhinec is a small town near Hennebonne by the sea,' and would continue until Kenneth or Effie would interrupt him with an eager question. Then he forgot how his mother had told him the tale, and was obliged to begin all over again, so the story lasted a long while, and {{by the time it was}} ended the children were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>rolled</b> up in what ever coverings could be found, and go to sleep.

60|$|The {{beginning}} of the wondrous transformation, the dropping of the day's curtain, was for me a rare and perfect moment. As the golden splendor of sunset sought out a peak or mesa or escarpment, I gave it a name to suit my fancy; and as flushing, fading, its glory changed, sometimes I rechristened it. Jupiter's Chariot, brazen wheeled, stood <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> into the clouds. Semiramis's Bed, all gold, shone from a tower of Babylon. Castor and Pollux clasped hands over a Stygian river. The Spur of Doom, a mountain shaft as red as hell, and inaccessible, insurmountable, lured with strange light. Dusk, a bold, black dome, was shrouded by {{the shadow of a}} giant mesa. The Star of Bethlehem glittered from the brow of Point Sublime. The Wraith, fleecy, feathered curtain of mist, floated down among the ruins of castles and palaces, like the ghost of a goddess. Vales of Twilight, dim, dark ravines, mystic homes of specters, led into the awful Valley of the Shadow, clothed in purple night.|$|E
60|$|The steam gear clattered, stopped, clattered again; and the helmsman's eyeballs {{seemed to}} project out of a hungry face as if the compass card behind the {{binnacle}} glass had been meat. God knows how long he had been left there to steer, as if forgotten by all his shipmates. The bells had not been struck; {{there had been no}} reliefs; the ship's routine had gone down wind; but he was trying to keep her head north-north-east. The rudder might have been gone for all he knew, the fires out, the engines broken down, the ship <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> over like a corpse. He was anxious not to get muddled and lose control of her head, because the compass-card swung far both ways, wriggling on the pivot, and sometimes seemed to whirl right round. He suffered from mental stress. He was horribly afraid, also, of the wheelhouse going. Mountains of water kept on tumbling against it. When the ship took one of her desperate dives the corners of his lips twitched.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, comrade," [...] another said. [...] "I {{was with my}} regiment, the 5th, at Badajoz. It was a strong place. Phillipson, who was in command, was a {{thoroughly}} good officer. He had strengthened the defences in every way, and the garrison was 5000 strong. We reckoned we could hold out for three months anyhow. 15,000 men sat down before us on the 17th of March, and began to open trenches against a strong outlying fort. We made several sorties, and did all we could to hinder them, but on the 25th they stormed the fort. It was defended desperately, but in an hour it was all over. Still, that was only an outlying work. Soult {{was known to be}} advancing to our relief; but he waited to gather as large a force as possible, believing, reasonably enough, that we could hold out a month, while we still calculated on holding out for three. The English worked like demons, and on the 6th of April they had made two breaches. We had prepared everything for them. We had planted mines all over the breaches. We had scores of powder barrels, and hundreds of shells <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> down. We had guns placed to sweep them on both flanks and along the top. We had a stockade of massive beams in which were fixed sword blades, while in front of this the breach was covered with loose planks studded with sharp iron points.|$|E
40|$|While China is {{frequently}} {{assumed to have}} a number of “levers” it could use to control North Korea, in fact, its policies across the board—from security to economics—are much more limited. An examination of actions in March and April 2017, when China was confronted with the destabilizing prospect of unilateral U. S. military action against North Korea, and apparently responded by taking more vigorous steps with Pyongyang, provides some useful insight. In addition to describing personal experience along the border in April 2017, this article sifts, weighs, and contextualizes assertions about the posture and readiness of Chinese troops along the Sino-Korean border during the crisis period. The conventional wisdom outside of the PRC today seems to assume that mobilizing troops near the border signals to North Korea that China is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> either <b>roll</b> in or <b>to</b> block the flow of refugees into China. Too often, analysis which highlights assertions of Chinese mobilization in the border region ignore the signals already being sent by the Chinese military press (as opposed to Chinese foreign affairs periodicals) with respect to North Korea, and the documentation of open-source data on related Chinese military drills. Finally, if China was, in fact, using troop movements to intimidate North Korea, how would we know a) that troop movements were in fact happening and b) that China intended them to impress DPRK...|$|R
