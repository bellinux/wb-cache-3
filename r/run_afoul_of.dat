In August 2016, BT Group {{filed a lawsuit against}} Valve stating that Steam's client infringes on four of their patents, which they state are used within the Steam Library, Chat, Messaging, and Broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E

25|$|Adulterous office romances {{are widely}} {{considered}} to be unhelpful to business and work relationships, and superior-subordinate relationships are banned in 90% of companies with written policies regarding office romance.

Firings nonetheless often occur on the basis of charges of inappropriate office conduct.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a concern in the {{administration}} over whether {{the use of military}} forces to support and carry out the evacuation was permitted under the newly passed War Powers Act. Eventually White House lawyers determined that the use of American forces to rescue citizens in an emergency was unlikely to <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the law, but the legality of using military assets to withdraw refugees was unknown.|$|E

25|$|Due to redefined and reinterpreted {{copyright}} laws, {{and increased}} financial interests, {{some forms of}} collage art are significantly restricted. For example, {{in the area of}} sound collage (such as hip hop music), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the de minimis doctrine as a defense to copyright infringement, thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on fair use or de minimis protections, and toward licensing. Examples of musical collage art that have <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> modern copyright are The Grey Album and Negativland's U2.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{became a}} major industry, {{especially}} in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream. Barrier islands, such as Kiawah and Hilton Head, were developed as retirement communities for wealthy outsiders. The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in {{the billions of dollars}} of losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21–22, 1989. Charleston was more used to hurricanes; historical preservation groups immediately stepped in to begin salvage and reconstruction, with the result that one year after Hugo, the city was virtually returned to normal.|$|E
25|$|Since {{probation}} {{is a form}} of punishment, {{once the}} sentence of probation has commenced, the court will <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the double jeopardy clause if it increases the penalty. Probation's primary objective is to protect society by rehabilitating the offender. A person placed on probation is considered a probationer of the court as a whole, and not that of a particular judge thereof. When a defendant is placed on probation, he expressly agrees to be subject to supervision appropriate to a probationer, to avoid the more onerous regimen of a prisoner; accordingly, the defendant retains those rights of an ordinary citizen that are compatible with probationary status, although certain rights, such as the right against self-incrimination, are impaired. There is no requirement that probation must be granted on a specified showing. Probation is considered a privilege and not a right. The action of a district court in refusing to grant probation is not reviewable on appeal except possibly for arbitrary or capricious action {{on the part of the}} District Court amounting to abuse of discretion.|$|E

500|$|The entire league {{was once}} again based in Canada for the 1996 CFL season, with Larry Smith {{describing}} the move as a [...] "retrenchment". This did not stem the troubles the teams were facing. With no expansion fee revenue to buoy them, eight of the nine Canadian teams would lose money in 1996. The Rough Riders disbanded {{at the end of}} the season and the Stampeders declared bankruptcy after Ryckman was fined $250,000 for stock manipulation by the Alberta Securities Commission. After the indictment of McNall, Ryckman was the second major architect of expansion to <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the law.|$|E
500|$|Silesius's poetry {{directs the}} reader to seek a path toward a desired spiritual state, an eternal stillness, by eschewing {{material}} or physical needs and the human will. [...] It requires an understanding of God that is informed by the ideas of apophatic theology and of antithesis and paradox. [...] Some of Silesius's writings and beliefs that bordered on pantheism or panentheism caused tensions between Silesius and local Protestant authorities. [...] However, {{in the introduction to}} Der Cherubinischer Wandersmann, he explained his poetry (especially its paradoxes) within the framework of Catholic orthodoxy and denied pantheism which would have <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> Catholic doctrine.|$|E
500|$|As a result, {{the city}} has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height {{restrictions}} on buildings and structures in Grant Park; structures over [...] tall are not allowed in the park, {{with the exception of}} bandshells. However, within Millennium Park, the [...] Crown Fountain and the [...] Jay Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restrictions, because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures. Shorter structures do not <b>run</b> <b>afoul</b> <b>of</b> the height restrictions. The Harris Theater, which lies between the North Pavilions, was built mostly underground to avoid the restrictions. The Northwest Pavilion, tallest of the four, is three stories high; the Northeast Pavilion is two stories, and the South Pavilions are each one story.|$|E
