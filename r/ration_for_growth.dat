40|$|Feeding of {{balanced}} <b>ration</b> {{is essential}} <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> and reproduction. Breeding efficiency {{appears to be}} correlated with concentrations of trace elements (Kumar and Vadhve, 1984). In recent years, the interest in nutritional significance of trace minerals in animal reproduction has markedly increased. The imbalance or deficiency of trace elements leads to inactive ovaries and repeat breeding in dairy animals. (Hidiroglou, 1979). Therefore, {{the present study was}} aimed to relate the blood profile of these compounds (Cu, Co, Zn, and Iron) with fertility status in Surti buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile Tapes philippinarum (Adams and Reeve) were reared {{for three}} weeks on {{different}} rations of Chaetoceros neogracile which were either centrifuged and stored or fed together with the culture medium. Algal rations were adjusted daily in order to feed constant weight-specific daily rations. Growth of T. philippinarum fed the concentrate of C. neogracile was maximal at a daily ration of 1 % (algal dry weight per clam live weight). T. philippinarum fed single or mixed diets of C. neogracile and Isochrysis sp. (clone T-Iso) directly from the algal cultures, maximized growth at a ration of 1, 3 % day - 1. Higher growth rates and gross growth rates efficiencies were obtained with C. neogracile fed together with the culture medium. A set of grazing experiments showed that the incipient limiting concentration was about 26 C. neogracile cells µ 1 - 1. Measurements of cell concentration during the growth tests demonstrated a discontinuous feeding activity in the treatments receiving the optimal <b>ration</b> <b>for</b> maximum <b>growth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Calves need high {{concentrations}} of protein with high protein quality in their feed <b>ration</b> <b>for</b> proper <b>growth.</b> Soya bean meal is widely used {{in the world as}} a protein feed of good nutritional quality but the ethics around the cultivation of the beans are often questioned. Home grown or locally produced feeds, such as nitrogen fixating forage and grain legumes as well as rapeseed products, are shown to give less contribution to environmental problems than imported feeds. The objective {{of the study was to}} compare dry matter intake, live weight gain, feed efficiency and profitability in calves fed two levels of forages with high inclusion of red clover together with two different amounts of rapeseed cake vs. soya bean meal. Soya bean meal gave the highest live weight gain and the best profitability. However, a greater amount of rapeseed together with clover/grass silage also gave a good live weight gain and profitability, close to the results for soya bean meal...|$|R
40|$|Two assays were {{accomplished}} being, both using {{a randomized}} block design: Assay 1 the aimed was {{to evaluate the}} blood parameters of weaned recently pigs and receiving rations with and without probiotic. Twenty pigs with body weight of 6. 99 +/- 0. 42 kg were used and were collected samples of blood to the 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after wean, for determinations of the bool parameters. Assay 2 the objective {{was to determine the}} <b>rations</b> digestibility <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> swine supplemented or not with probiotic in the rations. The rations and the ages of the animals influenced most of the variables of the blood parameters. The probiotic didn't alter the ration digestibility to exception for mineral matter. It is ended that the blood parameters were altered {{for the use of the}} probiotic and the age of the animals, both emphasized to challenges happened after wean and the mineral matter was better taken advantage with the use of the probiotic...|$|R
40|$|IT HAS been {{reported}} by Dann and Handler (1941) that the niacin con-tent of eggs increased during incubation and that hatched chicks contained ten times as much niacin as the incubated egg. From this finding, these workers suggested that the hatched chick is able to synthe-size niacin and is therefore independent of a dietary supply of this vitamin. Snell and Quarles (1941) reported that niacin is synthesized by the chick embryo in amounts sufficiently great so that the hatched chick contains over twenty times the niacin content originally present in the unincubated egg. Briggs et al. (1942) reported that grow-ing chicks required approximately 8. 17 mg. of niacin per pound of <b>ration</b> <b>for</b> op-timal <b>growth</b> and <b>for</b> the prevention of chick "black tongue. " In later work, Briggs and co-workers (1943) described the typical symptoms of a niacin defi-ciency in chicks and reported that chicks fed the particular basal ration synthe-sized approximately one-sixth of their total niacin requirement.

40|$|The in vivo {{dry matter}} {{digestibility}} (DMD) of whole and cracked barley grain in cattle and sheep {{was compared to}} validate laboratory estimates of grain DMD. Mean (&SD) DMD of cracked barley fed to sheep and cattle was not significantly different, (81. 8 + 1. 7 % v 82. 2 + 2. 3 %), but DMD of whole grain fed to cattle (52. 9 t 3. 4 %) was lower than when fed cracked to cattle (82. 2 + 2. 3 %) and whole or cracked to sheep (83. 1 f 2. 5 % & 8 1. 8 21. 7 %). The DMD of Bandicoot oats, a high fat content grain, and triticale, a low fat content grain was determined in vivo in cattle and sheep and estimated by laboratory analysis. Mean DMD of Bandicoot oats {{was found to be}} 81. 5 + 5. 0 % in sheep, 79. 9 & 3. 9 % in cattle and 87. 2 % by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy using standard grain calibrations obtained by FEEDTEST from pepsin cellulase and in vivo investigations. The mean DMD of triticale was found to be 84. 6 + 4. 5 % in sheep, 78. 4 & 3. 0 % in cattle and 88. 9 % by NIR. Bandicoot oats and triticale were also compared as the main component (67 %) of a feedlot <b>ration</b> <b>for</b> steers. <b>Growth</b> rates, carcass weights and fat cover were similar; however the intake of steers fed triticale was restricted to the appetite of steers fed Bandicoot oats...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{flexibility}} {{is critical in}} determining fitness. As conditions change during ontogeny, continued responsiveness is necessary {{to meet the demands}} of the environment. Studies have shown that subsequent ontogenetic periods of development can interact with one another and shape developmental outcomes. The role genetic variation within populations plays in shaping these outcomes remains unclear. Four full-sub families of zebrafish Danio rerio were raised under for dietary regimes: high food <b>rations</b> <b>for</b> 60 days (HH), low food <b>rations</b> <b>for</b> 60 days (LL), high food <b>rations</b> <b>for</b> 30 days followed by low food <b>rations</b> <b>for</b> 30 (HL), and low food <b>rations</b> <b>for</b> 30 days followed by high food <b>rations</b> <b>for</b> 30 (LH). While diet significantly altered size at 30 days (high vs. low food rations), subsequent dietary change resulted equal sizes across all four feeding treatments. Swimming performance showed variation due to interactions between dietary treatments. Furthermore, there was significant family level variation in the manner in which swimming performance responded to fluctuating dietary conditions. These results suggest that plastic responsiveness to subsequent environmental changes can be trait specific and vary significantly within populations...|$|R
40|$|Three {{levels of}} {{metabolism}} {{have been identified}} in the mussel Mytilus edulis L. Standard Metabolism is attained after prolonged starvation. On feeding, there is an initially elevated metabolic rate, termed active metabolism, which is characterised by increases in oxygen uptake, ventilation rate and filtration rate. After three days feeding, oxygen consumption decreases to a value intermediate between standard and active levels; this is defined as routine metabolism. Integrated measurements of ingested ration, assimilated ration and metabolic rate provide an estimate of energy balance which is a useful index descriptive and predictive of the effects of sublethal stress. Growth efficiency increases hyperbolically with increasing ration to reach a maximum after which efficiency decreases as ration is further raised. The optimum <b>ration</b> <b>for</b> efficient <b>growth</b> is an increasing; function of mussel weight. Gametogenesis in Mytilus edulis occurs in winter when food is scarce, Energy for gonad maturation is obtained from reserves built up during summer when food is abundant. The mantle and digestive gland are particularly important storage sites. The digestive gland also regulates the flow; of assimilated material to other tissues, During prolonged stress the digestive tubules become considerably degenerate but the tissue possesses the capacity to recover after such periods of stress. Lipid, carbohydrate and protein are synthesised in summer and metabolic rate is low. During winter, gametogenesis results in an inflated metabolic rate and turnover of metabolic pools is rapid as reserves are utilized. Sublethal stress also leads to catabolism of energy reserves but {{it is not possible to}} define the degree of stress in terms of biochemical parameters such as the carbohydrate: protein ratio because they tend to be regulated to similar values which are independent of the severity of the stress experienced...|$|R
40|$|A {{mail survey}} of swine {{producers}} in Ontario was undertaken during 1991 {{to describe the}} types, frequency, and motives for antimicrobial use. Two hundred operations that marketed fewer than 350 hogs per year, and 800 that marketed more than 350 per year were sent questionnaires, 63 % of which were completed and returned. Most operations (86 %) added antimicrobials to starter (weanling pig) rations, while fewer (29 %) added these drugs to finisher pig rations. The most commonly used antimicrobials were tylosin, carbadox, and furazolidone in weanling pigs, and tylosin, lincomycin, and tetracycline in finishers. Water medication of grower-finisher pigs was practised on 25 % of farms; 80 % of farms had injected at least some grower-finisher pigs with antimicrobials in the 12 mo preceding the survey. Approximately 20 % of operations that added antimicrobials to finisher <b>rations</b> did so <b>for</b> <b>growth</b> promotion purposes only, while others used them for disease treatment, prevention, control, {{or a combination of}} reasons. Among those not using antimicrobials in finisher rations, 83 % did not believe they were necessary and 37 % were concerned about the potential for residues in marketed hogs...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-six cross bred weaned pigs were {{allotted to}} seven {{different}} nutritional treatments. The {{purpose of this}} experiment was to compare various nontraditional byproduct, cull or waste feeds with conventional or commercial swine <b>rations</b> <b>for</b> rate of <b>growth,</b> efficiency of growth and carcass traits. One treatment was terminated after 38 days because of impaired protein digestion resulting from {{the presence of a}} dietary inhibitor. It was concluded that cull peas or extruded cull beans may be used in diets fed to growing pigs as a supplemental protein source without significantly diminishing efficiency or rate of growth. Bakery wastes resulted in less efficient gains (p< 0. 05), a lighter harvest weight and longer days to market weight. Therefore, bakery waste may be used as a component of the diet as an energy source but supplemental protein would be required to achieve growth performance and feed efficiency similar to that of pigs on the other dietary treatments in the present study. No significant differences due to diets were found for carcass composition, color of lean or color of fat. Cost of the feed in the commercial diet {{in the present study was}} more than twice that of the diets which contained nontraditional feedstuffs. This study shows it is not only cost effective, but profitable to use certain cull, waste or byproduct feeds as a component of diets for growing pigs...|$|R
