5|$|According to Harmetz, {{the usual}} <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of Germany, {{at least for}} people in the film industry, was not via Morocco and Lisbon but via Vienna, Prague, Paris, and England. Only the film's {{technical}} adviser, Robert Aisner, traced the path to Morocco shown in the film's opening scene.|$|E
5|$|Caversham Valley {{has long}} been the major <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of the central city to the south. The suburb is located close {{to the start of the}} Dunedin Southern Motorway (part of State Highway 1), the main road access to central Dunedin from the south, and close to the South Island Main Trunk railway. The {{creation}} of the Dunedin Southern Motorway redirected traffic away from South Road, the main thoroughfare through Caversham.|$|E
5|$|North of Rockwood, the {{community}} {{centered around the}} northern split of the overlap between NY10 and NY29, NY10 intersects NY10A, an alternate route around Rockwood Lake to the east. Farther north, NY10 enters Caroga Lake, a community situated on the eastern edges of West and East Caroga lakes. In {{the center of the}} hamlet, NY10 meets NY29A and follows the <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of the area. Together, NY10 and NY29A head northward through a region dotted with small lakes, as well as the larger Canada Lake, before splitting in the vicinity of Pine Lake.|$|E

5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Ticonderoga, NY9N passes through a valley before curving to the east and {{entering}} the hamlet of Ticonderoga. For the most part, NY9N bypasses the community as it turns north onto Wicker Street, the westernmost north–south through street in the hamlet. Northwest of the former village's center, NY9N meets NY22 and NY74, the latter of which serves as a northerly bypass of Ticonderoga. NY22 joins NY9N here, following the <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|The {{offer of}} {{defection}} is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects {{her and the}} Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, M, orders {{him to go to}} Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the Orient Express. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian MGB agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third agent.|$|E
5|$|Until the {{construction}} of the bypass, South Road and Caversham Valley Road formed the main <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of Dunedin to the south. State Highway 1 followed South Road through the main retail area, then followed Caversham Valley Road to Lookout Point. Above its retail area, South Road winds around the flank of Calton Hill; Caversham Valley Road forms a straighter, steep route that originally continued from the end of South Road's retail area. For this reason, the part of South Road running through the retail area is also sometimes referred to as part of Caversham Valley Road. Improvements to Caversham Valley Road to ease congestion and increase safety began in 2011. A junction {{at the north end of}} Caversham's main retail area connects South Road with the bypass.|$|E

5|$|By 1800, the {{increased}} agricultural productivity had allowed Nguyễn Ánh {{to support a}} sizable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials for military purposes, in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased castor sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food surplus allowed Nguyễn Ánh to engage in welfare initiatives that improved morale and loyalty among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The surplus grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguyễn army into Tây Sơn territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered Tây Sơn mandarins were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguyễn administration.|$|E
5|$|Once White Plains {{became the}} county seat of Westchester in 1759, the road between this village {{and the city of}} New York (then {{encompassing}} only Manhattan) became an important route and was established as the White Plains Post Road. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via Kingsbridge along the old Boston Post Road. A new bridge over the Harlem River (the original Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White Plains Post roads to a new alignment along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The White Plains Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White Plains heading north. The old White Plains Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day White Plains Road, which was laid out in 1863. (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White Plains Post Road continued north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the route shifted east to modern-day White Plains Post Road, going through Bronxville and Scarsdale to White Plains.|$|E
5|$|Panić {{combined}} well-motivated paramilitary infantry with trained {{engineering units}} to clear mines and defensive positions, supported by heavy armour and artillery. The paramilitaries spearheaded a fresh offensive that began on 30 September. The assault succeeded in cutting the Croatian supply route to Vukovar when {{the village of}} Marinci, on the <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of the town, was captured on 1 October. Shortly afterwards, the Croatian 204th Brigade's commander, Mile Dedaković, broke out with a small escort, slipping through the Serbian lines to reach the Croatian-held town of Vinkovci. His deputy, Branko Borković, took over command of Vukovar's defences. General Anton Tus, commander of the Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter, put Dedaković {{in charge of a}} breakthrough operation to relieve the town and launched a counter-offensive on 13 October. Around 800 soldiers and 10 tanks were engaged in the attack, which began in the early morning with artillery preparation. Special police forces entered Marinci before noon, but had to retreat as they did not have enough strength to hold their positions. Croatian tanks and infantry encountered heavy resistance from the JNA and were halted at Nuštar by artillery fire. The JNA's 252nd Armoured Brigade inflicted heavy losses on the Croatian forces and around 13:00 the attack was stopped by the HV General Staff. A humanitarian convoy of the Red Cross was let through to Vukovar.|$|E

5|$|The {{extensions}} from Rickmansworth to Aylesbury and Chesham {{were designed}} by Charles Liddell and built by contractor James Firbank. Rather than follow {{the valley of the}} River Chess, which would have been the most convenient route to Chesham, the <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of Rickmansworth was intentionally built on higher ground to reduce the steep climb over the Chilterns towards Aylesbury, and thus rose steadily from Rickmansworth to a hilltop station at Amersham. At Chalfont Road station (renamed Chalfont& Latimer in 1915) the line to Chesham split from the line to Aylesbury. With a total length of 3miles 56chains (3mi 1,232yd; 5,955m), the single-track Chesham branch ran alongside the Aylesbury line for a short distance, before curving down the slope of the Chess Valley at a gradient of around 1 in 66. Chalk from the railway's cutting along the Chess Valley was used to build an embankment to bring the railway into the town centre. Bridging the watercress beds of the Chess Valley proved problematic, and the cost of the line exceeded its estimate. Additional costs were incurred by the laying of temporary track in early 1889 to allow the directors of the MR a trial trip along the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{route to}} the town centre is the A338 spur road, a dual carriageway that connects to the A31 close to the Hampshire border. The A31 joins the M27 at Southampton and from there the M3 to London and the A34 to the Midlands and the North can be accessed. The main road west is the A35 to Honiton in Devon which runs through the South East Dorset Conurbation and continues east as far as Southampton, albeit as a non-primary route. The A350 in the neighbouring borough of Poole provides the only northern <b>route</b> <b>out</b> of the conurbation. National Express coaches serve Bournemouth Travel Interchange & Bournemouth University. There are frequent departures to London Victoria Coach Station and Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. Local buses are provided mainly by two companies, Wilts & Dorset, the former National Bus Company subsidiary and now owned by the Go-Ahead Group, and Yellow Buses, the former Bournemouth Council-owned company and successors to Bournemouth Corporation Transport, which began operating trams in 1902. Other operators serving the town include Damory Coaches and the Shaftesbury & District bus company.|$|E
