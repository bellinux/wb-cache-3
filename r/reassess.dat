5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to <b>reassess</b> their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day {{adjournment}} while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E
5|$|The August 1938 {{shipbuilding}} plan {{envisioned a}} total of 15 Project 23-class battleships, and this grandiose scheme was only slightly revised downward to 14 ships in the August 1939 plan. Eight of these were to be laid down before 1942 and the remaining six before 1947. However, only four were actually laid down before the outbreak of World War II forced the Soviets to <b>reassess</b> their ambitious plans. On 19 October 1940 an order was issued, signed by Stalin and Molotov, that no new battleships would be laid down in order to concentrate on smaller ships' building (and also, probably, because more resources were required for the Army), one ship is to be scrapped, and priority {{should be given to}} only one of the three remaining battleships.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and cutting {{teeth of the}} silky shark make it {{potentially}} dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to <b>reassess</b> its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The main {{character}} of Redemption is French crusader Christof Romuald, a once-proud, religious church knight who {{is transformed into}} a Brujah vampire. With his religious faith destroyed, Christof is forced to <b>reassess</b> his understanding of good and evil as he acclimates to his new life. Christof's anchor to humanity is the nun Anezka, a human with a pure soul who loves Chrisof even after his transformation. As a member of the Brujah under Ecaterina the Wise, Christof allies with Wilhem Streicher, the Gangrel Erik, and the Cappadocian Serena during his journeys through 12th century Prague. Other characters in this era include the slaver Count Orsi, the Tremere Etrius, and the Ventrue Prince Brandl.|$|E
5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to <b>reassess</b> their operational aims. Warr argued that they should move away from conventional operations and instead focus on population control and disrupting communist supply lines and freedom of movement. Assessing that with just two infantry battalions 1 ATF {{did not have the}} strength to destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon and search operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations. Two days later 5 RAR conducted a successful cordon and search of the village of Binh Ba as part of Operation Caloundra, screening 1,500 villagers and interrogating 591. Nine confirmed members of the Viet Cong were captured, while five draft dodgers were also detained. By mid-afternoon the operation had concluded without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|From 1768 {{there were}} a number of grand schemes proposed, all with the aim of linking the Bristol Channel to the English Channel by a waterway, thereby {{avoiding}} the need to navigate by sea around Cornwall and Devon. James Brindley was the first to survey a route, which would have run from the Bristol Channel to Exeter, following the course of the River Tone for part of its route. In 1769, Robert Whitworth looked at a shorter route from Bridgwater Bay to Seaton, following the River Parrett and the River Axe. He was asked to <b>reassess</b> the route in the 1790s. William Jessop surveyed a route between Taunton and Exeter in 1794, while another group proposed a canal linking Bristol, Nailsea, Bridgwater and Taunton, which was surveyed by William White. Jessop's assistant, Josiah Easton, suggested a route from Uphill (on the Bristol Channel) to Seaton, again in 1794, and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the Grand Western Canal and the Bristol and Western Canal, respectively. Only the first was authorised, but the economic downturn caused by the Napoleonic Wars meant that construction did not begin immediately.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{did not see}} the Canadian Corps's {{capture of}} Vimy Ridge as a loss. Contemporary German sources viewed the action, at worst, as a draw, given that no {{full-scale}} breakthrough occurred following the attack. The Germans did not attempt to recapture the ridge, even during the Spring Offensive and it remained under British control {{until the end of the}} war. The loss of Vimy Ridge forced the Germans to <b>reassess</b> their defensive strategy in the area. Instead of mounting a counterattack, they pursued a scorched earth policy and retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line. The complete failure of the French Nivelle Offensive in the week after the Arras Offensive placed pressure on Field Marshal Douglas Haig to keep the Germans occupied in the Arras sector to minimize French losses. The Canadian Corps participated in several of these actions including the Battle of Arleux and the Third Battle of the Scarpe in late April and early May 1917.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Reassessing</b> coping {{involves}} {{efforts to}} wait patiently for an appropriate opportunity to act {{or for a}} change or improvement in the situation, and {{can be observed in}} individuals encountering a stressful relationship event. It was hypothesized that <b>reassessing</b> coping would be negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional Web-based survey was conducted in order to test this hypothesis by examining relationships between coping strategies including <b>reassessing</b> coping, distancing coping and constructive coping for stressful relationship events and depressive symptoms. Participants were 1, 500 individuals recruited from the general populations of the United States, Australia, and China. Results: Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that scores on coping strategies predicted depressive symptom scores in the samples from all three countries with medium or large effect sizes. Further, the beta values for <b>reassessing</b> coping scores were negative and significant in all samples, indicating that the hypothesis was supported for each of the population samples surveyed. In addition, distancing coping, which reflects strategies that attempt to actively damage, disrupt, and dissolve a stressful relationship, was associated with high levels of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: <b>Reassessing</b> coping for interpersonal stressors was be negatively associated with depressive symptoms i...|$|R
