5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the <b>red</b> <b>mud</b> and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E

The RM addition caused a pH increase, a striking decrease of total organic carbon and a significant increase of water-soluble C, N and P. The analysis of As mobility through sequential extraction showed a reduction of the water-soluble arsenic in the RM-soil compared to the UP-soil (3. 44 % and 5. 59 % of the total As respectively) and a remarkable increase of the residual (non extractable) arsenic fraction in the RM-soil (> 300 % compared to UP-soil).

RM samples were artificially enriched in batch tests with solutions containing increasing concentrations of As(V). The pH of the solution significantly affected the adsorption, which increased with the decrease of pH. Moreover a sequential extraction procedure [H 2 O; (NH 4) 2 SO 4; NH 4 H 2 PO 4; NH 4 + -oxalate; NH 4 + -oxalate + ascorbic acid] was applied to RM samples exchanged with arsenate. Using this approach it was shown that low concentrations of arsenate sorbed in RM were present as water soluble and exchangeable fractions, while NH 4 + -oxalate and NH 4 + -oxalate + ascorbic acid extracted most of the adsorbed arsenate from RM at different pH values. Besides, FT-IR spectroscopy was used {{to better understand the}} nature of RM surface configuration after As(V) sorption. In the FT-IR spectra the presence of As(V) species was highlighted by a well resolved band at 865 cm − 1. The intensity and broadness of this band increased at the decreasing of pH.

40|$|Sediments {{from natural}} {{geological}} hinterland accumulate inside waterways and man made accumulations on land. Their {{grain size distribution}} and mineral composition are comparable with soils. Accumulated mud reduces safe operation and functionality of these facilities. Thus, it should be permanently removed and disposed of inside the water body or on land. Industrial muds are also stored in man made accumulations on land. Due to high water content, strength of muds is usually lower than strength of soils with water content at liquid limit. Some muds exhibit thixotropic behaviours. In this thesis, the validity of in situ and laboratory test methods and material models, developed for soils, for the identification of mud properties and for the prediction of their behaviour, were investigated. Two muds were examined: dredged marine sediment – reful from the Port of Koper and <b>red</b> gypsum <b>mud,</b> which is by-product {{in the production of}} titanium dioxide in Celje. Both are deposited on land, in accumulations which present limitations in the planning of the infrastructure and production. Reful is deposited in shallow lagoons, while <b>red</b> gypsum <b>mud</b> is stored behind two large embankments Za Travnikom and Bukovžlak, which represents high risk facilities. Properties of muds were identified with in situ and laboratory investigations. Results were interpreted in the light of classical soil mechanics, taking into account the specificities which emanate from the mud origin and from new sedimentation environment. The influence of salty pore water on the index properties of reful was determined. The limitations of in situ measuring sensors for the investigation of muds were checked. The validity of semi empirical relationships, developed for evaluation of in situ tests in soils, for the description of <b>red</b> gypsum <b>mud</b> properties were analysed. ConTec Viscometer 5, designed for mortars and concrete, was recognized as suitable also for rheological investigations of muds. The sensitivity and thixotropic behaviours of muds were evaluated. The improvement of reful was investigated by mixing it with inorganic binders. From the results of laboratory tests and from trial pressure filtration tests, technological and material parameters for model description of consolidation creep, drying and pressure filtration, were estimated. Results show that Soft soil creep model is suitable for the description of consolidation creep, while basic 1 D model, developed for the computation of the Slano Blato landslide drying, is not completely appropriate for the description of drying of mud in the accumulation and oedometer test is suitable also for the prediction of the pressure filtration parameters. ...|$|R

Because the amendments increased soil pH to approximately 6, a lime treatment to the same pH and an unamended treatment were included for comparison. All the amendments had significant positive effects on the soil microbial biomass and growth of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. cv. Avance), but only WTS-A improved lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Tom Thumb) growth. The mineralization of added ammonium nitrogen was not significantly affected by the treatments, while a physiologically based extraction test (PBET) showed that bioaccessibility of As was low (< 5 %) and decreased only in the WTS-A treatment. Concentrations of As in soil pore water and extractable As only decreased in the WTS and RG treatments. In contrast, Cu concentrations in soil pore water and extractable Cu decreased in all treatments, by more than 84 % in the WTS, RM, and RG treatments. Non-isotopically exchangeable As and Cu were present in colloids in the soil pore water. Untreated soil had < 4 % isotopically exchangeable As and this decreased by approximately 50 %, with WTS, RM, and RG. The labile Cu pool represented a large proportion (34 %) of the total Cu pool, and the isotopically exchangeable and soluble Cu were strongly correlated with soil pH. Acidification of the treated soils showed that the labile As and Cu both increased in the treated soils compared with untreated soils. The significance of the treatment effects on soil fertility and potential off-site transport of As and Cu to ground water are discussed. Enzo Lombi, Rebecca E. Hamon, Gerlinde Wieshammer, Mike J.

40|$|Main articleThe "red muds" which {{occur at}} Rodent Corner {{along the west}} face of the exit quarry at Makapansgat limeworks have been divided into two {{sedimentary}} facies according to lithology, sedimentary properties and biological content: (1) coarse sandstone; and (2) siltstone and fine-sandstone. These two facies form a depositional couplet or sedimentary motif that occurs throughout the deposits {{and can be used}} as a basis for interpretation of the conditions of deposition. The coarse sandstone facies consists of thin lenticular beds which contain occasional elongate bone fragments showing a pronounced sedimentary fabric. This facies was probably deposited by flowing water, but, because of its coarse grain size, scale and low granulometric contrast, traction current structures such as cross-bedding and ripple cross-lamination were not developed. The angular character of the individual grains implies a short distance of transport and local derivation of the facies. The siltstone and fine sandstone facies is red and calcareous and contains sporadically distributed coarse sand grains. It is generally thicker and laterally more persistent than the coarse sandstone facies and capped by a mudcracked surface. The general characteristics of this facies are consistent with deposition in slow-moving or standing water from quiet suspension sedimentation. Shallowing of the water, related to changes in level of the water table, led to exposure of the depositional surface and the development of mudcracks. A variation of this facies pattern occurs in the middle of the succession where two limestone layers were deposited, the upper one intimately associated with local concentrations of cave pearls which originated from the lime-rich surface waters in locally agitated pools by concentration and precipitation of carbonate about a central nucleus. The facies couplet is interpreted in terms of storm and fair weather processes and compared with modern analogues found on shallow marine shelves, alluvial plains and in lakes. The coarse sandstone facies is attributed to storms and heavy rainfall outside the cave washing in coarse sandy detritus and raising the level of the water table. Between storm episodes quiet suspension sedimentation occurred accompanied by a gradual shallowing of the water table. Thus the coarse sandstone facies provides clues to storm periodicities and rainfall and suggests a rather wet climatic regime at this time. The <b>red</b> <b>muds</b> at Rodent Corner differ from those near the "Ancient Entrance" in that they contain coarse sandy interbeds, implying that the two deposits were separated from one another, possibly by a floor high, and that the opening into the cave at this time was small and probably located close to Rodent Corner.

40|$|Since {{primordial}} times, vultures {{have been}} competing with man for animal carcasses. One of these vultures, the once widespread bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), has {{the habit of}} bathing its polluted feathers and skin in red iron oxide - ochre - tainted water puddles. Why? Primitive man may have {{tried to find out}} and may have discovered its advantages. Red ochre, which has accompanied human rituals and everyday life for more than 100, 000 years, is not just a simple red paint for decoration or a symbol for blood. As modern experiments demonstrate, it is active in sunlight producing aggressive chemical species. They can kill viruses and bacteria and convert smelly organic substances into volatile neutral carbon dioxide gas. In this way, ochre can in sunlight sterilize and clean the skin to provide health and comfort and make it scentless, a definitive advantage for nomadic meat hunters.
