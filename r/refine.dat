In this study, conventional atmospheric high consistency <b>refining</b> is compared to pressurised high consistency <b>refining</b> after preheating to 125 C and 175 C. After high the consistency <b>refining</b> stage, the pulp samples were <b>refined</b> in a low consistency process in a laboratory Escher-Wyss <b>refiner.</b> The results show that the highest levels of tensile energy absorption and strain at break were achieved with curled and kinked fibres <b>refined</b> in a pressurised <b>refiner</b> at 175 C at a relatively low <b>refining</b> energy input, before the low consistency <b>refining</b> stage. These results were obtained at low airflow resistance, which is advantageous for sack paper.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of long fibre concentration on loadability and pulp properties during LC <b>refining</b> of mechanical pulp. Long fibre concentration was adjusted to three different levels by screen fractionation of the pulp. The three pulps were <b>refined</b> in a single disc pilot scale LC <b>refiner</b> at similar process conditions. Increased long fibre concentration supported a larger <b>refiner</b> gap and resulted in less fibre cutting at a given specific energy consumption. The higher long fibre concentration probably contributed to a stronger fibre network that maintained a larger <b>refining</b> gap at certain specific energy consumption. Increased long fibre concentration also enabled a higher tensile index increase in the LC <b>refiner</b> at certain fibre length reduction. The study supports a process combining LC <b>refining</b> with screen fractionation, where the long fibre fraction is recycled to the <b>refiner</b> feed. This enables a higher loadability and a more effective utilisation of the LC <b>refiner.</b> By using this technology, overall specific energy consumption can be reduced if a larger share of the <b>refining</b> is performed in LC rather than HC <b>refining...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{papermaking}} {{process can}} be described as a process to remove water from pulp. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the effects to dewatering properties in each sub-process including forming, pressing and drying. Lampen mill <b>refiner</b> and Voith LR- 40 <b>refiner</b> is used to generate 4 different types of pulp which are subject to dewater with laboratory papermaking process. Moving belt former (MBF) was used to forming sheets and this machine also can generate different vacuum levels to remove the water from the wet web. Then the wet sheets are dewatered with MTS-press which can generate high pressure in a millisecond scale. IR-dryer was used to dry the sheets to evaluate the evaporation rate. It is found that with the increasing energy level in <b>refining,</b> the heavily <b>refined</b> fibres are shorter, more fibrillation, straight and fines than that of lightly <b>refined.</b> Meanwhile, the Voith <b>refined</b> fibres have more fibrillation than Lampen <b>refined</b> pulp. In forming part, the vacuum curves and surface level curves can be characterized by MBF. When high vacuum level applied on wet web, the heavily <b>refined</b> pulps or high fines content furnishes have higher vacuum curves and longer drainage time because the fibrillations and more fines result in the web denser and less permeable. Voith <b>refined</b> samples have higher vacuum curves and longer drainage time than that of Lampen mill <b>refined</b> samples. The dry solid content was measured after each sub-step. Heavily <b>refined</b> samples have lower dry solid content than that of lightly <b>refined</b> samples and Voith heavily <b>refined</b> samples have lower dry solid content than that of Lampen heavily <b>refined</b> samples. The heavily <b>refined</b> pulps or more fines content have the lower speed to be dried. Lightly <b>refined</b> samples have higher evaporation rate than of heavily <b>refined</b> samples...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of eucalyptus pulp fibers {{prior to and}} after low-consistency (LC) <b>refining</b> was studied using a state-of-the art laboratory <b>refining</b> device and advanced surface analysis techniques. It was found that LC <b>refining</b> could generate fines and fibrillation and change the surface chemical composition of fiber surfaces. Both of these two effects can facilitate the adsorption of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) by the combination of increased specific surface area, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions, thus compensating {{for the loss of}} optical properties resulting from LC <b>refining.</b> The mechanical hydraulic force generated by the high <b>refining</b> energy disturbed the FWA retention. Therefore, high <b>refining</b> energy could improve the adsorption of FWAs when they are added after <b>refining,</b> but for better performance, the <b>refining</b> energy should be controlled and lowered. In addition, small amounts of calcium salt added after <b>refining</b> can also ameliorate the adsorption of FWAs...|$|R
