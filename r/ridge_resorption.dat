40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} type 2 diabetes mellitus and the reduction of mandibular residual ridge in completely edentulous patients wearing complete dentures and to investigate the ef-fect of gender, age and years of edentulousness / den-ture wearing on <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> on both groups. Methods:Seventy-two (36 men and 36 women) {{with a mean age}} 63. 5 years (range of 52 to 73 years) com-pletely edentulous denture-wearing patients were included in this study. Of these, there were 40 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 32 control subjects participated in the study. Resorption in the mandibular residual ridges was assessed by using the mental foramen and the inferior border of the mandible, as they appear in panoramic radiographs, as reference points using Wical and Swoope Analysis method. Measurements were performed using “Dijite” Digital Caliper. The amount of mandibular <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> was calculated and correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the results were compared with control group. Differences in gender, age and years of edentulousness were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (V 11. 0). A 2 -sample t-test was used to {{evaluate the}} differences in mean values of mandibular <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> between diabetics and controls. Level of significance was set at 0. 05. Results: The mean mandibular residual <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> of all participants is 8. 0 mm (26. 9 %), diabetic group significantly (P < 0. 01) had two times more resorption compared with control group (35. 8 % versus 18. 0 %).

There were no differences in both groups regarding the age of subjects and the length of time they have been edentulous and years of denture wearing. The amount of mandibular residual <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> was directly related to the number of years of edentulousness.

40|$|Background: Following the {{extraction}} of a tooth, bone resorption can cause significant problems for a subsequent denture implant and restorative dentistry. Thus, the tooth extraction socket needs to be maintained to reduce the chance of any alveolar <b>ridge</b> bone <b>resorption.</b> Objective: The objective {{of this study is}} to determine whether the administration of mangosteen peel extracts (MPEs), combined with demineralized freeze-dried bovine bone xenograft (DFBBX) materials for tooth extraction socket preservation, could potentially reduce inflammation by decreased the expression of nuclear factor κβ (NfKb) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κβ ligand (RANKL), to inhibit alveolar bone resorption, and increased of bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP 2) expressions to accelerate alveolar bone regeneration. Materials and Methods: This study consists of several stages. First, a dosage of MPE combined with graft materials was applied to a preserved tooth extraction socket of a Cavia cobaya. Second, the C. cobaya was examined using immune histochemical expression of NfKb, RANKL, BMP 2, as well as histology of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The research was statistically analyzed, using an analysis of variance test and Tukey honest significant difference test. Results: The results of this research were that it was determined that MPEs combined with graft materials on a preserved tooth extraction socket can reduce NfKb, RANK, and osteoclasts also increase of BMP 2 and osteoblast.

Before placement of endosseous implants in the jaws, both {{the quantity and quality}} of the residual ridge must be assessed radiographically. Remodeling activity after tooth extraction is localized primarily at the crestal area of the residual ridges, resulting in reduction of the height of bone and creation of various three-dimensional shapes of the residual <b>ridges.</b> When bone <b>resorption</b> at the lingual and buccal aspects is greater than that at the crestal area, a knife-edge type of residual ridge develops. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the knife-edge morphology of the residual alveolar bone at proposed implant sites in partially or completely edentulous patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) cross-sectional images of the upper and lower jaws were assessed at the proposed sites before implant placement. Images of 258 proposed implant sites belonging to 30 patients were assessed radiographically. RESULTS: In 120 proposed implant sites out of 258 (46. 5 %), the residual alveolar ridge had a knife-edge configuration, the majority belonging to completely edentulous patients who lost their teeth more than ten years previously.

40|$|Lactation {{will reduce}} the stores of bone mineral {{irrespective}} {{of the amount of}} dietary calcium. In the rat, mineral requirements for lactation are met primarily by remodeling the cancellous bone in the metaphyses of long bones. Fluoride, by the nature of its incorporation into bone crystals and by its direct cytotoxic effect on bone resorbing cells, reduces the availability of calcium from bone. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the effects of fluoride ingestion and multiple pregnancies and lactations on the morphology of the rat femur. Virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a standard laboratory diet and 150 ppm fluoride in the drinking water ad lib. while undergoing three successive pregnancies and lactations. Rebreeding periods commenced immediately following a 21 -day lactation period. All litters were normalized to 8 pups on the day of birth. Following the third lactation period, both femurs were removed from all animals and prepared for either light or scanning electron microscopy. Periosteal surfaces of the diaphysis consisted of areas of woven bone formation with some prolonged resting areas around osteocyte lacunae. Endosteal surfaces consisted of areas of bone formation and resorption. Mineralized segments in formation areas were short and irregular in shape, and arranged in an unorganized manner. The irregular Howship 2 ̆ 7 s lacunae in resorption areas were located at various depths and sub-divided by prominent sharp <b>ridges.</b> The active <b>resorption</b> process exposed several layers of bone lamellae.

Conventional denture design and fabrication are challenged for its labor and experience intensity, urgently necessitating an automatic procedure. This study aims to develop a fully automatic procedure enabling shape optimization and additive manufacturing of removable partial dentures (RPD), to maximize the uniformity of contact pressure distribution on the mucosa, thereby reducing associated clinical complications. A 3 D heterogeneous finite element (FE) model was constructed from CT scan, and the critical tissue of mucosa was modeled as a hyperelastic material from in vivo clinical data. A contact shape optimization algorithm was developed based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. Both initial and optimized dentures were prototyped by 3 D printing technology and evaluated with in vitro tests. Through the optimization, the peak contact pressure was reduced by 70 %, and the uniformity was improved by 63 %.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effect of the mandibular implant-retained overdenture using two or four dental implants, or the conventional complete denture on resorption of the residual ridge of the maxillary anterior and mandibular posterior areas over a period of 10 years. In total, 120 patients, 30 patients treated with an overdenture on two implants (two-implant group), 30 patients with an overdenture on four implants (four-implant group) and 60 patients treated with a conventional full denture (conventional group), participated in this study.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to present the {{contemporary}} approach as well as the interdisciplinary management of impacted canines in the upper jaw. Impacted canines are common and frequent complain. After the third molars, the maxillary canines are the most commonly impacted permanent teeth. About one third of impacted maxillary canines are positioned labials or within the alveolus, and two thirds are located palatals. The appropriate timing and surgical procedure for uncovering an impacted canine are determined by specific criteria. Although the mechanical management of impacted teeth is a routine task for most orthodontists, certain impactions can be frustrating, and the esthetic outcome can be unpredictable if the oral surgeon uncovers the impacted tooth improperly. When referring a patient to have an impacted tooth uncovered, the orthodontist might assume incorrectly that the surgeon knows which surgical procedure to use. However, if not instructed properly, the surgeon could select an inappropriate technique, leaving the orthodontist with the difficult if not sometimes lengthy and challenging task of erupting the impacted tooth into the dental arch. On the other hand, if the correct uncovering technique is chosen, the eruption process can be simplified, resulting in a predictably stable and esthetic result. This is very important in the surgical-orthodontic treatment of impacted maxillary canines. Retention of permanent maxillary canines incurs the risk of complications, among which resorption of permanent incisors is quite frequent. Early diagnosis of resorption is difficult as in most cases it occurs posterior or anterior in the mid-root of the lateral incisor. Studies have demonstrated the necessity to take X-ray pictures not later than at the age of 10 to supplement the clinical examination whenever resorption is suspected. If in the oral cavity examination, lateral incisors exhibit atypical position, i. e. the crowns are distally protruding and deviated and canine <b>ridge</b> is palpable, <b>resorption</b> can be recognized.

The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze vertical and horizontal alveolar ridge dimensions clinically and by CBCT immediately following extraction and 3 - 4 months following socket preservation. METHODS: The preserved group (P) consisted of 20 patients with 1 - 2 non-molar teeth requiring extraction with socket preservation, while the control group (C) consisted of 5 patients requiring extraction alone. An acrylic stent was fabricated presurgically in order to measure vertical and horizontal ridge dimensions clinically and radiographically immediately following extraction and 3 - 4 months following socket preservation. RESULTS: Overall, P sites gained ridge height and lost minimal ridge width over 3 - 4 months, while C sites lost both ridge height and width. Preserved sites in which the teeth were extracted due to caries had the most significant gain in the radiographic vertical occlusal dimension (RVO).

The bone ratios were calculated using proportional area: anatomic to fixed reference areas and mean difference of ratios between the intervals determined RRR. The ridge locations included anterior and posterior maxillary and posterior mandibular arches. The T-Scan III digital occlusal system was used to record anterior and posterior percentage occlusal force (%OF) distributions. There were significant differences in anterior and posterior %OF between treatment groups. Two-way anova showed RRR was significant for arch locations (P= 0 005), treatment group (IOD versus CD) (P= 0 001), however, no significant interaction (P= 0 799). Multivariate regression analyses showed significant association between RRR and %OF at anterior maxilla (P= 0 000) and posterior mandible (P= 0 023) and for treatment groups at posterior maxilla (P= 0 033) and mandibular areas (P= 0 021). Resorption was observed in IOD compared to CD groups, with 8 5 % chance of less resorption in former and 7 8 % in the latter location. Depending on arch location, <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> at various locations was associated with occlusal force distribution and/or treatment groups (implant prostheses or conventional complete dentures) ...|$|E
40|$|For several years, implant-supported overdentures {{have been}} used with {{excellent}} results in rehabilitation of the edentulous mandible. The effect on the antagonistic jaw bone resorption however, {{has not yet been}} evaluated. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine on orthopantomograms the anterior and posterior maxillary <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> in three groups of patients with different mandibular prosthetic reconstructions: (1) overdentures supported by two implants, (2) fixed prostheses supported by four to six implants, and (3) complete dentures. The results indicated a more pronounced annual bone resorption in complete denture wearers compared to patients with implant-supported overdentures. A limited but continuing bone resorption was observed for the patients with implant-supported overdentures, and a slightly higher annual bone resorption occurred in the implant-supported fixed prosthesis group. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dentin {{dysplasia}} is {{an exceptionally}} rare, autosomal-dominant, hereditary condition, primarily characterized by defective dentin formation affecting both the deciduous and permanent dentitions. The etiology remains imprecise to date, {{in spite of}} the numerous hypotheses put forward and the constant updates on this condition. This case report of type I dentin dysplasia exhibits radiographic findings that are unique and diverse from the classical findings of various subtypes of this disease reported to date. This article also depicts the implant-based oral rehabilitation of the young patient diagnosed with this variant model of dentin dysplasia type I. Early diagnosis and implementation of this preventive and curative therapy is vital for avoiding premature exfoliation of deciduous and permanent dentition and the associated residual <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption,</b> thereby overcoming functional and esthetic deficits and ensuring protection of the remaining dentition from further harm...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{previous}} {{study on the}} genetic association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in FGFR 1 OP 2 /wit 3. 0 and the long term atrophy of edentulous mandible hypothesized that the excessive jawbone atrophy after dental extraction {{may be associated with}} abnormal oral mucosa contraction induced by the FGFR 1 OP 2 /wit 3. 0 gene. It was reported that the minor allele of rs 840869 or rs 859024 in FGFR 1 OP 2 /wit 3. 0 was associated with the excessive atrophy of edentulous mandible. The present study represents an attempt to replicate the results of this {{previous study}} and to examine the genetic association between polymorphisms in FGFR 1 OP 2 and residual <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> of mandible in a Korean population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 134 subjects (70. 46 ± 9. 02 years) with partially or completely edentulous mandible were recruited. The mandibular bone height was measured following the protocol of the American College of Prosthodontists (ACP). From 24 subjects, seven variants in FGFR 1 OP 2 were discovered and four of them were novel. Selected SNPs that are not in high LD at r 2 threshold of 0. 8 were genotyped for the remaining population. There was no frequency of the minor allele of SNP rs 859024 in Korean population. SNP rs 840869 was not associated with residual <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> (p = 0. 479). The bone height of the subject with the ss 518063493 minor allele (8. 52 mm) was shorter than that of those subjects with major alleles (18. 96 ± 5. 33 mm, p = 0. 053). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The patient with minor allele of ss 518063493 may be associated with excessive atrophy of edentulous mandible whereas the patients with that of rs 840869 are not associated in Korean population. The result from this study may assist in developing a novel genetic diagnostic test and be useful in identifying Koreans susceptible to developing excessive jawbone atrophy after dental extraction...|$|E
40|$|Background  The {{reconstruction}} of a functional occlusion {{in the presence}} of severe residual <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption</b> remains a significant challenge for maxillofacial surgeons and prosthodontists. Removable appliances are unsuccessful in severely resorbed cases and the advanced degree of bone loss precludes conventional implant-retained prostehesis. In recent years, bone graft {{reconstruction of}} the maxilla and the mandible has been advocated to reverse the debilitating effects of alveolar <b>ridge</b> <b>resorption.</b> Purpose  The surgical objective was the reconstruction of the osseous platform of the jaws, thereby allowing implant-retained definitive prosthetic rehabilitation utilizing the Teeth-in-an-Hour TM concept within 4 months. Materials and Methods  A completely edentulous patient received bone grafts from the posterior iliac crest to augment both the maxillary and mandibular alveolar ridges. The manmandible was augmented using Marx’s “soft issue matrix expansion procedure” and was restored in the conventional manor using an impression and a milled framework. The maxilla underwent “inlay/onlay” bone graft augmentation of the right and left maxilla {{at the same time as}} the mandiblular procedure. Implant placement was at 4 months post-bone graft reconstruction. Immediate loading of implants into a bone graft using Nobel Biocare’s Teeth-in-an-Hour TM protocol prelaunch was implemented. This included CT-based implant planning, simultaneous CAD/CAM fabrication of a surgical guide, a CNC-milled framework, flapless surgical placement of the implants, and immediate placement of a pre-fabricated definitive prosthesis. This approach reduced the time necessary for an edentulous patient to transform from severely atrophic alveolar support to implant-retained maxillary and mandibular prosthetic restorations. Immediate loading with an implant retained definitive prosthesis using a bone graft-reconstructed osseous platform was also performed. Conclusion  The Teeth-in-an-Hour TM concept was utilized to restore bone grafted augmentation of the maxilla with immediate loading of a definitive prosthesis within 4 months. The remarkable accuracy of the software, minimally invasive and short surgery and treatment time, uneventful quick recovery with minimal discomfort is a benefit not only to the patient, also to the treating team...|$|E
