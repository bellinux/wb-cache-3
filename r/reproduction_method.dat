25|$|If {{this image}} were {{transferred}} directly to paper, {{it would create}} a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber blanket, which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or offset to the rubber blanket cylinder, this <b>reproduction</b> <b>method</b> is known as offset lithography or offset printing.|$|E
25|$|Although some sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting {{has become}} the most common <b>reproduction</b> <b>method.</b> Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the {{cuttings}} are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, billet planting is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called ratoons. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made {{depending on the type of}} culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island la Réunion, sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.|$|E

[...] These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: [...] "Increasing the fidelity of recording ... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness." [...] Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin' in the Rain—was that some silent-era actors {{simply did not}} have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, {{a process known as}} [...] "looping", had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.With Hollywood's wholesale adoption of the talkies, the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound-film production was soon resolved.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} analysis of the circular cylinder located in the fluid flow as the Fluid-Structure interaction problem. The most important problem is the boundary <b>reproduction</b> <b>method</b> between fluid and structure for this problem. Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) finite element Method is used to analyze the problem. The research on an aerodynamic characteristic of the structure has been done by the experimental research, but in recent years, various characteristics are investigated by the numerical analyses. Although in the numerical analysis, various approaches has been developed, the definite conclusion has not been put out. It is necessary to consider the boundary <b>reproduction</b> <b>method</b> between fluid and structure for expressing the characteristic of the structure. In this research, the ALE finite element method is applied as the boundary <b>reproduction</b> <b>method.</b> The ALE method makes up for the fault of the Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinate systems, and is a useful method for the moving boundary reproduction. In the ALE method, the movement of a continuous body is described with a reference coordinate system that can be arbitrarily moved without any relation to transformation of structure and movement of fluid. As a result, effectively both parties parts are combined and the description located in the flow of the transformation and flow becomes possible. Here, new mesh control approach is tried in this research to be smaller mesh strain. Development of this method is the main point of this research. ...|$|E
