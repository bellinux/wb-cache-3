5|$|In 1991, the Chief Military Prosecutor for the Soviet Union began {{proceedings}} against P.K. Soprunenko for {{his role}} in the Katyn murders, but eventually declined to prosecute because Soprunenko was 83, almost blind, and <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cancer operation. During the interrogation, Soprunenko defended himself by denying his own signature.|$|E

5|$|Found in grasslands {{and open}} {{woodlands}} dominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris trees, the turquoise parrot feeds mainly on grasses and seeds and occasionally flowers, fruit and scale insects. It nests in hollows of gum trees. Much of its habitat has been altered and potential nesting sites lost. Predominantly sedentary, the turquoise parrot can be locally nomadic. Populations {{appear to be}} <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> crash in the early 20th century. The turquoise parrot has been kept in captivity since the 19th century, and several colour variants exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Marischal College {{merged with}} the {{neighbouring}} King's College to form the University of Aberdeen. There {{was no room for}} two professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite his scientific reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to Tait. Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at King's College, London, instead. After <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> near-fatal bout of smallpox in 1860, Maxwell moved to London with his wife.|$|E
5|$|On defense, linebacker Vince Hall, in {{his second}} game after <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> broken forearm, led all {{defensive}} players with 11tackles. Hall also recorded an interception in the late stages of the fourth quarter that allowed Virginia Tech to run down the clock and force Boston College into a hasty offense. Tied for third overall was Tech's Xavier Adibi, who recorded nine tackles (one for loss) and caught the game-ending interception. Adibi returned the interception 40yards for a defensive touchdown that sealed the victory for the Hokies.|$|E
5000|$|Short matches (only {{two games}} in the earlier rounds) left too much to chance - the {{stronger}} player could blunder a game, {{and it would be}} difficult to <b>recover</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bad start.

5|$|The {{following}} year, Brulé {{participated in}} the Canadian national junior team's summer development camp {{in preparation for the}} 2006 World Junior Championships. At the time of the final roster selection in December 2005, however, Brulé was <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> leg injury, suffered during NHL play with the Blue Jackets. He was invited to the team's summer camp again in 2006, but declined, choosing to focus instead on making the roster for Columbus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> sprained knee ligament, it was {{expected}} that the Eagles' linebackers would have to play a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of failing}} health Willis spent the {{remainder}} of his life chiefly in retirement at Idlewild. His wife Cornelia was also <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> difficult illness after the birth of their first child together, a son named Grinnell, who was born April 28, 1848. They had four other children: Lilian (born April 27, 1850), Edith (born September 28, 1853), Bailey (born May 31, 1857), and a daughter who died only a few minutes after her birth on October 31, 1860. Harriet Jacobs was re-hired by Willis to work for the family.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{began the}} 2003 {{season with a}} grandiose {{statement}} – namely that he would lower the 100m record to 9.65s. After <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> minor injury he suffered in January, Despite claims he could also beat the 60m indoor record, his form was poor and he failed to pass the heats at the 2003 British Grand Prix, finishing fourth {{in a time of}} 6.68s. He was beaten by Mark Lewis-Francis by a hundredth of a second at the trials for the IAAF World Indoor Championships, narrowly missing out on selection with a time of 6.59s.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 {{he became}} brigadier general. After a brief cavalry command he was reassigned to infantry. Wounded at Cross Keys, Steuart {{was out of}} the war for almost a year while <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{shoulder}} injury. He was reassigned to Lee's army shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg. Steuart was captured at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and exchanged in the summer of 1864. He held a command in the Army of Northern Virginia {{for the remainder of the}} war. Steuart was among the officers with Robert E. Lee when he surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House.|$|E

5|$|Tech's rushing offense {{featured}} two {{running backs}} who shared {{time on the}} field: Mike Imoh and Cedric Humes. During the regular season, Imoh rushed the ball 152times for 704yards, an average of 4.6yards per carry. He scored fourtouchdowns and set a school record for rushing yards in a game {{when he ran for}} 243yards in Virginia Tech's game against North Carolina. Humes was on the field slightly less than Imoh, but earned 595 yards and five touchdowns on 124 carries. Tech offensive tackle Jimmy Martin was expected to play in the game after <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> high ankle sprain.|$|E
5|$|The Bears opened rookie minicamp at the Walter Payton Center on March 10, and {{concluded}} on May 12. A total of 59 players participated, {{which includes the}} six draft picks, nine of the ten undrafted free agents (Mark Harrison {{was going to be}} signed, but failed his physical as he was <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> broken fifth metatarsal), kicker Austin Signor, ten veteran players, and 33 tryout players.

5|$|The {{enormous}} territorial {{gains of}} the Palestine offensive {{contrasted with the}} British Expeditionary Force's offensive on the Western Front at Cambrai. Fought in Flanders from 20 to 30 November, it ended with heavy losses and no gains. The French army was still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> serious mutiny, the Italians were defeated at the Battle of Caporetto, and Russia {{was out of the}} war following the Bolshevik Revolution. Allenby's advance by comparison made considerable territorial gains, helped secure Baghdad and the oilfields at Basra in Mesopotamia, encouraged the Arab Revolt, and inflicted irreplaceable losses on the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} Milan's {{eleventh}} {{appearance in the}} final. They had won on six occasions (1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003), and lost four times (1958, 1993, 1995, 2005). Liverpool were appearing in their seventh final. They had previously won the competition five times (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005), while they lost the 1985 final to Juventus. The final was a rematch of the 2005 final which Liverpool won 3–2 in a penalty shootout, after <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> three-goal deficit at half-time to level the score at 3–3 after full-time and extra time.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, the ship, now captained by Captain Tucker, is {{observed}} and attacked by Xindi vessels before the treatments can be completed.
