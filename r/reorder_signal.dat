50|$|Routine was {{the level}} of calls without {{priority}} and required no special signaling; the user would only dial the telephone number. Calls with precedence required preceding the telephone number with the desired precedence signal. Calls of increasing precedence could preempt calls of lower priority, giving them a special tone, if need be. For example, if a call was placed with Flash precedence and the route had no available trunks, the switch would preempt a Routine call, and if none in progress, would search for Priority and Immediate type calls. Only when all lines of a switch were already used with Flash or Flash Override precedence would the caller receive a <b>reorder</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
40|$|Wave Steering is a {{new design}} {{methodology}} that realizes high throughput circuits by embedding layout friendly synthesized structures in silicon. Wave Steered circuits inherently utilize latches in order to guarantee the correct signal arrival times at the inputs of these synthesized structures and maintain the high throughput of operation. In this paper, we show a method of <b>reordering</b> <b>signals</b> to achieve minimum circuit latency for Wave Steered circuits and propose an Integer Linear Programming(ILP) formulation for scheduling and retiming these circuits to minimize the number of latches for minimum latency. Experimental results show that in 0. 25 Âµm CMOS technology, as much as 33. 2 % reduction in latch count, at minimum latency, can be achieved over unoptimized Wave Steered circuits operating at 500 MHz. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{real-time}} and high-priority traffic over IP networks makes network survivability more critical. Several MPLS-based recovery mechanisms have been proposed to ensure continuity of service following network impairments. These approaches, however, suffer from the transient effects that negatively impact the traffic that is being rerouted onto the protection paths. Packet loss and reordering are the most significant negative effects resulting from protection switching. In conventional MPLS networks, the detection and retransmission of out-of-order or lost packets is left to the higher layers, which in effect, degrades the overall performance. This paper proposes a signaling mechanism to minimize the impact of protection switching on packet loss and <b>reordering.</b> The proposed <b>signaling</b> protocol is general and independent of the particular MPLS protection mechanism. The signaling protocol uses the existing queues on the nodes to buffer incoming traffic and hence reduce loss of data and packet reordering during recovery operations. Easy to implement calculations are used by the nodes to estimate the required queue sizes and to control the signaling procedure. The protocol has been implemented and studied in the three MPLS protection mechanisms under consideration. The results of our simulation study show that, {{with the implementation of}} the proposed signaling scheme in the basic protection mechanism, the number of packets reordered is significantly reduced while maintaining or improving packet loss without imposing much overhead on the nodes in the network...|$|R
