40|$|Research {{into the}} {{experiences}} of casual <b>relief</b> <b>teachers</b> (CRTs) (substitute or supply teachers) across Australia and internationally has reported feelings of marginalisation among participants. These findings are concerning {{when one considers that}} students might be in the care of CRTs for an equivalent of 1 year or more throughout their schooling. When CRTs describe such feelings there is a suggestion that they do not feel a part of the community of practice in which they work. Accordingly, their opportunities for professional learning are often compromised, which has implications for their ability to maintain pedagogical knowledge and skills. This study used cluster sampling survey data to offer insights into professional challenges faced by CRTs. The discussion examines the self-determined skills of 59 Australian CRTs and the way schooling is organised that may leave them feeling excluded rather than members of what should be their “communities of practice. &rdquo...|$|R

This {{research focuses on}} Casual <b>Relief</b> <b>Teachers</b> (CRTs), their reporting of bullying in primary school playgrounds in Victoria, {{and the impact of}} anti-bullying programs. While CRTs possessed a personal definition and understanding of bullying, they lacked an understanding of school policy and procedures at the schools in which they were employed.

The CRTs in many cases did not recognise, or chose not to respond to, non-physical forms of bullying. The schools in the study used a ‘whole school’ approach, though the focus ranged from ‘Zero Tolerance’ to ‘No Blame’ or ‘Method of Shared Concern’. CRTs were normally not informed about the schools’ programs and procedures on bullying, especially with respect to yard duty.

Given that absenteeism can be disruptive of the fundamental teaching and learning activities in a school. There {{is a need for}} better information {{on the extent to which}} HIV/AIDS leads to poor teaching and learning. The data was collected in Mthatha by administering questionnaires to teachers, having interviews with managers of three schools and an Education Development Officer. The study revealed that there is inefficient bureaucratic procedures that result in the delays in granting sick leave and absenteeism management. Concomitantly the perceptions of policies, practises and attitudes that influence behaviour are not readily encouraging and reinforcing. The study recommends the need for revision of the already existing policy to develop a policy on sick leave entitlements and <b>relief</b> <b>teachers</b> which takes into account the HIV/AIDS situation. The research is informed by the realisation that parallel efforts to create supportive social environments, through building alliances between peer educators and more influential people is essential. Therefore, human capital is a determining factor for economic success, by investing in training and education there will be enhanced well being for individuals and communities as well as increased global advantage to fight the growing epidemic...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores two of {{the main}} {{relationships}} which are significant to the individual with dissociative identity (DI) : the client-therapist relationship and the individual's relationship with significant others. By examining recent research on DI and analysing transcripts of interviews, discourses are identified that challenge the traditional assumptions concerning the client-therapist relationship and then capacity of those with multiple selves to establish meaningful relationships. They offer new {{ways of looking at}} the role and significance of relationships {{in the life of the}} individual with DI. The social aspects of living with DI will then be examined, in particular, the use of the Web as a means of connection. This section of the paper is an exploration into what the Web facilitates for individuals with DI, the acceptance gained through online communities and how this further informs their sense of self and way of being in a society where multiple selves is still an unknown.

40|$|Impending {{changes in}} Australian {{education}} brings forth the expected transformation of teachers working in schools. Three key points for transforming Australian schools {{has been identified}} by Gillard (2008 a) including the improvement of quality teaching, ensuring every child benefits and mandating transparency and accountability. A number of initiatives were considered to assist with such reform including {{the implementation of a}} Digital Education Revolution, the move to the Australian Curriculum and the implementation of a National Framework for Professional Standards for Teaching. As these transformative initiatives are rolled out to teachers across Australia, the equitable access to PD to support all teachers, regardless of their geographical location, is in question. In line with the literature, the author proposes the concept of delivering PD and accessing PD from regional and remote areas be reconsidered. This research paper will outline the findings from the study including travel time being significant and impacting on teachers personal time; limited <b>relief</b> <b>teachers</b> impacting on access to PD; promotion and teacher registration being explicitly linked to PD; professional learning communities being valued but often limited by small staff numbers; professional learning conducted in the local context being preferred; professional learning established at the teacher and school level being desirable; teachers being confident in using technology and accessing PD online if required; and social cohesiveness being valued and often limited by isolation.

The survey also collects information about the number of overseas-trained and beginning teachers employed by schools. In 2014, the survey was completed by 92 % of all state and state-integrated schools (94 % of primary schools and 87 % of secondary schools). Summary The annual Survey of Staffing {{provides the}} Ministry of Education with {{a snapshot of the}} number of entitlement staffing vacancies at the start of Term 1. The survey also collects information about the number of overseas-trained and beginning teachers employed by schools. In 2014, the survey was completed by 92 % of all state and state-integrated schools (94 % of primary schools and 87 % of secondary schools). Vacancies in state and state-integrated schools There were 204. 5 full-time teacher equivalent (FTTE) vacancies in state and state-integrated schools {{at the start of the}} 2014 school year. These vacancies represented 0. 5 % of all FTTE entitlement positions in such schools (0. 4 % in primary schools and 0. 5 % in secondary schools). Over the last ten years, the overall vacancy rate has varied between 0. 9 % and 0. 4 %. As a proportion of entitlement positions, and consistent with previous years, vacancies were higher in schools in rural areas, schools with the highest proportion of Māori students on their roll (relative to other schools) and low decile schools (deciles 1 – 3). Vacancies for Māori medium/bilingual teachers in primary schools In primary schools, there were 13. 1 FTTE vacancies for Māori medium/bilingual teachers, representing 0. 6 % of all FTTE entitlement positions in schools that offer Māori medium education. The proportion of vacancies for Māori medium/bilingual teachers in primary schools has been gradually increasing (0. 5 % in 2013, 0. 4 % in 2012 and 0. 2 % in 2011). Vacancies for Pasifika medium/bilingual teachers in primary schools At the start of Term 1 2014, there was one FTTE vacancy reported for a Samoan bilingual teacher, and no vacancies reported for Tongan or Cook Islands bilingual teachers. In 2013 there were no Pasifika bilingual vacancies in primary schools that offer Pasifika medium education. Location of schools with vacancies Consistent with data from previous years, the Ministry of Education local office areas of Invercargill, Nelson and Whangarei had the highest proportion of vacant entitlement positions. Subject vacancies in secondary schools Teaching positions in technology subjects made up the greatest proportion of vacancies in secondary schools (19. 6 % of all vacancies at the beginning of the 2014 school year, an increase from 13. 3 % in 2013). Half of these vacancies were in hard materials (for example, wood and metal work), and relatively few of them were in computer technology. Mathematics and statistics had the second highest proportion of vacancies (15. 7 % of vacancies in secondary schools), followed by vacancies for English (14. 1 %), Māori language (Te Reo Māori and Māori medium/bilingual, 14 %), and science subjects (8. 3 %). There were no vacancies reported for Pasifika medium/bilingual teachers. Past years’ data shows that English, Māori language, mathematics and statistics, and science subjects typically have the largest vacancy rates. A higher demand for teachers would be expected in the core subjects offered in secondary schools. Vacancies in technology subjects have fluctuated, with the rate in 2014 being a marked increase over that of 2013 (13 %) and 2012 (5. 2 %). Readvertised vacancies In 2014, 29 % of vacancies in primary schools (22 % in 2013) and 47 % of vacancies in secondary schools (41 % in 2013) had been readvertised. There is anecdotal evidence that schools may choose to re-advertise vacancies to broaden their pool of applicants so care is required when considering these results. Readvertised vacancies represented 0. 1 % of all FTTE entitlement positions in primary schools and 0. 2 % of such positions in secondary schools. The proportion of readvertised vacancies in schools has fluctuated over the last eight years, but in 2014 was half the proportion reported in 2006. Consistent with previous years, readvertised vacancies were higher in schools in rural areas, schools with the highest proportion of Māori students on their roll (relative to other schools) and low decile schools (deciles 1 – 3). <b>Relief</b> <b>teachers</b> for positions that require proficiency in Te Reo Māori In 2014, 14 % of primary schools, and 62 % of secondary schools had positions that require teachers to be proficient in Te Reo Māori. Overall, 66 % of these principals reported finding it ‘very difficult’ to find <b>relief</b> <b>teachers</b> for positions that require proficiency in Te Reo Māori (66 % of such primary and secondary schools). Thirty per cent of principals (29 % of such primary schools and 31 % of such secondary schools) reported finding it ‘somewhat difficult’ to source <b>relief</b> <b>teachers</b> for these positions. These figures are similar to those of 2013 and 2012. New Zealand-trained applicants Over the past three years, there has been an increase in the number of New Zealand-trained teachers applying for permanent positions in primary schools. Seventy-six per cent of primary schools had nine or more New Zealand-trained applicants for permanent Scale A classroom teacher position in 2014, compared to 73 % of primary schools in 2013, 70 % in 2012 and 59 % in 2011. In secondary schools, the number of New Zealand-trained applicants for positions has stayed relatively stable over the last three years. In 2014, schools were less likely to receive a high number of applications (nine or more) from New Zealand trained teachers for Te Reo Māori, Pasifika languages, the sciences and technology positions compared to other subjects – a trend that has been consistent over the last three years. The proportion of schools receiving no New Zealand-trained applicants increased in 2014 compared to 2013 for Te Reo Māori, English, mathematics and statistics, physics, and technology, however, the actual numbers involved in such cases are quite small. Overseas-trained teachers Overall, the number of relatively new overseas teachers employed in state and state-integrated schools has declined over the last five years. Relatively new overseas-trained teachers in 2014 made up 0. 4 % of all teachers in primary schools (the same proportion as in 2012 and 2013) and 0. 5 % of all teachers in secondary schools (continuing the decline seen over the last five years). Beginning teachers Over the last five years, the percentage of first year beginning teachers  (as a proportion of all teachers) has fluctuated. Overall, in 2014, first year beginning teachers made up 4. 4 % of all teachers (the highest proportion since 2010).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide a reasonably comprehensive study of the policies and practices of relief teaching in Tasmania. This has entailed looking at the broader context of policies and practices in this field in Australia and the United States, whilst focussing more closely upon the Tasmanian experience. As a consequence it has been necessary to obtain data {{from a variety of sources}} which include a literature review, examination of official files, information collected from state and territory departments and teacher unions, discussions with retired teachers and structured interviews with relief teachers. The literature, which focusses mainly on the employment of relief teachers in the United States of America, tends to suggest that relief teaching has a depressive effect on childrens' education because these teachers are rarely effective in their substitute role. The implication is that relief teachers are not entirely to blame for their ineffectiveness in moving student learning forward. It has been suggested that there is a need for school staff and relief teachers to form a working relationship whereby problems relating to relief teaching can be identified and more effectively addressed. A somewhat different perspective is apparent in Tasmania. From information contained in files held by the Department of Education and the Arts and interviews with retired teachers it is apparent that the factor most likely have an adverse affect on student learning is the unavailability of relief teachers. There is evidence to suggest that financial limitations placed on the employment of relief teachers has been a major factor and is considered to be the cause of significant interruption to continuity of student learning. From information provided by education authorities and teacher unions, it might be inferred that schools throughout Australia are able to call upon well-qualified and experienced relief teachers whose expertise is likely to be of assistance in maintaining students' academic progress. Moreover, it is likely that the utilisation of these teachers has the capacity to enhance the productivity of regular teachers because it reduces the stress regular teachers are likely to incur when workloads are increased through internal supervision. While education authorities admit that problems can arise, most appear to believe that the benefits of employing relief teachers outweigh the disadvantages. The issues within the literature relating to relief teaching provided the basis for the construction of an interview schedule which was subsequently used to elicit information and assess the range of concerns relevant to relief teaching in Tasmania. Subsequent to the collection and categorisation of data obtained from the interviews, chi-square tests were performed using the Macintosh StatView program. From the results of the tests, it has been ascertained that there are statistically significant differences when years of teaching experience and the grade level in which the <b>relief</b> <b>teacher</b> works are correlated with several issues relating to relief teaching. Test results indicate that the individual's perception of the role of the <b>relief</b> <b>teacher</b> is likely to be influenced by the grade level in which a teacher works. The majority of teachers working in the primary school are likely to perceive the role as one of providing their own educationally valid activities and lesson plans. Secondary school teachers generally see the role as that of maintaining learning programs which are currently being taken by the regular teacher. The grade level in which a teacher works is likely to have some bearing on the kinds of assistance relief teachers require to teach effectively. The majority of primary teachers believe information about school and class routines is important, while a small majority of those in the secondary area are likely to opt for assistance with behaviour strategies. When years of full-time and relief teaching experience were correlated with students' perceptions about the authority of relief teachers, it was found that subjects with less than ten years experience were the group most likely to believe students perceive them as lacking in authority. This group also feel the greatest need for orientation and training programs which specifically relate to relief teaching...|$|E
40|$|It {{is perhaps}} {{fair to say}} that the relief (substitute) teacher should be viewed as an {{extremely}} important educational resource, Reviewed literature spanning the better part of twenty years indicates that in parts of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, many students spend as much as one full year (or more) of their K- 12 education having curriculum delivered to them by these individuals.

The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether feelings of alienation were present in relief teachers servicing Western Australian government metropolitan primary schools, and if so, what they identified as contributing to those feelings. Additionally the research attempted to ascertain what (if any) support strategies for relief teachers were actually offered by the schools that had been serviced by the subject population. The research itself was qualitative in nature, using semi-structured interviews as the main data gathering tool, with twenty 2 ̆ 2 currently serving 2 ̆ 2 relief teachers being interviewed.

40|$|Many {{teachers}} {{working in}} remote and regional areas have {{limited access to}} collegial support networks. This research aimed to examine the existing strategies that were being undertaken by the Department of Education in Western Australia, to provide professional learning to teachers in regional and remote areas. It was important to establish the perceptions of teachers’ access to professional learning from those working at the coalface in geographically dispersed areas. Consequently, the possible opportunity for improving the amount and variety of professional learning, {{through the application of}} both synchronous and asynchronous technologies was proposed. The study was guided by the primary research question: “In what ways might technology be used to support professional development of regional and remote teachers in Western Australia?” Generating descriptions of current practice of professional learning along with the teacher perceptions were central to this research endeavour. 	The study relied on a mixed method research approach in order to attend to the research question. The data were collected in phases, referred to as an explanatory mixed methods design. Quantitative data were collected from 104 participants to provide a general picture of the research problem. To further refine this general picture, qualitative data were collected through interviews and e-interviews of 10 teachers. Participants in the study included graduate teachers, teachers who had taught more than two years, senior teachers and Level Three teachers from seven teaching districts within Western Australia. An investigation into current practice was included in this phase and technologies available to support a professional learning community over distance were documented. The final phase incorporated the formulation of a conceptual framework where a model was developed to facilitate the successful implementation of a professional learning community through the application of synchronous and asynchronous technologies. 	The study has identified that travel time in order to access professional development is significant and impacts on teachers’ personal time. There are limited <b>relief</b> <b>teachers</b> available in these isolated areas which impacts on the opportunities to access professional development. Teachers face inequities, in terms of promotion, because professional development is explicitly linked to promotional opportunities. Importantly, it was found that professional learning communities are valued, but are often limited by small staff numbers at the geographic locality of the school. Teachers preferred to undertake professional learning in the local context of their district, school or classroom and this professional learning must be established at the need of the individual teacher in line with the school priorities. Teachers reported they were confident in using technology and accessing professional development online if required, however, much uncertainty surrounded the use of web 2. 0 technologies for this purpose. The recommendations made from the study are intended to identify how a professional learning community might be enhanced through synchronous and asynchronous technologies...|$|R
40|$|Four {{hundred and}} eight casual <b>relief</b> <b>teachers</b> (CRTs) and 670 {{permanent}} teachers from government, independent, and Catholic primary schools {{and secondary schools}} in and around metropolitan Melbourne were surveyed using the researcher-developed Issues in Teaching Questionnaire (ITQ) {{in order to assess}} their attitudes, perceptions, and experiences in relation to 10 areas of concern including: job security, provisions and facilities, information and communication, lesson management, status, relationships with the school community, relationships with students, student management, job satisfaction, and job stress. These 10 areas of concern were derived from the literature regarding casual relief teaching, which comprised of various anecdotal, published, and unpublished sources. Classical test theory methods (e. g., Cronbach¡¦s ƒÑ and exploratory factor analysis) were used to determine the psychometric properties of the survey instrument, which indicated that the ITQ possessed excellent internal reliability and construct validity, and confirmed the existence of an ¡§in-class¡¨ factor and an ¡§out-of-class¡¨ factor. Using descriptive and multivariate inferential statistics, the responses of the CRTs and the permanent teachers were analysed. By comparison with the other group characteristics, employment status (i. e., CRT or permanent teacher) was the best predictor of scores on the ITQ. The CRTs reported significantly more positive attitudes, perceptions, and experiences regarding job stress (i. e., less job stress) compared with the permanent teachers, whereas the permanent teachers reported significantly more positive attitudes, perceptions, and experiences across all other areas of concern compared with the CRTs. When the responses of the CRTs and the permanent teachers were compared on a scale of magnitude (i. e., effect size), much larger effects were observed for the ¡§out-of-class¡¨ con cerns (e. g., Information and Communication, Provisions and Facilities, Lesson Management, Relationships with the School Community, Status, Job Security, and Job Satisfaction subscales) compared with the ¡§in-class¡¨ concerns (e. g., Relationships with Students, Student Management, and Job Stress subscales). Although many parallels were found between the CRTs and the permanent teachers in terms of their general classroom concerns, substantial differences existed between the two groups in relation to their concerns in the wider school context. Of particular importance were the considerable differences between the CRTs and the permanent teachers in terms of their employment conditions, and how they are currently being accommodated in schools and integrated into school communities. In these regards, CRTs are not receiving professional parity with their permanent counterparts. Overall, {{the results of this study}} (a) provide evidence of a psychometrically sound instrument for assessing the attitudes, perceptions, an d experiences of CRTs and permanent teachers across a range of school settings, (b) highlight the importance of employment status (i. e., CRT or permanent teacher) as a predictor of the ITQ subscales compared with the other group characteristics, and (c) present comprehensive and convincing evidence on the similarities and differences between the teaching experiences of CRTs and permanent teachers...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of staff shortages, relief or {{substitute}} teachers are playing an increasing role in many schools, yet they are largely invisible in policies, practices and research. In contrast, the problems surrounding relief teaching are highly visible: senior administrators worry about costs and timetables; regular teachers complain that no work is done; students become noisier; and relief teachers adopt strategies for 'survival'. Paradoxically, {{while there is a}} recurring theme in the literature to improve relief teaching effectiveness, relief teaching remains a low priority within the education system. This investigation evolved from a personal search {{to make sense of the}} recurring problems and paradoxes surrounding relief teaching. Its purpose was: to gather data on relief teaching which reflected the 'reality' of personal experience from a number of viewpoints; to determine the main issues from student, teaching and administrative perspectives, using a constant comparative method of analysis; and to find deeper links to illuminate the multidimensional relationships between relief teaching and its problems. Research was conducted in a core of eight secondary schools where the researcher worked as a <b>relief</b> <b>teacher.</b> Over a period of three years, through a synthesis of interviews, observations, anecdotal evidence, and reflection based on a naturalistic paradigm, the researcher developed strategies which enabled her to remain closely attuned to the varying settings. Using an inductive approach, data were gathered from over 300 participants, mostly administrators, teachers and students. In all, 85 hours of interviews were transcribed in addition to her written observations and reflections as a practitioner. The findings showed that the lack of consistent information, feedback and accountability caused many interview respondents to adopt a pragmatic, short-term approach to the management and practice of relief teaching. They based their decisions on divergent assumptions which were rarely challenged, causing problems to recur and intensify. The investigation concluded that the problems surrounding relief teaching were linked by three underlying factors: the context of relief teaching is largely invisible; relief teaching is different from regular teaching; and that there is no official recognition that problems exist. The process of making relief teaching visible as a phenomenon illuminated many inconsistencies within varying contexts and perspectives. Evidence strongly suggests that the context of relief teaching is central to the teaching and learning settings in schools. It shows, also, that the present approach to relief teaching is highly ineffective and gives rise to serious problems with far-reaching professional, economical, and legal implications. The thesis provides recommendations for future initiatives. Extensive appendices and the thematic structures underpinning the thesis enable the selection of material for a variety of purposes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the discourse of}} Northerners who traveled into the South during the Civil War. Northern soldiers, nurses, <b>teachers,</b> <b>relief</b> workers, and officers’ wives adopted an imperial framework in their encounter with the South. By {{the eve of the}} war, years of sectional turmoil had resulted in a perceived ontological separation between the North and the nation’s internal Other—the South. To Northerners, the region was comprised of untamed wilderness, an antiquated society, and an inferior culture. When over two million Northerners mobilized and entered the southern states, they broadly adopted imperial viewpoints and awakened to the cultural power they wielded as invaders. A close examination of letters and diaries written by ordinary Northern men and women who traveled to the South during the war reveals how the mobilization and movement of Northerners resulted in a distinctly imperial discourse aimed at exerting control over the flora, fauna, people, places, and institutions of the region.

40|$|During 2005, the Education Alumni Support Project (EdASP) (Maxwell, Smith, Baxter, Boyd, Harrington, Jenkins, Sargeant 2 ̆ 6 Tamatea 2006) {{provided}} online {{support for}} University of New England (UNE) graduand, and later, graduate, teachers as they commenced their careers.

One third of beginning teachers who were alumni of UNE in 2004, reported they did not receive adequate or any mentoring. UNE web-based technologies provided the teachers and mentors with online environments for professional and social interaction, and resource sharing. We found that support was especially sought by the project participants in their first school term, and there were differences in the levels of online support sought by secondary and primary beginning teachers. The project raises implications for on-going systemic support for beginning teachers, the issue of transition from students to teachers, as well as questions about teacher education students’ preparation.

40|$|Science {{is one of}} seven-mandated Key Learning Areas (KLAs) Foundation to Year 10 of the new Australian National Curriculum (ACARA, 2012). Not only, therefore, {{is science}} to be offered in every school {{as part of the}} curriculum, there is also the {{expectation}} that science is to be taught well to all students regardless of location, gender, cultural background or socio-economic status (ACARA, 2012). Studying science provides benefits to individuals by developing their scientific literacy skills (Goodrum, Hackling 2 ̆ 6 Rennie, 2001; Hackling 2 ̆ 6 Prain, 2008). Its study also benefits the national economy by equipping students with the innovative, inventive, and creative skills to generate and apply new ideas as knowledge workers in an interconnected and interdependent global economy (Marginson, Tytler, Freeman 2 ̆ 6 Roberts, 2013; Productivity Commission, 2007). A study of recent literature, including the national and international data on the middle years of school (ACARA, 2012; ACER, 2011, 2013; Goodrum et al., 2001; Goodrum, Druhan, 2 ̆ 6 Abbs, 2012; Hackling 2 ̆ 6 Prain, 2007; Marginson et al., 2013; Office of the Chief Scientist, 2012; Productivity Commission, 2007), could reasonably be expected to show rural and remote students doing well in science if not at least as well as their metropolitan counterparts. Sadly, this is not the case. Science performance in national and international assessments overall is flat-lining (ACARA, 2011; ACER, 2011, 2013) and the gap between metropolitan, rural and remote students in some assessment data indicates as much as 18 months of difference in schooling in favour of metropolitan students and with the gap increasing with increasing remoteness. What are the causes of this inequity and how can it be addressed? Science teachers hold the key (Australian Council of Deans of Science, 2005; Dow, 2003 a; Goodrum et al., 2001). Improving the effectiveness of science teachers helps improve science learning outcomes for students. One way to improve the effectiveness of science teachers is to improve their Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Kind, 2009 b; Magnusson, Krajcik 2 ̆ 6 Borko, 1999; Loughran, 2010; Loughran, Berry 2 ̆ 6 Mulhall, 2006; Shulman, 1986) through professional learning experiences. However, improving teachers’ science PCK in the middle-school years in rural and remote settings through traditional face-to-face professional learning activities poses a number of challenges. These include lack of casual <b>relief</b> <b>teachers,</b> difficulties in attracting and retaining science teachers, the provision of experienced mentors and coaches and, the provision of fewer professional learning opportunities compared with metropolitan areas (Australian Council of Deans of Science, 2005; Australian Secondary Principal’s Association, 2006; National Centre of Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Mathematics Education for Rural and Regional Australia, 2006). Educative curricula designed to improve teachers’ science PCK as well as learning outcomes for students provide an alternative to traditional face-to-face professional learning for teachers in rural and remote locations (Davis 2 ̆ 6 Krajcik, 2005). Can educative curricula help address the inequity in student science outcomes in rural and remote areas? The Middle Years Astronomy Project (the Project) is an example of one educative curriculum currently in use in the middle years of some rural and remote schools (McKinnon, 2005). This educative curriculum is aligned with the Australian Science Curriculum. It comprises access to telescopes and digital cameras located in NSW (Australia) and Wyoming (USA) that students can control remotely to take photographs of many astronomical phenomena, which can form the basis of further investigations. It also comprises a teachers’ guide designed to improve teachers’ science PCK by providing guidance on designing instructional strategies for science projects with knowledge of five factors in mind. These factors are knowledge of the science content, knowledge of students’ alternative conceptions, knowledge of instructional strategies and the most appropriate assessment strategies to employ, knowledge of the science curriculum, and knowledge of personal beliefs and orientations toward science teaching and learning. This thesis explores the potential for this educative curriculum to improve the PCK of teachers of science in the middle school years in rural and remote settings. It does this by employing a Type IV multiple-case, embedded mixed-methods design (Yin, 2014) over two phases in two states of Australia collecting a range of data from four remote sites in Western Australia and four rural sites in Victoria. Participants comprised 12 teachers, four principals, four teaching principals, one Science KLA Consultant, one Cluster Coordinator and over 200 students. Data were gathered from interviews; archival records; researcher direct observations; an astronomy diagnostic test; student artifacts; and school based documents. A framework, developed from the works of Davis 2 ̆ 6 Krajcik (2005), Kind (2009 b) and Magnusson et al. (1999), is used to analyse the data for evidence of changes in teachers’ science PCK. The results of this research indicate that the Project improved teachers’ science PCK for most teachers. Reasons for this are presented. An emerging phenomenon from the research was the ability of experienced science teachers to move holistically and fluidly between components of PCK to make in the moment pedagogical decisions to improve student learning. This has been referred to as ‘pinball pedagogical reasoning’ (Mitchell, Pannizon, Keast 2 ̆ 6 Loughran, 2015). The findings of this research have implications for both current practice and future research, providing guidance to teachers and designers of professional learning experiences, including educative curriculum designers, on the areas to target when seeking to develop components of PCK for experienced teachers and on assisting less experienced teachers to acquire the ‘pinball pedagogical reasoning’ skills of experienced teachers. The findings also suggest that PCK development takes time and requires a planned and systematic approach to teacher career development with support from the employer. This thesis suggests further areas for research and concludes by arguing that a poor science education, which results in poorer scientific literacy skills and a reduced ability to contribute to, and thrive in, the national and international knowledge economies, adds to the education disadvantage students in rural and remote locations experience relative to their metropolitan peers. It advocates a moral imperative to ensure this does not happen. It also suggests that using educative curricula to improve the PCK of rural and remote science teacher, as well as science student learning outcomes, is a strategy worthy of pursuit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{knowledge}} growth of beginning primary teachers in different employment contexts in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. It examines {{the difference in}} competency {{in the first two}} years of teaching attained by those who commenced teaching in stable, cohesive circumstances with secure, continuing employment and that of their colleagues, a majority of beginning teachers, who worked in uncertain and fragmented teaching situations as casual, <b>relief</b> or substitute <b>teachers.</b> This study also proposes an extension of current models of the knowledge base of teaching and the formulation of a more complex view of the knowledge base comprising three domains, knowledge of the practice of teaching, knowledge of the context of teaching, and knowledge of self-as-teacher. This thesis proposes a redefinition of the current concept of “context” beyond the school in which a teacher is employed to the broader concept of the employment context itself and examines the contextual factors impacting on teacher development. It enhances extant models of teacher development that describe teacher competencies at time-bound stages of a teacher’s career and proposes that beginning teachers’ movement from one stage of development to the next requires experience-in-context. A literature review provided insights into the way in which researchers such as Bullough (see, for example, Bullough, 1989, 1997; Bullough, Knowles, & Crow, 1992) and Berliner (1995, 1998, 2001) represented the experiences of beginning teachers and their development. The data revealed some consonance in the experience of beginning teaching between contemporary Australian teachers and teachers represented in the literature. There were also significant differences, resulting from the effect of differences in initial employment experience that remained hitherto unexamined by other authors. This research study utilised an exploratory mixed methods design. Data were gathered primarily through semi-structured interviews in a collective case study of eight participants. The question-response format was complemented by classroom observation, stimulated recall, document and artefact analysis and participant completion of a series of concept maps. In addition, a postal survey-questionnaire provided quantitative data from 241 beginning teachers located across NSW, Australia. The data indicated that the employment context significantly affected teacher development. Teachers in cohesive situations experienced development in all three domains of the knowledge base and were able to progress beyond the “novice” stage within two years. Those who spent two years in uncertain and fragmented employment contexts frequently regressed. This study will be of interest to educational researchers as it proposes some redefinitions of accepted constructs commonly applied to beginning teachers’ development. It will be of interest also to educational policy makers in clarifying the effect on future teacher competency of learning to teach in uncertain contexts, and to educational practitioners who are responsible for the induction and mentoring of teachers whose early experience may have been less than professionally satisfying...|$|R
