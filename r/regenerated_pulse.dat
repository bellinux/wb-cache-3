50|$|The {{modelling}} {{results for}} the 2R regenerator are shown with the article. In Figure 1, the upper panel shows <b>regenerated</b> <b>pulse</b> from the input (lower panel) for the Mamyshev 2R regenerator. Note how the noisy 1's pulses are boosted to same power levels in the output, while the 0's pulses are reduced to the noise floor.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{spectral}} filtering process, the <b>regenerated</b> <b>pulse</b> is intrinsically {{shifted from the}} original frequency. This can be beneficial if wavelength conversion is to be achieved simultaneously the regeneration and therefore channel switching can be considered. However, if one wants to recover an output signal having the initial wavelength, an option of applying another regeneration with the BPF center frequency placed at the original channel center frequency allows to overcome this problem. Note {{that this can be}} done in a single fiber using a bidirectional propagation in the nonlinear fiber.|$|E
40|$|Systems that adopt organic {{scintillation}} detector arrays often require a calibration process {{prior to the}} intended measurement campaign to correct for significant performance variances between detectors within the array. These differences exist because of low tolerances associated with photo-multiplier tube technology and environmental influences. Differences in detector response can be corrected for by adjusting the supplied photo-multiplier tube voltage to control its gain and the effect that this has on the pulse height spectra from a gamma-only calibration source with a defined photo-peak. Automated methods that analyze these spectra and adjust the photo-multiplier tube bias accordingly are emerging for hardware that integrate acquisition electronics and high voltage control. However, development of such algorithms require access to the hardware, multiple detectors and calibration source for prolonged periods, all with associated constraints and risks. In this work, we report on a software function and related models developed to rescale and regenerate pulse height data acquired from a single {{scintillation detector}}. Such a function {{could be used to}} generate significant and varied pulse height data {{that can be used to}} integration-test algorithms that are capable of automatically response matching multiple detectors using pulse height spectra analysis. Furthermore, a function of this sort removes the dependence on multiple detectors, digital analyzers and calibration source. Results show a good match between the real and <b>regenerated</b> <b>pulse</b> height data. The function has also been used successfully to develop auto-calibration algorithms...|$|E
50|$|In brief, {{because it}} is very easy to <b>regenerate</b> <b>pulses</b> at the {{receiver}} into the ideal form transmitted. The only part of the transmitted waveform required at the receiver is the time at which the pulse occurred. Given the timing information the transmitted waveform can be reconstructed electronically with great precision. In contrast, without conversion to a pulse stream but simply transmitting the analog signal directly, all noise in the system is added to the analog signal, permanently reducing its quality.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{stochastic}} dynamics of a semiconductor neuron that uses the non-linear conductances of modulation doped semiconductors to compute electrical spikes. This GaAs-based neuron has pn wires which propagate and delay electrical pulses and a soma which sums and <b>regenerates</b> <b>pulses</b> through the positive feedback of a quantum tunnel amplifier vertically integrated with the wire. The neuron exhibits the property of excitability: it responds with a spike to a perturbation that exceeds a certain threshold value, and remains silent if the perturbation is small. When exciting the neuron with a sub-threshold periodic signal, a superimposed random noise is shown to enhance the coherence of the output pulse train. We perform a systematic study of stochastic resonance and coherence resonance {{as a function of}} excitation parameters and analyze output spectra using statistical tools...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a spatial neuron that sums and <b>regenerates</b> electrical <b>pulses</b> in real time. The neuron uses a monolithic web of micro-transmission lines to propagate electrical pulses to a 'soma' {{where they are}} regenerated via quantum tunnelling amplification. The gain of the neuron follows a sigmoid curve {{similar to the one}} that controls the firing of real neurons. We report on the dependence of the regeneration threshold on bias parameters and obtain a good fit of the measured threshold by computing the stability diagram of the soma. The neuron is shown to <b>regenerate</b> coincident <b>pulses</b> with a timing sensitivity of 10 Î¼s compared to milliseconds for real neurons. The present design demonstrates that the physics underpinning analogue computation in biological neurons has an equivalent in modern semiconductor structures...|$|R
40|$|DE 10212576 A UPAB: 20031128 NOVELTY - Pulses (I 1 -In) of an RZ signal (1) to be re-shaped, having similar mean power, are coupled {{out of the}} {{transmission}} path. They are amplified (2) to a mean pulse power exceeding the soliton power. This power level causes width compression {{as a result of}} non-linear effects, in certain optical fibers. The amplified pulses are then passed through an optical fiber path (3) having positive dispersion and a defined length, until they have all been compressed to the same pulse width and amplitude. They therefore have almost identical pulse shape. They are passed through an attenuation section (4), reducing them to normal transmission power levels. They are coupled back into {{the transmission}} path as a regenerated output signal (5). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for corresponding optical pulse-shaping equipment. USE - To <b>regenerate</b> <b>pulses</b> by optical means, in an optical transmission network. ADVANTAGE - The method and equipment described, offer a very simple means of regeneration. The shaping procedure is carried out within an optical fiber. During this stage there is no conversion into electrical signals and no integrated optical components with semiconductor amplifiers are required...|$|R

Although peak local values of ice water content may occur early in the storm lifetime, large areas of high concentrations expand with time and persist even when the storm tops begin to warm.

50|$|Each pulse {{is made up}} of a step up {{followed}} after a short interval by a step down. It is possible, even in {{the presence}} of electronic noise, to recover the timing of these steps and from that <b>regenerate</b> the transmitted <b>pulse</b> stream almost noiselessly. Then the accuracy of the transmission process reduces to the accuracy with which the transmitted pulse stream represents the input waveform.|$|R
50|$|Reeves {{recognised}} {{the potential}} that pulse-code modulation had for reducing noise when speech is transmitted over long distances. With an analogue signal, {{every time the}} signal is amplified, the noise contained in the signal is also amplified and new, additional noise is added. With pulse code modulation, all that is required is to <b>regenerate</b> the <b>pulses,</b> hence the noise content of the signal is not increased. Reeves patented the invention in 1938. Unfortunately his idea required quite complex circuitry (by 1930s standards), that was not cost-effective, using valves. Pulse code modulation was not used commercially until the 1950s, when {{the invention of the}} transistor made it viable, although it was used by Bell Telephone Laboratories during the Second World War for secure communications links, such as the SIGSALY system used for encrypted voice communications between Roosevelt and Churchill.|$|R
50|$|Note that {{digital systems}} do not suffer {{from many of}} these effects at a signal level, though the same {{processes}} occur in the circuitry, since the data being handled is symbolic. As long as the symbol survives the transfer between components, and can be perfectly <b>regenerated</b> (e.g., by <b>pulse</b> shaping techniques) the data itself is perfectly maintained. The data is typically buffered in a memory, and is clocked out by a very precise crystal oscillator. The data usually does not degenerate as it passes through many stages, because each stage regenerates new symbols for transmission.|$|R
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the proof of principle of a semiconductor neuron, which has dendrites, axon, and a soma and computes information encoded in electrical pulses {{in the same way}} as biological neurons. Electrical impulses applied to dendrites diffuse along microwires to the soma. The soma is the active part of the neuron, which <b>regenerates</b> input <b>pulses</b> above a voltage threshold and transmits them into the axon. Our concept of neuron is a major step forward because its spatial structure controls the timing of pulses, which arrive at the soma. Dendrites and axon act as transmission delay lines, which modify the information, coded in the timing of pulses. We have finally shown that noise enhances the detection sensitivity of the neuron by helping the transmission of weak periodic signals. A maximum enhancement of signal transmission was observed at an optimum noise level known as stochastic resonance. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with simulations of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Our neuron is therefore extremely well suited to providing feedback on the various mathematical approximations of neurons and building functional networks...|$|R
40|$|The {{hairy vetch}} (Vicia villosa Roth) is a climbing, {{prostrate}} or trailing legume grown as forage. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reduces soil erosion and provides an instant mulch. Multiple axillary shoot regeneration from a mature seed explant (zygotic embryo with two cotyledons) was obtained on MS medium containing 0. 05 - 1. 6 mg/l TDZ {{with or without}} 0. 10 mg/l IBA. The frequency (%) of shoot regeneration ranged from 45. 83 - 75. 00 % with a maximum number of 28. 6 shoots per explant on MS medium containing 0. 20 mg/l TDZ- 0. 10 mg/l IBA. The mean shoot length decreased proportionately with each increase in TDZ concentration irrespective of the IBA concentration in the culture medium. However, comparing {{the two types of}} regeneration media, longer shoots were recorded in the presence of IBA in the culture medium. <b>Regenerated</b> shoots were <b>pulse</b> treated with 50 mg/l IBA for 5, 10 and 20 min for rooting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: When {{agricultural}} {{lands in}} formerly dry forest are abandoned, chronic disturbance by livestock grazing and wood extraction may set back successional processes precluding older dry forest structure from be reached. We compare cacti density, richness, diversity and evenness in twelve 50 Ã 50 m plots: six plots in secondary dry forest and six plots in older conserved dry forest at Sierra de Huautla, Central Mexico. Cacti were identifi ed, the life-form of each species was recorded and size was measured to assign individuals into four life-stage classes. Nine cacti species were registered across both forest types. In this dry forest, richness, diversity and evenness of cacti community increased in sites under chronic disturbance, whereas density was not signi-fi cantly affected. Size structure at community {{level in the}} conserved forest showed an increase of individuals with size, whereas in the secondary forest, size structure showed an uneven distribution of individuals, as in populations that <b>regenerate</b> by <b>pulses.</b> In the secondary forest, there was a lower proportion of adults {{and they were in}} average, smaller than those in the conserved forest. Chronic disturbance may eventually change cacti community structure, affecting animals that depend on large arboreal cacti for food, perches and/or refuge; therefore, maintenance of biodiversity will be at stake.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{bandwidth}} in worldwide data networks {{continues to increase}} due to growing Internet use and high-bandwidth applications such as video. All-optical signal processing is one promising technique for providing the necessary capacity and offers payload transparency, power consumption which scales efficiently with increasing bit rates, reduced processing latency, and ultrafast performance. In this thesis, we focus on using semiconductor optical amplifier-based logic gates to address both routing and regeneration needs in ultrafast data networks. To address routing needs, we demonstrate a scalable, multi-packet all-optical header processing unit operating at a line rate of 40 Gb/s. For this experiment, we used the ultrafast nonlinear interferometer (UNI) gate, a discrete optical logic gate which has been demonstrated at speeds of 100 Gb/s for bit-wise switching. However, for all-optical switching to become a reality, integration is necessary to significantly {{reduce the cost of}} manufacturing, installation, and operation. One promising integrated all-optical logic gate is the semiconductor optical amplifier Mach-Zehnder interferometer (SOA-MZI). This gate has previously been demonstrated capable of up to 80 Gb/s bit-wise switching operation. To enable simple installation and operation of this gate, we developed a performance optimization method which can quickly and accurately pinpoint the optimal operating point of the switch. This eliminates the need for a time-intensive search over a large parameter space and significantly simplifies the operation of the switch. With this method, we demonstrate the ability of a single SOA-MZI logic gate to <b>regenerate</b> ultrafast <b>pulses</b> over 100 passes and 10, 000 km in a regenerative loop. Ultimately, all-optical logic gates must be integrated on a single low-cost platform and demonstrated in cascaded, multi-gate operation for increased functionality. (cont.) This requires low-loss monolithic integration. Our approach to this involves an asymmetric twin waveguide (ATG) design. This design also has the potential for high-yields {{as a result of a}} high tolerance for fabrication errors.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{a pool of}} flagellar precursors, assayed by {{the ability}} of cells to regenerate flagella {{in the absence of}} de novo protein synthesis, has been examined during organelle morpho-genesis in the biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas. The results demonstrate that flagellar elongation can continue even when this pool is apparently empty and suggest that 2 sources of precursors are available to the regenerating flagella: those pre-existing in the cellular pool and those synthesized de novo. Further evidence for this was obtained by subjecting <b>regenerating</b> cells to <b>pulses</b> of cycloheximide. Cells exposed to this drug during the first 60 min post deflagellation formed only half-length (5 -/im) flagella, whereas a pulse administered after this point allowed the formation of longer flagella and suggested that some de novo protein synthesis was required for the formation of full-length flagella, although it was not a prerequisite for the initiation of regeneration. In addition, it was found that, subsequent to the removal of the cycloheximide, flagellar regeneration did not recommence immediately, but was delayed for a period of approximately 45 min, irrespective of length of flagella formed prior to drug inhibition. The nature of this cycloheximide-induced delay is unclear and certain alternatives, based on the exhaustion of structural/regulatory components are considered. Although {{it is not possible to}} distinguish between these alternatives, tubulin is not the limiting component, since a pool of this protein is present when flagellar elongation is prevented by cycloheximide...|$|R
