40|$|In {{the process}} that leads a {{flawless}} Nb{sub 3 }Sn <b>round</b> <b>strand</b> {{to become part of}} a Rutherford cable first, and of a coil next, the same cabling process affects strands of different kinds in different ways, from filament shearing to subelement merging to composite decoupling. Due to plastic deformation, after cabling the filament size distributions in a strand usually change. The average filament size typically increases, as does the width of the distribution. This is consistent with the low field transport current of strands in cables being typically lower and less reproducible than for round strands [1]. To better understand the role of filament size in instabilities and to simulate cabling deformations, strands to be used in cables can be tested by rolling them down to decreasing sizes to cover an ample range of relative deformations. A procedure is herein proposed that uses both microscopic analysis and macroscopic measurements of material properties to study the effects of deformation...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design is presented for the 50 Tesla superconducting solenoids {{that are required}} for an optimized fast cooling ring in current designs for multi-TeV muon colliders. The solenoid utilizes high-performance multifilament Bi- 2212 /Ag <b>round</b> <b>strand.</b> The conductor is a cable-in-conduit consisting of six such strands cabled around a thin-wall spring tube then drawn within an outer sheath. The spring tube and the sheath are made from high-strength superalloy Inconel. The solenoid coil comprises 5 concentric shells supported independently in the conventional manner. Each shell consists of a winding of the structured cable, impregnated in the voids between cables but empty inside so that the spring tubes decouple stress so that it cannot straindegrade the fragile strands, and a high-E stress shell. An expansion bladder is located between the winding and the stress shell. It is pressurized and then frozen to provide hydraulic compressive preload to each shell. These provisions {{makes it possible to}} accommodate ~ 10 T field contribution from each shell without degradation, and to distribute refrigeration so that heat is removed throughout the volume of the windings...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{sustained}} {{interest in the}} development of the Bi 2212 /Ag round wire (RW) because of its unique potential for applications in high-field magnets (25 T or higher). The Bi 2212 conductor is a <b>round</b> <b>strand,</b> which is a very favorable shape to produce multistage twisted cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs) for the next fusion machine (DEMO). One drawback of Bi 2212 is its fragile mechanical properties. The stress and strain accumulated during cabling, the thermal contraction during cooldown, and the electromagnetic load can have a severe impact on the transport properties of the Bi 2212 RW. In order to investigate the strain distribution of Bi 2212 in CICC, some research and development work was made at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP). A simple cable wound with three Bi 2212 RWs was manufactured and subjected to mechanical tests. A numerical model was proposed to analyze the stress-strain distribution of a wire inside a cable at cryogenic temperature. Comparisons were made between the model and experimental results. Based on the results and improved understanding of the mechanical behavior, an optimization could be implemented to reduce the Bi 2212 cable degradation, in terms of conductor design, manufacture, and operation...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} presents {{research work}} on the bond behaviour of in concrete embedded one-layered <b>round</b> <b>strand</b> ropes 6 x 19 Standard. The essay reports about experimental tests and theoretical modeling of the embedded wire ropes. The investigation on the bond of embedded steel wire ropes is based on already available knowledge about pure steel wire ropes and the bond behaviour of conventional types of reinforcement. The affinity of bond behaviour of reinforcing steel bar and prestressing strands are used {{to develop a new}} material model. Experimental tests are the base of modeling. Global bond behaviour was analysed by RILEM-pull-out tests. The tests studied the influence of concrete strength, rope geometry and bond length. Thereby the usual setup was modified to account for the special properties of the ropes. Another testing series showed the material behaviour of the cement paste penetrated wire rope. It‘s possible to describe the strain behaviour of the rope along its embedded length based on these tests. The developed bond model describes bond behaviour {{as a function of the}} bond stress-slip relation. This function depends on concrete strength and the rope geometry. The nonlinear material behaviour of the “concrete wire rope ” is formulated by its tangent modulus of elasticity. Furthermore a specified secant modulus of the “concrete wire rope“ can be used in case of low stresses. Calculation and analysing of bond behaviour along a defined embedding length by adapted differential equations are possible. The analysing by FEM is getting feasible as well. ...|$|E

Liquid {{metal flow}} {{behavior}} in <b>round</b> <b>strands</b> continuous casting under intermittently reversing direction electromagnetic stirring {{was measured by}} ultrasonic Doppler velocity-meter in a physical simulation system in order to investigate the effects of time interval (i t) of periodically reversed magnetic field on the spatial and temporal flow. The results show that under electromagnetic stirring with direction reserved magnetic field, there’s a periodically change of the metal flow velocity and rotation direction with the periodically direction changing of the magnetic field. From both the experimental and mathematical model calculation results, {{it is found that}} when i t is nearly equal to the time required for the metal flow speeding to the maximum velocity from still and decreases to zero again, there is a critical value of the rate of dynamic pressure, which means the wash effect of the liquid metal flow.

50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are <b>round</b> <b>strands</b> as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned {{in such a way that}} they are non-rotating which means that under tension the rope torque is nearly zero.The open spiral rope consists only of round wires. The half-locked coil rope and the full-locked coil rope always have a centre made of round wires. The locked coil ropes have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.|$|R
40|$|Integrases, {{such as that}} of the Streptomyces {{temperate}} bacteriophage ϕC 31, promote {{site-specific recombination}} between DNA sequences in the bacteriophage and bacterial genomes to integrate or excise the phage DNA. ϕC 31 integrase belongs to the serine recombinase family, a large group of structurally related enzymes with diverse biological functions. It has been proposed that serine integrases use a “subunit rotation” mechanism to exchange DNA strands after double-strand DNA cleavage at the two recombining att sites, and that many rounds of subunit rotation can occur before the strands are religated. We have analyzed the mechanism of ϕC 31 integrase-mediated recombination in a topologically constrained experimental system using hybrid “phes” recombination sites, each of which comprises a ϕC 31 att site positioned adjacent to a regulatory sequence recognized by Tn 3 resolvase. The topologies of reaction products from circular substrates containing two phes sites support a right-handed subunit rotation mechanism for catalysis of both integrative and excisive recombination. Strand exchange usually terminates after a single round of 180 ° rotation. However, multiple processive “ 360 ° rotation” <b>rounds</b> of <b>strand</b> exchange can be observed, if the recombining sites have nonidentical base pairs at their centers. We propose that a regulatory “gating” mechanism normally blocks multiple <b>rounds</b> of <b>strand</b> exchange and triggers product release after a single round...|$|R

Within the High Field Magnet Project, the first prototypes feature 1 meter long two-layer shell-type coils and common coils. For the former, keystoned Rutherford-type cable made of 28 Nb{sub 3 }Sn strands 1 mm in diameter are used, whereas {{for the latter}} a 60 -strand flat cable was chosen.

An experimental cabling machine with up to 28 -strand capacity that has been recently purchased, installed and commissioned at Fermilab, has allowed further advances in strand and cable studies.

40|$|Conjugal {{transfer}} of the broad-host-range plasmid R 1162 is initiated and terminated at the nic site within the 38 -bp origin of transfer (oriT). Termination involves ligation of the transferred single strand by the plasmid-encoded MobA protein. Several different assays were used to identify the oriT DNA required for termination. For plasmids containing two oniTs, with transfer initiated at one and terminated at the other, the inverted repeat within oniT is- important for termination. Deletion of the outer arm reduces the termination frequency-, those terminations that do occur probably depend upon nicking at this oriT prior to transfer. The locations of second-site suppressor mutations indicate that base pairing between {{the arms of the}} inverted repeat is important for termination. In vitro, the inverted repeat is not required for specific cleavage of single-stranded DNA at nic, but competition experiments indicate that oriTs with the inverted repeat are preferentially cleaved.
