5|$|During the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 {{had become one of}} the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.|$|E
25|$|William Niskanen {{noted that}} during the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> privately held federal debt {{increased}} from 22% to 38% of GDP, despite a long peacetime expansion.

Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years.</b> The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.|$|E
25|$|With Ronald Reagan's {{victory in}} 1980 the modern American {{conservative}} movement took power. Republicans {{took control of}} the Senate {{for the first time since}} 1954, and conservative principles dominated Reagan's economic and foreign policies, with supply side economics and strict opposition to Soviet Communism defining the Administration's philosophy. Reagan's ideas were largely espoused and supported by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which grew dramatically in its influence during the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> extended to a second term by the 1984 presidential election, as Reagan and his senior aides looked to Heritage for policy guidance.|$|E
25|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key {{economic}} variables examined, the American economy performed better during the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years</b> than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.|$|E

500|$|Some {{hardcore}} punk bands made {{a conscious}} decision to avoid putting Reagan in their lyrics. In wanting his music to outlast the administration, [...] Washington, D.C. musician Ian MacKaye, who was in the bands Minor Threat, Embrace, Pailhead, and Fugazi during the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> has said, [...] "I remember clearly resisting the urge to put the word 'Reagan' in any of the songs". In the late 1980s U.S. skinheads spearheaded a patriotic right-wing faction within the New York hardcore scene, and although bands like Agnostic Front and Cro Mags did not reference the president directly in their lyrics, their support of Reagan fell within their interpretation of patriotic backlash that reimagined hardcore without the antiestablishment ethos of punk rock. Some groups' stances on the president were a bit more ambiguous. When the drunk-rock group Murphy's Law praised Reagan and his films in their 1986 song [...] "California Pipeline," [...] fans could take it as either actual pro-Republican patriotism, or a tongue-in-cheek take on anti-Reagan irony. By the late 1980s, reference to Reagan in hardcore music had become so commonplace that the joke was no longer on the president, but on a punk scene where bands were practically obliged to put a Reagan song on their setlist or album.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} have criticized a pervasive shift in NASA culture away from safety {{in order to}} ensure that launches took place in a timely fashion, sometimes called [...] "go fever". Allegedly, NASA upper-level management embraced this decreased safety focus in the 1980s while some engineers remained wary. According to Vaughan, the aggressive launch schedules arose in the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years</b> as a way to rehabilitate America's post-Vietnam prestige.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Reagan</b> <b>years</b> {{were marked}} by a renewed push for capitalism, business, with {{national}} efforts to de-regulate industries such as telecommunications and aviation. The economy resumed upward growth after a period in the early 1980s of languishing. A report in The New York Times described that the flushness of money and growth during these years had spawned a drug culture of sorts, with a rampant acceptance of cocaine use although the overall percent of actual users was most likely small.

2500|$|The {{economic}} {{conditions of the}} <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> coupled with tax incentives for home businesses, helped propel Melco {{to the top of}} the market. [...] At the Show of the Americas in 1980, Melco unveiled the Digitrac, a digitizing system for embroidery machines. The digitized design was composed at six times the size of the embroidered final product. The Digitrac consisted of a small computer, similar in size to a BlackBerry, mounted on an X and Y axis on a large white board. It sold for $30,000. The original single-needle sample head sold for $10,000 and included a 1" [...] paper-tape reader and 2 fonts.

2500|$|The {{long career}} {{of the series}} and continual use of real-life {{political}} figures, analysts note, have led to some uncanny cases of the cartoon foreshadowing a national shift in the politicians’ political fortunes. Tina Gianoulis in St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture observes that [...] "In 1971, well before the conservative <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> a forward-looking BD called Ronald Reagan his 'hero.' In 1984, almost ten years before Congressman Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, another character worried that he would 'wake up someday in a country run by Newt Gingrich.'" [...] In its 2003 series [...] "John Kerry: A Candidate in the Making" [...] on the 2004 presidential race, the Boston Globe reprinted and discussed 1971 Doonesbury cartoons of the young Kerry's Vietnam War protest speeches.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have criticized}} {{elements}} of Reaganomics {{on the basis}} of equity. For example, economist John Kenneth Galbraith believed that the Reagan administration actively used the Laffer curve [...] "to lower taxes on the affluent". Some critics point out that tax revenues almost always rise every year, and during Reagan's two terms increases in tax revenue were more shallow than increases during presidencies where top marginal tax rates were higher. Critics also point out that since the Reagan tax cuts, income has not significantly increased {{for the rest of the}} population. [...] This assertion is supported by studies that show the income of the top 1% nearly doubling during the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> while income for other income levels increased only marginally; income actually decreased for the bottom quintile.|$|E
2500|$|In {{stating that}} his {{intention}} was to lower taxes, Reagan's approach was a departure from his immediate predecessors. Reagan enacted lower marginal tax rates as well as simplified income tax codes and continued deregulation. During Reagan's presidency, the annual deficits averaged 4.2% of GDP after inheriting an annual deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 1980 under president Carter. The real (inflation adjusted) rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. GDP per working-age adult had increased at only a 1.15% annual rate during the Carter administration; increased at a 1.8% rate during the Reagan administration. The increase in productivity growth was even higher: output per hour in the business sector had been roughly constant in the Carter years, increased at a 1.4% rate in the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years.</b> However, Federal net outlays as percent of Gross Domestic Product was higher under Ronald Reagan than under Jimmy Carter ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in his term, Bush {{faced the}} problem {{of what to do}} with {{leftover}} deficits spawned by the <b>Reagan</b> <b>years.</b> At $220billion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times its size since 1980. This financial situation severely limited the President's ability to enact major domestic programs. The federal government did not have the revenues for any large, new domestic ventures, nor did the political climate lend itself to enacting them. To compensate for these constraints, Bush stressed [...] "a limited agenda," [...] that included volunteerism, education reform, and anti-drug efforts. Having pledged during the campaign not to raise taxes, the President found himself in the difficult position of trying to balance the budget and reduce the deficit without imposing additional taxes on the American people. He also faced a Congress controlled by the Democrats. Although Republicans thought that the government should approach the budget deficit by drastically cutting domestic spending, the Democrats wanted to raise taxes on the richest Americans. Budget negotiations for the 1991 fiscal year proved especially contentious and problematic. Bush had no choice but to compromise with Congress, and his administration entered into lengthy talks with congressional leaders. Bush issued a written statement to the press, reneging on his 1988 [...] "no new taxes" [...] campaign promise, noting that tax increases might be necessary to solve the deficit problem.|$|E
