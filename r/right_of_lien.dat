40|$|The Bankruptcy Code {{has reached}} a {{delicate}} balance between protecting the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> secured creditors and providing financially troubled companies with flexibility in reorganizing their businesses. One protection that has been available to secured creditors {{is the right to}} 2 ̆ 2 credit bid 2 ̆ 2 at any sale of collateral free <b>of</b> <b>liens,</b> which allows the creditor to buy the property by offsetting its claim against the purchase price instead of paying cash. This right is designed to assure that property is not sold free of security interests at a price that is below the collateral 2 ̆ 7 s true value. An inadequate sales price deprives the creditor of the full benefit of its security interest. The importance of credit bidding has grown as asset sales have become more common in chapter 11 cases. Despite the universal view during the past three decades that the right to credit bid was essentially guaranteed when property is sold under a chapter ii plan, two recent controversial decisions-the Fifth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in In re Pacific Lumber Co. and the Third Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC-curtailed this protection by holding that a secured lender may be denied the right to credit bid when its collateral is sold under a chapter -i plan if the bankruptcy court makes a judicial finding that the creditor will realize the 2 ̆ 2 indubitable equivalent 2 ̆ 2 of its secured claim without credit bidding. These recent circuit court decisions have shifted the balance between the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>lien</b> holders and the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> financially troubled borrowers in a way that affords less protection to secured creditors and greater flexibility to chapter ii debtors. This Article analyzes these cases and discusses the impact these decisions will have on the chapter ir sale process, creditor expectations and behavior, and the cost and availability of credit. This Article will also discuss the recent Seventh Circuit decision in River Road Hotel Partners, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, which rejected the Third Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning in Philadelphia Newspapers, thereby causing a circuit split. The Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to review the Seventh Circuit decision, is likely to resolve these important issues soon...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} Serbian {{mortgage}} {{law is not}} too long. The mortgage law began in first half of XIX century. The first Act about mortgage was The Intabulation Law from 1839. year. Mortgage is a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>lien</b> on an immovable which authorizes the creditor to seek satisfaction of his claim {{for the value of}} such immovable before of other creditors that do not have mortgage on it, as well as before creditors who have acquired mortgage on such immovable subsequent on him, irrespective of a contingent change of owner of the encumbered immovable. The mortgage was based on some rules. The mortgage is accessory rights. One of the basic features of a security right is its dependence on the claim. The mortgage creditor is entitled to request satisfaction of the claim from the value of immovable encumbered by mortgage, regardless of whether it is still in possession of the mortgage debitor or it has been convened into ownership of a third party. This The Intabulation Law is changed twice. For the first time in 1842 year, and second time in 1853. year. The lack of both changes was missing the principle of speciality. Principle of speciality marks the fact that a guarantee (security), may secure only a definite claim of one creditor and that the guarantee may exist only on a definite set of objects (assets). On one hand speciality of real security interest forbids securing an indefinite number of claims or an indefinite amount of claim, and, on the other, forbids the prospect of indefinite assets, or all assets of the debitor be subject of to such a security interest. This lack are eliminate in the new Intabulation Law from 1854. year, which was incorporated into Serbian Civil Code from 1844. year. The subject of this article is The Intabulation Law from 1854. year...|$|E

40|$|The South African law {{acknowledges}} {{two types}} <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> or <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> retention, namely enrichment liens and contractual liens (also known as debtor and creditor liens). Enrichment liens {{are regarded as}} limited real rights which are enforceable against {{the owner of the}} thing. Contractual liens are not regarded as limited real rights: sometimes they are referred to as personal rights which are enforceable only inter partes. Thus, a lien is classified as a right (subjektiewe reg) (ie a real right or a personal right). This article reflects on the correctness of this classification <b>of</b> <b>liens.</b> The term "right" can have various meanings and the aim {{of this article is to}} determine the exact meaning of the term "right" in the context of "right of retention". In my opinion a lien is not a right. I therefore reject the classification <b>of</b> <b>liens</b> into contractual liens and enrichment liens with its concomitant consequences. A lien is a defence against an ownerʹs rei vindicatio in that it allows a creditor (a lienholder) to retain control of the ownerʹs thing until the debt has been paid. Because the law grants a defence to a creditor in control of a thing, the owner cannot succeed with her rei vindicatio. A distinction should be drawn between an entitlement that flows from a right (it describes the content <b>of</b> the <b>right)</b> and a competency or capacity which emanates directly from the law. A lien is not an entitlement flowing from a lienholderʹs personal right - based on a contract or an enrichment claim - against the debtor. It is rather a capacity to withhold because the law grants this defence. The term "capacity" is not used in a technical sense but rather in the context of the ability to withhold, which is granted by the law...|$|R

Therefore releasing a lien is a delicate process, because lien claimants generally want to be paid before they release the lien, and the liened party wants the lien released before they make payment. Unlike a lien waiver which negates the right to file a lien in the future, a lien release cancels a lien {{that has already been}} placed.|$|R
