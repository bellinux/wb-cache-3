5|$|After the {{completion}} of sea trials which began in 2014 the USS Zumwalt was officially commissioned into the US Navy on October 15, 2016 at Baltimore, Maryland. However, in November, 2016 the principal and only ammunition for the Zumwalt's two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems, the Long <b>Range</b> <b>Land</b> Attack Projectile, was cancelled due to increased costs. USS Zumwalt is currently assigned to the US Pacific Fleet and is homeported in San Diego, California.|$|E
5|$|The navy {{has looked}} into {{creating}} precision guided artillery rounds {{for use with}} the current fleet of cruisers and destroyers. The most recent attempt to modify the guns for longer range came with the Advanced Gun System mounts that were to be installed aboard the Zumwalt-class destroyers, although the navy {{has been involved in}} the Long <b>Range</b> <b>Land</b> Attack Projectile and Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition projects for over 10 years in an effort to develop Extended Range Guided Munitions.|$|E
5|$|The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly. The {{shores of}} the bay were {{initially}} home to farms and ranches. Longhorn cattle, which had roamed wild throughout Texas, became free resources for producing hides and beef shipped throughout North America. The famed Allen Ranch was established near Harrisburg {{in what is now}} southeast Houston and Pasadena, in addition to the Bay Lake Ranch and other ranches established around the bay. The <b>range</b> <b>land</b> of these ranches came to encompass most of the terrain around the bay south of the San Jacinto River. Cedar Bayou (part of modern Baytown), Shoal Point (part of modern Texas City), and other small communities began to develop during this period. Eagle Point (part of modern San Leon) became an important shipping and trading post for slaves.|$|E

40|$|Revegetating {{deteriorated}} <b>range</b> <b>lands</b> by sowing adaptable, nutritious, and palatable grasses {{is vital}} for adequate forage production in the Intermountain region, for profitable livestock raising, and as a safeguard against flood and erosion damage. The effect of serious droughts, greatly aggravated by overstocking, {{has resulted in the}} replacement of valuable perennial grasses by annual weeds and grasses that have much less value as forage for livestock or for proper soil protection. The abandonment of unsuccessful submarginal croplands has also added greatly to the vast acreage of deteriorated but potentially productive <b>range</b> <b>lands</b> of the region in need of revegetation. Proper guides and procedure for revegetating run-down ranges and abandoned dry farms by artificial reseeding are necessary to safeguard against costly pitfalls and to insure reasonable success.

25|$|While {{originally}} {{developed as a}} tool for <b>range</b> <b>land</b> use and restoring desertified land, the holistic management system can be applied to other areas with multiple complex socioeconomic and environmental factors. One such example is Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), which promotes sector integration in development and management of water resources to ensure that water is allocated between different users in a fair way, maximizing economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. In essence, coordinated holistic water management takes into consideration all water users in nature and society. Another example is mine reclamation. A fourth use of Holistic management is in certain forms of no till crop production, intercropping, and permaculture. Holistic management has been acknowledged by The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS).|$|E
25|$|The Marine Bombing Squadrons {{were formed}} during World War II {{to fill the}} need for a long <b>range,</b> <b>land</b> based bomber that could be used against enemy {{shipping}} and submarines. In the Pacific Theater, the squadrons served ashore as a garrison air force to attack bypassed Japanese bases and other installations. The VMBs flew the North American PBJ-1 Mitchell, which was the naval version of the U.S. Army Air Forces' B-25 Mitchell. Sixteen of these squadrons were commissioned with seven serving in combat, four never able to leave the U.S. due to the war ending and four others converted to VMTB squadrons. The seven PBJ squadrons that saw combat in the Pacific suffered the loss of 45 aircraft, 26 in combat and 19 in non-combat operations, and 173 crew: 62 officers and 111 enlisted men.|$|E

This important industry has, from the time of its introduction, been closely associated with the use of public <b>range</b> <b>lands.</b> The unrestricted grazing of public <b>range</b> <b>lands</b> resulted in damage to a considerable area and was one of the important factors that led to the establishment of federal agencies to administer these properties...|$|R
25|$|When Mosby {{returned}} to Washington in 1901, {{during the second}} term of the McKinley administration (wary during the first term because of McKinley's service in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War, {{as well as being}} perceived as just another office-seeker), he again sought a job in the Justice Department. After McKinley's assassination, President Theodore Roosevelt instead sent Mosby west as a special agent of the Department of the Interior. There, Mosby dealt with illegal fencing of <b>range</b> <b>land</b> by cattle barons in Colorado and Nebraska, who often used fake homestead claims by military widows as well as violated the Van Wyck Fence Law of 1885. When witnesses refused to come forward to testify about illegal fencing for fear of retaliation, Mosby upheld the law by first sending notices to the affected landowner. The Pawnee Cattle Company capitulated in Colorado, so Mosby moved on to western Nebraska, where he learned the land agent actually lived in Iowa and failed to supervise the range.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate over}} battleships {{in the modern}} navy {{continued}} until 2006, when the two reinstated battleships were stricken after naval officials submitted a two-part plan that called for the near-term goal of increasing {{the range of the}} guns currently in use on the Flight I Arleigh Burke-class destroyers with specially designed ammunition intended to allow a 5-inch projectile fired from these guns to travel an estimated [...] inland. The long-term goal calls for the replacement of the two battleships with vessels of the [...] of guided-missile destroyers. These ships are to be outfitted with an advanced gun system (AGS) that will fire specially developed 6-inch Long <b>Range</b> <b>Land</b> Attack Projectiles for shore bombardment; however, the long-term goal for the Zumwalt class is to have the ships mount railguns or free-electron lasers.|$|E
500|$|The {{result of}} the latter effort to design and build a {{replacement}} ship for the two battleships was the [...] program, also known either as the DD(X) or DDG-1000 (in reference to the hull number assigned to Zumwalt). The DD(X) was to mount a pair of Advanced Gun System turrets capable of firing specially designed Long <b>Range</b> <b>Land</b> Attack Projectiles some [...] inland. Originally, the navy had planned to build a total of 32 of these destroyers, however the increasing cost of the program led the navy to reduce {{the overall number of}} destroyers built from 32 to 24. In 2007 the total procurement of Zumwalt-class destroyers was further reduced to a total of seven, before being discontinued at a total of two destroyers in July 2008 as a {{result of the}} high cost of building each of the two ships. In September 2008 the navy and the House of Representatives reached an agreement which will allow for the construction of a third DD(X) destroyer, bringing the total number of Zumwalt-class destroyers to three.|$|E

Much more information is needed however in order to recommend suitable methods and species for seeding various vegetation types and genes with reasonable reliability. Throughout the arid and semi-arid <b>range</b> <b>lands,</b> moisture is the principal factor limiting satisfactory seedling establishment. Special attention should therefore be given to more efficient utilization of the moisture supply.

The agency also commissioned a study from the National Academies of Science (NAS) on wild-horse management. In September 2011, BLM announced it would begin working with the Humane Society of the United States to develop new practices in herd management and roundup, and increase its emphasis on adoptions {{and the use of}} drugs as fertility control to help better manage its wild horse herds. The results of the study by the NAS were released in June 2013, and covered a wide variety of issues, including the carrying capacity of wild horse and burro ranges, wild horse and burro population growth, and best practices in fertility control. Overall, the NAS was critical of the BLM, saying that herd populations were increasing at an [...] "unsustainable rate" [...] and that the [...] "BLM fails to effectively use contraception tools", criticizing the methods used for estimating populations and available forage, and stating that the agency has failed to communicate appropriately with the public.
