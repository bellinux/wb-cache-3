5000|$|Connections {{between the}} {{imperial}} <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> and {{the cult of}} Sol are postulated. Augustus was posthumously depicted with <b>radiate</b> <b>crown,</b> as were living emperors from Nero (after AD 65) to Constantine. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo-object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations {{that would otherwise be}} politically controversial but there is broad agreement that coin-images showing the imperial <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> are stylistically distinct from those of the solar crown of rays; the imperial <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> is depicted as a real object rather than as symbolic light. Hijmans argues that the Imperial <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> represents the honorary wreath awarded to Augustus, perhaps posthumously, to commemorate his victory at the battle of Actium; he points out that henceforth, living emperors were depicted with <b>radiate</b> <b>crowns,</b> but state divi were not. To Hijmans this implies the <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as [...] "saviour of the Republic" [...] through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios. Wreaths awarded to victors at the Actian Games were radiate.|$|R
50|$|The dupondius was {{normally}} further {{distinguished from}} the similarly sized as {{with the addition of}} a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> to the bust of the emperor in 66 AD during the reign of Nero. Using a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> to indicate double value was also markedly used on the antoninianus (double denarius) introduced by Caracalla and the double sestertius. Since dupondii minted prior to and during the reign of Nero, and occasionally under later rulers, lack the <b>radiate</b> <b>crown,</b> it is often hard to distinguish between the as and the dupondius due to heavy patina which often obscures the coin's original color.|$|R

40|$|Aim. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish peculiarities of the channels of blood supply of the telencephalon <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> of the rat in norm and in the dynamics in 6 weeks long injection of nalbuphine. Methods and results. The research work was carried out on 24 mature white male rats aged 3. 0 – 4. 5 months weighing 160 - 270 g. The method applied in the study was injection of bloodstream along with morphometric and statistical methods. Morphological and morphometric analysis of angioarchitecture of telencephalon <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> allowed to evaluate the degree of its vascularization in case of a long-term effect of nalbuphine. Conclusion. Results showed that there is a clearly observed connection between the depth of structural transformations of the parts of hemomicrocirculatory bloodstream of the rat’s <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> under the influence of opioid and the morphometric indices. The obtained results can serve as the morphologic basis for further scientific research in neurology...|$|R
50|$|A solar symbol is {{a symbol}} {{representing}} the Sun. Common solar symbols include circles with or without rays, crosses or spirals.In religious iconography, personifications of the Sun or solar attributes are indicated {{by means of a}} halo or a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{iconographic}} {{tradition of}} depicting the Sun with rays {{and with a}} human face develops in Western tradition in the high medieval period and becomes widespread in the Renaissance, harking back to the Sun god (Sol/Helios) being depicted as wearing a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> on his head in classical antiquity.|$|R
25|$|Homer {{describes}} a more-than-natural light around {{the heads of}} heroes in battle. Depictions of Perseus {{in the act of}} slaying Medusa, with lines radiating from his head, appear on a white-ground toiletry box in the Louvre and on a slightly later red-figured vase in the style of Polygnotos, ca. 450-30 BC, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On painted wares from south Italy, radiant lines or simple haloes appear on a range of mythic figures: Lyssa, a personification of madness; a sphinx; a sea demon; and Thetis, the sea-nymph who was mother to Achilles. The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the sun-god Helios and had his usual <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> (copied for the Statue of Liberty). Hellenistic rulers are often shown wearing <b>radiate</b> <b>crowns</b> that seem clearly to imitate this effect.|$|R
5000|$|A radiant or <b>radiate</b> <b>crown,</b> {{also known}} as a solar crown, sun crown, or tyrant's crown, is a crown, wreath, diadem, or other {{headgear}} symbolizing the sun or more generally powers associated with the sun. It typically takes the form of either a horned disc to represent the sun, or a curved band of points to represent rays.|$|R

In the group the Three Muses are easily recognizable.|$|R
5000|$|The radiate or Post-reform radiate (the Latin name, {{like many}} Roman coins of this time, is unknown), was a Roman coin {{introduced}} by Diocletian during his reforms. The radiate looked {{very similar to}} the Antoninianus, with a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> like Sol Invictus, apart from the absence of the [...] "XXI" [...] marking that numismatists believe indicated that the coin contained 20 parts bronze to 1 part silver. The radiate had little or no silver content. The weight varies between 2.23 and 3.44 grams.|$|R
25|$|The Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy issued coins between 1807 and 1813 in {{denominations}} of 1 and 3 centesimi and 1 soldo (plural soldi) in copper, 10 centesimi in 20% silver alloy, 5, 10 and 15 soldi, 1, 2 and 5 lire in 90% {{silver and}} 20 and 40 lire in 90% gold. All except the 10 centesimi bore {{a portrait of}} Napoleon, with the denominations below 1 lira also showing a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> and the higher denominations, a shield representing the various constituent territories of the Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|The Antoninianus, or radiate, was a coin {{used during}} the Roman Empire {{thought to have been}} valued at 2 denarii [...] It was {{initially}} silver, but was slowly debased to bronze with a minimal silver content. The coin was introduced by Caracalla in early 215, and was a silver coin similar to the denarius except that it was slightly larger and featured the emperor wearing a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown,</b> indicating that it was a double denomination. Antoniniani depicting females, usually the emperor's wife, featured the bust resting upon a crescent moon.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the last}} sestertii were struck by Aurelian (270-275 AD). During {{the end of its}} issue, when sestertii were reduced in size and quality, the double sestertius was issued first by Trajan Decius (249-251 AD) and later in large {{quantity}} by the ruler of a breakaway regime in the West, named Postumus (259-268 AD), who often used worn old sestertii to overstrike his image and legends on. The double sestertius was distinguished from the sestertius by the <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> worn by the emperor, a device used to distinguish the dupondius from the as and the Antoninianus from the denarius.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} both coins {{is typical of}} those {{associated}} with the ‘Gallic Empire’. They are of the [...] "radiate" [...] type and depict Domitianus as a bearded figure wearing a spiky or <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> representing the rays of the sun, in reference to Sol Invictus (i.e. the sun perceived as a deity lit. ‘the Unconquered Sun’). The representation is not realistic, but standardized and stereotypical and {{is very similar to}} that of the later coins of the [...] "Gallic Emperor" [...] Victorinus (269-271 AD) and the earliest of Tetricus I, the last [...] "Gallic Emperor" [...] (271-274).|$|R
5000|$|Initially the Roman Emperor Aurelian {{recognized}} Vaballathus' rule, {{perhaps because}} he was engaged {{in conflict with the}} Gallic Empire in the west and hesitated to incite open warfare with the Palmyrene Empire. This mutual recognition is testified by early coins issued by Zenobia under Vaballathus's name, but also acknowledging Aurelian as emperor. In the coins, Aurelian is shown wearing a <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> that signifies his supremacy as emperor, and Vaballathus was crowned with a laural wreath. [...] The Alexandrian minted coins showed Aurelian in his first year and Vaballathus in his fourth year [...] with Vaballathus adopting honorary titles possibly inherited from his father Odaenathus.|$|R

50|$|Mondal {{worked out}} of his Howrah studio, {{churning}} {{out a series of}} “kings” and “queens” painted with oil on canvas. These are perhaps Mondal’s best known works, depicting tragic looking figures, seemingly suffering from paranoia and fear, yet ironically termed kings and queens. Some of the highlights of this series were the works Man Acting as King, King Being Appeased, King Making Confession, and King and his Assassin. Mondal also produced a series of “deities”, which sometimes seem to merge thematically with his “queens”. The artist’s deities are generally depicted with <b>radiate</b> <b>crowns,</b> whereas his kings and queens are not. Other favorite subjects of the artist were the brothel and the harem, which he depicted in canvases such as Event in Red Light Area and Orgy.|$|R
50|$|In a later, {{even more}} {{turbulent}} era, a common coin type of Probus shows {{him in the}} <b>radiate</b> solar <b>crown</b> of the Dominate: the reverse offers Rome's Temple of Venus and dea Roma. While Probus' image shows his monarchic Imperium, Roma displays his claims to restoration of Roman tradition and Imperial unity.|$|R
500|$|Breen {{wrote that}} the <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> that the Liberty head bears is not {{dissimilar}} to those on certain Roman coins, but is [...] "more explicitly intended to recall that on the Statue of Liberty". Anthony de Francisci recalled that he opened {{the window of the}} studio and let the wind blow on his wife's hair as he worked. However, he did not feel that the design depicted her exclusively. He noted that [...] "the nose, the fullness of the mouth are much like my wife's, although the whole face has been elongated". De Francisci submitted two reverse designs; one showed a warlike eagle, aggressively breaking a sword; the other an eagle at rest, holding an olive branch. The latter design, which would form the basis for the reverse of the Peace dollar, recalled de Francisci's failed entry for the Verdun City medal. The submitted obverse is almost identical to the coin as struck, excepting certain details of the face, and that the submitted design used Roman rather than Arabic numerals for the date.|$|R
50|$|The stems <b>radiate</b> {{from the}} <b>crown</b> to a {{diameter}} of about 10 cm to over 1 m, often branching. They are usually prostrate, forming flat patches, though they may grow more upwards in shade or among taller plants.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} is the Crown weight. It has twisted ribbons, alternately colored and lacy white, which <b>radiate</b> from the <b>crown</b> from a central millefiori floret down to converge {{again at the}} base. This was first devised in the Saint Louis factory and remains popular today.|$|R
25|$|The denarius {{continued}} to decline slowly in purity, with a notable reduction instituted by Septimius Severus. This {{was followed by}} the introduction of a double denarius piece, differentiated from the denarius by the <b>radiate</b> <b>crown</b> worn by the emperor. The coin is commonly called the antoninianus by numismatists after the emperor Caracalla, who introduced the coin in early in 215. Although nominally valued at two denarii, the antoninianus never contained more than 1.6 times the amount of silver of the denarius. The profit of minting a coin valued at two denarii, but weighing only about one and a half times as much is obvious; the reaction to these coins by the public is unknown. As the number of antoniniani minted increased, the number of denarii minted decreased, until the denarius ceased to be minted in significant quantities {{by the middle of the}} third century. Again, coinage saw its greatest debasement during times of war and uncertainty. The second half of the third century was rife with this war and uncertainty, and the silver content of the antonianus fell to only 2%, losing almost any appearance of being silver. During this time the aureus remained slightly more stable, before it too became smaller and more base (lower gold content and higher base metal content) before Diocletian's reform.|$|R
50|$|The double sestertius {{was a large}} Roman coin made of {{orichalcum}} (brass) {{first issued}} by Trajan Decius in AD 249-251, {{as a response to}} the inflationary pressures of the time which had devalued the buying power of the conventional sestertius. In reality the new coin was little bigger than the traditional sestertius, which by then was being manufactured at a lower weight and smaller size than it had originally been, and was not a success. The new coin fell out of use but was revived by the rebel emperor Postumus (259-268), who ruled a breakaway empire consisting of Britain, Gaul and parts of Germany, and was keen to associate his regime with a reformed coinage system. Postumus issued his own version of the double sestertius, often taking very worn old sestertii and using these to overstrike his own portrait and legends on, probably because of a shortage of metal. After his reign, the Roman coinage system degenerated further with almost the only circulating pieces being very debased double-denarius coins, known to us as antoninianii or 'radiates' (from the use of the <b>radiate</b> <b>crown).</b> Older coins like the sestertius soon dropped entirely out of use, with many being melted down to create new radiates. By the fourth century AD even these had been discontinued and an entirely new coinage system had been created.|$|R
2500|$|In 249 AD, Philip was succeeded (or {{murdered and}} usurped) by his praetorian prefect Decius, a traditionalist ex-consul and governor. After an {{accession}} of doubtful validity, Decius justified himself as rightful [...] "restorer and saviour" [...] of Empire and its religio: {{early in his}} reign he issued a coin series of imperial divi in <b>radiate</b> (solar) <b>crowns.</b> Philip, the three Gordians, Pertinax and Claudius were omitted, presumably because Decius thought them unworthy of the honour. In the wake of religious riots in Egypt, he decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to [...] "ancestral gods" [...] or suffer a penalty: only Jews were exempt. [...] The Decian edict required that refusal of sacrifice be tried and punished at proconsular level. Apostasy was sought, rather than capital punishment. A year after its due deadline, the edict was allowed to expire and shortly after this, Decius himself died.|$|R
25|$|Maximinus Thrax (reigned 235–8 AD) sequestered the {{resources}} of state temples in Rome to pay his armies. The temples of the divi were first in line. It was an unwise move for his own posterity, as the grant or withholding of apotheosis remained an official judgment of Imperial worthiness, but the stripping of the temples of state gods caused far greater offense. Maximinus's actions more likely show need in extreme crisis than impiety, as he had his wife deified on her death but in a rare display of defiance the senate deified his murdered predecessor, then openly rebelled. His replacement, Claudius Gothicus, reigned briefly but successfully and was made a divus on his death. A succession of short-lived soldier-emperors followed. Further development in imperial cult appears to have stalled until Philip the Arab, who dedicated a statue to his father as divine in his home town of Philippopolis and brought the body of his young predecessor Gordian III to Rome for apotheosis. Coins of Philip show him in the <b>radiate</b> solar <b>crown</b> (suggestive of solar cult or a hellenised form of imperial monarchy), with Rome's temple to Venus and dea Roma on the reverse.|$|R

2500|$|The Decian edict {{appealed to}} {{whatever}} common mos maiorum might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire. Within its multitude of cults, no ancestral gods need be specified by name. The fulfillment of this sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define {{them and their}} gods as Roman. Yet despite its appeal to tradition, the Decian edict represents {{a significant departure from}} precedent. Most oaths of loyalty were collective; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives. Crisis had helped reformulate what Empire was, and what it was not: in the earliest days of the Principate, Livy had been convinced that the problems of the late Republic stemmed from impiety. The principate of Augustus had been justified by its restoration of peace and the mos maiorum. Then, as now, devotion to private and mystery cults was acceptable within limits; excessive or exclusive devotion to one cult were marks of superstition and obsession. This was not merely improper but robbed Rome's gods of their dues from its citizens. Valerian (253–60) singled out the largest and most stubbornly self-interested of these cults: he outlawed Christian assembly and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome's traditional gods. His son and co-Augustus Gallienus – himself an initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries – also identified himself with traditional Roman gods and the virtue of military loyalty. Aurelian (270–75) appealed for harmony among his soldiers (concordia militum), stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official, Hellenic form of unitary cult to the Palmyrene Sol Invictus in Rome's Campus Martius. The senate hailed him as restitutor orbis (restorer of the world) and deus et dominus natus (god and born ruler) but his intolerance of military corruption led to his murder by the Praetorians. Aurelian's immediate successors consolidated his achievements: coinage of [...] Probus (276–82) shows him in <b>radiate</b> solar <b>crown,</b> and his prolific variety of coin types include issues showing the temple of Venus and Dea Roma in Rome.|$|R
40|$|A cascade liner and <b>radiating</b> Z-pinches, a <b>crown</b> of Z-pinch are {{considered}} in the paper aiming at the investigation of dynamics of the compression of an external liner of a cascade scheme, the radiation intra a space and on the outside. The investigation of dynamics of plasma and magnetic fields in a crown of Z-pinch, processes of the current concentration on composite Z-pinch is also {{the aim of the}} paper. As a result the excess of the radiation power in a space over its power on the outside has been detected in a cascade scheme as well as the difference of a spectrum from a black-body spectrum. Instabilities of the compression of an external liner have been investigated. The filamentation explanation has been suggested. The formation of a crown, in which magnetic fields to 5 MGs are detected, has been investigated in dense Z-pinch. The energy transfer only to an evaporated crown of a filament has been revealed in composite Z-pinch. The confirmation of serviceability of a cascade scheme and the correspondence in the main of experimental data to a theoretical model at current 3 - 4 MA make it possible to extrapolate this cascade scheme on big currents.
