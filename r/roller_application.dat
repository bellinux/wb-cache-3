Objective: The {{purpose of the current}} study is the clinical and histopathological evaluation of percutaneous collagen formation in atrophic acne scars after dermal <b>roller</b> <b>application.</b> Patients and Methods: Total study duration was 26 weeks in which 12 patients received seven sessions of PCI at 3 -weeks interval, 3 mm punch biopsy specimens of scars were obtained before and after treatment (at 18 and 26 weeks). Microscopic examination of pre and post operative biopsies were done, using routine stains and Picrosirius red stain. Results: PCI induced notable improvement in the appearance of acne scars with significant reduction in the score from 123. 3 ± 24. 5 to 74. 16 ± 16. 49 (P = 0. 00) after 26 weeks. Polarized light assessment of Picrosirius red stain clarified the gradual replacement of old thick orange-red birefringent collagen fibers by newly synthesized thin green-yellow birefringent ones postoperatively.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis was carried out using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system coupled to an Agilent G 1969 A TOF-MS system. Transdermal flux values of the drugs were determined from the steady-state portion of the cumulative amount versus time curves. Following twelve hours of microneedle <b>roller</b> <b>application,</b> there was a 6. 74 -fold increase in the percutaneous penetration of tiagabine hydrochloride (86. 42 ± 25. 66 µg/cm 2 /h) compared to passive delivery (12. 83 ± 6. 30 µg/cm 2 /h). For carbamazepine in 20 % ethanol, passive transdermal flux of 7. 85 ± 0. 60 µg/cm 2 /h was observed compared to 10. 85 ± 0. 11 µg/cm 2 /h after microneedle treatment.

50|$|Engineers {{can use the}} Brinell {{hardness}} {{of materials}} in their calculations to avoid this mode of failure. A rolling element bearing's static load rating is defined to avoid this failure type. Increasing the number of elements can provide better distribution of the load, so bearings intended for a large load may have many balls, or use needles instead. This decreases the chances of brinelling, but increases friction and other factors. However, although roller and ball bearings work well for radial and thrust loading, they are often prone to brinelling when very high impact loading, lateral loading, or vibration are experienced. Babbitt bearings or bronze bushings are often used instead of <b>roller</b> bearings in <b>applications</b> where such loads exist, such as in automotive crankshafts or pulley sheaves, to decrease the possibility of brinelling by distributing the force over a very large surface area.|$|R

40|$|The roller {{swashplate}} {{bearing in}} hydraulic piston pumps is very unique in <b>applications</b> of <b>roller</b> element bearings. The main advantages {{of this type}} of bearings are low friction, very small difference between start torque and steady state torque, and no additional pressure source is required for their functioning. Therefore, better control performance and higher efficiency can be expected from piston pumps with roller swashplate bearings, compared with pumps with hydrostatic or plain ones. However, it is particularly challenging to design a roller swashplate bearing to meet the very demanding and widely varying load requirements for heavy duty off-highway machine operations, considering cost and pump size limitations. Quite different from most other <b>roller</b> bearing <b>applications,</b> a <b>roller</b> swashplate bearing for heavy duty hydraulic piston pumps is subject to (a) extremely high contact pressure between rollers and races due to high system pressure, (b) high frequency oscillating forces in three dimensions caused by the torque ripple and discharge pressure ripple inherent in pump rotating group, (c) very unfavorable local lubrication conditions when the pump is operated with no or little displacement change, and (d) sliding between rollers and races because of frequent sudden pump displacement changes. Based on the observed failure modes of bearings in this application, this paper discusses several measures to improve the fatigue life of the swashplate roller bearing for an axial swashplate type piston pump used in a heavy duty off-highway machine. Analyses, simulation results, and machine operation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed measures. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of fine machining efficiency of 34 CrMo 4 steel with <b>roller</b> burnishing tools. <b>Application</b> of <b>roller</b> burnishing process as a clean and environmentally friendly machining process which can replace other pollution processes is of great interests. It is important to evaluate the influence of material properties (primary hardness) for smoothing efficiency and achieving of lower roughness and higher work piece hardness. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of cutting outputs have been done on specimens prepared for final machining process to estimate the rate of roughness decrease, and diameter increase. Roughness measured data before and after roller burnishing process have been compared. Findings: It was found that surface roughness is significantly lower after roller burnishing. Roughness ratio (before/after process) and decrease factor was 4 what doesn’t satisfy expected results. Some roughness results after burnishing exceed upper limits. Research limitations/implications: Results and findings presented in this paper are qualitative and might be slightly different in other machining condition (e. g. higher hardness materials and higher roughness of row material). Practical implications: Smoothing process can be performed on standard machine tools without additional reconfiguration tasks. Process is very rapid. Process is very versatile for any workshop and can be conducted without coolant what is additional advantages for the environment and pollution free machining.

40|$|The {{failure of}} ceramic {{components}} in, e. g., roller bearing and <b>roller</b> tool <b>applications</b> generally is initiated at small cracks {{at or near}} the surface and is controlled by the tensile contact stresses. The common way to improve static, cyclic and rolling load capacity is therefore to decrease the size of natural and machining induced flaws and to increase the strength by optimizing the material and the fabrication procedures. Unfortunately, the gain of material quality is limited by the capabilities of mass-production methods and economical restrictions. The aim of the presented investigation was to use our novel shot peening technique in order to introduce high compressive residual stresses and by this to increase the static, cyclic and rolling load capacities. The material we studied was a commercially available silicon nitride. This type of silicon nitride has recently been used as a material for full ceramic bearings. The process of shot peening used in our investigations involves the impact of cemented carbide beads on the surface under controlled velocity. The impact velocity and the hardness of the shot are high enough to cause limited plastic flow near the surface. Up on completion of the process, the workpiece exhibits a layer with compressive residual stresses. For the assessment of the surface strengthening the X ray diffraction analysis (XRD), the static and cyclic ball-on-plate strength test and a rolling contact test (Amsler test) were used. The XRD investigations allowed evaluating the peening-induced residual stress depth profiles. In the ball-on-plate test, the samples were loaded with a spherical indenter up to Hertzian failure (surface cracks) of the sample. In the cyclic ball on plate test the samples were tested 106 cycles at different loads. The rolling contact tests were preformed with and without water lubrication. The results show that high compressive residual stresses in the GPa-range can be introduced in silicon nitride which may boost the static load capacity of the near surface layer by a factor of up to 4. Only little effect on the surface integrity could be obtained. Also the cyclic load capacity increased by a factor of 4. The rolling contact tests showed {{that it was possible to}} increase the Hertzian pressure by a factor of 3 without initiation of any cracks or pitting in the raceway...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine impacts of corn silage production systems that included a rye cover crop and application of liquid dairy manure in the spring and fall on water quality and soil characteristics. Four management systems were each replicated four times: traditional, double-crop, roll-down, and undercut. Manure was applied below the soil surface during the undercutting process; otherwise, manure was surface applied. In the roll-down system, the rye crop was flattened with a heavy <b>roller</b> after manure <b>application.</b> Rainfall was simulated within 48 h of manure application to produce runoff events. Grab samples of runoff were collected and composited for analysis. Soil samples were collected prior to treatments in the fall and spring. The roll-down system had no significant effect on water quality (sediment, nutrients, bacteria) as compared to the traditional system. While the roll-down system may require an occasional tillage operation to prevent surface compaction, it is recommended in situations where reduction of residual herbicide applications is a primary concern. The undercut system displayed evidence of a compaction layer developing below the disturbed soil layer. The undercut system reduced loadings of all nutrients, but increased losses of total suspended solids, as compared with all other systems. Mean volume of runoff from the undercut system was less than half that from any other system. Overall, the undercut system is recommended over the other systems analyzed for preventing transport of manure constituents to surface water, but should be evaluated in a complete dairy system before it is implemented by producers...|$|R
40|$|Rollers {{may provide}} a viable {{alternative}} to herbicides for terminating cover crops, however, excessive vibration generated and transferred to the tractor hinders adoption of this technology in the U. S. To avoid excessive vibration, producers must limit their operational speed, which increases time and cost of rolling. The effect of speed on rye (Secale cereale L.) termination rate, vibrations and cotton yield was tested for two roller designs during the 2004 - 2005 growing season. A triple-section roller (4. 1 m wide) with long straight bars (straight bar roller) and a smooth roller with an oscillating crimping bar (smooth roller/crimper) were evaluated at speeds of 3. 2 and 6. 4 km h- 1. Cover termination and cotton yield were recorded. In 2004, higher rye termination rates resulted from the straight bar roller (96 %) in comparison with the smooth roller/crimper (94 %). Three weeks after rolling, both rollers had effectively terminated rye without use of herbicides. The smooth roller/crimper transferred lower vibration levels to the tractor’s frame than the straight bar roller at both speeds. No differences in cotton yield were found between roller types, speeds and chemical treatment (glyphosate) except for lower cotton yield recorded for the smooth roller/crimper at the speed of 3. 2 km h- 1. Cotton yield in 2004 was decreased by hurricane Ivan and these results might not be representative for normal weather conditions. Under typical weather conditions in 2005, higher cotton yield resulted following straight bar <b>roller</b> and glyphosate <b>application,</b> and might be associated with higher soil moisture availability due to faster termination of rye...|$|R
40|$|In some <b>applications</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} fail {{prior to}} their expected life time. The processes of these failures are not fully understood {{and there are many}} different factors which affect the lifetime. One phenomenon which could affect the life time is the corrosion mechanisms of the steel. On defects and inclusions corrosion might be initiated even though the material does not corrode in the matrix. The aim of this project is to study the initial corrosion on martensitic AISI 52100 steel. No similar studies have been published on this kind of steel but some studies on general carbon steel were performed during the 1970 s. These studies suggested that manganese sulphur inclusions play a critical roll in the initial corrosion. The present study samples were emerged in deionised water for one to ten minutes. The samples were then studied with XPS, SEM, EDX and FIB-SEM to investigate if and where the corrosion occurred. The XPS analysis showed that similar iron oxides, a few nm thick, mostly covered the samples after 5 min. exposure as well as after handling in air. Using imaging methods no clear signs of preferential corrosion was observed on samples exposed for one or two minutes, but on samples exposed for five and ten minutes. No clear signs of preferential corrosion was observed on samples exposed for one or two minutes, but samples exposed for five and ten minutes did. The analysis of the five minute exposure showed manganese sulphur inclusions which were partially decomposed. The ten minute exposure showed inclusions with thicker oxide films around them, cracks and flaking of the surface could be observed close to several inclusions. It is hypothesized that these phenomena origin from some kind of micro galvanic corrosion and/or sulpur infection of the steel matrix...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is the {{investigation}} of magnetron sputtered carbon nitride coatings suitable for roller bearing components. The research field of tribology of bearings focuses on minimizing friction between components by improving the lubricants. The development of lubricants is, however, expensive and involves environmentally deleterious chemical byproducts. A solution to avoid such harmful conditions, reduce the processing cost, and more importantly, minimize the friction, is to apply a low-friction and wear-resistant coating {{on the surface of}} the bearing. The deposition of such coatings on components can substantially increase their lifetime, reduce the maintenance costs, and eventually increase the reliability of the machinery. Carbon nitride (CNx) coatings have high resiliency and can withstand the demanding conditions of bearing operation. The morphology of CNx coatings is highly affected by applying a negative substrate bias voltage. At high bias (100 - 120 V), the coatings become denser and more homogeneous with decreased porosity, resulting in more wear-resistant materials. I also found that the duty cycle of the applied bias affects the layer morphology. Less homogeneous films are produced using lower duty cycles (i. e., in high power impulse magnetron sputtering, HiPIMS) for a specific value of bias voltage. Thus, changing bias voltage, we can manipulate the structure of CNx and design layers, depending on the requirements of the bearing application. My results show that denser films yield higher hardness and wear-resistance, but also higher compressive stress, which is a disadvantage for the coating-substrate adhesion. In order to obtain improved adhesion on bearing steel, we developed an in-situ surface treatment, prior to the CNx deposition, which also surpasses the limitations set by the properties of each material. The steel substrates are successfully pretreated using W or Cr ions originating from a HiPIMS source. Plasma ions are accelerated to the substrates with energies of 900 eV, due to the application of a synchronized high bias voltage, which clean effectively the substrate surface from residual contaminants and strengthen the interfacial bonding. CNx-coated rollers are tested in rolling operation and show the absence of run-in period in all lubrication regimes. This is a big advantage for applications which rotate under boundary lubrication (BL). The coated rollers yield friction coefficients in the range of 0 : 020 and 0 : 025 in elastohydrodynamic (EHDL) and hydrodynamic (HDL) lubrication regimes, being lower than the friction coefficients of 0 : 026 - 0 : 052, exhibited by the uncoated rollers. Here, friction decreases steadily with increasing number of cycles, due to the presence of CNx in the contact. In BL, CNx-coated rollers present an increased friction coefficient of 0 : 052, but the wear is much lower than in the case of uncoated rollers. All rollers are covered with CNx in the wear tracks after the tests, avoiding failures and presenting low abrasive wear. The obtained tribological performance of the CNx-coated rollers in rolling is overall improved compared to the established operation of uncoated rollers. Thus, CNx layers can function as low-friction and wear-resistant coatings protecting the steel components in several <b>roller</b> bearing <b>applications,</b> such as in gearboxes and wheels in automotive, aerospace, marine, and turbine industry...|$|R
