50|$|After {{moving to}} Hong Kong in 1962, he started {{fighting}} {{for the rights of}} workers and the underprivileged. His focus on social ills started with drug addiction, one of the city's gravest social problems at the time. He was an experienced narcotics researcher and called for better <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>addicts.</b> A methadone outpatient scheme, which Ding had advocated since the late 1960s backed up by results from Randomized control trial, was set up in 1972 by the Medical Health Department.

5000|$|He was {{involved}} in the 1980s in tackling Dublin's growing drug problem. Heroin had largely been introduced to Dublin by the Dunne criminal group, based in Crumlin, in the late 1970s. In 1982 a report revealed that 10% of 15- to 24-year olds had used heroin at least once in the north inner city. The spread of heroin use also led to a sharp increase in petty crime. Gregory confronted the government's handling of the problem as well as senior Gardaí, for what he saw as their inadequate response to the problem. He co-ordinated with the Concerned Parents Against Drugs group in 1986, who protested and highlighted the activities of local drug dealers, and defended the group against accusations by government Ministers Michael Noonan and Barry Desmond that it was a front for the Provisional IRA. During a public meeting held by the group, Gregory told Charlie Dunne, an associate of the Dunne criminal group, that [...] "If you had any decency left in you, you'd walk straight into the Liffey and drown yourself". Gregory however believed that the solution to the problem was multi-faceted and worked on a number of policy level efforts across policing, service co-ordination and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>addicts.</b> In 1995 in an article in The Irish Times, he proposed what would later turn into the Criminal Assets Bureau which was set up in 1996, catalysed by the death of journalist Veronica Guerin. His role in its development would be acknowledged later by the then Minister of Justice Nora Owen.|$|E

40|$|Holiness {{movement}} to market movement? – {{changes in the}} Norwegian Pentecostal movement since 1977. The Norwegian Pentecostal movement has changed considerably since 1977. In this period, {{the changes in the}} movement have increasingly gained speed. The changes can be seen in how the movement has changed its focus from the preaching of eschatology and the struggle against secularism, to be more open to secular thoughts and mass culture. It can also be seen in the decreasing in use of tongues in church gatherings. The diaconal works of the movement, centered on Evangeliesenteret, has changed less {{than the rest of the}} movement, and is in many ways conserving to the Norwegian Pentecostal movement. Explanations of these changes can be found both inside and outside the churches. The isolation of the churches as a result of the huge focus on holiness and eschatology, became a considerable problem for the younger generations. Conflicts with the older leaders brought eventually forth changes. An unhealthy charismatic culture gave way for new thoughts on how charismatic expressions, such as tongues, should be practiced. The opening of the {{movement to}} society also opened up to secular thought. One result is the market mindset that puts the consumer’s need in focus. Modern Pentecostal churches have therefore much emphasized the relevance of their messages and the way it is presented.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Drug {{addiction}} and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>addicts</b> {{have become a}} significant public health problem in Sri Lanka. However, relatively {{few studies have been}} carried out in drug rehabilitation centres in Sri Lanka. Lack of epidemiological health related data on drug addicts and their behavior related to the drug addiction have further impeded {{the development and implementation of}} preventive and health promotive activities targeting this group of people. Therefore, this study was carried out to provide a descriptive overview of drug addicts and their behavior related to drug addiction. Methods: All the drug addicts admitted during a period of three months to the Drug Rehabilitation Centers in the Galle District were included in the study. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the information. Results: A total of 381 drug addicts participated in the study. Of them, 99 % were males. Mean age of the drug addicts was 34. 04 years (SD 7. 5). A majority (74 %) were Sinhalese. 94. 5 % of addicts had smoked cigarettes before drug {{addiction and}} only 5. 5 % had started drugs before commencing smoking.

However, these data do not {{take into consideration the}} effect an economic obstacle, such as a recession, could have on an individual 2 ̆ 7 s urge to cope with this stressful period with illicit drugs. Furthermore, there is no research to suggest how clinicians and/or treatment institutions can forecast whether the use of monetary resources will be sustainable due to private and/or governmental fund reductions during an economic recession. Based on theories of social learning and social disorganization within an ecological framework, this study employed a quantitative trend analysis to explore the impact the 2007 - 2009 economic recession had on illicit drug use throughout the United States. A sample of respondents from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive from 2006 to 2010 surveys was used to run the statistical analysis. Based on the analyses, age and gender (covariates) and all variables (social disorganization and Gross Domestic Product) were found to be significant predictors of illicit drug use. Although methamphetamine was not significant for prevalence over time, total drug use, cocaine, and heroin were prevalent over time based on predictors. These findings suggest local, state, and federal policies regarding the prosecution and imprisonment of nonviolent and minor drug offenders should be reprioritized towards the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>addicts</b> while enforcing firmer laws upon the most disruptive and severe aspects of the drug trade in order to promote a genuine positive change towards social organization...|$|E

40|$|Background: Opiate-induced {{addiction}} is a main social problem in Iran. As treatment {{of this problem}} is a health priority among the medical community, studies on this topic are very crucial. The exact mechanism of dependence on opiates and their withdrawal syndrome remain unclear. It seems that dopaminergic system and locus coeruleus (LC) {{have an important role}} in the expression of somatic signs during opioids withdrawal. The LC has been shown to contain significant levels of dopamine (DA). In the present study, the effects of different D 2 dopaminergic receptor agonist and antagonist administration in the LC on withdrawal sign expression in morphine dependence is investigated in rats. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats, weighing 220 – 280 g were divided into eight groups (n= 8). Two cannulae were stereotaxically implanted bilaterally into the LC of each rat. After a one-week recovery, seven groups were rendered dependent on morphine by subcutaneous injection during a seven-day period. Non-dependent control animals received saline according to the same protocol. Animals received bilateral intra-LC injections of saline (1 &# 956;g/site) and quinpirole (0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 &# 956;g/site, a D 2 agonist) 15 min and sulpiride (5, 15 and 30 &# 956;g/site, a D 2 antagonist) 30 min prior to naloxone injection about 24 hours after the last dose of morphine or saline according to their respective group. To calculate the total withdrawal score, as an index of withdrawal syndrome, 20 different withdrawal signs were assessed and the scores of the intensity of these withdrawal signs were added. Results: Total withdrawal scores were significantly decreased by quinpirole (0. 1 µg/site) and sulpiride (15 and 30 µg/site). Conclusion: The D 2 dopaminergic system in the LC may be involved in the morphine-induced dependency in rats. Further studies are needed to define the mechanism of this dependency in order to improve methods for the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>addicts...</b>|$|E

No studies have examined the perception of ward atmosphere in Arabic speaking countries and none that solely examined the perception of ward atmosphere in Jordan; therefore, the purpose of this descriptive non-experimental survey was to investigate the perceptions of ward atmosphere amongst nurses, patients and patients’ relatives in four Jordanian psychiatric hospitals. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 136 nurses, 104 patients and 27 patients’ relatives from AL-Rasheed private hospital, National Centre for <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Addicts</b> (NCRA), Marka Military hospital and National Centre for Mental Health (NCMH). The study instrument used was the Ward Atmosphere Scale (WAS) which was developed by Moos in 1968 and translated into Arabic by two bilingual translators in 2007. It measured both the Real (actual) and Ideal ward atmosphere. The data were analysed by using SPSS version 15 for windows. The main findings of this study were that Jordanian patients and relatives were reasonably happy with the current ward atmosphere. However, Jordanian mental health nurses felt that some change was needed as they rated the three subscales of Involvement, Practical Orientation and Order and Organisation statistically significantly lower than patients and relatives. The findings also revealed that relatives and nurses rated the Ideal ward atmosphere significantly higher than patients on all subscales except Autonomy and Order and Organisation. In contrast with Western mental health facilities, comparisons were made which indicated that North American nurses rated significantly higher than the Jordanian nurses in all Real WAS subscales except Staff Control. In addition, the research indicated that North American patients rated significantly higher than the Jordanian patients in Autonomy and Practical Orientation and significantly lower than the Jordanian patients in Anger and Aggression and Staff Control as this was positively influenced by greater staff numbers. Finally, all of the demographic variables tested in the current study were found to have no impact on the perceptions of ward atmosphere. This was true for nurses, patients and relatives but hospital ownership appeared {{to have an impact on}} ward atmosphere perceptions. The findings of the current study conclude that it was the quality of service and the actual operational system of the hospital that directed the participants’ perceptions of ward atmosphere. In order to improve the ward atmosphere in Jordanian psychiatric hospitals, recommendations with regard to Jordanian mental health services, mental health nursing practice and mental health nursing education were made...|$|E
