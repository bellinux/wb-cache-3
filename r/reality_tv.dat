5|$|<b>Reality</b> <b>TV</b> was {{a popular}} genre of {{television}} programming in the UK in 2002. The third series of the UK version of Big Brother—which was showing while Russian's con took place—attracted audience figures of approximately 5.8million. Most British <b>reality</b> <b>TV</b> programmes at the time centred on a team {{of people trying to}} accomplish a specific goal or target. For example, the 2000 series Jailbreak challenged a group to escape from a mock prison, while the 2001 series The Mole gave the contestants the task of discovering which of them was sabotaging their attempts to win money. Most <b>reality</b> <b>TV</b> shows offered a cash reward to successful participants—both Jailbreak and the first series of The Mole offered a prize of £100,000.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{performs a}} historical analysis of MTV's Real World programming and an ethnographic study {{of two of}} its most prominent participants. In it I examine <b>reality</b> <b>TV's</b> role in television's ongoing transformation as a technology and cultural form {{from the perspective of}} those who work in the industry as reality-talent. By adopting this perspective, I indicate some of the ways <b>reality</b> <b>TV's</b> construction of celebrity has altered the economic and performative regimes that have traditionally structured television stardom. One of the central issues this dissertation works to address {{is the way in which}} many participants are limited by the singular nature of their fame. To do this, I explore how the participant's status as on-camera talent is rooted in an ability to perform as if always off-camera. The participant's amateur image is argued to serve two critical functions. Because the participant's image appears more real than the show itself, it exists as an element within the text that lets the viewer know that what they are watching is staged. This in turn requires that the participant's performance always be restricted to the reality that his or her image represents. Recently, this has meant that participants who transition into reality-talent often rely on their status within the media industry as the basis for their performances. In the case of MTV's stable of Real World participants, continued participation in one of the longest running reality franchises indicates the repurposing potential offered by a form of talent that is typically understood to be disposable. Ultimately, this project calls attention to the new manner in which <b>reality</b> <b>TV's</b> representational logic and industrial deployment uniquely situates viewer and participant in a shared space of labor...|$|R
5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from their subjects, Meerkat Manor – {{due to its}} extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} <b>reality</b> <b>TV.</b>|$|E
