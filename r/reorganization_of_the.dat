In 1567 he commanded a royal task force, sent to remove the noble family of Starzechowscy from the royal lands they were decreed to hold illegally. Another major task he completed at that time was the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chancellery archive.|$|E
5|$|As the {{understanding}} of geodynamics improves, these models {{will be subject to}} revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Charles devoted {{the rest}} of his life to {{avoiding}} further warfare by gaining larger independence in foreign affairs, while he also promoted economic stabilization and a <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military. His remaining 20 years on the throne were the longest peace time of the Swedish Empire (1611–1718).|$|E
25|$|From 1600 onwards, the Safavid statesman Allāhverdī Khan, in {{conjunction}} with Robert Shirley, undertook further <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army, {{which led to a}} further increase in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> ghulams to 25,000.|$|R

5|$|In May 1943, Bainbridge joined Robert Oppenheimer's Project Y at Los Alamos. He {{initially}} led E-2, the instrumentation group, {{which developed}} X-ray instrumentation for examining explosions. In March 1944, he became {{head of a}} new group, E-9, which was charged with conducting the first nuclear test. In Oppenheimer's sweeping <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamos laboratory in August 1944, the E-9 Group became X-2.|$|E
5|$|Looking back at {{the reign}} of Heraclius, {{scholars}} have credited him with many accomplishments. He enlarged the Empire, and his <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government and military were great successes. His attempts at religious harmony failed, but he succeeded in returning the True Cross, one of the holiest Christian relics, to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Bomb Group {{received}} newer B-17s {{and served}} in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with both the Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces. GHQ Air Force assumed its designated wartime role in November 1940, was renamed Air Force Combat Command in June 1941, but went out of existence in March 1942 in a major <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Army Air Forces.|$|E
50|$|Buchenbach {{itself is}} first heard of in 1350. It was an Austrian possession, and from 1653 by <b>the</b> Barons <b>of</b> Sickingen owning most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land. <b>The</b> {{settlements}} <b>of</b> Ober- und Unterbuchenbach were under different overlords, causing continual difficulties and disputes, {{so that there}} were numerous <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipality down to the 19th century.|$|R

5|$|The biggest tournaments {{since the}} <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ATP World Tour in 1990 are the Grand Slams, ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, WTF/YEC and the Olympics. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic {{are the only}} players to have won 40+ tier 1 tournaments. Boldface {{indicates}} an Open era record.|$|E
5|$|Borders and {{administration}} of the colony similarly changed a number of times. Originally, and for the initial period, the colony vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from Senegal. In 1893, French Sudan formally came under civilian administration, which lasted until 1899. At that point, a <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony split 11 southern provinces to other French colonies like French Guinea, the Ivory Coast and Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|By 1996 Widerøe had {{undertaken}} {{a series}} of operational amendments after recommendation from the commission, including a <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft operation division, the quality insurance division and the company's reporting systems. Another concern was that pilots did not follow the company's routines, resulting in the company grounding about ten pilots which did not follow policy or did too many errors during observations. Some would be receive additional training while others would be retired. The company would further invest 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to improve safety.|$|E
40|$|With every finite-state word or tree automaton, we {{associate}} a binary relation on words or trees. We then consider <b>the</b> "rectangular decompositions" <b>of</b> this relation, i. e., {{the various ways}} to express it as a finite union of Cartesian products of sets of words or trees, respectively. We show that the determinization and <b>the</b> minimization <b>of</b> these automata correspond to simple geometrical <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectangular decompositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated relations...|$|R
5|$|The 6th Massachusetts {{continued}} as a peacetime militia unit following the Civil War, typically meeting for annual musters at various camps in Massachusetts. During <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts militia in 1866 and 1877, the 6th Massachusetts was consolidated {{and some of}} its companies disbanded or transferred, but the regimental organization remained intact. The regiment was again activated during the Spanish-American War. <b>The</b> 6th Massachusetts <b>of</b> 1898 participated in the Puerto Rican Campaign.|$|R
50|$|Aarle-Rixtel is {{a village}} in <b>the</b> Dutch {{municipality}} <b>of</b> Laarbeek in North Brabant. It lies about 4 km north <b>of</b> Helmond. Since <b>the</b> municipal <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> 1968 <b>the</b> castle Croy is part of Aarle-Rixtel.|$|R
5|$|By 2002, the {{executive}} branch had again grown to fourteen cabinets, but had no additional departments. Shortly after his election in 2003, Governor Ernie Fletcher undertook the last major <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive branch to date, {{reducing the number of}} cabinets to nine—Justice and Public Safety, Education and Workforce Development, Environmental and Public Protection, Transportation, Economic Development, Health and Family Services, Finance and Administration, Tourism, Arts and Heritage, and Personnel.|$|E
5|$|Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family Hygrophoraceae {{based on}} {{molecular}} phylogenetics, proposed that H.appalachianensis {{should be the}} type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H.rosea, and H.trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have perforations in the center. Their spores and basidia are dimorphic (of two sizes), {{and the development of}} the microbasidia and macrobasidia is often staggered. The macrobasidia are club shaped and appear as if they have a stalk.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{architectural}} {{and artistic}} value, the Church of St George {{has been part}} of the list of Bulgaria's monuments of cultural of national importance since 1927. With the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> list in the 1960s, it was included on it both as an architectural and as an artistic monument, in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Together with the native house of Dimitar Peshev and the city art gallery, since 2010 it has been listed as number 26 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War <b>the</b> regiments <b>of</b> {{artillery}} in <b>the</b> post-war Militia were renumbered and the 2nd Field Regiment {{was removed}} from <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> battle. <b>The</b> <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1964 Suttie Commission and the ensuing reduction in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> units in <b>the</b> Militia would eventually see the 2nd Field Regiment reforming in 1966 with initially two and then three batteries. They were the 7th, 50th, and 66th Field Batteries, each perpetuating a different regiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-war artillery in Montreal.|$|R
50|$|From 1856 he was <b>the</b> Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archives <b>of</b> Tuscany, {{and could}} thus {{contribute}} to <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Florentine (1852-55) and Tuscan archives, thanks also to <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> notable collaborators such as Cesare Guasti, Salvatore Bongi, Giovanni Sforza.|$|R
25|$|The Democratic Republican Party (or the Democratic Party) and the Whig Party (which {{had been}} pretty well {{destroyed}} after the 1852 elections) {{had been the}} major political parties in the United States. Corbett had been a Whig and follower of Henry Clay but when the Republican Party was founded on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan, {{he was one of}} its early and enthusiastic supporters. The Republican Party was founded as the anti-slavery party in opposition to the pro-slavery Democratic Party in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few fundamental <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American political system.|$|R
5|$|During {{much of the}} war, the 2nd Canadian Regiment {{was known}} as Congress's Own Regiment, and Livingston's command {{continued}} {{to be known as}} the Canadian Regiment. Greatly depleted by its five years of service, Livingston's regiment was disbanded in the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Continental Army on January 1, 1781. Its Canadian elements were assigned to Hazen's command, which was then redesignated as the Canadian Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work}} on the uranium gun-type weapon was {{concentrated}} in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1970s the {{laboratory}} was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping {{as well as}} a single course offered to the public in the summers. There was a brief time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in beekeeping was offered, however, with the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> department of entomology these classes have since ceased.|$|E
50|$|At first, no {{dramatic}} changes occurred. There were no changes in units, facilities, or responsibilities. The 4950th Test Group continued with AFSWC {{activities in the}} interim. However, in August 1959, phase down <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) at Eniwetok was approved and the facility moved into maintenance standby status. In October, the AFSWC proposed further <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4950th Test Group (Nuclear), but these proposals were not carried out. The 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) was given responsibility for Eniwetok buildup {{in the event that}} testing was resumed.|$|R
50|$|After {{a stroke}} sidelined former {{chairman}} Akio Morita, Sony CEO and new chairman Norio Ohga selected Idei {{to be the}} next president, a choice that raised eyebrows at Sony. His sweeping <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company included trimming <b>the</b> board <b>of</b> directors from 38 members dominated by company management to 10 with a substantial presence of outsiders. Already perceived as the company's driving force, Idei was formally named co-CEO in 1998 and sole CEO in 1999. In 2000, while Ohga remained Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Board, Idei became Executive Chairman and Kunitake Andō became president.|$|R
50|$|In 1867, {{following}} territorial <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> Galicia, <b>the</b> Austrians {{created the}} Pilzno county again, and it existed until 1931, when government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Polish Republic merged {{it with the}} Ropczyce County and moved the capital firstly to Ropczyce and then in 1936 to Debica.|$|R
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called for the {{formation}} of two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine {{to bring about}} a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E

30|$|However, in {{analyzing}} the reasons for changes in cell stiffness, {{it should be noted}} that glass was used as the substrate for cell cultivation and, further, for stiffness measurements, which, in accordance with the literature data [34 – 36], may result in uncharacteristic <b>reorganizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytoskeleton, decreasing the measured cell stiffness. At the same time, all groups of cells were cultivated under the same conditions; thus, we can discuss with confidence about the observed changes in mechanical properties of cells on completion of their cultivation with NPs.|$|R
