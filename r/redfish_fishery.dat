40|$|In early October 2000 an {{exploratory}} fishing for oceanic redfish {{have been conducted}} by one Spanish pelagic trawler in the NAFO Regulatory Area of Div. 1 F. One scientific observer was on board this vessel during the whole fishing period. The seasonal and geographic distribution pattern of the fishing effort in the Spanish oceanic <b>redfish</b> <b>fishery</b> is presented. A shift in the fleet activity towards {{the south and west}} is observed between the second and third quarter, approaching the vicinity of the NAFO Convention area.

The length distribution in NAFO Div. 1 F is similar to the one recorded in the NEAFC oceanic <b>redfish</b> <b>fishery</b> by the Spanish and German fleets in the upper 500 m layer. Only 11 % of the females and 5 % of the redfish males caught in NAFO 1 F were immature (juveniles).

40|$|A method, {{described}} by Gulland (1961), for estimating {{the effects on}} fisheries of changes in gear selectivity is reviewed and applied to data of the major commercial fisheries of the Newfoundland Area (ICNAF Subarea 3). Methods of estimating the essential parameters are also briefly- described. The changes in gear considered are in reality increases in the mesh size of trawls, the other gear components remaining unchanged. [...] For assessment purposes the subarea has been divided into several regions, largely {{on the basis of}} a knowledge of the cod stocks, and the fisheries in them have been considered separately. Some evaluation of the effects of fishing on the cod and haddock stocks has been made, and for these fisheries both immediate and long-term assessments of increases in the mesh size of trawls have been computed. Also given are the effects of such mesh size changes on the landings by gears other than trawls. Because of the recent development of the <b>redfish</b> <b>fisheries</b> in most regions and of the scarcity of adequate data from the major redfish-producing countries, the assessments that can be made are restricted largely to the calculation of the immediate losses. [...] The assessments indicate that the mesh sizes required to produce the optimum long-term yields vary greatly between regions for the different species. Since two or more species are often present on the same fishing grounds and caught by trawlers, for practical reasons a uniform mesh-size regulation must be considered for the subarea as a whole. A 41 / 2 inch mesh size in trawls is shown to be the optimum for the cod and haddock fisheries considered together. Despite the lack of long-term assessments for the <b>redfish</b> <b>fisheries,</b> the available information suggests that long- term benefits are unlikely from any increase in mesh size, although an increase to 4 inches would result in only slight immediate losses for most regions. No long-term assessments were made for the flounder fishery, but cursory examination of selection ogives and length composition data indicates that an increase in mesh size to 6 inches would not affect the commercial landings. Since it is not practical to have different mesh, sizes throughout the subarea, it is concluded that a minimum mesh size of 41 / 2 inches might be a fair choice for the regulation of the trawl fisheries on all species...|$|R
40|$|Since 1991, the {{aggregate}} biomass of fish stocks inhabiting the West Greenland shelf stagnates {{at the lowest}} level. The latest survey results of cruise no. 152 conducted by FRV 'Walther Herwig III' do not indicate any improvements in state of the stocks, although no fishing effort was recently directed towards groundfish. The cod stock showed again a record low and is presently dominated by recruits of the year classes 1991 and 1993. Both year classes {{are considered to be}} weak and the cod stock is beyond the 'minimum biologically acceptable level'. Consequently, an increase in stock abundance is not expected either in short or long term. Other ecologically or economically important fish species, American plaice, redfish, wolffish and starry skate, were also found to have minimum stock abundances. By-catch estimates of juvenile groundfish taken by the shrimp fishery, operating at traditional grounds of cod and <b>redfish</b> <b>fisheries,</b> are indispensible. Analysis of climatological data from Nuuk/West Greenland indicates that climate during the past fourty years was characterized by two decades of anomalous warm conditions, and cooling which dominates the dimate since 1969. Anomalous cold events were encountered during 1983, 1984 and during 1992, 1993. Similar to the air temperature anomalies, autumn temperatures of the ocean surface layer indicate cold and warm periods during the past thirty years. In contrast to the colder than normal atmospheric conditions during the early nineties, however, the ocean conditions indicate intermediate warming...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OnlyThis paper {{shows that}} the {{importance}} of fish habitat depends in part on the management of the fishery. Two cases of cold water coral - fisheries interactions are studied in a bioeconomic model setting: Norwegian and Icelandic <b>redfish</b> <b>fisheries.</b> The two countries have applied different types of management; Norway’s management has been closer to open access, while Iceland has had a property rights system of individual transferable quotas (ITQ) in the time period studied. Using the production function approach and assuming an essential fish habitat connection, the cases are studied using time series data of catch and effort in the fisheries, while estimating for possible outer limits of cold water coral decline. In both countries there are indications of economic losses due to cold water coral decline. However, the open access nature of the Norwegian fishery seems to exacerbate these losses. The assumed loss of 30 - 50 % of cold water coral gives an estimated marginal change in annual harvest of between 0. 15 % and 0. 24 % for the Icelandic fishery. For Norway, cold water coral decline results in a percentage marginal change in annual harvest of between 0. 29 % and 0. 46 %, twice that of the optimally managed fishery. The results of this study give indications of how habitat loss may affect fisheries. It points to the importance of management of fisheries when bringing in broader ecosystem connections. The greater losses due to habitat decline when fisheries are unmanaged raises the stakes of fisheries management...|$|R

40|$|In Division 3 O, primarily, redfish of {{two species}} Sebastes mentella and S. fasciatus are harvested. The bulk of catch (85 %) {{is made up}} by S. fasciatus.

Continuing pressure over Flemish Cap redfish stocks by cod predation, at levels higher, or much higher, than the levels prior to 2006 lead to higher natural mortalities since then.

We predict codend size selection based on morphological data collected from golden redfish (S. marinus) individuals.

40|$|There are {{two species}} of redfish in Divisions 3 L and 3 N, the deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and the Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) that have been commercially fished and {{reported}} collectively as <b>redfish</b> in <b>fishery</b> statistics. Both species, occurring on Div. 3 LN and managed as a single stock, don’t belong to isolated local populations but, on the contrary, {{are part of a}} large Northwest Atlantic complex ranging from the Gulf of Maine to south of Baffin Island. The present ASPIC assessment of this stock is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and, for the first time, to all stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. Both CPUE and surveys were used with all observations within each series. In order to proceed on the threshold of the new 2014 approach, and taking into account that since then no substantial changes appear to have occurred {{on the state of the}} stock, the main features of the previous input framework were kept, with MSY fixed at 1960 - 1985 average catch and the rest of the approved 2014 assessment framework updated. The 3 L Spanish survey, the only ongoing survey so far outside the analysis, has now been successfully included on this assessment framework (relative inter-quartile range from bootstrap analysis for the last two assessments highlight the higher consistence of most of the 2016 assessment results when compared with the ones from 2014). ASPIC assessment results confirm a stable stock from the 1960 ’s to the first half of the 1980 ’s, sustaining an average yield of 21 000 t. Stock declined with a sudden rise of the catch over the late 1980 ’s first half of the 1990, and increased since then, after catches fell to a residual level with the stock collapse. Assessment results also confirm that the maximum observed sustainable yield (MSY) of 21 000 t can be a long term sustainable yield if fishing mortality stands at 0. 11 /year, exploiting a correspondent Bmsy at 190 000 t. 2 There is a very high probability that the stock was at the beginning of 2016 at or above Bmsy, after crossing 2015 under a fishing mortality most likely at or below 50 % Fmsy.

The present ASPIC assessment is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and to most of the stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. Both CPUE and surveys were used with all observations of each series. This assessment is not a follow up of the previous ones (Ávila de Melo et al., 2012 and 2010). The logistic Schaefer production model (1954) incorporated in ASPIC operating model (Prager, 1994) can not cope anymore with the most recent biomass increases observed in both spring and (mainly) autumn Canadian 3 LN surveys, unless it is allowed to provide unrealistic assessment results. And continuing to strip off the highs of each one of these series, {{in order to get a}} picture in line to what is the perception of the stock history from commercial and survey data trends, is no longer a valid option, as reflected on the last STACFIS research recommendation on this matter (NAFO, 2012). Being so, input has been reframed opening room to a new combination of Canadian autumn 3 L and 3 N surveys. The inclusion of the Spanish spring survey on Div. 3 N and the removal of the historical CPUE series have also been considered. Two selected frameworks options have finally run with MSY kept constant at an initial starting guess, instead of being estimated by the model. Before entering the latest (2013) ASPIC Suite flow, the input selected from exploratory analysis was submitted to a sensitivity test in order to evaluate the robustness of the new framework against variability on random number seed, start user guesses for key model parameters and last year survey biomass. The consistency of the new ASPIC assessment with their predecessors was checked by comparison of biomass and fishing mortality fit trajectories against previous ones from the 2012 and 2010 assessments. A 2014 - 2012 retrospective analysis was also performed with good results (small retro bias on relative biomass and fishing 2 mortality in response to the general increase of the still standing survey series), and the assessment pursued successfully to bootstrap mode (again good consistency with previous results) and projections. A medium term management plan is finally proposed, based on bi-annual increases of the catch from the present TAC level of 6 500 t up to target catch/TAC of 18 100 t, the 2014 equilibrium yield from the present assessment, that should be in place by 2019 - 2020.

The present ASPIC assessment is based on the logistic form of a non-equilibrium surplus production model (Schaeffer, 1954; Prager, 1994), adjusted to a standardized catch rate series (Power, 1997) and to most of the stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted in various years and seasons in Div. 3 L and Div. 3 N from 1978 onwards. These surveys were framed according to the input formulation previously adopted on the 2 nd take of the ASPIC 2008 assessment (Ávila de Melo and Alpoim, 2010 a). The assessment was preceded by an exploratory analysis to check the response of the model to the inclusion of the Spanish spring survey series on Div. 3 N and to the 2010 - 2011 update of the remaining three Canadian survey series that are at present the backbone input of this assessment. Each of these series includes recently high points that are well above their overall increasing trends, observed 2002 onwards. The analysis point out that in terms of consistency with previous assessments and the past history of the <b>redfish</b> <b>fishery,</b> as well as performance of the model, the ASPIC 2012 option with the exclusion of the Spanish survey and the removal of the recent outliers from the respective Canadian series represents the better update of the survey data input framework. The chosen input formulation run afterwards with different last year survey results and different starting guesses for key parameters and different random number seeds, in order to test the robustness of ASPIC results to turbulence in the inputs used to initialize the model deterministic run. A 2012 versus 2010 ASPIC comparative assessment (both on FIT and BOT modes) and a 2012 - 2010 retrospective analysis were also carried out to check the consistency between the two last full assessments and the magnitude of bias on relative biomass and fishing mortality in response to the general increase of the still standing survey series. Regardless the input formulations, the starting guess region, the mode of the ASPIC runs or the retrospective patterns, the 2012 assessment reiterates the main conclusion of the previous ones: the biomass of redfish in Div. 3 LN is above Bmsy, while fishing mortality is well below Fmsy. Most recent catches continue to be at a low level on the historical context of this fishery and the answer of the stock to a direct fishery of the magnitude of years between the mid 1960 ’s and the mid 1980 ’s is unknown. Projections were made on the short term, in order to select a 2013 - 2012 catch roof large enough to consolidate the reopening of a redfish direct fishery on divisions 3 L and 3 N but keeping a high probability of the stock staying above Bmsy.

The reason for this approach is the historical dominance of this group in the 3 M redfish commercial catch until 2005. However a new golden <b>redfish</b> <b>fishery</b> (S. marinus) started on September 2005 on shallower depths of the Flemish Cap bank above 300 m, and the Flemish Cap cod fishery reopened in 2010. These new realities implied a revision of catch estimates, in order to split recent redfish commercial catch and by-catch from the major fleets on Div. 3 M into golden (S. marinus) and beaked (S. mentella and S. fasciatus) redfish catches. An Extended Survivor Analysis (Shepherd, 1999) was used with the same framework of previous assessments and with the tuning of the 1989 - 2012 EU survey. Survey results suggest that the beaked redfish stock {{has not been able to}} hold its growth and sustain an above average level, suffering instead a severe decline on the second half of the 2000 ’s. The most likely hypothesis to justify this unexpected downward trend on stock size is an increase in natural mortality by cod predation. From the sensitive analysis, natural mortality at 0. 4 was applied on ages 4 - 6 through 2006 - 2010, and extended to ages 7 plus on 2009 and 2010. It has been kept constant through all ages on 2011 and 2012, but with an overall decline to 0. 125. This is the highest possible level of natural mortality giving assessment results in line with the recent survey trends and at the same time with key diagnostics very close to the best ones, obtained with the return on 2011 - 2012 to the “standard” redfish natural mortality of 0. 1. A 2013 - 2009 retrospective XSA was also carried out, being this assessment very much in line with their immediate predecessors (2012 - 2011). Above average year classes coupled with low fishing mortalities allowed a rapid growth of biomass and abundance since 2003 that pushed the stock to a 2008 - 2009 high. Between 2009 and 2011 biomass and abundance of exploitable and 7 plus female stock went down for causes other than fishing. These declines were halted at well above average levels on the terminal year and, at least for biomass, there was some improvement on 2012. The recruitment at age 4 increased from 2002 till 2006 and was kept at a high level until 2009, with 2005 year class as the most abundant year class of the assessment interval. Recruitment to exploitable stock declined since then and is approaching the level of the weak year classes from the 1990 ’s. Short and medium term stochastic projections were obtained for female spawning stock biomass (SSB) under Fstatusquo, together with SSB and yield medium term probability profiles. As it was documented on the 2011 assessment F 0. 1 is an unacceptable management option at the current beaked redfish stock status. Keeping on 2014 and 2015 fishing mortality at its present low level will sustain on the short term a high level of female spawning biomass. But on the long term it will be natural mortality to determine the future of beaked redfish as a fishery resource...|$|E
40|$|The 3 M redfish {{assessment}} {{is focused on}} the beaked redfish, regarded as a management unit composed of two populations from two very similar species: the Flemish Cap S. mentella and S. fasciatus. The reason for this approach is the historical dominance of this group in the 3 M redfish commercial catch until 2005. However a new golden <b>redfish</b> <b>fishery</b> (S. marinus) started on September 2005 on shallower depths of the Flemish Cap bank above 300 m, and the Flemish Cap cod fishery reopened in 2010. These new realities implied a revision of catch estimates, in order to split recent redfish commercial catch and by-catch from the major fleets on Div. 3 M into golden (S. marinus) and beaked (S. mentella and S. faThe Extended Survivor Analysis assessment used as tuning file the 1989 - 2016 EU survey abundance at age matrix included in a revised input framework. Continuing pressure over Flemish Cap redfish stocks by cod predation, at levels higher, or much higher, than the levels prior to 2006 lead to higher natural mortalities since then. In order to include an independent approach to natural mortality in the sensitivity M framework, for the more recent years (2011 - 2016) natural mortality has been estimated from a number of different biological models, some size/age-independent and others size/age-dependent. These different estimates were arranged in two sets and tuned to survey at age data. A natural mortality of 0. 1 on 2015 - 2016 and the natural mortalities adjusted on previous assessments were found to be the most suitable option to M input. A 2017 - 2013 retrospective XSA was performed, confirming the consistency of the present with preceding results as regards stock biomass, female spawning biomass and fishing mortality. sciatus) redfish catches. Above average year classes and high survival rates allowed a rapid growth of biomass and abundance 2003 onwards, pulling the stock to a 2008 - 2010 high. Since 2009 abundance went down for causes other than fishing, being still above the 1990 ’s low in 2016. By the turn of the decade stock biomass and female spawning biomass (SSB) shown marginal declines as well, but reversed on 2011 - 2012. Individual growth of survivors and low fishing mortalities sustained stock biomass and SSB at high levels till 2015 - 2016. Recruitment at age 4 increased from 2002 till 2006 and was maintained at a maximum level till 2009. Recruitment declined since then and is kept on 2015 - 2016 at the low of the weak year classes from the 1990 ’s, while SSB is still well above the size that originated the high 2002 - 2006 recruitments. Despite the significant decline so far natural mortality has not flattened yet. If natural mortality and fishing mortality stay at their most recent levels, the actual high of female spawning biomass can hold on 2018 - 2019. But on the long term it will be natural mortality, namely over pre recruited ages, to determine the future of beaked redfish as a fishery resource. On 2015 STACFIS remind that projections are based in the assumption that natural mortality stay at its most recent level on the present year and at least on the two next coming years. And that, taking into account the uncertainty on the present and future level of natural mortality, its impact on female spawning stock biomass at the end of any projection is unknown. On 2017 these constraints are still in place, and therefore short and medium term projections are not presented. Versión del edito...|$|E
