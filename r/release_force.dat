50|$|While the {{auditory}} and visual {{capabilities of the}} owl allow it to locate and pursue its prey, the talons and beak of the owl do the final work. The owl kills its prey using these talons to crush the skull and knead the body. The crushing power of an owl’s talons varies according to prey size and type, and {{by the size of}} the owl. The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), a small, partly insectivorous owl, has a <b>release</b> <b>force</b> of only 5 N. The larger barn owl (Tyto alba) needs a force of 30 N to release its prey, and one of the largest owls, the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) needs a force over 130 N to release prey in its talons. An owl’s talons, like those of most birds of prey, can seem massive in comparison to the body size outside of flight. The masked owl has some of the proportionally longest talons of any bird of prey; they appear enormous in comparison to the body when fully extended to grasp prey. An owl’s claws are sharp and curved. The family Tytonidae has inner and central toes of about equal length, while the family Strigidae has an inner toe that is distinctly shorter than the central one. These different morphologies allow efficiency in capturing prey specific to the different environments they inhabit.|$|E

At this point, the leader of the cult, who is revealed to be Tavion Axmis (Kath Soucie) arrives. She was the former apprentice of Kyle's nemesis Desann from Jedi Outcast. Tavion has recovered the [...] "Scepter of Ragnos", which has the power to drain and <b>release</b> <b>Force</b> energy. Tavion disables Jaden and Kyle, causing the room to cave-in as she escapes with Rosh, destroying Jaden's lightsaber in the process. Kyle and Jaden narrowly escape and return to the Academy. Jaden is promoted to Jedi Knight, and constructs a new lightsaber. Luke comes to the conclusion that Tavion plans to restore the Sith to power by using the stolen Force energy to resurrect the ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos (Peter Lurie). As the Jedi prepare to battle Tavion and her followers on Korriban, Kyle informs Jaden that he has received a call for help from Rosh. Though skeptical, Jaden agrees to help. Fighting through a mining facility on Taspir III, Jaden is again confronted by Alora, who continues to taunt him as he chases her through the complex. Eventually, Jaden finds Rosh, who asks for help and claims to have seen the error of his ways. Gripped by anger, Jaden is goaded by Alora to kill Rosh and join Tavion, while Kyle telepathically tries to dissuade him. At this point, the player can choose to either let him live and thus stay on the light side or kill Rosh and turn to the dark side.|$|E

40|$|In {{ultraviolet}} {{nanoimprint lithography}} (UV-NIL), {{the presence of}} fluorinated components in a release-agent-free antireflection-structured (RAF-ARS) replica mold {{is an important factor}} preventing the adhesion of resin on its surface.

We also examined the effects of the filling ratio on an RAF-ARS replica mold.

40|$|Release liners {{are used}} in various {{self-adhesive}} applications such as hygiene products (feminine care and diapers), envelopes, labels, etc. The main function of the release liner {{is to protect the}} adhesive layer in the product. Release liner has to stick to the adhesive, but also be easily removed from it. Therefore, the optimal level of <b>release</b> <b>force</b> needed to peel off the release liner is important for the proper performance of the liner. Release liner consists usually of base paper, precoating, and silicone coating. Silicone offers easy release, but it is the most expensive part of the release liner. Precoating makes the paper surface smoother and allows the use of a thinner silicone layer. The properties of the base paper, such as roughness and porosity, as well as the properties of the precoating and silicone coating, such as coating coverage, affect the final performance of the release liner. In addition to the factors directly related to the release liner, the release performance is affected by other factors such as the adhesive, the face stock material and the peel speed and angle. For a release liner manufacturer, {{it is important to know}} well all the factors that affect the performance of the release liner in the final product. In this work, influence of base paper porosity, precoating and silicone amount of the release liner as well as impact of different adhesives on the <b>release</b> <b>force</b> were investigated. In the theoretical part of the work, the phenomenon of adhesion is introduced with the help of general adhesion theories, continued with the concept of practical adhesion, or the practical strength of the adhesive bond, with contributions of fundamental adhesion and energy dissipation in the peeling process. Then, the materials involved in the study are introduced starting from the base paper, precoating and silicone, and continuing with pressure-sensitive adhesives. For the experimental part of the work, release liner samples were prepared with a base paper of 3 different levels of porosity coated with a hand coater using 2 levels of precoating and 3 levels of silicone coating. Air permeance values (closely related to the porosity), coat weights, water contact angles, and surface roughness were determined for the release liner samples. Six commercial adhesives intended for release liner applications were then characterized by their rheological properties. Release tests were then performed for the 18 different release liner samples and 6 different adhesives. It was found that the porosity of the base paper at the porosity level used did not have strong influence, but paper with lower porosity would allow the use of lower level of precoating. The level of precoating and silicone coating expectedly had a significant influence on the release performance with a higher level of precoating allowing less silicone to be used. Unexpectedly, a clear correlation between the rheological properties of the adhesive and the <b>release</b> <b>force</b> was not found. Commercial adhesives intended for the same purpose (hygiene products) gave similar release forces...|$|E

40|$|Haptic {{feedback}} {{plays an}} important role to further enhance the level of realism of virtual environments where visual and audio feedbacks are only provided. However, realistic haptic rendering depends on its coupling to the underlying physics engine that governs the behavior of virtual objects. This paper presents methods to streamline the generation of haptic feedback with physics engine based on Sensable’s OpenHaptics and nVidia’s PhysX. Minimal development effort is required to couple these two components. To render the forces due the interactions between virtual objects, the Error-based method and the Contact Plane Collision Response method are proposed to utilize virtual material stiffness and object collision geometry provided by PhysX. The latter method yields more jitter-free output by restricting the haptic interface {{on one side of the}} contact plane. While PhysX does not <b>release</b> <b>force</b> information, an Indirect Force Estimation technique is proposed to simulate static or dynamic pulling force by introducing a spring between the haptic interface and the object being pulled. By using Hooke’s Law, the pulling force can be estimated indirectly from the elongation of the spring.

40|$|Design {{considerations}} for UV-NIL resists were investigated {{focusing on the}} major issues of ink-jetting performance, pattern formability, release property, and dry etching resistance. Regarding ink-jetting performance, small droplet ink-jetting of 0. 7 pl was successfully demonstrated by adjusting the resist fluid property to the ink-jet coater and controlling the resist volatilization. Regarding pattern formability, a resist pattern was imprinted from a mold pattern of 28 nm in width and 60 nm in depth without pattern dimension change. It was thought that modulus control of the resist {{was more important than}} resist shrinkage in achieving excellent pattern formability. As for release property, resist with fluorine monomer and with non-reactive fluorine anti-sticking agent were compared. The results indicated that resist design has the capability to both reduce separation force and maintain a clear mold surface. The mold release agent decomposed with increasing number of imprint shots, but the low <b>release</b> <b>force</b> resist with non-reactive anti-sticking agent was able to control degradation of the mold release agent and thus improve release property endurance.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of irreversible thermodynamics of nonlocal continua, the Clausius-Duhem in-equality enriched {{by the addition of}} two (nonlocality) energy residuals (one for elasticity, the other for damage) is employed to devise a coupled nonlocal elastic/nonlocal damage phenomenological constitutive model. With a particular choice of the nonlocal variables (average of the strain dif-ference and of the kinematic internal variable (k. i. v) difference), the constitutive model turns out to satisfy the criterion in virtue of which, in the case of macroscopically uniform strain and k. i. v., both energy residuals vanish identically hence all the state equations collapse into their local forms and as consequence all the state variables (stress, energy <b>release</b> <b>force,</b> damage hardening force) take on their respective local values. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity of the elastic moduli tensor, caused by damage, reflects on the greater attenuation effects upon the long distance par-ticle interactions, which are accounted for through the equivalent distance. This replaces the Euclidean (or geodetical) distance as argument of the attenuation function and increases with the damage variation along the optimal path (while the internal length is taken constant). Linear isotropic damage is considered, with the nonlocality introduced through the k. i. v. con-trolling the related hardening effects. The above thermodynamic procedure leads to the (nonnega-tive) intrinsic damage dissipation density having the shape of a bilinear form. The damage evolutive law is then formulated through the normality rule, such that a maximum dissipation principle can be shown to hold. 1...|$|E
