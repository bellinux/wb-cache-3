5|$|The house {{shows the}} {{transition}} from medieval architecture, in which the hall was the main living and entertaining room, to the more modern plan, where the hall became a <b>reception</b> <b>room.</b> Somerhill {{is one of the}} earliest examples of this.

5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class <b>Reception</b> <b>Room</b> and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The <b>Reception</b> <b>Room</b> with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Hotel {{was built}} between 1882 and 1887. It had seven floors, 500 rooms {{and a large}} ballroom which has largely survived intact from its {{original}} design. The original <b>reception</b> <b>room</b> was renamed the Mayflower Room in 1923, and is now called the Salon. Unlike other hotels on Northumberland Avenue that were {{taken over by the}} War Office, the Grand has survived as an entertainment and exhibition venue.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{building}} in the complex is the Executive, Library and Museum Building. Situated next to the Hills Capitol and the Huston Capitol, {{it was built in}} 1894. It was designated the Matthew J. Ryan Legislative Office Building on June 14, 1999, in recognition of former Speaker Matthew J. Ryan. The Ryan Office Building is the oldest {{building in}} the complex and was originally designed to house the State Library and State Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the Governor's Office and <b>Reception</b> <b>Room.</b> Today it houses the offices {{of the members of the}} Pennsylvania House of Representatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{second of}} the {{principal}} reception rooms, the Saloon (9), opens from the Marble Hall. This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens. Originally known as the Great Parlour, {{this has always been}} the chief <b>reception</b> <b>room</b> of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a Victorian copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean plasterer Edward Goudge. The centrepiece of the room is a large Aubusson carpet made in 1839 for the 1st Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|The final large <b>reception</b> <b>room</b> on {{the first}} floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil {{paintings}} by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from {{the upper part of the}} earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.|$|E
5|$|The squash {{house was}} {{constructed}} around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was {{located near the}} Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. It was two stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired casement windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended {{the length of the}} main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a <b>reception</b> <b>room,</b> locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, standing alone in the tall grass, is a 16th-century post-and-lintel stone element, which {{was at the center of}} the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater that was part of the Shepard estate and was since dismantled.|$|E

5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public <b>reception</b> <b>room</b> and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E

25|$|The sole {{remaining}} part of {{the original}} McKay villa is the <b>reception</b> <b>room</b> on the ground floor and the royal suite directly above. The former was created in 1913 by removing the interior partitions of the villa; the baseboards, mouldings, and trims date from that era. It is where small ceremonies and presentations take place, while the latter is an oval room that was previously the drawing room of the original McKay villa and was subsequently used as a ballroom, a studio, and a study before becoming the monarch's bedroom. Some signs of the McKay house are still visible, notably in the now blanked window on the north wall of the <b>reception</b> <b>room</b> and the ornate plaster ceiling in the royal suite.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the rear}} {{stairway}} {{has a large}} carved newel post. Both parlors have Neoclassical black marble mantels that were preserved from an earlier building. Two later black marble mantels are in the <b>reception</b> <b>room,</b> which has a carved Louis XVI-style wooden screen supported by four Corinthian columns.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Great Hall there is a General Library, <b>Reception</b> <b>Room</b> and Council Chamber and another 50 rooms including some teaching space such as seminar rooms and lecture theatres.

Many of Houghton's windows are in the exaggerated, decorative Gothic, almost Islamic, style which originated from the Walpole's Strawberry Hill Gothic.|$|R

25|$|The long gallery {{connects to}} a large {{octagonal}} room in the middle which was constructed in the 4th century.
