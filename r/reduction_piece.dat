Real wages for both regular workers and managers plummeted, despite the growing wage differential. Piece work production relations were introduced wholesale.

50|$|Notable {{performances}} of the Trois petites pièces montées during Satie's lifetime include conductor Gabriel Pierné's rendition with the Concerts Colonne on December 17, 1921, and Vladimir Golschmann's four presentations in concerts sponsored by the Ballets suédois (October 25 to 31, 1923). In June 1924, choreographer Leonide Massine assembled two of Satie's piano duets, Trois morceaux en forme de poire (1903) and the keyboard <b>reduction</b> of the <b>pièces</b> montées, into the ballet Premier Amour for the Soirées de Paris stage company at the Théâtre de la Cigale. It was a solo number starring Lydia Lopokova as a girl who dreams she {{falls in love with}} a doll. Satie and Marcelle Meyer played the piano during its handful of performances. Since Satie's death the original version of the suite has been largely neglected, even by conductors (Maurice Abravanel, Michel Plasson) who committed much of his modest orchestral catalog to disc.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a post LHC hadron {{collider}} operating in the ra- diation damping regime was discussed in the DPF workshop on future hadron facilities[1]. To date hadron colliders have all op- erated {{in a state of}} insigni®cant damping, where phase space di- lution from any source results in a costly degradation of instanta- neous and thus integrated luminosity. The concept of using radi- ation damping to enhance the integrated luminosity results in an effective decoupling of the machine performance from the ini- tial beam parameters. By relying more heavily on the damping mechanism, the requirements for tight emittance control through the injector chain and during the collider ®ll process can be re- laxed allowing for less stringent injection ®eld quality and the possibilities for looser tolerances in many other aspects of the machine. In this paper we present some generic parameters and machine characteristics before examining options for lengthen- ing the standard cell (quadrupole and spool <b>piece</b> <b>reduction)</b> and highly lumped correction schemes (correction element reduc- tion...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-nine {{percent of}} the sulphur dioxide {{generated}} over the period 1970 to 1994 arose from the combustion of fossil fuels in the energy sector. The annual mass emission of sulphur dioxide has fallen by 58 % over this period, due to the reductions in outputs from coal and petroleum fired plants. The influence of natural-gas power generation has played {{an important part in}} this <b>reduction.</b> Four major <b>pieces</b> of environmental legislation have been enacted to control sulphur-dioxide emissions: the Control of Pollution Act 1974, and three EEC Directives are discussed. The UK emissions in 1994 were 49 % below the 1980 baseline and 9 % ahead of the 1998 EU target level. The protocol on the reduction of sulphur-dioxide emissions, adopted in 1985, required a cut in the total SO 2 emissions of 30 % by 1993, based on 1980 levels. The UK achieved a reduction of 37 % by the end of 1993. Sulphur-dioxide emissions are predicted to fall according to the six scenarios in Energy paper 65 as a reference case. The predicted decline is in line with the UNECE targets set for 2010. ...|$|R
5000|$|Written in 1973, Evryali was Xenakis' {{second major}} work for piano solo after Herma, written in 1961. Evryali was {{composed}} for, and dedicated to, pianist Marie-Françoise Bucquet. According to her, upon presenting her the score, Xenakis said: [...] "Here's the piece. Look at it, {{and if you}} think you can do something with it, play it" [...] ( [...] , translated in [...] ). Conventional notation is used throughout the score; however, instead of using two or three staves as is customary for piano scores, Xenakis frequently employs four and five staves. Numerous passages are impossible to play as written either because it is physically impossible to reach the notes, or, in one case (a C-sharp in the penultimate passage of arborescences), because the written note is not available on most pianos (this particular difficulty was rectified in a later edition of the work). Therefore, the performer has to create a <b>reduction</b> of the <b>piece,</b> omitting some notes, transposing others, etc., {{in order to make it}} playable ( [...] ; [...] ). Citing these and other difficulties of Evryali, pianist-composer Marc Couroux compares the performer to the [...] "warrior" [...] from Carlos Castaneda's books: when confronted with the piece, one must remain [...] "lucid" [...] and choose [...] "which aspects the piece are essential and must be preserved", and which must be sacrificed [...]|$|R
40|$|The Project {{work was}} begun in January of 1995 and was {{completed}} in May of 1996. The authors performed a broad value engineering study to examine all parts and functions to lower costs, improve functioning and safety. The results of the Phase 1 work was a total redesign of the original Energy Saver resulting in two components instead of three, a weight of four pounds versus the original fourteen pounds and a <b>reduction</b> from 21 <b>pieces</b> to 10 pieces. The manufactured cost dropped from $ 350 to $ 175. Based on these improvements the Value Improvement Project has been successful. The second generation unit was named the BROIL-MASTER and has been registered under the Provisional Application (Patent) Program. The authors performed a technical analysis to determine the potential energy savings of applications identified and collect data on host product gas consumption, payback period, and other cost/saving relationships. The industrial search for energy project applications for the authors design was not successful. Seven Broil-Master demonstration projects have been successfully completed. The Broil-Master has received certification from the American Gas Association and UL approval is due {{by the end of}} July. The Restaurant Equipment Test Center of Pacific Gas and Electric is interested in testing the Broil-Master sometime in 1996.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the role of real-time B-mode ultrasound in posterior decompression and reduction and to observe the signal changes in spinal cord blood flow in a thoracolumbar burst fracture (TBF). Between February 2004 and December 2008, 138 patients with TBF were divided into group A (108 cases) and group B (30 cases). In group A, under the assistance of real-time B-mode ultrasound, posterior decompression and fracture <b>piece</b> <b>reduction</b> were performed, and we observed the signal changes in spinal cord blood flow. In group B, posterior fenestration was combined with pushing the fracture piece into the fractured vertebral body using an L-shaped operative tool. Presurgical and postsurgical recovery of neurological function was evaluated according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards, {{and the range of}} spinal decompression was determined by measuring the proportion of encroached fracture piece in the spinal canal (spinal stenosis rate) on the computed tomography (CT) image. In group A, 12 patients had a grade A spinal injury according to the Frankel grading system, and there were six cases without neurological recovery. In the other patients, neurological function increased by 1 - 3 grades. There were no aggravated spinal cord injuries or other serious complica-tions. In group B, three patients were categorized as grade A and there were two cases without neurological recovery. In the other patients, neurological function increased by 1 - 3 grades. In groups A and B, the postsurgical spinal stenosis rate was significantly lower than the presurgical stenosis rate (P 0. 05). Real-time B-mode ultrasound is an effective method for posterior decompression and reduction and to observe signal changes in spinal cord blood flow in TBF...|$|R
40|$|Raytheon Company is {{currently}} ramping up production radars for a fighter aircraft. This product is doubling {{production in the}} next year to meet customer demand; however, the program {{has not been able to}} meet the current demand schedule for the radar. In addition, the cost of producing this radar is over the budgeted amount. Management is pushing cost and cycle time <b>reductions</b> on every <b>piece</b> of the radar, a task the team is diligently working to accomplish. The main focus of this project is one sub-assembly of the AESA radar system, the "coldwall", a heat sink that also provides the base structure by which all of the radar sensing equipment is connect to. The coldwall also acts as a heat sink, reducing the internal temperature of the radar assembly, thereby improving the fidelity of the radio frequency signal and longevity of the system itself. Currently, the cycle time to manufacture the coldwall is on average twice the planned cycle time and the cost is three times the budgeted amount. This thesis provides a case in which a process improvement investigation takes place under tight budgetary and time constraints in ramp-up mode. (cont.) The goal of this thesis is to develop a case for accurate and complete data collection to help future process improvement decisions. The act of focusing this investigation was cumbersome due to the lack of data available on the process. In addition, the case study shows a situation where proactive issue resolution and active waste elimination could alleviate the stress incurred by cost over runs and delayed product shipments. by Ryan W.

40|$|The {{traditional}} ocean chemical {{explanation for}} the emergence of suboxia is that once O 2 levels decline to about 10 micromoles/kg then onset of NO 3 <b>reduction</b> occurs. This <b>piece</b> of ocean chemical lore is well founded in observations and is typically phrased as a microbial choice and not as an obligate requirement. The argument based on O 2 levels alone could also be phrased as being dependent on an equivalent amount of NO 3 that would yield the same energy gain. This description is based on the availability of the electron acceptor: but the oxidation reactions are usually written out as free energy yield per mole of organic matter, thus not addressing the oxidant availability constraint invoked by ocean scientists. Here we show that the argument can be phrased simply as competing rate processes dependent on the free energy yield ratio per amount of electron acceptor obtained, and thus the [NO 3]:[O 2] ratio is the critical variable. The rate at which a microbe can acquire either O 2 or NO 3 to carry out the oxidation reactions is dependent on both the concentration in the bulk ocean, and on the diffusivity within the microbial external molecular boundary layer. From the free energy yield calculations combined with the ~ 25 % greater diffusivity of the O 2 molecule we find that the equivalent energy yield occurs at a ratio of about 3. 8 NO 3 :O 2 for a typical Redfield ratio reaction, consistent with an ocean where NO 3 reduction onset occurs at about 10 μmol O 2 : 40 μmol NO 3, and the reactions then proceed in parallel along a line of this slope until the next energy barrier is approached. Within highly localized microbial consortia intensely reducing pockets may occur in a bulk ocean containing finite low O 2 levels; and the local flux of reduced species from strongly reducing shelf sediments will perturb the large scale water column relationship. But all localized reactions drive towards maximal energy gain from their immediate diffusive surroundings, thus the ocean macroscopic chemical fields quite well approximate the net efficiency and operational mode of the ensemble microbial engine...|$|R
5000|$|Puzzle Fighter is {{a puzzle}} game which is {{inspired}} by the Capcom arcade game Pnickies and Sega arcade game Baku Baku Animal. [...] As in that game, the player controls pairs of blocks ("gems" [...] in game parlance) that drop into a pit-like playfield (twelve blocks tall by six blocks wide, with the fourth column from the left being thirteen blocks high). In Puzzle Fighter, however, gems can only be eliminated by coming into contact with a Crash Gem of the same color, which eliminates all adjacent gems of that color, setting up the potential for huge chain reactions. As gems are eliminated, [...] "garbage blocks" [...] called Counter Gems will drop into the opponent's playfield; these will eventually become normal gems, but only after they count down to zero (most Counter Gems start at [...] "5" [...] and are reduced by one each time {{a new pair of}} gems is dropped on that board), and until that time they cannot be eliminated by normal means. (The only way to eliminate Counter Gems before they become normal gems is to place a Crash Gem of that color nearby so it eliminates at least one normal gem. If this is done, all Counter Gems immediately adjacent to the Crash Gem will be taken out as well). Additionally, gems of the same color that form squares or rectangles (of at least two blocks tall and wide) in the pit become a giant Power Gem of that size and color; eliminating these as part of a combo increases the number of Counter Gems that would otherwise normally appear on the opponent's board. The only other type of piece to appear is a diamond, which eliminates all the gems - normal, Power, Counter, and Crash alike - of whichever color gem it lands on. (This, too, will cause Counter Gems to appear on the opponent's board. The diamond is supposed to create half the number of Counter Gems as a normal chain reaction. However, there is a bug that allows players to bypass this <b>reduction.).</b> The diamond <b>piece</b> appears every 25 pieces.|$|R
