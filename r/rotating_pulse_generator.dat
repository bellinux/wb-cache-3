40|$|The flow in {{turbocharger}} compressors and turbines for automotive {{engine application}} is highly unsteady in nature, as it {{responds to the}} intake and exhaust manifolds of the internal combustion engine. The optimization of the turbocharger system is therefore a very difficult task, since only steady flow maps are generally provided by turbocharger manufacturer. For several years a specialized components test facility operates at the University of Genoa, particularly suitable to test turbochargers under steady and unsteady flow conditions. The test bench has been continuously upgraded in order to study components under pulsating flow condition by using different layout configurations. A recent set-up {{makes it possible to}} study turbocharger compressor under unsteady flow condition by using a <b>rotating</b> valve <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> system. Measurements of pressure signals downstream the compressor, instantaneous mass flow rate and turbocharger rotational speed are performed. In the paper the effect of both pulse characteristics (frequency - i. e., engine rotational speed -, amplitude and mean value) on compressor performance is analyzed. In particular the attention is focused on the surge limit position under unsteady flow operation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pulsed</b> power <b>generators</b> {{are a key}} {{component}} in compact systems for generation of high-power microwaves (HPM). HPM generation by virtual cathode devices such as Vircators put high demands on the source. The rise time and the pulse length of the source voltage are two key issues in the generation of HPM radiation. This thesis describes the construction and tests of several inductive high power <b>pulse</b> <b>generators.</b> The <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> were designed {{with the intent to}} deliver a pulse with fast rise time and rectangular voltage. Therefore, the <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> are all based on discharges of transmission lines. The transmission lines used in the <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> are modern high voltage cables normally used in power transmission. All tested <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> have step up transformers as intermediate magnetic energy storage. Further, the <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> have contributed to the knowledge of compact designs. Closing switches is another important device in <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> architectures.
