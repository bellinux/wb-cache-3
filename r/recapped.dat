5|$|In 2003, Ivory {{became a}} fan favourite, and {{wrestled}} sporadically in the women's division. In June of that year, {{she had three}} pinfall victories over the WWE Women's Champion, Jazz, but never received a title match opportunity. Her only pay-per-view appearance {{in the course of}} the year was on December 14 at Armageddon, where she unsuccessfully challenged Molly Holly for the Women's Championship, after Molly grabbed her tights for leverage, and managed to capture the victory. She also served as a trainer on the third season of Tough Enough, and did broadcasting duties at WWE events. Ivory also spent eight weeks working as a trainer at WWE's then-developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In May of that year, she and Todd Grisham began hosting The WWE Experience, a weekly television show that <b>recapped</b> events from Raw and SmackDown!. On July 22, 2005, several weeks before WWE Experience ended in August 2005, WWE announced that Ivory had opted not to renew her contract with the company.|$|E
5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are <b>recapped</b> to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the American {{television}} medical drama Grey's Anatomy, commenced airing in the United States on September 27, 2007 and concluded on May 22, 2008. The season continues {{the story of a}} group of surgeons and their mentors in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, describing their professional lives and the way they affect the personal background of each character. Season four had twelve series regulars with ten of them returning from the previous season, out of which eight are part of the original cast from the first season. The season aired in the Thursday night timeslot at 9:00 EST. In addition to the regular seventeen episodes, a clip-show narrated by the editors of People <b>recapped</b> previous events of the show and made the transition from Grey's Anatomy to Private Practice, a spin-off focusing of Dr. Addison Montgomery and aired on September 19, 2007, before the season premiere. The season was officially released on DVD as a five-disc boxset under the title of Grey's Anatomy: Season Four – Expanded on September 9, 2008 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Recaps</b> {{are also}} used for several soap operas, most notably in Australia. The Australian prison soap opera Prisoner (commonly known as Prisoner: Cell Block H) used a <b>recap</b> {{sequence}} throughout its eight-season run. In the early years it only showed the final scene of the previous episode before the opening credits. However, in later years it began to show several select cuts from the previous episode during the <b>recap</b> sequence, often, a new scene would directly follow the <b>recap</b> before the opening credits. In {{the early years of}} Australian soaps Home and Away, Neighbours and Sons and Daughters a <b>recap</b> showed directly after the opening credits, which may have been confusing for viewers who would have started watching them, not realizing they were viewing a <b>recap</b> sequence and not a new opening scene. The layout was changed in later years as <b>recaps</b> for Home and Away and Neighbours started before the credits, but currently they again show after the credits in such a way not to confuse the viewer. British soap operas, apart from Hollyoaks, do not use a <b>recap</b> sequence, however, they may be relevant.|$|R

40|$|Clinical trials showed renal {{protective}} effects of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) {{in patients with}} sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). Subsequently, a human recombinant chimeric AP (<b>recAP)</b> was developed as a pharmaceutically acceptable alternative. Here, we investigated the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (PK) of <b>recAP</b> and developed a translational population PK model. Biodistribution was studied during LPS-induced AKI in rats. Iodine- 125 -labeled <b>recAP</b> was primarily taken up by liver, spleen, adrenals, heart, lungs and kidneys followed by the gastro-intestinal tract and thyroid. Tissue distribution was not critically affected by endotoxemia. PK parameters were determined in rats and minipigs during IV bolus injections of <b>recAP,</b> administered once, or once daily during seven consecutive days. Plasma concentrations of <b>recAP</b> increased with increasing dose and disappeared in a biphasic manner. Exposure to <b>recAP,</b> estimated by AUC and Cmax, was similar on days 1 and 7. Subsequently, population approach nonlinear mixed effects modeling was performed with <b>recAP</b> rat and minipig and biAP phase I PK data. Concentration versus time data was accurately described in all species by a two-compartmental model with allometric scaling based on body weight. This model provides a solid foundation for determining the optimal dose and duration of first-in-man <b>recAP</b> studies...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Recapping</b> laminoplasty {{has become}} the frequently-used {{approach}} to the spinal canal when bone decompression of the vertebral canal is not the goal. However, what changes will occur after surgery, and whether <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty can actually {{reduce the risk of}} delayed deformities remains unknown. Methodology: We designed an animal experiment using a caprine model, and partitioned the animals into in vitro and in vivo surgical groups. We performed <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty on one group and laminectomy on another group. These animals were sacrificed six months after operating, cervical spines removed, biomechanically tested, and these data were compared to determine whether the <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty technique leads to subsequent differences in range of motion. Image data were also obtained before the surgery and when the animals were killed. Besides, we investigated the initial differences in kinetics between <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty and laminectomy. We did this by comparing data obtained from biomechanical testing of in vitro-performed <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty and laminectomy. Finally, we investigated the effect that longitudinal distance has on cervical mechanics. This was determined by performing a two-level <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty, and then extending the laminoplasty to the next level and repeating the mechanical testing at each step. Principal Findings: There were three mainly morphological changes at the six months after laminoplasty: volume reduction and bone nonunion of the <b>recapping</b> laminae, irregular fibrosis formation around the facet joints and re-implanted lamina...|$|R
40|$|Sepsis-{{associated}} acute kidney injury (AKI) {{is associated}} with high morbidity and mortality. Excessive platelet activation contributes to AKI through the formation of microthrombi and amplification of systemic inflammation. Two phase II trials demonstrated that bovine-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) improved renal function in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated AKI. In this study, we characterised the platelet-inhibiting effects of a human recombinant AP. Whole blood and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of healthy volunteers (n= 6) was pre-treated ex vivo with <b>recAP,</b> whereafter platelet reactivity to ADP, collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL) and Pam 3 CSK 4 was determined by flow cytometry. <b>RecAP</b> (40 U/ml) reduced the platelet reactivity to ADP (inhibition with a median of 47 %, interquartile range 43 - 49 %; p< 0. 001) and tended to reduce platelet reactivity to CRP-XL (9 %, 2 - 25 %; p= 0. 08) in whole blood. The platelet-inhibiting effects of <b>recAP</b> were more pronounced in PRP both for ADP- (64 %, 54 - 68 %; p= 0. 002) and CRP-XL-stimulated samples (60 %, 46 - 71 %; p= 0. 002). <b>RecAP</b> rapidly converted ADP into adenosine, whereas antagonism of the A 2 A adenosine receptor partially reversed the platelet inhibitory effects of <b>recAP.</b> Platelets of septic shock patients (n= 5) showed a 31 % (22 - 34 %; p= 0. 03) more pronounced reactivity compared to healthy volunteers, and this was completely reversed by <b>recAP</b> treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that <b>recAP</b> inhibits ex vivo human platelet activation through dephosphorylation of ADP and formation of adenosine as its turnover product. <b>RecAP</b> is able to reverse the platelet hyperreactivity present in septic shock patients. These effects {{may contribute to the}} beneficial effects of <b>recAP</b> as a new therapeutic candidate for sepsis-associated AKI...|$|R
