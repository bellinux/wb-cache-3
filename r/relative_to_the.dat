5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bike. As mentioned above, {{the effectiveness of}} rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, which makes it appear to move backwards in a looping motion <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion is about 72 days.|$|E
5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importance of their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results {{in a range of}} dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E

5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E

5|$|Although a clear <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei {{was much}} smaller, {{roughly the size}} of the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest {{specimens}} were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} jaguar is most {{closely related to}} the leopard.

Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such as the European jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar. Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds.
