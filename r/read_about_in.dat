5|$|In 1952, Buczynski {{started at}} the Old School Elementary in Queens, where he made good grades and {{particularly}} enjoyed music, reading, drawing, and painting. In August 1954, his mother gave birth to his first brother, Frank, whom he would remain fond of despite the seven-year age gap. Although his family was Roman Catholic, he took an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Ancient Egypt and Classical Greece, which he <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> books. He began devising and performing his own rituals to the deities of these religions, sparking his lifelong interest in Contemporary Paganism. His interest in Pagan religion only increased following his father's sudden death {{from a heart attack}} at age 31 in August 1958. His mother married Edward Nascato in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

25|$|He {{asked himself}} why was {{there such a}} drastic {{discrepancy}} between the Buddhist doctrines that he <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> books and {{the actual practice of}} Buddhism in real life. He yearned to dedicate his whole life to unraveling this mystery. His mind was set on finding places where Buddhism was still practiced the way it should be. It was at this point where he decided to become a monastic.|$|E
25|$|Peel's {{enthusiasm for}} music outside the {{mainstream}} occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the then station controller Derek Chinnery contacted John Walters {{and asked him to}} confirm that the show was not playing any punk, which he (Chinnery) had <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.|$|E

25|$|Watts {{spent several}} {{holidays}} in France in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy Epicurean with strong interests in both Buddhism and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It {{was not long}} afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the Anglican Christianity he {{had been exposed to}} and the Buddhism he had <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the London Buddhist Lodge, which had been established by Theosophists, and was now run by the barrister Christmas Humphreys. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of meditation during these years.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Gardner {{had begun}} to {{correspond}} with a young woman named Doreen Valiente. She eventually requested initiation into the Craft, and though Gardner was hesitant at first, he agreed that they could meet during the winter {{at the home of}} Edith Woodford-Grimes. Valiente got on well with both Gardner and Woodford-Grimes, and having no objections to either ritual nudity or scourging (which she had <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> a copy of Gardner's novel High Magic's Aid that he had given to her), she was initiated by Gardner into Wicca on Midsummer 1953. Valiente went on to join the Bricket Wood Coven. She soon rose to become the High Priestess of the coven, and helped Gardner to revise his Book of Shadows, and attempting to cut out most of Crowley's influence.|$|E
25|$|After {{the capture}} of Francis I by Charles V's troops {{during the battle of}} Pavia (1525), the two eldest princes, Francis and Henry, were {{retained}} as hostages in Spain in exchange for their father. Because the ransom was not paid in time, the two boys (eight and seven at the time) had to spend nearly four years isolated in a bleak castle, facing an uncertain future. Henry found solace by reading the knight-errantry tale Amadis de Gaula. The experience may account for the strong impression that Diane made on him, as the very embodiment of the ideal gentlewomen he <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> Amadis. As his mother was already dead, Diane gave him the farewell kiss when he was sent to Spain. At the tournament held for the coronation of Francis's new wife, Eleanor of Austria, in 1531, while the Dauphin of France saluted the new queen as expected, Henry addressed his salute to Diane.|$|E

500|$|Paula Findlen, {{writing in}} the Cambridge History of Science, asserts that Natural history was an ancient form of {{scientific}} knowledge, most {{closely associated with the}} writings of the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder...

[...] broadly described all entities found in nature, or derived from nature, that could be seen in the Roman world and <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> its books: art, artifacts, and peoples as well as animals, plants, and minerals were included in his project. Findlen contrasts Pliny's approach with that of his intellectual predecessors Aristotle and Theophrastus, who sought general causes of natural phenomena, while Pliny was more interested in cataloguing natural wonders, and his contemporary Dioscorides explored nature for its uses in Roman medicine in his great work De Materia Medica.|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Ebony and Jet magazines, Jackson {{said that he}} had gotten the idea for the song from a true story that he had <b>read</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> Time or Newsweek magazine.

He added that the student's friends' jealousy resulted in them killing the student; Jackson stated that the student's death {{was not included in the}} music video. The only case that fits these details is that of Edmund Perry. However, Perry was not killed by kids in his neighborhood; he was killed by a plainclothes police officer when Perry and his brother allegedly attacked and badly beat the officer in a mugging attempt.|$|E
