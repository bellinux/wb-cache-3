40|$|Background Although stoma closure is {{considered}} a simple surgical intervention, the interval between construction and reversal is often prolonged, and some ileostomies may never be reversed. We evaluated possible predictors for non-reversal and prolonged interval between construction and <b>reversal.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods In a cohort study of ileostomy patients treated in a large teaching hospital, we collected data from the surgical complication and enterostomal therapists ’ registries between January 2001 and December 2011. Parameters re-sponsible for morbidity, mortality, length of stay and time interval between construction and reversal were analysed. Results Of 485 intentionally temporary ileostomies, 359 were reversed after a median of 5. 6 months (IQR 3. 8 – 8. 9 months), while 126 (26 %) remained permanent. End ileostomy and intra-abdominal abscess independently delayed reversal. Age, end ileostomy, higher body mass index and preoperative radiotherapy were independent factors for non-reversal. Median duration of hospitalisation for reversal was 7. 0 days (5 – 13 days). Morbidity and mortality were 31 and 0. 9 %, respectively. In 20 patients (5. 5 %), re-ileostomy was necessary. Conclusions A substantial number of ileostomies that are intended to be temporary will never be reversed. If reversed, the interval between construction and reversal is longer than anticipated, while morbidity after reversal and duration of hospitalisation are considerable. Besides a temporary ileostomy, {{there are two other}} options: no diversion or a per-manent colostomy. Shared decision-making is to be preferred in these situations...|$|E

We demonstrate that the CoO AFM switching is a Kolmogorov-Avrami process in which the thermal activation energy creates AFM domain nucleation centers which further expand by domain wall propagation.

40|$|We {{describe}} three presentations {{relating to}} the X-ray pulsar GX 1 + 4 at a workshop on magnetic fields and accretion at the Astrophysical Theory Centre, Australian National University on 1998, November 12 - 13. Optical and X-ray spectroscopy indicate that GX 1 + 4 is seen through a cloud of gravitationaly bound matter. We discuss an unstable negative feedback mechanism (originally proposed by Kotani et al, 1999), based on X-ray heating of this matter which controls the accretion rate when the source is in a low X-ray luminosity state. A deep minimum lasting ~ 6 hours occurred during observations with the RXTE satellite over 1996, July 19 - 21. The shape of the X-ray pulses changed remarkably from before to after the minimum. These changes {{may be related to}} the transition from neutron star spin-down to spin-up which occurred at about the same time. Smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of the effect of adding matter with opposite angular momentum to an existing disc, show that it is possible for a number of concentric rings with alternating senses of rotation to co-exist in a disc.

30|$|Nanoscale {{magnetic}} grains {{are essential}} for extending the areal density of hard disk drives. These nanoscale grains are found in hard disk drives, in which the problem of writability still remains to be solved. Energy-assisted magnetic recording schemes [1, 2] have already been proposed for solving the writability problems in magnetic recordings. In these recording schemes, microwave-assisted magnetization reversal (MAMR) has recently attracted much attention as an alternative technique for future ultrahigh density recordings. In the case of MAMR, a microwave field is tuned to the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of the recording medium, during which a quasi-direct current (dc) field is also applied, wherein the quasi-dc field is smaller than the switching field {{in the absence of}} microwaves. Resonant magnetic precession drives the magnetization over the energy barrier imposed by anisotropy provided that the microwave field amplitude is sufficiently large. Recent experiments [3 – 6] and simulations [7 – 13] have demonstrated a reduction in the switching field by applying a large amplitude microwave field with frequencies in the order of gigahertz. To realize ultrahigh density recordings for hard disk drives, magnetic materials with a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (such as L 10 -FePt) are required to overcome thermal fluctuations. However, for magnetization <b>reversal,</b> these <b>materials</b> require a strong magnetic head field and microwave field [14] at extremely high frequencies. This is an issue concerning MAMR that needs to be resolved. Recent micromagnetic analysis has shown that an exchange-coupled composite (ECC) structure [15] with both soft and hard magnetic materials effectively reduces the strengths of dc and microwave fields as well as the optimum microwave frequency for magnetization reversal [16 – 20].|$|R

Cyclic work softening, or fatigue softening, is the loss of mech-anical strength and the accompanying reduction in surface hardness which 2 some materials show under cyclic loading [1]. Like hardening under cyclic loads, softening under cyclic loads is limited and usually takes place only during the first 10 - 25 % of the fatigue life. Cyclic hardening or soften-ing occurs only if there is plastic strain produced by each loading i. e. only if there is a mechanical hysteresis loop for the cyclic loading.

The following results are discussed: (1) The Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) limit becomes exact when the damping constant is infinitely large.

(2) For a given magnetic anisotropy, there is a critical damping constant, above which the minimal switching field {{is the same as}} that of the SW-limit. (3) The field of a ballistic magnetization reversal should be along a certain direction window in the presence of energy dissipation. (4) Since a time-dependent magnetic field can be an energy source, two new reversal strategies are possible.

Using this method, I was able to measure the exchange stiffness of thin film Co alloyed with Cr, Fe, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru. The results of this work showed that the rate at which a substituent element reduces the exchange stiffness is not directly related to its effect on the magnetization of the alloy. These measured trends have been understood by combining measurements of element specific magnetic moments obtained using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and material specific modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) within the local density approximation (LDA).

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper on 'Observations of candle flames under various atmospheres in microgravity' by Ross et al., {{it was found}} that for the same atmosphere, the burning rate per unit wick surface area and the flame {{temperature}} were considerably reduced in microgravity as compared with normal gravity. Also, the flame (spherical in microgravity) was much thicker and further removed from the wick. It thus appears that the flame becomes 'weaker' in microgravity due to the absence of buoyancy generated flow which serves to transport the oxidizer to the combustion zone and remove the hot combustion products from it. The buoyant flow, which may be characterized by the strain rate, assists the diffusion process to execute these essential functions for the survival of the flame. Thus, the diffusion flame is 'weak' at very low strain rates and as the strain rate increases the flame is initially 'strengthened' and eventually it may be 'blown out'. The computed flammability boundaries of T'ien show that such a <b>reversal</b> in <b>material</b> flammability occurs at strain rates around 5 sec. At very low or zero strain rates, flame radiation is expected to considerably affect this 'weak' diffusion flame because: (1) the concentration of combustion products which participate in gas radiation is high in the flame zone; and (2) low strain rates provide sufficient residence time for substantial amounts of soot to form which is usually responsible for a major portion of the radiative heat loss. We anticipate that flame radiation will eventually extinguish this flame. Thus, the objective of this project is to perform an experimental and theoretical investigation of radiation-induced extinction of diffusion flames under microgravity conditions.

A fully transient, two-dimensional, nested-grid hydrodynamic model of the continuum is coupled to the biogeochemical MIRO model for the coastal zone and the CONTRASTE model for the estuary. Transient model simulations are performed with a high spatial (80 – 750 m) and temporal (30 min) resolution {{over a period of}} one year (January–December 1995). The high temporal resolution allows including the short-term variability triggered by the tides, the freshwater discharge and the wind stress. System scale simulations provide time series of nutrient transformations and fluxes along the entire estuary–coastal zone continuum, as well as highly resolved nutrient inventories for the estuarine and the coastal zone sub-domains. Simulation results reveal that the balance between highly variable estuarine nutrient inputs and physical constrains set by the unsteady residual transport field exert an important control on the magnitude and succession of phytoplankton blooms and the ecosystem structure in the coastal zone. In addition, they suggest that the poorly surveyed estuarine–coastal zone interface plays {{a central role in the}} continuum. In this dynamic area, marked spatial concentration gradients develop and episodically lead to a <b>reversal</b> of <b>material</b> fluxes from the coast into the estuary. During distinct episodes of the productive period, euryhaline coastal diatoms intrude far upstream into the saline estuary. This intrusion reduces the estuarine nutrient concentrations and export fluxes, thereby reinforcing the nutrient limitation in the coastal area.

The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the incidence of new ischaemic cerebral lesions following transcervical CAS with carotid flow <b>reversal</b> for neuroprotection. <b>Materials</b> and MethodsThirty-one consecutive patients underwent transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal. A stroke scale and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) were performed within 24  h before and after the procedure. DW-MRI studies were compared blindly by two independent neuroradiologists. New hyper-intense DW signals were interpreted as ischaemic infarcts. The progress of all patients was followed for at least 30 days following intervention. ResultsAll procedures were technically successful. Nineteen (61 %) patients were symptomatic Mean carotid flow reversal time was 22  min. There were no major adverse events at 30 days. All patients remained neurologically intact without increase in the stroke scale. Thirty subjects had paired DW-MRI studies. Post-procedural DW-MRI ischaemic infarcts were found in four (12. 5 %) patients, all ipsilateral to the treated hemisphere and asymptomatic. During follow-up, all stents remained patent and all patients remained stroke-free. ConclusionsThese data suggest that transcervical carotid stenting with carotid flow reversal carries a low incidence of new ischaemic infarcts, significantly lower than that reported with transfemoral CAS. The transcervical approach with carotid flow reversal may improve the safety of CAS and has the potential to produce results comparable to those of carotid endarterectomy...|$|R
40|$|Ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin {{ordering}} {{is governed}} by the exchange interaction, the strongest force in magnetism. Understanding spin dynamics in magnetic materials {{is an issue of}} crucial importance for progress in information processing and recording technology. Usually the dynamics are studied by observing the collective response of exchange-coupled spins, that is, spin resonances, after an external perturbation by a pulse of magnetic field, current or light. The periods of the corresponding resonances range from one nanosecond for ferromagnets down to one picosecond for antiferromagnets. However, virtually nothing is known about the behaviour of spins in a magnetic material after being excited on a timescale faster than that corresponding to the exchange interaction (10 - 100 â��fs), that is, in a non-adiabatic way. Here we use the element-specific technique X-ray magnetic circular dichroism to study spin reversal in GdFeCo that is optically excited on a timescale pertinent to the characteristic time of the exchange interaction between Gd and Fe spins. We unexpectedly find that the ultrafast spin <b>reversal</b> in this <b>material,</b> where spins are coupled antiferromagnetically, occurs by way of a transient ferromagnetic-like state. Following the optical excitation, the net magnetizations of the Gd and Fe sublattices rapidly collapse, switch their direction and rebuild their net magnetic moments at substantially different timescales; the net magnetic moment of the Gd sublattice is found to reverse within 1. 5 picoseconds, which is substantially slower than the Fe reversal time of 300 femtoseconds. Consequently, a transient state characterized by a temporary parallel alignment of the net Gd and Fe moments emerges, despite their ground-state antiferromagnetic coupling.

The subjects were divided into two groups. One group consisted of 20 individuals (nine males and 11 females) in the age range of 25 - 57 years and they were exposed to checks subtending a visual angle of 90, 120, and 180 minutes of arc. Another group comprised of 20 individuals (10 males and 10 females) in the age range of 36 - 60 years and they were subjected to checks subtending a visual angle of 15, 30, and 120 minutes of arc. The stimulus configuration comprised of the transient pattern reversal method in which a black and white checker board is generated (full field) on a VEP Monitor by an Evoked Potential Recorder (RMS EMG. EPMARK II). The statistical analysis was done by One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using EPI INFO 6. Results: In Group I, the maximum (max.) P 100 latency of 98. 8 ± 4. 7 and the max.
