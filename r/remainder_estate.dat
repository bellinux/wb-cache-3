50|$|Many jurisdictions {{retain the}} {{possibility}} of creating a life estate, although this is uncommon. In the United States, life estates are most commonly used either to grant someone use of the property {{for the remainder of}} that person's life in a will, or by a grantor to reserve the right to continue using the property {{for the remainder of the}} grantor's life after it is sold. The right to ownership of the property after the death of the life estate owner is called the <b>remainder</b> <b>estate.</b> In England and Wales fee simple is the only freehold estate that remains; a life estate can only be created in equity and is not a right in property.|$|E

Real estate contracts are typically bilateral contracts (i. e., agreed to by two parties) and should have the legal requirements specified by contract law in general and should also be in writing to be enforceable.|$|R
