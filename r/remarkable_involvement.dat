Compared to controls, liver preparations from GP-treated calves showed an overall reduction the extent of the ill vitro ability to metabolize testosterone and a number of substrates, most those associated with CYP 2 C or CYP 3 A, which also displayed a reduced expression on western By contrast the tested hydrolytic and conjugative pathways were not significantly affected. As by northern blot, the lack of significant differences in CYP mRNA abundance point to a post-transcriptional effect of the GP combination.

40|$|Abstract—We {{studied the}} mural {{distribution}} of collagen types I and III and tropoelastin in enhanced experimental atherogenesis induced in rabbits by hyperlipidemia superimposed by hypertension. Animals were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 5 weeks and also subjected to midthoracic aortic coarctation for 4 weeks. Serum cholesterol levels were increased {{and blood pressure}} was elevated proximal to the coarctation. Foam cell lesions developed in the aorta proximal to the coarctation. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that gene expression of collagen types I and III and tropoelastin was upregulated, with a differential distribution across the arterial wall. New collagen type I was mainly distributed in the intima, the outer media, and the adventitia. New collagen type III was spread more uniformly across the wall, including the adventitia, whereas tropoelastin was mainly localized in intimal foam cell lesions. Morphometric data showed an increase in wall thickness. These results suggest that collagen types I and III {{play a role in}} remodeling of the aortic wall in response to hypertension. The <b>remarkable</b> <b>involvement</b> of the adventitia in this response indicates that the adventitia is {{an important component of the}} arterial wall. Tropoelastin is closely associated with foam cell lesion formation, suggesting a role for this component in atherogenesis as well. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2000; 20 : 2566 - 2572.)

40|$|Awareness {{of illness}} {{is a form}} of self-knowledge {{concerning}} information about the pathological state, its functional consequence, and the way it affects the patient and his interaction with the environment. Unawareness of illness has raised much interest for its consequences on compliance with treatment, prognosis, and the patient's quality of life. This review highlights the great complexity of this phenomenon both at phenomenological and etiopathogenic levels in stroke, traumatic brain injury, psychosis, dementias, and mood disorders. In particular, the clinical expression is characterized by failure to acknowledge being ill, misattribution of symptoms, and noncompliance with treatment. Unawareness of illness may also be linked with characteristics that are peculiar to each individual disturbance, such as symptom duration and cognitive impairment. Despite a long-lasting interest in the clinical characteristics of unawareness, only recently has the focus of research investigated pathogenic mechanisms, with sometimes controversial results. The vast majority of studies have pointed out a <b>remarkable</b> <b>involvement</b> of the right hemisphere. Specifically, functional and structural changes of the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and some other frontal areas have often been found to be associated with awareness deficit, as well as parieto-temporal areas and the thalamus, although to a lesser extent. These data indicate the present difficulty of localizing a specific cerebral area involved in unawareness and suggest the existence of possible brain circuits responsible for awareness. In conclusion, phenomenological manifestations of poor awareness are well outlined in their complexity, whereas neuroanatomic and neuropsychological findings are still too vague and sparse and need further, greater efforts to be clarified...|$|E
5000|$|Devipuram has <b>remarkable</b> high female <b>involvement.</b> The {{participation}} {{of women in}} Devipuram {{is largely due to}} the weakening of India’s caste and kin communities, which is a result of rapid urbanization. This social shift leads, for some individuals, to a loss of dharma and an introduction of anomie in its place. Devipuram relieves anomie by creating a community which empowers women to thrive within self-determined social roles.|$|R
40|$|An {{elderly woman}} with a complex medical history {{presented}} with a left forearm mass that slowly developed for several months. The excisional biopsy of this skin mass was <b>remarkable</b> for <b>involvement</b> by a follicle centre cell derived lymphoma with a nodular and diffuse pattern associated with a subset of scattered Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg like cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies did not detect the presence of IgH-bcl 2 fusion transcript, and molecular studies were negative for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements and EBV DNA sequences. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg like cells are rarely reported in FLs, and the association with primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma is extremely rarely seen. To our knowledge, our case is the second case of primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma with Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg like cells...|$|R
50|$|A small {{fortified}} castle {{from the}} 12th century existed until the French Revolution, leaving only behind the tower {{that gives the}} estate its name. Viticulture first began in the 19th century when the land {{was attached to the}} estate of Château La Brède, birthplace of Montesquieu. Under the ownership of Monsieur Charropin, the estate took the identity of Latour-Martillac, but the wine it produced was not noted as <b>remarkable</b> until the <b>involvement</b> of Edward Kressmann. A German wine trader, he became gradually more involved in the vinification from when he first began distributing Latour-Martillac, until he acquired the estate in 1929. Following the death of the owner, Kressmann faced the risk of losing a wine that had been a favourite of his clients for generations, and bought it outright.|$|R
40|$|The reverse {{engineering}} process {{represents one of}} the best known methodologies for creating three-dimensional (3 D) virtual models starting from physical ones. Even if {{in the last few years}} its usage has significantly increased, the <b>remarkable</b> <b>involvement</b> of the operator has until now represented a significant constraint for its growth. Having regard to the fact that this process, and in particular its first step (that is the acquisition phase), strongly depends on the operator's ability and expertise, this paper aims at proposing a strategy for automatically supporting an "optimal" acquisition phase. Moreover, the acquisition phase represents the only moment in which there is a direct contact between the virtual model and the physical model. For this reason, designing an "optimal" acquisition phase will provide as output an efficient set of morphological data, which will turn out to be extremely useful for the following {{reverse engineering}} passages (pre-processing, segmentation, fitting, …). This scenario drives the researcher to use a selectivesampling plan, whose grid dimensions are correlated with the complexity of the local surface region analyzed, instead of a constant one. As a consequence, this work proposes a complete operative strategy which, starting from a first raw preliminary acquisition, will provide a new selectivesampling plan during the acquisition phase, in order to allow a deeper and more efficient new scansion. The proposed solution does not require the creation of any intermediate model and relies exclusively on the analysis of the metrological performances of the 3 D scanner device and of the morphological behaviour of the surface acquired...|$|E

40|$|S. J. P. Kruger, {{four times}} {{president}} of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR), {{played a central role}} in the Afrikaners' struggle for independence both in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. His significance as a leader also becomes apparent when considering the plethora of literature written on him both during his lifetime and after. Not only is his own life story intertwined with the history and development of the ZAR and rise of Afrikanerdom, but as a leading figure he was also subject to much criticism. This was particularly evident in the years leading up to and during the South African War (1899 - 1902) when the ZAR forces clashed with Britain. Against this dualistic background a stereotypical and binary portrayal of Kruger emerged. Some of these have been perpetuated into the literature of the 21 st century. However, despite the array of works published on Kruger, it remains <b>remarkable</b> why his <b>involvement</b> in the South African War has not received extensive scrutiny, principally his "behind-the-scenes" contribution. It is to this prominent event in the life of Kruger that this study turns with particular reference to the year 1900 which has been identified as a so-called "crisis period". Using the War telegrams dispatched by Kruger during the said period, this study endeavours to not only investigate Kruger's War-time contribution and motives, but also to reassess his character in the context hereof. Although much of the evidence suggests that the Kruger persona is somewhat entrenched, the War telegrams however point to additional representations of Kruger and call thus for further reappraisal.
