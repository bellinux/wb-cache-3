40|$|Stable carbon {{isotopes}} {{have been}} used to assess the coupling between changes in environmental conditions and the response of soil or ecosystem respiration, usually by studying the time-lagged response of δ 13 C of respired CO 2 (δ 13 C R) to changes in photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination (Δ i). However, the lack of a systematic response of δ 13 C R to environmental changes in field studies stresses the need to better understand the mechanisms to this response. We experimentally created a wide range of carbon allocation and respiration conditions in Fagus sylvatica mesocosms, by growing saplings under different temperatures and girdling combinations. After a period of drought, a water pulse was applied and the short-term responses of δ 13 C in soil CO 2 efflux (δ 13 C <b>R</b> <b>soil)</b> and δ 13 C in aboveground plant respiration (δ 13 C R above) were measured, as well as leaf gas exchange rates and soil microbial biomass δ 13 C responses. Both δ 13 C <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> and δ 13 C R above values of all the trees decreased immediately after the water pulse. These responses were not driven by changes in Δ i, but rather by a fast release of C stored in roots and shoots. Changes in δ 13 C <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> associated with the water pulse were significantly positively correlated with changes in stomatal conductance, showing a strong impact of the plant component on δ 13 C <b>R</b> <b>soil.</b> However, three days after the water pulse in girdled trees, changes in δ 13 C <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> were related to changes in microbial biomass δ 13 C, suggesting that changes in the carbon source respired by soil microorganisms also contributed to the response of δ 13 C <b>R</b> <b>soil.</b> Our study shows that improving our mechanistic understanding of the responses of δ 13 C R to changes in environmental conditions requires the understanding of not only the plant's physiological responses, but also the responses of soil microorganisms and of plant-microbial interactions...|$|E
40|$|Aims: In {{view of the}} {{projected}} increase in global air temperature and CO 2 concentration, the effects of climatic changes on biomass production, CO 2 fluxes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization in newly established grassland communities were investigated. We hypothesized that above- and below-ground biomass, gross primary productivity (GPP), AMF root colonization and nutrient acquisition would increase {{in response to the}} future climate conditions. Furthermore, we expected that increased below-ground C allocation would enhance soil respiration (<b>R</b> <b>soil).</b> Methods: Grassland communities were grown either at ambient temperatures with 375 ppm CO 2 (Amb) or at ambient temperatures + 3 °C with 620 ppm CO 2 (T+CO 2). Results: Total biomass production and GPP were stimulated under T+CO 2. Above-ground biomass was increased under T+CO 2 while belowground biomass was similar under both climates. The significant increase in root colonization intensity under T+CO 2, and therefore the better contact between roots and AMF, probably determined the higher above-ground P and N content. <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> was not significantly affected by the future climate conditions, only showing a tendency to increase under future climate {{at the end of the}} season. Conclusions: Newly established grasslands benefited from the exposure to elevated CO 2 and temperature in terms of total biomass production; higher root AMF colonization may partly provide the nutrients required to sustain this growth response. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Vegetation was sampled in an array of 60 quadrats arranged in transects running parallel with the edge of the woodland and at increasing distances from it. Species abundance at each quadrat was measured using the Domin scale. Point quadrats were used to allow assessment of vegetation structure and canopy cover at each quadrat was described using a point centred quarter method. Environmental variables including illumination, P. A. <b>R.,</b> <b>soil</b> temperature, air temperature, soil moisture, soil organic content and pH were measured at each quadrat. Data was analysed using a variety of univariate and multivariate statistics. Results indicated a microclimatic and vegetational transition zone' of approximately 10 metres in diameter at the northern boundary of Moorhouse Wood and adjacent habitats. This was indicated by; 1. Illumination, P A <b>R.,</b> <b>soil</b> and ah temperature, soil moisture and soil organic content all underwent significant alterations over this distance and continued to change more gradually further into the wood. 2. Edge oriented patterns of variation were found in both canopy and ground floral community composition and in general, species with ecological preferences for disturbed or for warm and light conditions were increased in abundance {{at the edge of the}} woodland. Some evidence of invasion by non-woodland species was found but these did not appear to be colonising the woodland interior. 3. Ground vegetation structure was altered by proximity to the woodland edge. This was shown to be unrelated to most microclimatic variables and it is suggested that a high level of disturbance is more likely to be responsible for the decreased height of vegetation at the boundary. Comments are made concerning the significance of these findings and their importance in understanding the affects of habitat fragmentation on the woodland microclimate and ground flora...|$|E

30|$|Performance {{standards}} in SMCRA (Sections  515 (b)(5) and (6)) require that all topsoil be salvaged. The term “soil” refers to all surface soil material {{to a depth}} of broken bedrock that can be removed with a dozer. Soil includes the O, A, E, B, C, and <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> horizons, and should include soil organic matter and plant materials. If the topsoil is less than 15  cm thick (6 inches) thick and a topsoil substitute has not been approved, regulations require the operator to remove the topsoil along with a suitable amount of unconsolidated material immediately below the topsoil (C horizon) and treat the mixture as topsoil. Topsoil should be redistributed immediately unless it is impractical, in which case it should be stockpiled, segregated, and protected. When redistributed, the soil must achieve “an approximately uniform, stable thickness,” although that thickness may be varied to meet revegetation goals; and should be consistent with the post-mining land use, contours, and drainage systems. The soil redistribution operation should prevent excess compaction.|$|E

40|$|Decades {{of studies}} {{on the role of}} {{decomposition}} in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling have focused on organic matter (OM) of plant origin. Despite potentially large inputs of belowground OM from fungal cell walls and invertebrate exoskeletons, studies of the decomposability of their major constituent, chitin, are scarce. To explore effects on soil C dynamics of chitin, in comparison with two plant-derived chemicals, cellulose and lignin, I conducted a field-based chemical-addition experiment. The design contained three chemical treatments plus a control, with four replicates in each of two species of tropical trees grown in plantations. The chemicals were added in reagent-grade form at a rate that doubled the natural detrital C inputs of 1000 g C m− 2 y− 1. Despite its purported recalcitrance, chitin was metabolized quickly, with soil respiration (<b>R</b> <b>soil)</b> increasing by 64 % above the control within days, coupled with a 32 % increase in soil extractable ammonium. Cellulose, which was expected to be labile, was not readily decomposed, whereas lignin was rapidly metabolized at least partially in one of the forest types. I examined effects of stoichiometry by adding to all treatments ammonium nitrate in a quantity that adjusted the C:N of cellulose (166) to that of chitin (10), using both field and in vitro experiments. For cellulose, CO 2 release increased more than five- to eightfold after N addition in root-free soil incubated in vitro, but only 0 – 20 % in situ where roots were intact. By the end of the 2 -year-long field experiment, fine-root biomass tended to be higher in the chitin treatment, where <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> was significantly higher. Together these findings suggest that soil N availability limited cellulose decomposition, even in this Neotropical forest with high soil N stocks, and also that trees successfully competed for N that became available as chitin decomposed. These results indicate that the major constituent of cell walls of soil fungi, chitin, can decompose rapidly and release substantial N that is available for plant and microbial growth. As a consequence, soil fungi can stimulate soil OM decomposition and N cycling, and thereby play a disproportionate role in ecosystem C and N dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Soil soluble organic {{nitrogen}} (SON) {{can play an}} important role in soil nitrogen (N) cycling in forest ecosystems. This study examined the effect of land-use change from a native forest (NF) to a first rotation (1 R) and subsequent second rotation (2 R) hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) plantation on soil SON pools. The impact of residue management on SON pools was also investigated in the 2 R forest, where SON was measured in tree rows (2 R-T) and windrows (2 R-W). Various extraction techniques were used to measure SON pool size in the 0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm layers of soil. The results showed that land-use change had a significant impact on soil SON pools. In the 0 - 10 cm layer, 3. 2 - 8. 7, 14 - 23, 20 - 28, 60 - 160 and 127 - 340 mg SON kg- 1 were extracted by water, 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4, 2 M KCl, hot water and hot 2 M KCl, respectively. The size of the SON pools and the potential production of SON (PPSON) were generally highest in the NF soil and lowest in the 2 R-T soil, and in all forest types decreased with soil depth. The larger SON pools in the NF soil coincided with lower soil, litter and root C:N ratios, suggesting that the difference in the size of SON pools between the NF and 1 <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> may be related to differences in the quality of organic matter input under the different forest ecosystems. Differences in the size of SON pools between the 1 <b>R</b> <b>soil</b> and the 2 R soils and between the 2 R-T soil and the 2 R-W soil may be related to the quantity of organic matter input and time since disturbance. Significant relationships were found between the SON extracted by 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 (SONps) and 2 M KCl (SONKCl), and also among the SON extracted by hot 2 M KCl (SONhKCl), hot water (SONhw) and water (SONw), suggesting that the organic N released by these groups of extracts may be at least partly from similar pools.
