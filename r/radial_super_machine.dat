25|$|Big <b>Machine</b> and <b>Super</b> <b>Machine</b> {{wrestled}} {{the majority}} of the matches against Bobby Heenan's cronies, occasionally with Lou Albano joining them to face Bundy, Studd and Heenan in six man tag-team action. Soon, other masked wrestlers (whose identities were generally obvious) appeared and temporarily teamed with The Machines. On September 10, Big and <b>Super</b> <b>Machine</b> were joined by Animal Machine to defeat King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd and Bobby Heenan. On September 16 the Machines were joined by Hulk Machine as the trio defeated the Heenan Family. The Hulk Machine returned on September 22 and helped the Machines win in the main event at the Madison Square Garden. A few weeks later the Machines received help from the kilt-wearing Piper Machine. On a house show in St. Paul, Minnesota the Machines even got the help of Crusher Machine, pinning John Studd to gain the victory for his team. On October 28, The Machines wrestled their last match under that gimmick, a loss to Bundy and Studd. This also marked the last appearance as a manager in the WWF for Lou Albano.|$|R

2500|$|Less {{than two}} months after the {{suspension}} was announced, vignettes appeared on WWF Television hailing the debut of a masked tag team from the Orient, known as [...] "The Machines": Giant <b>Machine</b> and <b>Super</b> <b>Machine.</b> The team announced that they were coming to America soon with their manager Lou Albano and that their only mission was to prove that they were the number one tag team in the world. <b>Super</b> <b>Machine</b> was portrayed by Bill Eadie. [...] His ring name was a play on his previous gimmick [...] "Masked Superstar". Though it was clear that Giant Machine was none other than André the Giant, commentators sold that Giant Machine might be Giant Baba, and not André, under the mask. In televised interviews with Studd and Bundy, Studd would question the two smaller Machines being Japanese as one had a West Texas accent (Big Machine/Mulligan) and the other had a [...] "New York accent" [...] (Super Machine/Eadie). On the WWF show Tuesday Night Titans, Heenan claimed he knew of no Japanese wrestler who was 7'4" [...] tall, weighed over 500lbs and spoke with a French accent.|$|R
