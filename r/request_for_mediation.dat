Meanwhile, the Normans of Aversa pacified the valley of the Sangro. After Pandulf fled to Constantinople, Guaimar turned his attention to Amalfi. In April 1039, in support of the deposed and blinded Manso II, Guaimar forced the abdication and exile of John II and his mother, Maria, a sister of Pandulf. Guaimar installed himself as duke. Then in July, he conquered Sorrento, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1034. He gave it to his brother Guy with the title of duke. He also received the homage of the Duke of Naples, John V, who had brought the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>mediation</b> to Constantinople in 1037.|$|E

50|$|On December 22, 2009, a {{magistrate}} of the Franklin county {{juvenile court}} denied Bary's parents' <b>request</b> <b>for</b> forced <b>mediation</b> {{and set the}} date for the dependency hearing {{for the end of}} January. The hearing was canceled on January 19, 2010, when a deal between the parties was reached with Bary becoming a dependent of the State of Ohio in exchange for admitting that she broke the rules when she ran away. On January 29, 2010, once it was learned that Bary would be allowed to contact Reverend Lorenz and his wife, Bary's parents, on the strict advice of their lawyer, requested to back out of the deal. On March 2, 2010, Judge Elizabeth Gill denied their request and ordered them to continue their counseling sessions so that Rifqa could return home to her family before she turned 18.|$|R
40|$|Marital {{separation}} {{is a common}} experience {{in the lives of}} many families. It entails the failure of the couple's life plan and it represents, on an individual level, an experience of loss that can produce symptomatic behaviours and dysfunctional relationship dynamics. These negative consequences, affecting children in particular, are not so much related to the change in the family configuration, as to the level of conflict between parents and to their greater or lesser ability to reflect jointly on the impact of their disagreements on the emotional state of their children. Awareness of the possible effects of conflictual separation on the psychological well-being of children has increased <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> family <b>mediation</b> interventions. This practice is now internationally acknowledged as a valid method to significantly reduce even the most bitter conflict, facilitating the resumption of parental responsibility in the couple. This article describes the practice of an Italian Family Mediation Service that works with couples in highly conflictual situations, promoting the re-appropriation of a joint approach to parenting. It also outlines the client profile, both concerning the couple’s agreement to consult the service, the referral source {{and the nature of the}} separation as defined by Italian law...|$|R

The dispute stemmed from Johnston Press' announcement in June 2011 of plans to cut 18 jobs including two editors. Following the ballot {{and the failure to}} reach a settlement with Johnston Press staff walked out on indefinite strike on 15 July 2011.

Johnston Press went on to service notice of redundancy upon the South Yorkshire Times editor Jim Oldfield on 8 August 2011.

5000|$|The Lutheran {{views on}} the veneration of Mary were {{interpreted}} differently by different theologians over time. Key is his interpretation of the Magnificat of Mary, which to some is {{a relic of the}} Catholic past, but to others a clear indication that he maintained a Marian piety. Luther states in his Magnificat that one should pray to Mary, so God would give and do, through her will, what we ask. But, he adds, it is God's work alone. Some interpret his Magnificat as a personal supplication to Mary, but not as a prayerful <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>mediation.</b> An important indicator of Luther's {{views on the}} veneration of Mary are not only his writings but also approved practices of Lutherans during his lifetime. The singing of the Magnificat in Latin was maintained in many German Lutheran communities. The Church Order (Kirchenordnung) of Brandenburg, Bugenhagen Braunschweig and other cities and districts decreed by the royal heads of the Lutheran Church maintained three Marian feast days to be observed as public holidays. It is known that Martin Luther approved of this. He also approved of keeping Marian paintings and statues in the Churches. Luther did, however, say that [...] "Mary prays for the church". He also advocated the use {{of the first half of}} the Hail Mary (that is, [...] "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.") as a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Virgin.|$|E

The entire process is very informal, and at no charge, and is therefore very accessible to labourers, who often utilise it: About 300 new cases are brought before the Commission <b>for</b> Conciliation, <b>Mediation</b> and Arbitration daily. In addition to the Commission <b>for</b> Conciliation, <b>Mediation</b> and Arbitration, 1995 saw the introduction of bargaining councils, which allow for communication across the industry.
