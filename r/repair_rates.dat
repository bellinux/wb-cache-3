5000|$|In {{the past}} two decades, some {{surgeons}} have embraced surgical techniques to repair the damaged native valve, rather than replace it. These techniques were pioneered by a French heart surgeon, Dr. Alain F. Carpentier. A repair still involves major cardiac surgery but for many patients presents the significant advantage of avoiding blood thinners and may provide a more durable result. Not all damaged valves are suitable for repair; in some, the state of valve disease is too advanced and replacement is necessary. Often, a surgeon must decide during the operation itself whether a repair or a replacement is {{the best course of}} action. For patients with {{the most common type of}} mitral valve disease, termed [...] "degenerative" [...] or [...] "myxomatous" [...] mitral valve disease, <b>repair</b> <b>rates</b> are very high and long term durability is excellent.|$|E

5000|$|A {{reliability}} program plan {{may also}} be used to evaluate and improve availability of a system by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability & maintainability and not on reliability. Improving maintainability is generally easier than improving reliability. Maintainability estimates (<b>repair</b> <b>rates)</b> are also generally more accurate. However, because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large, they are likely to dominate the availability calculation (prediction uncertainty problem), even when maintainability levels are very high. When reliability is not under control, more complicated issues may arise, like manpower (maintainers / customer service capability) shortages, spare part availability, logistic delays, lack of repair facilities, extensive retro-fit and complex configuration management costs, and others. The problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the [...] "domino effect" [...] of maintenance-induced failures after repairs. Focusing only on maintainability is therefore not enough. If failures are prevented, none of the other issues are of any importance, and therefore reliability is generally regarded as {{the most important part of}} availability. Reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks, etc. But, as GM and Toyota have belatedly discovered, TCO also includes the downstream liability costs when reliability calculations have not sufficiently or accurately addressed customers' personal bodily risks. Often a trade-off is needed between the two. There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership. Testability of a system should also be addressed in the plan, as this is the link between reliability and maintainability. The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system (e.g., by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability.|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} parameters, namely {{breakdown}} <b>rate</b> (α) and <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> (β), on the queue {{length of the}} system have been demonstrated in Figs.  1 and 2. It is noticed that the breakdown <b>rate</b> and <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> {{are supposed to have}} contradictory effect on the queue length of the system which is very true. It is clear from Fig.  1 a–c that the queue length increases as the breakdown rate increases from 0.008 to 0.01  U for all the service time distributions. The maximum number of customers or queue length is observed in the case 1 (c) when the service time is supposed to be gamma distributed. On the other hand, in Fig.  2 wherein graphs are plotted for different values of <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> β (0.6, 0.8 and 1), LS decreases with an increase in the <b>repair</b> <b>rate.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that an increase in breakdown rate forces the customers to accumulate in the system due to the non-working condition of the server and hence increases the queue length. However, an increase in the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> helps in the fast recovery of the server and thus reduces the number of customers in the system.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} that stress-induced DNA damage may be responsible for cell lethality, cancer proneness and/or immune reaction. However, statistical features of their <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> remain poorly documented. In order to interpret the shape of the radiation-induced DNA damage repair curves with a minimum of biological assumptions, we introduced the concept of repair probability, specific to any individual radiation-induced DNA damage, whatever its biochemical type. We strengthened the apparent paradox that the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of a population of DNA damage is time-dependent even if the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> of the individual DNA damage is constant. Hence, the existing models, based on a dual approach of the DNA repair may be insufficient for describing the DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> over a large range of repair times. Since the repair probability of DNA damage cannot be assessed individually, the measurement of the DNA <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> is assumed to consist in determining the instantaneous mean of all repair probabilities. The relevance of this model was examined with different endpoints: cell species, genotypes, radiation type and chromatin condensation. The Euler's Gamma function was shown to provide the distribution the most consistent with such hypotheses. Furthermore, formulas, deduced from the Gamma distribution, were found to be compatible with our previous model, empirically defined but based on a variable repair half-time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With {{the growth}} of memory {{capacity}} and density, test cost and yield improvement are becoming more important. In the case of embedded memories for systems-on-a-chip (SOC), built-in redundancy analysis (BIRA) is widely used {{as a solution to}} solve quality and yield issues by replacing faulty cells with extra good cells. However, previous BIRA approaches focused mainly on em-bedded memories rather than commodity memories. Many BIRA approaches require extra hardware overhead to achieve the op-timal <b>repair</b> <b>rate,</b> which means that 100 % of solution detection is guaranteed for intrinsically repairable dies, or they suffer a loss of <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> to minimize the hardware overhead. In order to achieve both low area overhead and optimal <b>repair</b> <b>rate,</b> a novel BIRA approach is proposed and it builds a line-based searching tree. The proposed BIRA minimizes the storage capacity requirements to store faulty address information by dropping all unnecessary faulty addresses for inherently repairable die. The proposed BIRA analyzes redundancies quickly and efficiently with optimal <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> by using a selected fail count comparison algorithm. Experi-mental results show that the proposed BIRA achieves optimal re-pair rate, fast analysis speed, and nearly optimal repair solutions with a relatively small area overhead.

40|$|Abstract: Business {{facilities}} among domestic architectures have rapidly {{been constructed}} along with domestic economic development. It {{is an important}} facility taking the second largest proportion next to apartment buildings among current 31 building types of fire department classification of 2012 year for urban architectures. The expected service life of business facilities is 15 years, but 70 % of those in urban areas have surpassed the 15 year service life as of the present 2014. Thus, the demand for urgent rehabilitation of such facilities is constantly increasing due to the aging and performance deterioration of the facilities’main finishing materials. Especially, the business facilities are being used for the lease of company office or private office, and such problems as aging and performance deterioration of the facilities could cause less competitive edge for leasing and real estate value depreciation for the O&M (Operation & Management) agent and the owner, respectively. Therefore, an effective planned rehabilitation as a preventive measure according to the standardized <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> {{by the number of}} years after the construction is in need in order to prevent the aging and performance deterioration of the facilities(La et al. 2001). Nonetheless, domestic repair/rehabilitation standards based on the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> are mainly limited to apartment buildings and pubic institutions, resulting in impractical application of such standards to business facilities. It has been investigated and analyzed that annual <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> data for each finishing material are required for examination of the applicability of the <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> standard for the purpose of establishment of a repair plan. Hence, this study aimed at developing a <b>repair</b> <b>rate</b> computation model for finishin...|$|R

Firstly, we propose a consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN) estimator of availability for such repairable system. Based on the CAN estimator of the system availability, interval estimation and testing (hypothesis) are performed. To implement the simulation inference for the system availability, we adopt two repair-time distributions, such as lognormal and Weibull distribution, in which three types of Weibull distribution are considered according to the shape parameter.
