5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{formation of the}} Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis {{is that it was}} formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E
