5|$|Double mutants deleted {{for both}} MLH3 (major pathway) and MMS4 (minor pathway) showed {{dramatically}} reduced crossing over compared to wild-type (6- to 17-fold); however spore viability was <b>reasonably</b> high (62%) and chromosomal disjunction appeared mostly functional.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Swift made {{reference}} to the moons of Mars, about 150 years before their actual discovery by Asaph Hall, detailing <b>reasonably</b> accurate descriptions of their orbits, in the 19th chapter of his novel Gulliver's Travels.|$|E
5|$|Reaction of imidazol-2-ylidenes with 1-bromohexane gave 90% of the 2-substituted adduct, {{with only}} 10% of the {{corresponding}} alkene, indicating that these molecules are also <b>reasonably</b> nucleophilic.|$|E
5|$|There is a Farmers' Market in the Parade every Friday from 8.30am to 2pm, with a {{wide range}} of <b>reasonably</b> priced local produce.|$|E
5|$|Time {{and space}} are only {{relevant}} to this initial inquiry {{to the extent that}} they inform us whether an individual would <b>reasonably</b> expect to be stopped and searched at a geographic point beyond the international border.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which are <b>reasonably</b> clear.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{recognized}} as such {{at the time}} of its discovery, Compsognathus is the first theropod dinosaur known from a <b>reasonably</b> complete fossil skeleton. Until the 1990s, it was the smallest known non-avialan dinosaur; earlier it had been incorrectly thought to be the closest relative of Archaeopteryx.|$|E
5|$|An older snake may shed {{its skin}} only {{once or twice}} a year, but a younger, still-growing snake, may shed up to four times a year. The {{discarded}} skin gives a perfect imprint of the scale pattern and it is usually possible to identify the snake if this discard is <b>reasonably</b> complete and intact.|$|E
5|$|By 1721, the Baptist {{community}} in Taunton had grown large, and <b>reasonably</b> affluent. They {{built a new}} chapel, funded entirely by the congregation, very near {{to the site of}} the original Meeting House. The pastor of the church at the time was Joseph Jeffries, and during his ministry the church transitioned from a Baptist church to Unitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Grameen {{has offered}} credit to classes of people {{formerly}} underserved: the poor, women, illiterate, and unemployed people. Access to credit {{is based on}} reasonable terms, such as the group lending system and weekly-instalment payments, with <b>reasonably</b> long terms of loans, enabling the poor to build on their existing skills to earn better income in each cycle of loans.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{played the}} piano <b>reasonably</b> well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him {{assimilate}} into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein {{is said to have}} begun playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.|$|E
5|$|Only Kronshtadts hull {{survived the}} war <b>reasonably</b> intact {{and was about}} 10% {{complete}} in 1945. She was judged obsolete and the Soviets considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, but the idea was rejected and both hulls were scrapped in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish can be {{manufactured}} using large vats, <b>reasonably</b> powerful heaters and air conditioners. There is no set method of manufacture, although most methods use pressures of two atmospheres {{to ensure the}} naphtha does not boil off, and temperatures of up to 85°C.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company {{brought a}} case against Eastern Counties Leather in the High Court of Justice, wanting £1 million in damages {{for the cost of}} finding a new {{borehole}} and an unsuccessful attempt to decontaminate the original one, and an injunction to prevent any more use of PCE. They argued that Eastern Counties Leather were liable in three ways; first, in negligence, second, in nuisance, and third, under the rule developed in Rylands v Fletcher. The case came before Kennedy J, who dismissed all three of the Company's claims. On the matter of negligence, he held that the damage had to be <b>reasonably</b> foreseeable, as was required under Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd; he applied this same test to the claim under nuisance. Applying the case of Hughes v Lord Advocate, Kennedy found that the harm was not <b>reasonably</b> foreseeable, and both actions under nuisance and negligence must fail.|$|E
5|$|The Stokes Mortar {{was rapidly}} {{developed}} {{when it became}} clear that some type of weapon was needed to provide artillery-like fire support to the infantry. The weapon was fully man-transportable yet also capable of firing <b>reasonably</b> powerful shells at targets beyond the range of rifle grenades.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} around Passchendaele {{proved to}} be the division's last offensive actions for 1917 and they spent the winter months in the rear training, or undertaking defensive duties in <b>reasonably</b> quiet sectors of the line as they were reformed and brought back up to strength. Around this time also, the five Australian divisions on the Western Front were reorganised into a unified command structure under the Australian Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} view from the boundary of the Nackington Road end of the St. Lawrence Ground with Canterbury Cathedral visible in the background. The painting has Blythe in the action of bowling from the Pavilion End to Johnny Tyldesley. Tayler compressed the view of the playing area so that he could feature all of Kent's eleven players while keeping them recognisable and <b>reasonably</b> sized.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{skeleton}} {{was collected}} from the red floodplain mudstone of the Sebeș Formation of Romania. It consists {{of a variety of}} vertebrae, as well as much of pectoral and pelvic girdles, and {{a large part of the}} limbs. It is the first <b>reasonably</b> complete and well-preserved theropod from the Late Cretaceous of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of a combination of}} several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single <b>reasonably</b> foreseeable incident.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can <b>reasonably</b> ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was <b>reasonably</b> {{good and}} {{possibly}} {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
5|$|As {{regards the}} first question, in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the Singapore High Court adopted four {{conditions}} {{set out in}} De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) {{to determine whether a}} legitimate expectation has been created. The public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is <b>reasonably</b> expected to apply.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while <b>reasonably</b> stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in <b>reasonably</b> foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Left Alliance's loss of seats, its {{chairman}} Paavo Arhinmäki was still <b>reasonably</b> {{satisfied with the}} party's performance in the election, due to his claims that the media had concentrated on the four major parties during the campaign. However, Arhinmäki got the most personal votes in his electoral district of Helsinki. The Left Alliance's support was highest in Lapland with 16.7% of the votes and lowest in Southern Savonia with 2.2%.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in <b>reasonably</b> good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept <b>reasonably</b> short.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus and Bacchante were {{transferred}} to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of the Suez Canal, although the Turkish raid on the Suez Canal had already been repulsed {{by the time that}} they arrived in February. Upon arrival Rear-Admiral Richard Peirse, commander of the East Indies Station, hoisted his flag in Euryalus. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already occurred, and the sisters {{were transferred}} north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be <b>reasonably</b> quiet.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and roll, a <b>reasonably</b> discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to Hillside preparatory {{school in}} Surrey as his elder {{brothers}} had done. For {{a child with}} no interest in sport he acquitted himself <b>reasonably</b> well in cricket and rugby for the school. In class, he hated mathematics, was fair at classics, and excelled at English and divinity. Hillside encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including Mark Antony in Julius Caesar and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice.|$|E
5|$|In Amusement Todays Golden Ticket Awards for Best Steel Roller Coasters, Batman: The Ride ranked <b>reasonably</b> in {{the late}} 1990s before {{dropping}} off the poll, and returning once in 2005. The original installation at Six Flags Great America was ranked 23 and 25 in 1998 and 1999, respectively, before returning in 2005 at position 45. In 1998, the Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags St. Louis installations ranked 19 and 21, respectively.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but {{it is likely to}} have been <b>reasonably</b> secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language. There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} to be carried in a coat pocket or kept on a night-stand, and many have survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA. They remained <b>reasonably</b> popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are <b>reasonably</b> familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey could <b>reasonably</b> send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war. The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were <b>reasonably</b> effective.|$|E
