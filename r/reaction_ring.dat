40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The piston ring pack {{accounts}} for a disproportionate amount of the total engine frictional losses. The frictional behaviour of piston rings is significantly affected and governed by its flexible dynamics. The dynamically changing shape of the ring determines its contact geometry with the cylinder liner and hence affects the frictional losses. The compression ring undergoes a multitude of complex motions during the engine cycle prescribed by the gas pressure, contact <b>reaction,</b> <b>ring</b> tension, friction between the ring and its groove and inertial forces that excite a plethora of the ring’s modal responses. This adversely compromises the functionality of the ring {{through a number of}} undesired phenomena such as ring flutter, twist, rotation and jump.

This paper presents a methodology to directly solve the governing differential equations of motion for different forms of beam cross-section, where the shear and mass centres are not coincident, typical of the complex cross-sections of a variety of different piston compression rings.

In the presence of dodecane, the main reaction pathway involved contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring with concomitant elongation of the octyl chain by one carbon. Subsequently, the nonyl chain underwent methyl branching at carbon positions far from the ring. Methyl branching rearrangements of the cyclohexane ring of 1 -cyclohexyloctane were suppressed in the presence of dodecane. In the reaction product fraction of heptylmethylcyclohexanes, all cis-trans and positional isomers were formed except the 1, 1 ' -heptylmethylcyclohexane isomer. The isomer distributions were explained with pore mouth and key-lock catalysis. Pt/H-ZSM- 22 did not favor the paring reaction.

CT has been examined through a DNA duplex containing an A_ 6 -tract intervening between two 5 ‘-CGGC- 3 ‘ sites {{with each of}} the photooxidants covalently tethered to one end of the DNA duplex. CT is assayed both through determination of the yield of oxidative guanine damage and, in derivative DNA assemblies, by analysis of the yield of a faster oxidative trapping <b>reaction,</b> <b>ring</b> opening of N^ 2 -cyclopropylguanine (d^(CP) G) within the DNA duplex. We find clear differences in oxidative damage ratios at the distal versus proximal 5 ‘-CGGC- 3 ‘ sites depending upon the photooxidant employed. Importantly, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis data demonstrate the absence of any DNA aggregation by the DNA-bound intercalators. Hence, differences seen with assemblies containing various photooxidants cannot be attributed to differential aggregation. Comparisons in assemblies using different photooxidants thus reveal characteristics of the photooxidant as well as characteristics of the DNA assembly. In the series examined, the lowest distal/proximal DNA damage ratios are obtained with Ru and AQ, while, for both Rh and Et, high distal/proximal damage ratios are found. The oxidative damage yields vary in the order Ru > AQ > Rh > Et, and photooxidants that produce higher distal/proximal damage ratios have lower yields. While no oxidative DNA damage is detected using thionine as a photooxidant, oxidation is evident using the faster cyclopropylguanosine trap; here, a complex distance dependence is found. Differences observed among photooxidants as well as the complex distance dependence are attributed to differences in rates of back electron transfer (BET). Such differences are important to consider in developing mechanistic models for DNA CT...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated rotary percussive drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its <b>reaction</b> <b>ring</b> positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.

50|$|There {{are three}} groups of methods for the {{analysis}} of tannins: precipitation of proteins or alkaloids, <b>reaction</b> with phenolic <b>rings,</b> and depolymerization.|$|R
40|$|The enantiospecific total {{synthesis}} of (+) - 3 -epi-epohelmin {{was accomplished by}} rapid construction of the pyrrolizidine core starting from enantiopure L-pyrroglutamic acid. The key reaction included a highly regio-and stereoselective intramolecular cyclopropanation <b>reaction,</b> regioselective <b>ring</b> opening of a nitrogen-substituted donor-acceptor cyclopropane, stereoselective reduction of a ketone, chemoselective organolithium addition to a Weinreb amide, and chemoselective oxidation of an allylic alcohol...|$|R
50|$|Other {{possible}} {{reactions to}} form oxetane ring is the Paternò-Büchi <b>reaction.</b> The oxetane <b>ring</b> {{can also be}} formed through diol cyclization {{as well as through}} decarboxylation of a six-membered cyclic carbonate.|$|R
