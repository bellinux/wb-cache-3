5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> and send him off.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take {{a more active role in}} the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about {{whether or not he was}} a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E

5|$|Forced {{to choose}} between {{accepting}} depreciated money in payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors turned to the courts for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair that the replevin law violated the state and federal constitutions. This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's {{resignation}} as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did not <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> {{from public}} life. With {{the resumption of}} his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend. Hamilton influenced Washington {{in the composition of}} his Farewell Address by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington contemplated retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft that was used in a similar manner to Hamilton's.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the ACLU {{board of}} {{directors}} asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization. Baldwin objected, but {{a majority of the}} board elected to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from the position, and he was replaced by Patrick Murphy Malin. Under Malin's guidance, membership tripled to 30,000 by 1955the start of a 24-year period of continual growth leading to 275,000 members in 1974. Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates.|$|E

5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing credibility with. The executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's {{appeal for}} Soviet support split the {{government}} and led to mounting pressure from Western countries to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from power. Pan became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members and ordinary people. His supporters and opponents fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan had serious disagreements with the local military leadership. In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.|$|E

5|$|The Pros almost scored twice, {{but failed}} once because of ineligible {{receiver}} penalties. On the other hand, Pollard made a touchdown-saving tackle against Sternment {{in the third}} quarter. On the same drive, the Staleys missed a 30-yard field goal. The Staleys' Chamberlin attempted to injure Pollard twice {{in an attempt to}} <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from the game. The final score ended in a 0–0 tie; however, the Chicago Defender reported that the refereeing was biased towards Decatur.|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} Diefenbaker's retirement, {{especially}} from the Bay Street {{wing of the party}} as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly {{at the expense of the}} smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.|$|E
5|$|After Bart and Lisa see Krusty the Clown do {{his show}} at the Mt. Splashmore water park on TV, they {{consistently}} irritate and supplicate Homer about going there. Homer gets annoyed, but reluctantly decides to take them there. The family goes to Mt. Splashmore, where Bart, Lisa and Homer ride an intense water slide named H2WHOA!. Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced {{to shut down the}} ride and <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> {{with the help of a}} large crane.

5|$|Beginning in April 1934, and at Hitler's request, Heydrich and Himmler began {{building}} a dossier on Sturmabteilung (SA) leader Ernst Röhm {{in an effort}} to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> as a rival for party leadership. At this point, the SS was still part of the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary organisation which now numbered over 3 million men. At Hitler's direction, Heydrich, Himmler, Göring, and Viktor Lutze drew up lists of those who should be liquidated, starting with seven top SA officials and including many more. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. Röhm was shot without trial, along with the leadership of the SA. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Up to 200 people were killed in the action. Lutze was appointed SA's new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|During the 17 May 1992 Fairchild air show, Holland {{was again}} the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} again violated several safety regulations, including several low-altitude, steep turns {{in excess of}} 45° of bank and a high pitch angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (<b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from flying status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland or take {{any other kind of}} formal action.|$|E

5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As {{part of an effort}} to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Fleming {{enrolled}} at Eton College. Although not a high achiever academically, he excelled at athletics {{and held the}} title of Victor Ludorum ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927. He also edited a school magazine, The Wyvern. His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He spent {{less than a year}} there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting gonorrhea.|$|E
5|$|In his new positions, Khrushchev {{continued}} his kolkhoz consolidation scheme, which decreased {{the number of}} collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in Pravda in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would <b>remove</b> <b>him</b> from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.|$|E

5000|$|On January 31, 1956, the Board of Selectmen {{passed a}} {{preliminary}} resolution {{to hold a}} vote to remove Lawrence from office on March 3, 1956, as they no longer had confidence in him as town manager, they had been informed {{that he no longer}} wanted to serve as town manager, and the interests of the town would be best served by <b>removing</b> <b>him</b> from office. On February 3, 1956, Lawrence filed an injunction in Essex Superior Court that would prevent the Selectmen from <b>removing</b> <b>him</b> from office and prevent Charles C. DeFronzo from becoming temporary manager. Lawrence claimed that the Selectmen did not follow the proper procedure for <b>removing</b> <b>him</b> because they did not [...] "detail the specific reasons for his proposed removal". The case was dismissed and a year later the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the lower court's decision.|$|R
