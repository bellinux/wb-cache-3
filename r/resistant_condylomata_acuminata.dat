40|$|<b>Condylomata</b> <b>acuminata,</b> or genital warts, are proliferative lesions of genital {{epithelium}} {{caused by}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV types 6 and 11 {{are most often}} detected in these lesions. Genital lesions consistent with exophytic <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> were removed by excision biopsy from 65 patients, 41 of whom were otherwise healthy individuals (control group) and 24 of whom had conditions known to cause immunosuppression. Histologically, {{the majority of the}} lesions were typical <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata.</b> Three lesions removed from immunosuppressed individuals also contained foci of moderate to severe dysplasia (intraepithelial neoplasia grade II/III). A recently developed PCR and reverse blot strip assay was used to determine the specific HPV types present in the genital lesions. With a set of oligonucleotide primers based on the same primer binding regions used for the MY 09 and MY 11 primer pair, this PCR assay detects the presence of 27 HPV types known to infect the genital tract. All but two <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> contained either HPV type 6 or 11. The predominant type in the lesions from control patients was HPV 6, while lesions from immunosuppressed types most often contained HPV 11. <b>Condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> from immunosuppressed patients contained significantly more overall HPV types than lesions from the control group. HPV types associated with an increased risk of dysplasia (high-risk types) were detected in 42 (64. 6 %) of the total of 65 specimens; 18 (43. 9 %) specimens were detected in the 41 otherwise healthy individuals, and 24 (100 %) specimens were detected in the 24 immunosuppressed patients. HPV 16 was the most common high-risk type detected, found in 21 of 65 (32. 3 %) specimens. After HPV types 6 and 11, HPV types 53 and 54 were the most frequently detected low-risk HPV types. This study demonstrates that a high percentage of <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> lesions contain multiple HPV types, including types associated with a high risk of dysplastic abnormalities. Further studies are needed to determine the influence these additional HPV types have on the epidemiology of genital tract HPV infections and the natural history of <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata,</b> especially in immunosuppressed patients...|$|R

In most cases topical therapy is sufficient for successfully treating <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata.</b> Here, we report the case of a 51 -year old patient who suffered from a giant perianal located <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> which had developed over a period of more than 10 years. Imaging by MRI revealed a possible infiltration of the musculus sphincter ani externus. Because a topical treatment or a radiotherapy was considered unfeasible, a surgical treatment was the only therapeutic option in this unusual case. First, a colostomy was performed and subsequently a resection of the tumor with circular resection of the external portion of the musculus sphincter ani externus was performed. The large skin defect was closed by two gluteus flaps. The rectum wall was reinserted in the remnant of the musculus sphincter ani externus. Postoperatively, parts of the flaps developed necrosis. Therefore, a vacuum sealing therapy was initiated. Subsequently, the remaining skin defects were closed by autologous skin transplantation. Six months later the colostomy could be reversed. To date, one year after first surgery, the patient has still a normal sphincter function and no recurrence of the <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata.</b> This case report demonstrates how giant <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> can be successfully treated by extended surgical procedures including colostomy and plastic reconstruction of resulting defects upon resection...|$|R

Four variants, on the other hand, fell into different age groups. Condyloma acuminatum, showing marked cell death (5. 1 %) and observed exclusively among girls {{in the first decade}} of life, displayed numerous aciophil bodies, presumably reflecting single cell necroses. <b>Condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> showing marked acanthosis (16. 9 %) were found in patients between 12 and 30 years, dysplastic <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> (5. 9 %) between 20 and 62 years, and proliferative (giant) <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> (7. 2 %) between 31 and 80 years of age.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Imiquimod is {{a topical}} chemotherapic and {{immunostimulant}} agent with antitumoral and antiviral activities, used for anal <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> treatment, mainly in recurrences. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the imiquimod efficiency in chronic and recurrent anal <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> in HIV-infected persons. METHOD: A prospective study that analyzed 61 patients with recurrent anal condylomata treated with topic 5 % imiquimod, {{for at least}} 8 weeks. These patients had already been submitted to other topical and surgical treatments for anal warts. We evaluated the efficiency of this agent, through wart remission, with clinical examination and high-resolution anoscopy, CD 4 + T lymphocyte count and side effects. The patients were 55 males and 6 females, from 22 to 63 years old. RESULTS: Remission was seen in 90 %, being 46 % complete remission and 44 % partial remission. Other 10 % {{did not respond to}} the treatment with imiquimod within the 16 th week. Recurrences were observed in 11 % of patients in 24 -week follow-up. Statistics showed no differences in CD 4 + T cell scores when groups with and without complete remission were compared. Adverse effects were reported by 45 % of patients. They were mild to moderate burning (25 %), intense burning (7 %), ulcerative dermatitis (8 %) and systemic symptoms (5 %).

40|$|Exophytic <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> of the {{external}} genitalia of 40 patients were analyzed for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA by the Southern blot and hybrid capture methods. All lesions were initially analyzed by the Southern blot method by using a mixture of HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 whole genomic probes. Southern blots demonstrated characteristic PstI restriction patterns of HPV type 6, 11, or 16 {{in all but one}} lesion. HPV 6 subtypes accounted for 28 of 39 HPV-positive lesions. Twenty-seven of these 28 lesions contained HPV type 6 a, and 1 lesion contained HPV type 6 c. Eight lesions contained HPV type 11 and three contained HPV type 16. Two of the three <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> containing HPV type 16 were obtained from solid-organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive medications. The third lesion containing HPV type 16 was a typical exophytic condyloma acuminatum from a woman with previously resected vulvar carcinoma. The hybrid capture assay detected HPV DNAs in all lesions except the Southern blot-negative lesion. Twenty-five lesions were positive for the A probe only (HPV types 6 and 11 and related types). All of these lesions were found to contain HPV type 6 or 11 sequences in the Southern blot assay. The remaining 14 lesions were positive for both the A probe and the B probe (HPV types 16 and 18 and related types). The strongest signal in these 14 lesions by the hybrid capture assay was consistent with the result of the Southern blot assay in all but one case. We conclude that (i) HPV type 6 a is the most common type found in these lesions, (ii) HPV type 16 may be present more often in exophytic <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> from immunosuppressed individuals, (iii) hybrid capture is a useful tool for documenting the presence of HPV sequences in DNAs from exophytic <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata,</b> and (iv) in samples containing multiple HPV types, hybrid capture allows detection of minority HPV types...|$|R

Among <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata,</b> 22 cases (73 %) were positive for HPV types 6 or 11. In all ISH-positive cases only one viral type was detected. No correlation between HPV DNA positivity and histological findings of HPV infection was observed. Although less sensitive than some other molecular biology techniques, in situ hybridization with biotinylated DNA probes proved to be simple and useful for detecting and typing HPV in samples routinely received for histopathological analysis...|$|R
40|$|SummaryGiant {{condyloma}} acuminatum (GCA), originally described by Buschke and Loewenstein in 1925 as a lesion of the penis, is more rarely {{seen in the}} anorectum and is characterized by clinical malignancy {{in the face of}} histologic benignity; however, malignant transformation to frankly invasive squamous-cell carcinoma has been described in about one-third of patients. In addition, malignant transformation has been reported in patients with "ordinary" <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata.</b> Human papillomavirus, known to cause <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata,</b> is also known to induce these tumors and was found in 96 % of 63 cases reviewed in the last 10 years. These lesions have a propensity for recurrence and a likelihood of malignant transformation, and lead to significant mortality. Therefore, early and radical R 0 excision, along with vigilant follow-up, provides the hope for cure. Conservative and/or multimodal therapy has been reported in a few cases, but its effect is not yet proved. The authors report one case of GCA; in addition, they reviewed the literature over the last 10 years and compared with previous reviews...|$|R
40|$|Fifty women {{attending}} a clinic for {{sexually transmitted diseases}} with vulval <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> were examined by cervical cytology and colposcopy for cervical infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) or epithelial abnormality indicating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or both. Collated results showed a high prevalence of both conditions in these 50 women; 25 (50 %) had evidence of cervical infection by HPV and 18 (36 %) epithelial abnormalities consistent with CIN 1 or 2...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Epigen&# 174; (Laboratorios Cheminova International) {{represents}} an up-to-date preparation {{the development of}} which resulted from the experience obtained {{in the field of}} traditional medicine. Its excellent antiviral properties have been repeatedly proven by many studies. The indications of and methods: 55 patient are as follows: herpes simplex-labialis, genitalis (vulvovaginitis herpetica, balanopostitis herpetica), herpes simplexrecidivans, zoster, HPV infections - verrucae, <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata.</b> Material and methods: 55 patients diagnosed with herpes simplex-labialis, genitalis (vulvovaginitis herpetica, balanopostitis herpetica), herpes simplexrecidivans, zoster and <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata</b> were being observed at six departments of dermatovenereology as part of an international multicentre study. The series of patients consisted of 26 men (with the average age of 38. 5) and 29 women (with the average age of 40. 5). The youngest patient was a 12 -year-old boy with herpes simplex, the oldest patient was a 78 -year-old woman with zosterfacialis. The most numerous group of patients consisted of individuals with herpes simplex and herpes simplex recidivans amountmg to the total of 24 patients. Results: 11 relapses were recorded. The tolerability of the preparation Epigen&# 174; was very good in all patients, none of the patients had to discontinue the therapy and no adverse effects were recorded. Even patients with disease relapses spontaneously decided to continue with the application of Epigen&# 174; after the termination of the study. The application of Epigen&# 174; has significantly accelerated the healing process in local manifestations. The application of Epigen&# 174; spray or cream in patients with herpetic infections was followed by desiccation of vesicles without crust formation, which significantly reduced the abuse of analgesics. The effect was excellent in minor manifestations of <b>condylomata</b> <b>acuminata.</b> The treatment of more extensive condylomata manifestations requires a combination of Epigen&# 174; application and cryotherapy. Conclusions: Epigen&# 174; cream and spray is a clear contribution to the portfolio of topically employed dermatologie agents...|$|R
