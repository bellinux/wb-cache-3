5000|$|KFKB Milford, Kansas, {{had been}} renewed several {{times by the}} Federal Radio Commission. It {{was one of the}} most popular {{stations}} in the nation. KFKB was owned by a surgeon, John R. Brinkley, who, among other things, espoused, over the airwaves, implanting slivers of goat testes in men's testicles for [...] "sexual rejuvenation." [...] The American Medical Association was very upset over a program in which he read listener mail describing symptoms, and then prescribed over the air, describing the medication by number. Listeners had to visit a Brinkley [...] "kick back" [...] pharmacy to fill these prescriptions. In 1930 the Federal Radio Commission denied his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal.</b> Brinkley appealed on the grounds of censorship. The U.S. Court of Appeals denied his appeal. The court ruled that the Federal Radio Commission could consider past programming content without it being censorship. This, however, didn't stop the ever-popular Dr. Brinkley, who almost won the governorship of Kansas in 1930 by write-in votes. He simply beamed his programs to the United States over 100,000 watt XER from Villa Acuna, Coah, Mexico. This was twice the power of any broadcast radio station save one experimental 500,000 watt station WLW Cincinnati. Not to be outdone, Brinkley increased his power to 500,000 watts as well, as XERA, and used a curtain-array antenna to focus his signal northward. In 1941, Brinkley suffered from a series of serious medical problems. During his attempt to recuperate from them, he was charged with mail fraud, but died before the case could be tried.|$|E

In case of short-time work for structural reasons, the application has to be accompanied by a restructuring plan. Firms must introduce a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> every month. The committee’s secretariat collects the monthly applications, provides a preliminary assessment and evaluates the firm’s current economic, financial and social situation.

50|$|Before issuing {{electronic}} {{prescriptions for}} controlled substances, practitioners must meet several key requirements. One, they must use a software application that conforms to regulatory standards. They {{must also be}} credentialed for two-factor authentication, utilizing two of the following potential identification factors: (1) password or {{response to a question}} whose answer is known only to the practitioner (2) unique physical information, such as fingerprint or iris scan, otherwise known as biometric data or (3) physical object such as cryptographic key or hard token. Specific security measures must also be implemented. These include the requirement that two people need to authorize each controlled-drug e-prescription. One person confirms that the practitioner is authorized to sign the prescription. The second person is the practitioner who confirms his identity using the two-factor authentication system described above. Every provider workflow is likely to be somewhat different. One potential workflow <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>requests</b> would proceed as follows. The patient calls the pharmacy to request renewal. The pharmacy sends the electronic renewal request to the prescriber’s office. The prescriber reviews and authorizes. The response is then sent electronically to the pharmacy. Staff involvement in generating prescriptions for the prescriber to sign varies by practice. The new method of dispensing allows pharmacists to submit an accurate electronic <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a <b>renewal,</b> decreasing the burden of phone calls on medical office staff. No major changes are expected in the new prescription workflow since the prescriber is the primary actor in the current best practice and is expected to remain so after electronic prescriptions for controlled substances is implemented.|$|R
25|$|In 1684, the {{beginning}} of the Morean War between Venice and the Ottoman Empire resulted in the temporary reconquest of {{a large part of the}} country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3000 inhabitants, ⅔ of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to poverty to pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic began in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to send him a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> the <b>renewal</b> of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.|$|R

The article pays special attention to the existing, in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the breadth of presidential powers. Separately discusses the features of current and in General closed for the controlled companies to the private process of formation of the Russian political elite. According to the author, this process takes the form of selection of candidates by a narrow circle of senior officials for subjective reasons, in connection with which the political elite even more segregated from the controlled companies and rising to a new, unattainable level of elitism. Referring to the existing practice of the presidential elections in Russia in the early 90 -ies of XX century to the present focuses on the stagnation of the political opposition, lack of political competition among major political parties and their low electoral support in view of the existing political absenteeism. In the article the author considers the historical context of the formation of elite groups and privileged minorities, and draws attention to features of "technocratic parliamentarism", which is inherent in States with a parliamentary form of government and does not implement at present in Russia, with its prevailing system of governance by public authorities. In conclusion, the special attention of author is turned on the existing in society political absenteeism, latent protest potential and, as a consequence, the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> the <b>renewal</b> of political elites, particularly in the framework of the upcoming presidential elections of the Russian Federation in 2018, the participation of new candidates.
