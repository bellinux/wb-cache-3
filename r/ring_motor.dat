50|$|A wound-rotor motor {{can be used}} {{in several}} forms of adjustable-speed drive. Certain types of variable-speed drives recover slip-frequency power from the rotor circuit and feed it back to the supply, {{allowing}} wide speed range with high energy efficiency. Doubly fed electric machines use the slip rings to supply external power to the rotor circuit, allowing wide-range speed control. Today speed control by use of slip <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> is mostly superseded by induction motors with variable-frequency drives.|$|E

The initial USM version, while much smaller and lighter in weight than the L version, is considerably larger and heavier than later versions due to the internal optics {{and the use of}} larger but quieter and faster <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> USM. Production of the first version ended in (approximately) 1995. This lens is unique in the 28-80 mm f/3.5-5.6 series.|$|E

40|$|In the 1970 s {{the sugar}} {{industry}} began {{moving away from}} steam turbine driven shredders in favour of electric motor drives. Due to the high inertias of the shredders, long starting times and high starting torque requirements, the preferred electric motor drives have been slip <b>ring</b> <b>motors</b> with liquid starters. With the demand for higher Preparation Indices the shredder motor powers gradually increased. These ever-larger motors together with the power swings generally associated with shredders began to impact negatively on the sugar mill power houses and {{had the potential to}} cause loss of synchronism of the TAs and factory blackouts. The accepted solution was to engineer an increase in the rotor resistance and thus motor slip in order to relieve the stress on the power supply of the large power swings. Increasing motor slip is easily carried out with slip <b>ring</b> <b>motors</b> and external wire wound resistances left in the rotor circuit during normal running. This solution has been the standard adopted in virtually all new southern African mills from then to the present day. Pressure is being brought to bear by the large motor manufacturers in that slip <b>ring</b> <b>motors</b> and liquid starter applications are falling out of favour and being replaced with reliable, medium voltage, variable speed drives connected to robust, simple and low maintenance squirrel cage motors. The sugar industry needs to keep up with this technology and take advantage of less expensive, more reliable shredder drive designs...|$|R

5000|$|All USM lenses (including the L version) support {{full-time}} {{manual focusing}} (FTM), {{which allows the}} user to override autofocus simply by turning the focus ring. The USM (<b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> or micromotor) feature is signified by the gold [...] "Ultrasonic Motor" [...] text wrapped around {{the barrel of the}} lens on non-L versions. The original lens cap also says [...] "Ultrasonic" [...] although caution is advised as lens caps are often swapped and should not be counted upon as indicative of the actual lens' features.|$|E
50|$|Compared to a {{squirrel-cage}} rotor, {{the rotor}} of the slip <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, {{and the current}} lower, than for a squirrel-cage rotor. During the start-up a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the slip ring. Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over squirrel-cage motors is higher starting torque.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{development}} of semiconductor power electronics, {{it was difficult to}} vary the frequency, and cage induction motors were mainly used in fixed speed applications. Applications such as electric overhead cranes used DC drives or wound rotor motors (WRIM) with slip rings for rotor circuit connection to variable external resistance allowing considerable range of speed control. However, resistor losses associated with low speed operation of WRIMs is a major cost disadvantage, especially for constant loads. [...] Large slip <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> drives, termed slip energy recovery systems, some still in use, recover energy from the rotor circuit, rectify it, and return it to the power system using a VFD.|$|E

40|$|The Escherichia coli RuvB hexameric <b>ring</b> <b>motor</b> proteins, {{together}} with RuvAs, promote branch migration of Holliday junction DNA. Zero mode waveguides (ZMWs) constitute of nanosized holes and enable the visualization {{of a single}} fluorescent molecule under micromolar order of the molecules, which is applicable to characterize the formation of RuvA-RuvB-Holliday junction DNA complex. In this study, we used ZMWs and counted the number of RuvBs binding to RuvA-Holliday junction DNA complex. Our data demonstrated that different nucleotide analogs increased the amount of Cy 5 -RuvBs binding to RuvA-Holliday junction DNA complex in the following order: no nucleotide, ADP, ATPγS, and mixture of ADP and ATPγS. These results suggest that not only ATP binding to RuvB but also ATP hydrolysis by RuvB facilitates a stable RuvA-RuvB-Holliday junction DNA complex formation...|$|E
40|$|Persistence {{infection}} is the keystone of the ruminant and human diseases called brucellosis and Malta fever, respectively, and {{is linked to}} the intracellular tropism of Brucella spp. While described as non-motile, Brucella spp. have all the genes except the chemotactic system, necessary to assemble a functional flagellum. We undertook to determine whether these genes are expressed and are playing a role in some step of the disease process. We demonstrated that in the early log phase of a growth curve in 2 YT nutrient broth, Brucella melitensis expresses genes corresponding to the basal (MS ring) and the distal (hook and filament) parts of the flagellar apparatus. Under these conditions, a polar and sheathed flagellar structure is visible by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We evaluated the effect of mutations in flagellar genes of B. melitensis encoding various parts of the structure, MS ring, P <b>ring,</b> <b>motor</b> protein, secretion apparatus, hook and filament. None of these mutants gave a discernible phenotype as compared with the wild-type strain in cellular models of infection. In contrast, all these mutants were unable to establish a chronic infection in mice infected via the intraperitoneal route, raising the question of the biological role(s) of this flagellar appendage. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|The RuvA and RuvB {{proteins}} of Escherichia coli, {{which are}} induced {{in response to}} DNA damage, are important {{in the formation of}} heteroduplex DNA during genetic recombination and related recombinational repair processes. In vitro studies show that RuvA binds Holiday junctions and acts as a specificity factor that targets the RuvB ATPase, a hexameric ring protein, to the junction. Together, RuvA and RuvB promote branch migration, an ATP-dependent reaction that increases the length of the heteroduplex DNA. Electron microscopic visualization of RuvAB now provides a new insight into the mechanism of this process. We observe the formation of a tripartite protein complex in which RuvA binds the crossover and is sandwiched between two hexameric rings of RuvB. The Holliday junction within this complex adopts a square-planar structure. We propose a molecular model for branch migration, a unique feature of which is the role played by the two oppositely oriented RuvB <b>ring</b> <b>motors...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractRing NTPases {{represent}} {{a large and}} diverse group of proteins that couple their nucleotide hydrolysis activity to a mechanical task involving force generation and some type of transport process in the cell. Because of their shape, these enzymes often operate as gates that separate distinct cellular compartments to control and regulate the passage of chemical species across them. In this manner, ions and small molecules are moved across membranes, biopolymer substrates are segregated between cells or moved into confined spaces, double-stranded nucleic acids are separated into single strands {{to provide access to}} the genetic information, and polypeptides are unfolded and processed for recycling. Here we review the recent advances in the characterization of these motors using single-molecule manipulation and detection approaches. We describe the various mechanisms by which <b>ring</b> <b>motors</b> convert chemical energy to mechanical force or torque and coordinate the activities of individual subunits that constitute the ring. We also examine how single-molecule studies have contributed {{to a better understanding of}} the structural elements involved in motor-substrate interaction, mechanochemical coupling, and intersubunit coordination. Finally, we discuss how these molecular motors tailor their operation—often through regulation by other cofactors—to suit their unique biological functions...|$|R
