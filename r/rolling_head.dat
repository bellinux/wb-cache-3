6000|$|Little Tim seized his gun, {{feeling that}} the crisis had come. He was loath to destroy the creature, and hesitated. Instead of backing out of his prison, as he might easily have done, the bear made use of his free hind legs to make a {{magnificent}} bound forward. He was checked, of course, by the rope, but Tim had miscalculated {{the strength of his}} materials. A much stronger rope would have broken under the tremendous strain. The line parted like a piece of twine, and the bear, <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> over heels down the slope, bounded over the precipice, and went hurling out into space like a mighty football! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was playing}} with the kittens. One was patting and cuffing his bare toe, which had poked through his stocking. He pushed and teased the little scamp with his toe till it rushed at him, clinging, tickling, biting till he gave little bubbles of laughter, quite forgetful of us. Then the kitten was tired, and ran off. Lettie shook her skirts, and {{directly}} the two playful mites rushed upon it, darting round her, <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> over heels, and swinging from the soft cloth. Suddenly becoming aware that they felt tired, the young things trotted away and cuddled together by the fender, where in an instant they were asleep. Almost as suddenly, Sam sank into drowsiness.|$|E
60|$|As we {{emerged into}} this river-bed path {{suddenly}} we started {{a troop of}} tall giraffes, who galloped, or rather sailed off, in their strange gait, their tails screwed up over their backs, and their hoofs rattling like castanets. They were about three hundred yards from us, and therefore practically out of shot, but Good, who was walking ahead, and who had an express loaded with solid ball in his hand, could not resist temptation. Lifting his gun, he let drive at the last, a young cow. By some extraordinary chance the ball struck it full {{on the back of}} the neck, shattering the spinal column, and that giraffe went <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> over heels just like a rabbit. I never saw a more curious thing.|$|E

60|$|In such rough {{play the}} men were more equally matched than might have been expected, for the want of weight among the smaller men was often more than counterbalanced by their activity; and {{frequently}} a sturdy little fellow launched himself so vigorously against a heavy tar as to send him <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> over heels on the ice. This was not always the case, however, and few ventured to come into collision with Peter Grim, whose activity was {{on a par with}} his immense size. Buzzby contented himself with galloping {{on the outskirts of the}} fight, and putting in a kick when fortune sent the ball in his way. In this species of warfare he was supported by the fat cook, whose oily carcass could neither stand the shocks nor keep up with the pace of his messmates. Mizzle was a particularly energetic man in his way, however, and frequently kicked with such good-will that he missed the ball altogether, and the tremendous swing of his leg lifted him from the ice, and laid him sprawling on his back.|$|E
60|$|He had {{leaped out}} {{at the very end}} of the platform; and such was his {{determination}} in sticking to his desperate plan that he managed by a sort of miracle, performed almost in the air, to slam to the door of the carriage. Only then did he find himself <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> over heels like a shot rabbit. He was bruised, shaken, pale as death, and out of breath when he got up. But he was calm, and perfectly able to meet the excited crowd of railway men who had gathered round him in a moment. He explained, in gentle and convincing tones, that his wife had started at a moment’s notice for Brittany to her dying mother; that, of course, she was greatly up-set, and he considerably concerned at her state; that he was trying to cheer her up, and had absolutely failed to notice at first that the train was moving out. To the general exclamation, “Why didn’t you go on to Southampton, then, sir?” he objected the inexperience of a young sister-in-law left alone in the house with three small children, and her alarm at his absence, the telegraph offices being closed. He had acted on impulse. “But I don’t think I’ll ever try that again,” he concluded; smiled all round; distributed some small change, and marched without a limp out of the station.|$|E
60|$|That {{would have}} been a {{weakness}} which would not only have marked him forever as a cry-baby, but an indecorum too gross for words. It {{would have been}} as if, when once the boys were playing trip at school, and a big boy tripped him, and he lay quivering and panting on the ground, he had got up as soon as he could catch his breath and gone in and told the teacher; or as if, when the fellows were playing soak-about, and he got hit in the pit of the stomach with a hard ball, he had complained of the fellow who threw it. There were some things so base that a boy could not do them; and what happened out of doors, and strictly within the boy's world, had to be kept sacredly secret among the boys. For instance, if you had been beguiled, as a little boy, into being the last in the game of snap-the-whip, and the snap sent you <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> over heels on the hard ground, and skinned your nose and tore your trousers, you could cry from the pain without disgrace, and some of the fellows would come up and try to comfort you; but you were bound in honor not to appeal to the teacher, and you were expected to use every device to get the blood off you before you went in, and to hide the tear in your trousers. Of course, the tear and the blood could not be kept from the anxious eyes at home, but even there you were expected not to say just what boys did it.|$|E

It made her so angry that she strode back to the destructor, though it was still too hot to use the poker there. Wynn's books seemed to be {{catching}} well. She {{looked up at the}} oak behind the man; several of the light upper and two or three rotten lower branches had broken and scattered their rubbish on the shrubbery path. On the lowest fork a helmet with dependent strings, showed like a bird's-nest in the light of a long-tongued flame. Evidently this person had fallen through the tree. Wynn had told her that it was quite possible for people to fall out of aeroplanes. Wynn told her too, that trees were useful things to break an aviator's fall, but in this case the aviator must have been broken or he would have moved from his queer position. He seemed helpless except for his horrible <b>rolling</b> <b>head.</b> On the other hand, she could see a pistol case at his belt--and Mary loathed pistols. Months ago, after reading certain Belgian reports together, she and Miss Fowler had had dealings with one--a huge revolver with flat-nosed bullets, which latter, Wynn said, were forbidden by the rules of war to be used against civilised enemies. 'They're good enough for us,' Miss Fowler had replied. 'Show Mary how it works.' And Wynn, laughing at the mere possibility of any such need, had led the craven winking Mary into the Rector's disused quarry, and had shown her how to fire the terrible machine. It lay now in the top-left-hand drawer of her toilet-table--a memento not included in the burning. Wynn would be pleased to see how she was not afraid.|$|E

5000|$|Huston's {{original}} filmed {{depiction of}} Dobbs' death was more graphic - {{as it was}} in the book - than the one that eventually made it onto the screen. When Gold Hat strikes Dobbs with his machete, Dobbs is decapitated. Huston shot Dobbs' (fake) head rolling into the waterhole (a quick shot of Gold Hat's accomplices reacting to Dobbs' <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> remains in the film, and in the very next shot one can see the water rippling where it rolled in). The 1948 censors would not allow that, so Huston camouflaged the cut shot with a repeat shot of Gold Hat striking Dobbs. Warner Bros' publicity department released a statement that Humphrey Bogart was [...] "disappointed the scene couldn't be shown in all its graphic glory." [...] Bogart's reaction was: [...] "What's wrong with showing a guy getting his head cut off?" ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{microgravity}} {{environment of}} spaceflight, {{the relationship between}} sensory input and motor output is altered. During prolonged missions, neural adaptive processes come into play to recalibrate central nervous system function, thereby permitting new motor control strategies {{to emerge in the}} novel sensory environment of microgravity. However, the adaptive state achieved during spaceflight is inappropriate for a unit gravity environment and leads to motor control alterations upon return to Earth that include disturbances in locomotion. Indeed, gait and postural instabilities following the return to Earth have been reported in both U. S. astronauts and Russian cosmonauts even after short duration (5 - to 10 -day) flights. After spaceflight, astronauts may: (1) experience the sensation of turning while attempting to walk a straight path, (2) encounter sudden loss of postural stability, especially when rounding corners, (3) perceive exaggerated pitch and <b>rolling</b> <b>head</b> movements during walking, (4) experience sudden loss of orientation in unstructured visual environments, or (5) experience significant oscillopsia during locomotion...|$|E
40|$|The West African manatee (Trichechus Senegalensis) is {{threatened}} with extinction. Information on its ecology is scanty. Manatee ecology in Eniong Creek, South South Nigeria was studied. Canoe cruises {{were made in}} three randomly selected days per week, two weeks per month in the lower, middle and upper sections of the creek for six months. Behavior, feeding habits and dung and gut contents were observed directly. Information from respondents was also obtained. Chi-square tests, regression analysis and percentages were used to analyse data. Results showed that the manatee fed on at least 15 different species of plants with Ficus spp identified by {{the highest percentage of}} respondents (94 %). The number of manatee killed positively correlated (+ 0. 96) with the number sighted in the same period. There was a decline in the population of manatee from 803 in 2002 to 264 in 2007. The decline was attributed to heavy poaching and habitat destruction. Playful behavior of the manatee included somersaulting, barrel <b>rolling,</b> <b>head</b> and tail standing, body surfing and upside down gliding making it attractive for ecotourism. Alternative livelihood options were recommended for the local people to stop them from poaching the manatee and destroying its habitat...|$|E
