In 1998 South Crofty, Europe's last operational tin mine, closed, bringing metal mining in Cornwall to an end.|$|E
500|$|For another twenty years, the {{mechanism}} by which ATP is generated remained mysterious, with scientists searching for an elusive [...] "high-energy intermediate" [...] that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions. This puzzle was solved by Peter D. Mitchell {{with the publication of}} the chemiosmotic theory in 1961. At first, this proposal was highly controversial, but it was slowly accepted and Mitchell was awarded a Nobel prize in 1978. Subsequent research concentrated on purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved, with major contributions being made by David E. Green on the complexes of the electron-transport chain, as well as Efraim <b>Racker</b> on the ATP synthase. A critical step towards solving {{the mechanism}} of the ATP synthase was provided by Paul D. Boyer, by his development in 1973 of the [...] "binding change" [...] mechanism, followed by his radical proposal of rotational catalysis in 1982. More recent work has included structural studies on the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation by John E. Walker, with Walker and Boyer being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1997.|$|E

50|$|Efraim <b>Racker</b> {{was born}} to a Jewish family in 1913 in Neu Sandez, Poland (then Austrian Galicia), but {{he grew up in}} Vienna.

Efraim <b>Racker</b> was {{studying}} medicine at the University of Vienna when Hitler invaded in 1938. <b>Racker</b> fled to Great Britain, where he took a job in a mental hospital in Wales. His research focused on the biochemical causes for mental diseases.

50|$|Glutathione reductase {{was first}} {{purified}} in 1955 at Yale by E. <b>Racker.</b> <b>Racker</b> also identified NADPH {{as the primary}} electron donor for the enzyme. Later groups confirmed the presence of FAD and the thiol group, and an initial mechanism was suggested for the mechanism in 1965. The initial (low resolution) structure of glutathione reductase was solved in 1977. This was quickly followed by a 3Å structure by Shulze et al. in 1978. Glutathione reductase has been studied exhaustively since these early experiments, and is subsequently {{one of the most}} well characterized enzymes to date.|$|E

50|$|<b>Racker</b> and his associates, Anima Datta, Maynard Pullmand, and Harvey Penefsky, {{worked to}} isolate the enzymes {{involved}} in ATP synthesis. They observed that isolated mitochondrial fragments were capable of respiration but not able to synthesize ATP. <b>Racker</b> and his co-workers concluded that oxidative phosphorylation could be restored by addition of the supernatant from the centrifuging. The complex making this restoration possible was named Factor 1 or F1 {{as it is a}} necessary coupling factor for ATPase activity. This discovery of the first enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation was identified and purified in 1960.|$|E
