40|$|The European railway {{market is}} since 25 years {{subject to a}} {{constant}} transformation process. The EU’s <b>railway</b> <b>packages,</b> bundles of <b>railway</b> specific legislation, initiate reforms in a sector that was characterised by decade long national fragmentation and a shrinking modal share. National railways used to be run by vertical integrated governmental authorities, which were unable to adjust {{to changes in the}} market and new developments like the unprecedented rise of the individual motor car after World War Two. Liberalisation (market opening) and privatisation (franchising private competitors) were the key strategies to overhaul the massive and ponderous state-owned as well as statecontrolled railway sector in order to curb waste of public subsidies and worsening train service. The main objective is the creation of a single European railway market {{with a high degree of}} interoperability and competition, similarly to the Single European Sky initiative in the civil aviation. So far three <b>railway</b> <b>packages</b> (2001, 2004 and 2007) have been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. A fourth one is since 2013 in the making, whereby the technical pillar is closer to an agreement than the highly contested market pillar especially for high-speed long-distance passenger service. The rail freight sector was already liberalised and enjoys free market access for all competitors since 2007. The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of the <b>railway</b> <b>packages</b> in particular on the rail freight transport in the EU Member States. How much influence has the EU legislation in a specific policy area, here transport (impact assessment). In order to answer the research question a sequential multiple regression was chosen. This method allows adding gradually suitable independent variables and dummies in a fixed order to determine their impact on the dependent variable rail freight. The results were humble; the biggest impact on the depended variable had rail passengers with a high statistical significance. A negative impact had EU membership with low significance. All three <b>railway</b> <b>packages</b> had only a marginal impact without significance. Several problems and limitations were faced during the operationalisation and partly explain the poor output...|$|R
30|$|The European Union <b>Railway</b> <b>Packages,</b> a {{strategy}} for the revitalization of the railways in Europe, {{against a backdrop of}} decline, separated of infrastructure and operations and opened rail markets to competition. The EU used a mixture of statutory instruments, and these were delivered in <b>railway</b> <b>packages,</b> 2001, 2004 and 2007, with varying success. The first package permitted open access for national rail services across EU. The second package aimed to build an integrated European railway area, in particular by opening up more quickly the international rail-freight market, with a new directive on railway safety and the establishment of a European Railway Agency. The third opened up international passenger rail services from 2010 and the introduction of a certification system for locomotive drivers. However, in 2010 the Commission reported that “it has not been possible to improve the overall modal share of rail freight and passenger transport in line with the objectives set in the 2001 Transport White Paper… monopolistic positions still exist in many Member States both for freight and for passenger transport services.” [27].|$|R

30|$|During the 1990 s the {{progressive}} {{decline of the}} railway market share in Europe prompted the European Commission to start a deep and fundamental process of transformation. A number of legislative measures grouped into {{what is known as}} <b>Railway</b> <b>Packages</b> aimed at gradually creating a competitive single European Railway System were introduced. One of the primary implications of this process is the introduction of competition through the liberalisation of transport service operations.|$|R
30|$|To {{underline}} the importance of both the levels of the problem, it is worth to remind how the European Commission with the <b>railway</b> <b>packages</b> and the related directives, after having fully opened to competition the markets for rail freight services and for international passenger transport (long distance, i.e. large-scale), currently is focusing also on national markets for domestic passenger transport services (i.e. regional, small-scale) which remain largely closed and are still considered the bastions of national monopolies.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} twenty years, European Union has {{promoted}} liberalisation and competition within the rail system under EC Directive 91 / 440 and the <b>Railway</b> <b>Packages</b> concerned, and all Member States now try to pursue {{the difficult task of}} considering both public (sustainability, accessibility, employment, etc.) and commercial interests (profit, return on investment, growth). In this context, it is necessary to carry out analyses about rail services so as to gain useful information for increasing efficiency, effectiveness and productivity. In many cases, great importance has been attached to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which do not usually consider customer needs. This paper aims to promote a Decision Support System (DSS) for assessing rail services taking both service quality and performance indexes into account. In particular, the procedure is based on a microscopic simulation model combined to an assignment tool for assigning dynamically passengers to services. Thus, demand peaks, temporary capacity variations, temporary over-saturation of supply elements, and formation and dispersion of queues can be considered providing a more precise analysis of rail services. An application on metro Line 1 in Naples (Italy) is presented in order to explain the workings of the model. Numerical results demonstrate that this approach is very useful for planning or managing rail systems in accordance with passenger satisfaction and operational efficiency...|$|R
30|$|In the 1980 s the {{positive}} experience with deregulated transport markets {{in countries like}} the US and the UK {{as well as an}} increasing pressure from the European Communities (EC) to also open transport markets for firms established in other EC member states led to a change in the German transport policy. The markets for air transport services as well as for road haulage have been liberalized, following a step-wise approach. Deutsche Lufthansa was fully privatized. The implementation of the European <b>railway</b> <b>packages</b> facilitated competition in railway markets. According to the Rail Liberalization Index, only Sweden and the UK show a higher degree of liberalization than Germany [32, 33]. DB provides rail as well as several other transport services (regional and local bus transport, worldwide logistics via its branch DB Schenker). In 2015, DB’s market share was 61 % (based on ton kilometers) in rail cargo and 71 % (based on train kilometers) in regional passenger rail transport [22]. There is hardly any competition in the long-haul passenger market. Against this background, the Monopolies Commission (an independent advisory body to the German government and parliament) recommends a full vertical separation between infrastructure and operation in order to foster competition in the railway sector [38]. The prohibition of scheduled long-haul bus services, which had been introduced in the 1930 s to protect the railroad operator, lasted until the year 2013 [23]. Since then, the market for scheduled long-haul bus services has shown a tremendous growth [2].|$|R
30|$|Although the U.S freight {{transport}} system has very different (operational, technical and geographical) conditions, road and rail freight increased from 29.8 % (1239 btkm) and 37.3 % (1554 btkm) respectively, in 1990, to 35.2 % (1929 btkm) and 42.2 % (2309 btkm) by 2009. This {{has been at}} the expense of rail passenger and waterways transport [7]. Experts point out that liberalised (in particular downsized and/or limited federal economic regulation) [8] freight oriented railways [9], including privately owned and operated railways, have helped the United States freight railway industry succeed in gaining higher market share [10, 11]. It {{should be noted that the}} European railways are passenger oriented, originating from government owned and operated national railways with a focus on national priorities (not simply for economic advantage) [11, 12]. Although some incumbents such as DB Schenker or SNCF Fret have become standalone freight operators, and some previously public rail freight operators became wholly private (e.g. English, Welsh and Scottish Railways (EWS) the share of independent private operators is insignificant, not least since many early private companies were subsequently bought out by incumbents looking to compete in new markets, e.g. Rail 4 Chem eventually becoming part of SNCF. The European Commission has adopted and implemented, at various levels, many directives - including three <b>Railway</b> <b>Packages,</b> with ambitions for a fourth - in an attempt to make the European railways more competitive and achieve modal shift targets. The Commission has also funded research initiatives to upgrade and integrate the infrastructure and rolling stock, to achieve pan-European services and improve operational practices [5, 12 – 14].|$|R
50|$|Following on {{from the}} second <b>railway</b> <b>package,</b> the main act of the third <b>railway</b> <b>package</b> was open access for all {{international}} passenger services, including cabotage, across the railways of the EU from 1 January 2010.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach {{for assessing the}} accuracy of different frictional rolling contact theories.

This yields a better insight into the behaviour of the methods in diverse circumstances (varying contact patch ellipticities, mixed longitudinal, lateral and spin creepages) than is obtained when {{only a small number of}} (basic) circumstances are used in the comparison. The range of contact parameters that occur for realistic vehicles and tracks are assessed using simulations with the Vampire vehicle system dynamics (VSD) package. This shows that larger values for the spin creepage occur rather frequently. Based on this, our approach is applied to typical cases for which <b>railway</b> VSD <b>packages</b> are used. The results show that particularly the USETAB approach but also FASTSIM give considerably better results than the linear theory, Vermeulen–Johnson, Shen–Hedrick–Elkins and Polach methods, when compared with the ‘complete theory’ of the CONTACT program...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century railway legislation in Europe (the First <b>Railway</b> <b>Package</b> and Second <b>Railway</b> <b>Package,</b> {{and the creation of a}} Trans European Rail Freight Network) liberalised cross border freight traffic, giving rise to demand for locomotives to work between European Union countries with different electrification systems and creating a practically new market for multivoltage locomotives such as Bombardier's TRAXX. However increased cost of purchase and maintenance, along with costs of different safety system installations for cross-border work, have reduced the economic viability of multisystem vehicles versus the use of single voltage machines and locomotive changing.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the support}} of the EU {{in the form of the}} <b>Railway</b> Reform <b>Packages</b> 1 through 4, actual rail freight {{performance}} as a share of the market has been variable. At EU level, rail’s share of the freight market has consistently fallen, against a background of rising total volumes. In the the new member states (EU 12) – in many of which rail freight was dominant under Communism [11] –a downward trend can be noted, whereas in western member states (EU 15) rail’s share has slightly increased or remained the same [12]. Overall, rail’s modal share of the freight movement in tonne-km declined from 13.6 % in 1995, to 11.9 % in 2011 [13] and further declined to 11.7 % in 2014 [14]. With this reality in mind, in its 2011 Transport White Paper the European Commission set a target of 50 % modal shift from road to rail (and waterways) transport, by 2050, for distances over 300  km. It continues to support this aspiration through policy, regulation, and research and innovation [6].|$|R
40|$|AbstractUp to the 2000 s, European railway {{undertakings}} were integrated companies covering {{all elements of}} the railway system. As {{a result of the}} European <b>railway</b> <b>packages</b> these incumbent companies were subdivided into infrastructure managers and {{railway undertakings}}. The competition in the rail sector and the changing markets encouraged new companies with completely new business models to enter the railway market. New regulations generated entirely new roles and this is why nowadays a lot of companies with very different business models are active in the railway sector. These companies cover different parts of the value chain and have internal as well as external interfaces. Thus, a new model to evaluate funding models under these changing boundary conditions is essential. The authors developed a new role model to describe internal and external financial flows in the rail sector focusing on the financial issues of innovation. Initially all roles in the railway sector were defined and described. A role is the smallest not further divisible function in the railway system. Each role assigns to one field of the railway sector (infrastructure, service provider, operations and rolling stock) or to the external field called environment. A single company can cover multiple roles within the railway system and the former state railways with their wide product portfolio now cover numerous roles in the new railway system. The next step was to evaluate the relationships between the stakeholders within the system and to show the resulting financial flows within the railway system. The role model allows to illustrate the internal flows of a company (e. g. within integrated railway companies) as well as external flows between different undertakings. The model does not differentiate between the supply of rolling stock by internal divisions or by rolling stock leasing companies for example. As innovations usually tackle the economics of more than one role in the system, the model clearly allocates the qualitative economic effects of the innovations. The illustration of the financial flows allows to derive compensation models between the roles gaining profit from an innovation and the roles which lose profitability. The model also allows a rough estimation of the transaction effort for the compensation models. Finally the authors proofed the applicability of the model in three case studies. These case studies demonstrated that one of the mayor obstacles for innovation in the railway system are the missing direct financial flows between infrastructure and rolling stock...|$|R
