40|$|Firms that <b>race</b> <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> first {{may hold}} cash {{not only to}} invest timely but also to do it faster than the competitors, pushing them to hold more cash. We use data from US patents and their {{citations}} to identify and measure the dependency of innovation success on cash holdings in such races. We find that a firm's cash holdings increase its probability of winning a race while its rivals' cash decrease it. The cash sensitivity of winning increases through the mid 80 s and the 90 s. This increase {{is due to the}} increased concentration of incumbency strength among fewer incumbents. Hence, cash holdings have become strategically more important for the average, R&D-intensive, firm...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{international}} {{competition and the}} high market dynamism mean companies in many industries can only improve or safeguard their profitability and market share by launching innovative products, {{at the same time}} focusing their strength and continuing to specialize. However, the <b>race</b> <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> poses increasing technological challenges: ever greater technology complexity and convergence, swifter development times, and shorter product cycles. Companies with a long-term perspective that recognize their latent and/or manifest resource and competence deficits meet these challenges by forging links with external sources of know-how and skills. Forming strategic alliances of this kind provides access to supplementary technological skills and know-how. This has two key benefits. One is the potential to generate new products by combining internal and external resources. Second, the cooperative learning processes can close resource and competence gaps that open up {{in the course of a}} company's innovation activities. Many firms are aware of the positive impact of such alliances. Companies can create a broad, diversified resource pool by cooperating with customers, suppliers, research institutes and other enterprises from their own or other industries. The question is no longer whether but how to leverage this cooperation to achieve a competitive edge in development and marketing. This dissertation analyzes both the innovation potential of innovation-oriented cooperation networks and the prerequisites for designing them to capture this potential. Based on existing empirical analyses the Core Competence-Based View and the Relational View we propose a multidimensional model that maps the impact of cooperation networks on a company's innovation success along three dimensions: the organizational circumstances of the different partners, their cooperation skills, and their absorptive competence. We confirmed these (theoretically derived) assumptions by conducting a cross-industry survey of 5, 000 companies with revenues of between EUR 50 - 300 million. We found that factoring in organizational complementarities and compatibilities when selecting alliance partners, building an absorptive competence superior to those of competitors, greatly enhances the impact of cooperation networks on innovation success, particularly for SMEs...|$|E

40|$|This book chapter {{examines}} {{the tension between}} competition law enforcement and patent policy in developing countries. Based on the framework proposed by Louis Kaplow {{in an article in}} the early 1980 s, this book chapter suggests how developing countries should balance consumer welfare against the need to provide incentives <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> The book chapter argues that the balance depends on the developing country at issue, in particular on that country's capacity <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> For those developing countries with little capacity <b>to</b> <b>innovate,</b> this book chapter suggests that the balance should be tilted towards competition law enforcement.

40|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of firm-level {{data from the}} recent National Survey of Innovation indicates large firms are more likely <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> compared <b>to</b> small firms. Ownership structure is also found {{to be an important}} determinant of innovation - private limited and public limited firms are twice more likely <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> compared <b>to</b> soleproprietorship firms. A surprising finding is the negative correlation between the propensity <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> and the share of exports in sales. There is also no evidence that innovation is related to the extent or foreign vs. local ownership of firms. The findings on the influence of industry-level characteristics are mixed. While the influence of industry's technology level is inconclusive, the propensity <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> is positively correlated with market concentration.

Furthermore, fostering freedom to experiment and applying multifunctional teams have positive effects on the incentives <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> Besides, two factors (quality competition and high� uncertainty of market demand) are market related. Finally, in contradiction to our expectations, having well-educated employees has a negative effect on the incentives <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on competition in corporate law has debated whether competition is a 2 ̆ 2 <b>race</b> <b>to</b> the bottom 2 ̆ 2 or a 2 ̆ 2 <b>race</b> <b>to</b> the top. ” This Article endorses the increasing scholarly consensus that competition improves corporate law but {{argues that the}} pace of innovation in corporate law {{is likely to be}} slow. Because benefits of corporate law innovation are not internalized, neither states nor firms will have sufficient incentives <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> That competitive federalism is “to the top 2 ̆ 2 suggests that the model could be applied beyond the corporate charter context, for example to areas such as bankruptcy, but that benefits from such competition would accrue only gradually. This Article concludes by considering several means of stimulating competition in corporate law, including allowing firms to select different states for different aspects of corporate law and permitting private provision of law. Perhaps the most promising of these possibilities is the use of intellectual property law to protect corporate law innovations. Although recent decisions allowing patents for business methods make this approach feasible, the fit with existing patent law is imperfect. The scarcity in corporate law that leads to innovation is not a lack of ideas, but a lack of firms and states willing to accept the risks of being the first <b>to</b> <b>innovate...</b>|$|R

40|$|When novel {{behaviour}} patterns {{spread through}} animal populations, typically one animal will initiate the diffusion. It {{is not known}} whether such ‘innovators’ are particularly creative individuals, individuals exposed to the appropriate environmental contingencies, or individuals in a particular motivational state. We describe three experiments that investigated the factors influencing foraging innovation in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We exposed small laboratory populations of fish to novel foraging tasks, which involved exploration and problem solving to locate a novel food source. Experiments 1 and 2 found that (1) females were more likely <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> than males, (2) food-deprived fish were more likely <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> than nonfood-deprived subjects, and (3) smaller fish were more likely <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> than larger fish. We suggest that the sex difference may reflect parental investment asymmetries in males and females. Experiment 3 found that past innovators were more likely <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> than past noninnovators. Collectively, {{the results suggest that}} differences in foraging innovation in guppies are best accounted for by differences in motivational state, but, in addition, guppies may vary in their predisposition <b>to</b> <b>innovate...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify the determinants of the decision <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> in Taiwan. Three ?innovation strategies? are considered: doing R&D only, importing technology only, and combining both. We estimate a Bivariate Probit on a panel of more than 27000 Taiwanese manufacturing firms observed from 1992 to 1995. Results suggest that the decision to do R&D over the period was influenced by the prior changes in exportations at the industry level, whereas the decision to import technology is affected by the current changes. We identify a non-linear relationship between firm size and innovation. Moreover, older firms tend <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> less, whereas market structure doesn?t affect the decision <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> These two results change when only high-tech industries are considered: the effect of firms? age becomes insignificant, whereas a more concentrated market structure is shown to increase the probability <b>to</b> <b>innovate...</b>|$|R

30|$|Cabagnols and Le Bas (2002) {{explain the}} {{determinant}} of {{the choice between}} three types of innovation decisions: <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> only on product, <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> only on process and <b>to</b> <b>innovate</b> on both product and process. Specifically, these authors clarify the way by which French firms orient their decisions <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> But, {{one of the issues}} addressed by this recent literature is whether it is a one-stage or a two-stage process. Du et al. (2007) test the performance of two models of decision making: the simultaneous and the sequential model. They show that the sequential model (two-stage innovation decision) is more efficient than the simultaneous model (one-stage innovation decisions). More recently, Bourke and Jordan (2015) examine how the Irish high-technology companies make their decisions <b>to</b> <b>innovate.</b> These authors suggest that the adoption of the two-stage innovation decision-making model explains better the influence of the available sources on different types of innovation. In fact, the works that have investigated service firms’ innovation decision-making procedures remain relatively rare. Our paper contributes to this literature by focusing on the service companies in Tunisia, regarded as an emerging country.|$|R
