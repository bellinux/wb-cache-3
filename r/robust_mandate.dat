He supports the call being made by many governments and civil society groups: that a political solution to the twin crises of Lebanon and Palestine must be the international community's urgent priority. Dr. Davis also {{highlights the importance of}} international law in coping with the conflict and argues that the international community should be prepared to contribute a sufficient military force with a <b>robust</b> <b>mandate</b> to create a zone of security along the southern border with Israel. He concludes the paper by proposing key principles for a lasting solution to the conflict...|$|E
40|$|The UN {{doctrine}} for Peacekeeping {{operations is}} based on three fundamental principles for obtaining legitimacy for military operations. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate {{the change in the}} UN Security Council's view of legitimacy and {{the use of force in}} the context of the UN Peacekeeping Operation in Mali between 2013 - 2016, and how this has been demonstrated in the <b>robust</b> <b>mandate</b> authorized by the UN Security Council. Using Fairclough´s Critical Discourse Analysis Model, together with the resolutions and debates from the Security Council that constitutes the MINUSMA mandate and is the basis for this analysis. The analytical results identify two significant changes in the Security Council's view regarding legitimacy and methods, including the use of force applied in the field to defend the integrity of the mandate. Firstly, the view of legitimacy changes from extending support to host-nation authorities, to instead supporting the implementation of the peace agreements. Secondly, the Security Council's view on the use of legitimate force switches from defensive operations to preventive measures. This study fills a research gap on robust mandates, and how the UN's highest decision-making body is evolving its view on legitimacy in peacekeeping operations...|$|E

It deals with the political economy of POs and grapples with the trends of POs in the recent past, especially the increasingly <b>robust</b> <b>mandates</b> of peace operations and their implications. Brazilian participation in peace operations is discussed, focusing on its main characteristics and the consequences of an absence of consensus on the role of POs for the country´s grand strategy. Finally, suggestions are proposed that might create synergies between participation in POs and Brazil´s grand strategy...|$|R
40|$|As in {{many other}} {{scientific}} disciplines, the issue of sustainability of the aquatic digital archive {{has not yet been}} solved in a satisfactory way. Managing a sustainable repository requires more than the "Conan"-like librarian. It needs <b>robust</b> <b>mandates</b> at local, regional and (inter) national levels. It needs an official budget. It also needs to be embedded in research funding procedures at every level, from institutional to international. Both self-archiving in repositories and Open Access publishing need appropriate funding schemes. Lastly, organized support platforms for repository managers and librarians are need to coordinate developments on a global scale. This presentation introduces an overview and state-of-the-art of aquatic repositories worldwide. It further focuses on a fine example of sustainability-supportive initiatives, the DRIVER project...|$|R
40|$|Th is article {{examines}} the debate surrounding the responsibility to protect [R 2 P] with particular reference {{to the use of}} peacekeeping forces in that regard. Post-Cold War, human protection had expanded into a matter of international concern. Yet, where formerly humanitarian intervention was the mot du jour, a change in conceptual vocabulary led to the introduction of R 2 P and to a redefinition of sovereignty. Accordingly, the primary responsibility to protect its citizens rests with the sovereign state but, owing to international solidarity, the residual responsibility rests with the international community. Contextually, R 2 P is embedded in a continuum of responsibilities: prevent, react and rebuild. Proponents of the concept already see a norm in development. Still, divisions and confusion remain concerning the concept’s legal basis, its scope and its parameters. This is particularly relevant in view of peacekeeping forces, which have been increasingly deployed for humanitarian purposes. Because of ill-defi ned mandates and an overextension of resources, however, traditional peacekeeping is no longer suitable, lacking the resources, the personnel and the necessary expertise. To be able to fulfil the goals of R 2 P, peacekeeping will have to be redefined and the forces equipped with more <b>robust</b> <b>mandates</b> or fail...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Oral {{health in}} nursing home {{residents}} is poor. <b>Robust,</b> <b>mandated</b> assessment tools such as the Resident Assessment Instrument – Minimum Data Set (RAI-MDS) 2. 0 are key to monitoring and improving quality of oral health care in nursing homes. However, psychometric properties of RAI-MDS 2. 0 oral/dental items have been challenged and criterion validity of these items has never been assessed. Methods We used 73, 829 RAI-MDS 2. 0 records (13, 118 residents), collected in a stratified random sample of 30 urban nursing homes in Western Canada (2007 – 2012). We derived a subsample of all residents (n[*]=[*] 2, 711) with an admission and two or more subsequent annual assessments. Using Generalized Estimating Equations, adjusted for known covariates of {{nursing home residents}}’ oral health, we assessed the association of oral/dental problems with time, dentate status, dementia, debris, and daily cleaning. Results Prevalence of oral/dental problems fluctuated (4. 8  %– 5. 6  %) with no significant differences across time. This range of prevalence is substantially smaller than the ones reported by studies using clinical assessments by dental professionals. Denture wearers were less likely than dentate residents to have oral/dental problems (adjusted odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 0. 458, 95  % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 308, 0. 680). Residents lacking teeth and not wearing dentures had higher odds than dentate residents of oral/dental problems (adjusted OR[*]=[*] 2. 718, 95  % CI: 1. 845, 4. 003). Oral/dental problems were more prevalent in persons with debris (OR[*]=[*] 2. 187, 95  % CI: 1. 565, 3. 057). Of the other variables assessed, only age at assessment {{was significantly associated with}} oral/dental problems. Conclusions Robust, reliable RAI-MDS 2. 0 oral health indicators are vital to monitoring and improving oral health related quality and safety in nursing homes. However, severe underdetection of oral/dental problems and lack of association of well-known oral health predictors with oral/dental problems suggest validity problems. Lacking teeth and not wearing dentures should be considered an indicator for urgent oral/dental treatment needs...|$|R
40|$|Single-event-upset (SEU) {{has become}} a great threat to the {{reliability}} of nanometer circuits [1]. The need for costeffective <b>robust</b> circuit design <b>mandates</b> the development of efficient reliability analysis. In this paper, a static “Noise Impact Analysis ” methodology is developed to estimate the circuit vulnerability. First, both the circuit elements and the transient noise are abstracted in the format of matrices. Then the circuit-noise interaction is modeled {{by a series of}} matrix transformations, which jointly considers three masking effects that can potentially prevent transient noise from causing observable errors. Finally, the error-resiliency of the sequential elements is considered in determining the impact of transient noise on the circuit. Experiment results demonstrate that our technique can accurately yet quickly estimate the circuit failure rate by comparing with HSPICE simulation. The proposed methodology will greatly facilitate the economic design of robust nanometer circuit. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAdvances {{in medical}} imaging and image {{processing}} are {{paving the way}} for personalised cardiac biomechani-cal modelling. Models provide the capacity to relate kinematics to dynamics and—through patient-specific modelling— derived material parameters to underlying cardiac muscle pathologies. However, for clinical utility to be achieved, model-based analyses <b>mandate</b> <b>robust</b> model selection and parameterisation. In this paper, we introduce a patient-specific biomechanical model for the left ventricle aiming to balance model fidelity with parameter identifiability. Using non-invasive data and common clinical surrogates, we illustrate unique identifiability of passive and active parameters over the full cardiac cycle. Identifiability and accuracy of the estimates in the presence of controlled noise are verified with a number of in silico datasets. Unique parametrisation is then obtained for three datasets acquired in vivo. The model predictions show good agreement with the data extracted from the images providing a pipeline for personalised biomechan-ical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Video {{surveillance}} {{has long}} been in use to either monitor security sensitive areas or to know the statistic details for business purposes. Typical application includes banks, shopping complexes, Railway stations, crowded public places and borders. The advancement in computing power, availability of large-capacity storage devices and high speed network infrastructure {{paved the way for}} cheaper, multi sensor video surveillance systems. Traditionally, the video outputs are processed online by security officials and usually saved to tapes for later use only after a forensic event. However, assisting the human operators with identification of important events in video by the use of “smart ” video surveillance systems has become a critical requirement. The making of video surveillance systems “smart ” requires fast, reliable and <b>robust</b> algorithms. This <b>mandates</b> for this smart feature to run on camera itself; embedded software using spare processing capacity in Camera‟s Digital signal processor (DSP). In this article we propose a novel algorithm which is small in footprint and quick in identifying the activity using Event Trigger and process the image using histogram which can be embedded in DSP system...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] “Despite the {{widespread}} concern regarding childhood obesity, there is broad divergence of opinion regarding {{responsibility for the}} crisis. Whether the government, food industry, or parents are accountable has {{become the focus of}} much debate. Public health groups have attempted various strategies to confront childhood obesity, such as litigation, legislation, and government regulation. While many researchers and advocates agree that government should play an affirmative role with respect to childhood obesity, they are very much divided over what that role should be. For example, although none of these acts has become law, eighty-six bills have been proposed regarding obesity since the 106 th Congress. Thirteen bills in the 109 th Congress dealt specifically with childhood obesity. Although some urge the government to inform the public about healthy eating and healthy activities, they also argue that governmental action going beyond informational and educational functions would be too oppressive. Many advocates call for government oversight more <b>robust</b> than merely <b>mandating</b> calorie disclosures at fast-food restaurants, labels on grocery products, and nutrition education in public schools. ...|$|R
40|$|Hans Schippers and Dick Leurdijk {{look at the}} {{possibilities}} of forming an international military force for the West Bank in {{the final phase of}} the Annapolis peace initiative. The main task of this mission would be to maintain security and prevent a coup by the fundamentalist Hamas movement after an Israeli withdrawal. In November 2007, General James Jones, former commander of the NATO forces in Europe, was appointed security adviser for the region. Part of his task is to investigate whether such a mission, as a supplement to the US trained Palestinian National Security brigades, would be a viable option. The West Bank force would be modelled after UNIFIL-II, which was established after the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006. Unlike other international missions in the Middle East, which have a classical peacekeeping task with lightly armed personnel, UNIFIL-II has a <b>robust</b> peacekeeping <b>mandate</b> giving the military conditional authority for the use of force. Contributions for the stabilisation mission might come from Jordan, especially the Jordan led and Palestinian manned Badr Brigade, as well as from Egypt and several NATO countries. The idea of a West Bank force has led to sharp debates in Israel. Critics have pointed out that the international mission might hamper Israeli security operations. Palestinian president Abbas and king Abdullah of Jordan have expressed cautious support for the initiative. A positive reaction came from the Dutch government, which has made a solution of the Israel-Palestine conflict a key issue in its foreign policy. Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Verhagen, declared in January that after an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement had been signed, he would do his utmost to ensure a Dutch contribution to such an international force, led, e. g., by NATO...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present an}} {{extensive}} three year study on economically annotating video with crowdsourced marketplaces. Our public framework has annotated thousands of real world videos, including massive data sets unprecedented for their size, complexity, and cost. To accomplish this, we designed a state-of-the-art video annotation user interface and demonstrate that, despite common intuition, many contemporary interfaces are sub-optimal. We present several user studies that evaluate {{different aspects of}} our system and demonstrate that minimizing the cognitive load of the user is crucial when designing an annotation platform. We then deploy this interface on Amazon Mechanical Turk and discover expert and talented workers {{who are capable of}} annotating difficult videos with dense and closely cropped labels. We argue that video annotation requires specialized skill; most workers are poor annotators, <b>mandating</b> <b>robust</b> quality control protocols. We show that traditional crowdsourced micro-tasks are not suitable for video annotation and instead demonstrate that deploying time-consuming macro-tasks on MTurk is effective. Finally, we show that by extracting pixel-based features from manually labeled key frames, we are able to leverage more sophisticated interpolation strategies to maximize performance given a fixed budget. We validate the power of our framework on difficult, real-world data set...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the operations of}} the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the East Timorese Commisio de Acolhimento, Verdade e Reconciliacao (CAVR) within a comparative framework. It evaluates the portability of the TRC as a model for other transitions and specifically for the CAVR, and assesses to what extent and degree the TRC was utilised as a “model” for the CAVR and whether the model was successfully employed. Post-TRC truth commissions have become important mechanisms in transitional justice to examine past atrocities and historical injustices and apportion accountability, culpability and responsibility. The TRC set new standards for truth commissions because it had a <b>robust</b> investigative <b>mandate</b> that permitted it to examine all human rights violations committed during the apartheid years. It instituted innovative “themed” hearings that focussed on historical events and institutions central to the apartheid state as well as political hearings. It independently and unilaterally provided limited amnesty to perpetrators that fulfilled the mandated requirements. In making its Report findings based on submitted evidentiary documentation, the TRC utilised international law to establish that apartheid was a crime against humanity. The CAVR is the first-ever Asian truth commission and while it had a lesser profile than the TRC it set some significant precedents in its own right. Its utilisation of traditional, restorative law in the Community Reconciliation Procedures (CRP) was successful and its National Public Hearings (NPH) were themed hearings tailored to the provisions of international law that brought acknowledgment to victims that their violations were universally recognised crimes. The CAVR was intended by the UN as a “complementary judicial process” but jurisdiction over all serious crimes committed during 1999 remained the prerogative of the formal judiciary. While the CAVR heard testimonies from perpetrators of minor crimes, it was not authorised to issue amnesties, merely to facilitate them. However, it could examine historical crimes from 1975 – 1999. Chega! detailed the CAVR findings that the Indonesian military, primarily, was responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes during its illegal invasion and occupation of East Timor. While some aspects of the TRC were utilised by the CAVR, the circumstances in which they operated were very different. These factors, amongst others, preclude the portability of the TRC as a “model”...|$|R
