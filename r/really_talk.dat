5|$|South Park was {{the first}} weekly program to be rated TV-MA rating, and is {{generally}} intended for adult audiences. The boys and most other child characters use strong profanity, with only the most taboo words being bleeped during a typical broadcast. According to Parker and Stone, when little boys are alone, that's how they <b>really</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
500|$|Known for his reticence, Tang {{remains an}} enigmatic person. In an August 2008 {{interview}} with the Straits Times, fellow artist Vincent Leow said of Tang: [...] "He's a very hands-on person, very improvisational and has good ideas. But he doesn't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> much. You can't really tell who he is." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{underground}} {{success of the}} band's second studio album Kerplunk (1992), {{a number of major}} record labels became interested in Green Day. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances until meeting producer and Reprise representative Rob Cavallo. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> to and connect with".|$|E

500|$|Cartman is foul-mouthed (as are his friends) as a {{means for}} Parker and Stone to portray how they believe young boys <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> when they are alone. According to Parker, Cartman does not possess the [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] of the show's other child characters. Cartman is shown at times to be {{completely}} amoral and remorseless. Cartman is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.|$|E
500|$|Like his friends, Kyle is foul-mouthed as a {{means for}} Parker and Stone to display how they claim young boys <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> when they are alone. [...] Parker notes that while Kyle is {{sometimes}} cynical and profane, there is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] to the character, and Time described Kyle and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.|$|E
500|$|Stan is foul-mouthed (a trait {{present in}} his friends as well) {{as a means}} for Parker and Stone to display how they claim young boys <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> when they are alone. In {{responding}} to certain situations, particularly during earlier seasons, Stan often exclaims [...] "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here". While Stan is cynical and profane, Parker still notes that there is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] to the character, and Time magazine described Stan and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{that was}} nine months ago. What {{have you been}} doing since? Why didn't you declare {{yourself}} then?" [...] said Randolph impatiently, a little irritated by the man's extreme indifference. He <b>really</b> <b>talked</b> like an amused spectator of his own misfortunes.|$|R
500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward." [...] After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.|$|E
500|$|... "Oh {{it was so}} fun, it was amazing. For me it {{was like}} being on a Martin Scorsese set. I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lola" [...] {{was written}} as a {{critique}} of mainstream societal treatment of romantic love and heartbreak society. [...] "A wife’s just a whore with a diamond ring", Ndegéocello's sang. She drew inspiration from matchmaking reality television shows that presented love as a [...] "really clear exchange". [...] "I hear young women going 'well if he can buy me something'", Ndegéocello explained. [...] "That song—'Put It in the Bag'—which is based on 'can you buy me some things?' And then the male counterpart, all he can <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> about is sex and if the woman can cook. And it’s funny to me. That you're {{no more than a}} whore, you just have a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry. [...] "People change themselves", she said. [...] "Almost in the sense of creating mental anguish in order to make other people happy and to obtain celebrity and fame. That's why the lyric is 'you do anything.' Some people do anything for their big dreams of sunshine." ...|$|E
30|$|Whose doctor {{really does}} that? I mean {{even with a}} good {{relationship}} or rapport built with your doctor. Who’s <b>really</b> sitting around <b>talking</b> about sex with their doctor unless it’s a gynecologist or a urologist, possibly. But, general practitioner? I mean unless [your appointment is] really about sex. Who’s <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> to their doctor about sex? Doctors are weirded out about the stuff, too.|$|R

2500|$|The pacing {{and rhythm}} of Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday {{was a big}} {{influence}} on the pictures style. Woody Allen's Annie Hall was also very influential while Hudlin worked on the project because, according to Hudlin, [...] "if you talk about contemporary romantic comedy, you're <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about Annie Hall." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{expanding}} their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock, the band {{decided not to}} worry about what their next album was going to sound like. Tucker explained, [...] "It was so spontaneous [...] The songs just kept popping up one after another. We didn't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> about anything. It just kind of happened." [...] She also said that they wanted to write songs that were [...] "really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [...] earlier songs." [...] All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater-Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks. Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock, but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album's complex melodies. All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson, who previously produced the band's third studio album, Dig Me Out. The band decided to work with him again because, according to Weiss, Goodmanson [...] "has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it, so we sound better". The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington.|$|E
500|$|The Blessing has {{provoked}} a more divided response. Waugh's judgement was {{that those who}} criticised the book were [...] "lazy brutes..... can't bear to see a writer grow up". More recently, Philip Hensher and others have [...] argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford's [...] "marvellous voice" [...] is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her [...] "Frenchness" [...] than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France {{as the embodiment of}} everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford's final novel, Don't Tell Alfred, Waugh again hailing it as her best, [...] "clamouring for a sequel". In this judgement he was largely alone; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about. An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: [...] "What exactly goes on?... Can you always tell an Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> this way?" [...] Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplements review, in relation to Mitford's fictional output as a whole: [...] "Would she have been a better novelist if she had 'tried harder', gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?" ...|$|E
500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Cornell {{said the}} major {{change with the}} {{reformed}} Soundgarden {{was a lack of}} alcohol: [...] "The biggest difference I noticed... and we haven't even <b>really</b> <b>talked</b> about it: there are no bottles of Jack Daniel's around or beers. And we never talked about it... it's just not there." ...|$|R

5000|$|Capri's {{second and}} last film was Good Morning... and Goodbye! (1967). According to Jimmy McDonough, Capri felt betrayed by Meyer after a scene {{she was told}} [...] "alluded to nudity" [...] showed more of her body than Capri was {{comfortable}} with. She told McDonough, [...] "I was really upset. I never <b>really</b> <b>talked</b> to anybody on the set again." ...|$|R
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly is openly gay, but in {{comparing}} What Not to Wear {{with the show}} Queer Eye—which pioneered gay men making over people seen as needing fashion advice—the Washington Blade noted some key differences: [...] "nless you have your gaydar on while watching the show, you would have no idea. There's nothing 'gay' about the show and he doesn't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> about it on air. Viewers trust Kelly's expertise based {{on the strength of}} his choices rather than on the 'he's gay and he should know' fashion theory." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{director}} of the French branch of Tobis, Dr Henckel, had given Clair complete freedom to make the film, but after the Paris opening he told Clair that it was now clear what others thought of his methods, and that in future {{he would have to}} resign himself to giving the audience what they wanted - <b>talking</b> pictures that <b>really</b> <b>talked.</b>|$|R
50|$|The film {{then goes}} back several months. Chance is annoyed when Rory, a {{struggling}} actor with whom Chance had a one-night stand, appears {{at her door}} and becomes emotional trying to convince her {{that they have a}} connection beyond just sex because they <b>really</b> <b>talked</b> afterward. Chance and Simon spin a story about meeting in a mental institution, which makes Rory uncomfortable enough to stop crying and to leave.|$|R
2500|$|On 27 May 2011, Peter Jackson {{announced}} via Facebook that Orlando Bloom would reprise {{his role}} as Legolas. Bloom revealed on 25 April 2011 {{that he had been}} in contact with Jackson, who had given him a copy of the screenplay and said that there was a high probability that he would return. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I'm going to bet on it... But I can't <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> too much about it because it's still sort of in the ether.

We had a great year were we made like a hundred songs. Nobody’s ever heard that stuff. But once it went public, everything was different. I was confused, it started to feel like fulfilling a commitment where the game had changed. It was interesting, I’m still sort of unpacking that experience. We all had to sign confidentiality agreements, so I can’t <b>really</b> <b>talk</b> about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{threat of}} climate change to the islands is not a {{dominant}} motivation for migration as Tuvaluans appear to prefer to continue living in Tuvalu for reasons of lifestyle, culture and identity.

50|$|This is {{no simple}} reform. It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy, visible differences, have been the primary ways of {{organizing}} human beings into superior and inferior groups, and into the cheap labor on which this system still depends.

5000|$|While {{working at}} WNYC as a {{political}} reporter, Anna Sale submitted her idea for the show to an internal contest at WNYC. Sale describes her inspiration for the podcast as “a reaction to the artifice of politics, here you’re talking about things without <b>really</b> <b>talking</b> about them specifically, concretely or honestly." [...] Sale’s pitch won the contest and Death, Sex and Money launched in 2014 as a 30-minute podcast.|$|R
