5|$|Indiana fielded Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> {{to their}} 25-yard line. The Hoosiers {{attempted}} a long pass, but the throw fell incomplete and the quarter {{came to an}} end with the score still tied at 77.|$|E
5|$|After an Indianapolis 7-play drive {{ended in}} a punt, Chicago started on their own 20-yard line with 13:38 left in the game. But four plays later, Colts {{defensive}} back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhammad and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> 56yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Against Washington and Lee, Hanulak made an {{interception}} {{and then on}} Maryland's possession rushed for a 12-yard touchdown. Ron Waller dropped a Generals' punt at mid-field, but recovered and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> for a touchdown. After halftime, Tatum fielded third- and fourth-string players before the final results of 52–0.|$|E

Love always seeks mutuality and grows by the sense of responses, or we should love beautiful inanimate things more passionately than we do. Failing a full <b>return,</b> <b>it</b> makes the most of an inadequate return. Failing a sustained <b>return</b> <b>it</b> welcomes a temporary coincidence. Failing a <b>return</b> <b>it</b> finds support in accepted sacrifices. But it seeks a full return, and the fulness of life has come only to those who, loving, have met the lover.|$|R

5|$|Berkshire {{appears to}} have passed from Mercian to West Saxon control during Beorhtwulf's reign. The Welsh are {{recorded}} to have rebelled against Beorhtwulf's successor, Burgred, shortly after Beorhtwulf's death, suggesting that Beorhtwulf had been their overlord. Charters from Beorthwulf's reign show a strained relationship with the church, as Beorhtwulf seized land and subsequently <b>returned</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> 9-yards {{to his own}} 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14yards on their ensuing possession, {{but it was enough}} for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} last time the Crimson Tide led in the game as a pair of turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E

5|$|In February 1857 the Chelmsford Chronicle {{reported}} that £10 in silver {{had been stolen}} from Golding Spearman, keeper of the Tilbury Fort canteen. When the police were unable to identify the culprit, Spearman turned to Murrell, who asserted that he would place a spell on the thief which {{would result in the}} return of the money. Shortly after, a soldier discovered the stolen money and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to Spearman, who attributed its retrieval to Murrell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Trent Richardson scored first on a one-yard {{touchdown}} run {{followed by a}} 39-yard McCarron touchdown pass to White on consecutive possessions. Following an unsuccessful extra point by Jeremy Shelley, Alabama led 27–0 entering the fourth quarter. Early in the fourth, DeMarcus Milliner intercepted a Jordan Rodgers pass and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> 37-yards to the Commodores' 20-yard line. Three plays later, McCarron threw a 17-yard touchdown pass, his fourth of the day, to Darius Hanks to make the final score 34–0.|$|E

On the Hoosiers' first play, Paci {{completed}} a 34-yard pass to tight end Ross Hales for Indiana's second first {{down of the}} game. Just outside the Tech 10-yard line, Indiana was stopped short and prevented from scoring a touchdown. Indiana's head coach sent in placekicker Bill Manolopolous, whose 26-yard kick soared through the uprights and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 8:47 remaining before halftime.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} claimants to the Duchy {{began to see}} that Sforza would be a greater threat than the Ambrosian Republic. Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added {{with the fact that he}} rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E
