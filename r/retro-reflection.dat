A significant change of the spectral behaviour has been detected after laser irradiation and after fibre coating. A strong SiC resonance appears and the damped interference waves in the short wavelength region vanish simultaneously. Spectra modelling {{has been used to}} interpret the measured near-normal specular reflectance spectra. The dielectric function of the fibre material is described by a Lorentzian oscillator model. Because of the cylindrical shape of the fibrewith a diameter close to the wavelength of the used light the Maxwell based algorithm for spectra simulation of flat layered samples with smoothinterfaces has been extended by a term of interface irregularities which modifies the phase of the reflected beam. Based on this model the measuredspectra have been well described and the dielectric functions of the fibreshave been derived. The interference-like waves result from <b>retro-reflections</b> inside the fibre. Spectral changes due to laser treatment of fibres have been attributed to re-crystallization of the originally amorphous SiC based material resulting in scattering on the crystallite interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Electron {{reflection}} at an interface is {{a fundamental}} quantum transport phenomenon. The most famous electron reflection is the electronRhole Andreev reflection (AR) at a metal/superconductor interface. While AR can be either specular or retro-type, electronRelectron reflection is limited to only the specular type. Here we show that electrons can undergo <b>retro-reflection</b> in bilayer graphene (BLG). The underlying mechanism for this previously unknown process is the anisotropic constant energy band contour of BLG. The electron group velocity is fully reversed upon reflection, causing electrons to be retro-reflected. Utilizing a BLG/superconductor junction (BLG/S) as a model structure, we show that the unique low energy quasiparticle nature of BLG results in two striking features: (1) AR is completely absent, making BLG/S 100 % electron reflective; (2) electrons are valley-selectively focused upon <b>retro-reflection.</b> Our results suggest that BLG/S is a valley-selective Veselago electron focusing mirror which {{can be useful in}} valleytronic applications...|$|E

40|$|By {{combining}} the Dirac equation of relativistic quantum mechanics with the Bogoliubov-De Gennes equation of superconductivity we investigate the electron-hole conversion at a normal-metal [...] superconductor interface in graphene. We {{find that the}} Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions has several unusual features: 1) The electron and hole occupy different valleys of the band structure; 2) At normal incidence the electron-hole conversion happens with unit efficiency {{in spite of the}} large mismatch in Fermi wave lengths at {{the two sides of the}} interface; and, most fundamentally: 3) Away from normal incidence the reflection angle may be the same as the angle of incidence (<b>retro-reflection)</b> or it may be inverted (specular reflection). Specular Andreev reflection dominates in weakly doped graphene, when the Fermi wave length in the normal region is large compared to the superconducting coherence length. We find that the transition from <b>retro-reflection</b> to specular reflection with decreasing doping is associated with an inversion of the voltage dependence of the subgap conductance of the interface.

40|$|The task of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the possibilities of using micro-structuring {{on the surface of}} thin light-guides to efficiently couple light from top-emitting LEDs into such light-guides. Areas of application are backlighting for LCD TV and flexible light emitting layers for lighting purposes. The micro-structures considered are prisms and pyramids. The micro-structures can be {{on the same side of}} light-guide as the LEDs or on the opposite side. When located on the opposite side, the micro-structures are coated with a specular reflecting layer or with a diffuse reflecting layer. The LEDs can either be in optical contact with the light-guide or not in optical contact. Optical ray-tracing software package Light-Tools is used for all ray-tracing simulations of these geometries. In simulations, a two-step approach is taken: Firstly, we build in Light-Tools a simple model of an LED in proximity to a micro-structured light-guide in order to ascertain which geometry is most likely to show a high in-coupling efficiency. In the next step, we made a more elaborate and more accurate model of the most promising geometries. The results of these simulations show that, for micro-structures that are located on the light-guide on the side opposite to the LEDs, a diffuse reflecting layer (i. e. a Lambertian scatterer) is more useful than a specular reflecting layer (i. e. a mirror). Also, in general, the prisms structures perform better than the pyramid structures. The highest efficiency reached in the simulations is 60 % for Model I 1   in which the light source is not in optical contact with the light guide and the mirror is on the opposite side of the light guide. Compared to the result reported in a previous paper, the incoupling efficiency improvement is 8 %. We also looked into using <b>Retro-reflection</b> Films for improving the in-coupling efficiency. Several prototypes with a <b>Retro-reflection</b> Film were made and tested in the laboratory. Measurements were performed for three thicknesses of the light guide: 0. 25 mm, 0. 5 mm and 1 mm.

40|$|Road {{visibility}} {{is used as}} {{a performance}} index by both road lighting and automobile lighting engineers. We propose a road network visibility index devoted to road operators, in order to assess the quality of their inter-urban networks in terms of night-time visibility. On rural roads at night (without public lighting), an object on the road is only visible to the driver if it is illuminated by the headlights. Its visibility depends on its geometric and photometric properties, on the photometric properties of the headlamps, and on the <b>retro-reflection</b> properties of the road in the background. Our goal is to compute a “visibility level ” index along a road itinerary, to serve as a tool of diagnosis for road operators who may want to know where on their network the night-time visibility is poor. This tool may also assess the improvement brought by modifications of the infrastructure. We use an instrumented vehicle (Ecodyn), calibrated it in order to measure the <b>retro-reflection</b> of the road pavement. We get a profile of the retro-reflectivity along the road, then we consider average headlamp photometric data (UMTRI European low-beam), and compute the profile of the visibility level, as indicated in Adrian’s model, for a given target along the road. This methodology was tested on two itineraries of several kilometers. As a conclusion, we propose a night-time road visibility index for roads without street lighting, and show the feasibility of the measurement with an existing photometric system. This methodology is mainly dedicated to road operators, but may also find applications in the conception of advanced front-lighting systems through the in-vehicle use of “visibility level ” digital maps of road networks...|$|E

The controllability of the dissipation rate of the atomic motion gives a considerable advantage over typical optomechanical systems enclosed in optical cavities, in that it allows a segregation between the cooling and coherent dynamics regimes.

40|$|The Andreev {{reflection}} of the normal state-superconductor junction both in monolayer and bilayer graphene with a single magnetic barrier is investigated {{by means of the}} Green's function formalism. Within the tight-binding model, we study the direction-dependent Andreev {{reflection of}} two-dimensional graphene-superconductor junctions in the specular and <b>retro-reflection</b> regimes. The presence of a magnetic barrier close to the superconducting hybrid junction introduces a rich phenomenology. Such a barrier is capable of tuning the preferred angles of incidence for the Andreev reflection. In particular, it can enhance the specular reflection probability for certain angles of incidence in bilayer-based hybrid structures. When transmission is permitted, the Andreev reflection manifests itself in isolated peaks and asymmetric resonances associated with offsets and Fano-type oscillations in the transmission, respectively. Moreover, Fabry-Pérot oscillations in the Andreev reflection due to the interior scattering inside the magnetic barrier may appear. The impacts of magnetic barriers on the monolayer and bilayer hybrid interfaces are furthermore studied by calculating the differential conductances within the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formula.
