40|$|Abstract—Since {{regulating}} transformers {{have proved}} to be ef-ficient in controlling the power flow and regulating the voltage, they are more and more widely used in today’s environment of en-ergy production, transmission and distribution. This changing en-vironment challenges protection engineers as well to improve the sensitivity of protection, so that low-current faults could be de-tected (like turn-to-turn short circuits in transformer windings) and a warning message could be given. Moreover, the idea of an adaptive protection that adjusts the operating characteristics of the relay system in response to changing system conditions has became much more promising. It improves the protection sensitivity and simplifies its conception. This paper presents an adaptive adjust-ment concept in relation to the position change of the on load tap changer for universal differential protection of regulating trans-formers; such a concept provides a sensitive and cost-efficient pro-tection for regulating transformers. Various simulations are car-ried out with the Electro-Magnetic Transients Program/Alterna-tive Transients Program. The simulation results indicate the func-tional efficiency of the proposed concept under different fault con-ditions; the protection is sensitive to low level intern faults. The paper concludes by describing the software implementation of the algorithm on a test system based on a digital signal processor.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the placement of}} conventional power flow controllers (namely the Fixed series capacitor (FSC), Phase Angle <b>Regulating</b> <b>Transformer</b> (PAR)) and Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices (namely the Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), the Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC), the Unified Power Flow Controllers (UPFC) and the Sen Transformer (ST)) in bulk power systems to minimize transmission losses in the entire system. This firstly resolves line overloading and improves the overall voltage profile of the entire system. Secondly the transmission losses are minimized and also help in reducing the generation, which results in additional dollar savings {{in terms of the}} fuel costs. The sizes of the FACTS devices used were small {{in order to keep the}} initial installation costs low for the utility. The reduced FACTS device ratings are mentioned as a benefit, but not included in the overall loss minimization calculations. Various types of FACTS devices were modeled and placed in the power system, and the economic benefits were discussed and compared for different power flow conditions. The FSC, PAR, and TCSC are the FACTS Devices commonly used in the electric utility industry. In addition to the previous devices, the SSSC and UPFC were also modeled in the popular PSS/E and PSAT software's. The Sen Transformer was modeled using an electromagnetic transient simulation program (PSCAD/EMTDC). A line stability index was used to find the optimum location for placing the FACTS device. This thesis also provides a quantified value for the overall losses with the different FACTS devices, which is not available in the previous research literature. The Sen Transformer is a new type of a FACTS device that was developed by a former Westinghouse engineer, Dr. Kalyan Sen in 2003. It is based on the same operating principle as a UPFC (i. e. provides independent active and reactive power control) but uses the proven transformer technology instead. The benefit of the SEN transformer is that it would cost approximately only 30 % of the UPFC cost. This thesis studies the Sen Transformer for loss minimization. Since the Sen technology uses a mature transformer technology, its maintenance costs are going to be less and therefore the utilities would be more comfortable using such a device instead of UPFC. A 12 bus test system proposed by FACTS modeling working group was used for validating and testing the FACTS devices in this thesis. This test system is a composite model of Manitoba Hydro, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Chicago area subsystems. This test platform manifests number of operating problems, which the electric utilities typically face. This system has been used for congestion management, voltage support and stability improvement studies with the FACTS devices. The results show that compensating a short transmission line in this system is more effective in minimizing the overall losses and improving the voltage profile compared to a typical approach of compensating long lines. The results also show that the UPFC and Sen Transformer are the most effective in minimizing the overall losses with the Sen Transformer being the most cost effective solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{smart grid}} is a {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{that aims to}} revolutionize the whole electricity supply chain including generation, transmission and distribution systems in order to overcome the multiple challenges currently facing the electric power grid. The smart grid {{could be seen as}} a modern electrical power grid in which information as well as electricity flows among all nodes in the system, information is continuously collected, processed and hence used to control and coordinate the different system components such as distributed generation (DG) units, capacitor banks, voltage <b>regulating</b> <b>transformers,</b> etc. Therefore distributed intelligence and two-way data communication links are essential components in implementing the smart grid vision. There are numerous research efforts that focus on implementing the smart grid vision in electrical power distribution systems, most of which only target one aspect of the distribution system control and operation, e. g. a control system for voltage control, another one for DG control, a third one for protection, etc. The coexistence of such control strategies in a distribution system raises some concerns about their overall performance, their interactions with the other control strategies, and whether these control systems can adapt to changes in distribution system connectivity. In this PhD thesis we try to address these issues by proposing an implementation of the smart grid vision for distribution systems that provides an integrated design of power systems, communication systems and control strategies. A unified and flexible framework that incorporates all the different aspects of distribution system control and operation is proposed. Distributed processing units equipped with wireless communication capabilities are used to continuously process the local data along with the data received from other nodes and forward the results to neighboring nodes in the system, which in turn process the received data and share the results with their neighbors. Consequently, changes in any of the system components (load values, status of DG etc.) are taken into account in the calculations as soon as they occur, and the results are forwarded to relevant nodes in the systems. This way the information “propagates” throughout the system resulting in a seamless control and coordination among all the system components. Simulation of the electrical power distribution and the communication systems reveal the effectiveness of the proposed framework to control and coordinate multiple capacitor banks, DG units and voltage <b>regulating</b> <b>transformers</b> with changing load levels. It also reveals the potential of the proposed framework to operate in real-time by combining the real-time measured quantities with computer analysis in order to control the different system components within the time frame of normal non-emergency operating conditions. An experimental setup is built and used as a test bed for the proposed framework in order to assess the performance of the different ideas and techniques proposed in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The Photovoltaic (PV) {{energy is}} {{becoming}} more and more popular nowadays due to both the awareness of people about environmental concerns and the governmental support schemes which makes it more accessible for the potential PV owners to install PV systems at the residential level. However, the integration of large amount of PV systems at the residential level might bring challenges to the utilities companies regarding the power quality and the reliability of the system. One of the biggest challenges is the power output fluctuation of the PV systems. This fluctuation is caused by the weather condition and especially, by the fast-moving clouds which can be referred as the ’’cloud-effect’’. This project work has investigated the ’’cloud-effect’’ of the solar PV units in a residential grid with regard to voltage stability. The residential network (the real system) is a 10 / 0. 4 kV radial grid located in Mölndal area, Göteborg. The simulations have shown that the Mölndal grid was able to maintain its voltage stability when cloud induced power swings occurred in the network. This outcome can be explained as the distribution network is designed to be a strong grid with high short circuit capacity, short line branches and low load condition during the summer in the Swedish residential houses. However, in order to investigate the potential negative impacts of the cloud induced power swings on another possible weaker residential network, the operational parameters (the short circuit capacity and the load power) of the real system were modified. The simulations have shown that for the modified system, the network was able to maintain its voltage stability for 20 - 40 % PV penetration levels. For the 50 % PV penetration level, cloud induced power swings caused low operational voltage profiles (voltage instability) within the grid. This instability was not properly identified when the loads were modeled as static loads. Therefore, dynamic load models are recommended to be implemented in impact-studies in order to investigate more accurate the PV impact on the system operation, especially when a relatively large amount of the system load is represented by induction motors. Different mitigating solutions were proposed and implemented in the simulation for the modified case scenario. Static Var Compensator, STATCOM and Energy Storage Devices were found to improve the voltage stability limits of the network and therefore, to allow a higher penetration level of PV energy. The simulations have shown that ESD are the best mitigating solutions in order to counteract the PV power drops if they are located in close proximity of the electrical loads. For the case with SVC integration, it was found that the placement and the size of the device has to be correlated with the <b>regulating</b> <b>transformer</b> for proper and reliable operation of the grid. For the case with STATCOM integration, it has been shown that its dynamic transient response was superior to SVC when the network was iv subjected to PV power drops. This difference was due to both, that the device incorporated an inverter which provided reactive power independent of the grid voltage and also that its dynamic control was roughly modeled as for a PV inverter. By using this type of control algorithm, the reactive power support of the device was injected more casually which led to a better transient response within the system...|$|E

Minimization {{of the impact of}} a transaction on unrelated third party facilities or maximization of the power transfer between utilities needs now to be formulated as new constraints or objective functions. The dispatch and control of generating units, the taps of <b>regulating</b> <b>transformers,</b> mechanically switched capacitors and reactors have been the primary means available for controlling power flows over the years. However, certain applications require frequent operations that result in a rapid wearing out of the switching equipment. The inadequate line flow control may result in overloaded parts of the networks, while other parts are loaded far below their power carrying capacity. Therefore, the demands for flexibility in power flow control are growing continuously. The FACTS relying on thyristors have high speed switching capability that allows for rapid readjustment of line power flows in response to various contingencies. Installation of FACTS devices on key locations in a meshed network changes the effective reactance of the parallel paths and consequently the way that power divides among them.

The end of life of a transformer is linked to the rate of degradation of the winding paper insulation which is mainly due to heating processes. Rectifier transformers are subject to high thermal stress due to harmonic currents flowing through them. The need of monitoring and regulation of the hotspot temperature on the rectifier transformer winding is of great importance to keep the temperatures within safe limits as to preserve its life span.

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding animal {{development}} and physiology at a molecular-biological level has been advanced by {{the ability to}} determine at high resolution the repertoire of mRNA molecules by whole transcriptome resequencing. This includes the ability to detect and quantify rare abundance transcripts and isoform-specific mRNA variants produced from a gene. The sex hierarchy consists of a pre-mRNA splicing cascade that directs the production of sex-specific transcription factors that specify nearly all sexual dimorphism. We have used deep RNA sequencing to gain insight into how the Drosophila sex hierarchy generates somatic sex differences, by examining gene and transcript isoform expression differences between the sexes in adult head tissues. Results Here we find 1, 381 genes that differ in overall expression levels and 1, 370 isoform-specific transcripts that differ between males and females. Additionally, we find 512 genes not <b>regulated</b> downstream of <b>transformer</b> that are significantly more highly expressed in males than females. These 512 genes are enriched on the × chromosome and reside adjacent to dosage compensation complex entry sites, which taken together suggests that their residence on the × chromosome might be sufficient to confer male-biased expression. There are no transcription unit structural features, from a set of features, that are robustly significantly different in the genes with significant sex differences in the ratio of isoform-specific transcripts, as compared to random isoform-specific transcripts, suggesting {{that there is no}} single molecular mechanism that generates isoform-specific transcript differences between the sexes, even though the sex hierarchy is known to include three pre-mRNA splicing factors. Conclusions We identify thousands of genes that show sex-specific differences in overall gene expression levels, and identify hundreds of additional genes that have differences in the abundance of isoform-specific transcripts. No transcription unit structural feature was robustly enriched in the sex-differentially expressed transcript isoforms. Additionally, we found that many genes with male-biased expression were enriched on the × chromosome and reside adjacent to dosage compensation entry sites, suggesting that differences in sex chromosome composition contributes to dimorphism in gene expression. Taken together, this study provides new insight into the molecular underpinnings of sexual differentiation. </p...|$|R
