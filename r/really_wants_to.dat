As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in Dianetics. His letter to O'Brien discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status. The idea may not have been new; Hubbard has been quoted as telling a science fiction convention in 1948: [...] "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion." [...] Scholar J. Gordon Melton notes, [...] "There is no record of Hubbard having ever made this statement, though several of his science fiction colleagues have noted the broaching of the subject on one of their informal conversations." [...] The Church of Scientology has denied that Hubbard said this and insists that it is a misattributed quote that was said instead by George Orwell. Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of [...] "Spiritual Guidance Centers" [...] charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing ("That is real money...

Vanyaland writer Michael Marotta described the track as [...] "brooding and menacing", going on to describe Banks' delivery, [...] "Banks slices through her verses {{in a way that}} recalls the magic she first flashed on the still-lethal 2011 track '212'". In a positive review, Chris Thomas from HipHopWired complimented the track, writing [...] "The Harlem native waxes poetics with a dexterous flow. Her rhymes are laden with braggadocios lines about her boss status". In a mixed review, Kevipod from Direct Lyrics complimented the song's instrumental, but was critical of Banks' vocals, writing [...] "'Heavy Metal and Reflective' possesses a hard-hitting, menacing beat courtesy of Lil Internet and a lot of stale rapping by Azealia", while also commenting on the need for a more mainstream song from Banks' [...] "if she <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> put her career together again". Robbie Daw from Idolator panned the track, describing the song as [...] "trap-lite trash", recommending that Banks spends more time [...] "actually focus on not making shit music".|$|E

500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard {{gave the}} single a mixed review, stating that Minaj, being [...] "one {{of the most}} {{visually}} distinctive rappers to come along in years", that the single was an [...] "anticlimatic coming out song", [...] "considering the hype Minaj has generated through mixtapes, cameos and her co-starring role in Lil Wayne's Young Money project". However Hererra did commend the lyrical content, stating [...] "her sassy one-liners are as entertaining as always", and the overall production although it didn't suit Minaj's [...] "her mental-patient delivery nearly as well as, say, Kane Beatz' simpler track for Young Money's [...] "BedRock". Robbie Daw of 'Idolator' said, [...] "we wouldn’t expect Nicki to do any less than {{come out of the}} gate charging full force, lyrically, on her debut single. That said, we were expecting maybe a tad more of a melody on the track." [...] Chris Ryan of 'MTV Buzzworthy' gave the song a positive review, stating [...] "you get the feeling, listening to the song's air-raid keyboards and thunderous beats, that the Young Money princess <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> separate herself from the rap pack and carve out a space all her own". Ryan also said, [...] "her verbal dexterity, complex flow and humor, Nicki is reminiscent of classic Missy Elliott -- and that's a compliment of the highest order".|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E

Shakira expressed her views about the partnership, saying [...] "I am very excited to be able to express myself through another creative medium. “My feeling is that personal care and beauty should be effortless and accessible for everyone." [...] Interested in perfumery and conveying [...] "emotions through aromas", the singer decided to take the idea further and began exploring various scents. The development of the perfume took three years to complete and Shakira compared the process to composing a song, opining that [...] "It's similar to the process you go through when writing a melody: certain chord combinations inspire different feelings in the listener. I wanted to find a way of expressing the feeling of pure happiness through the medium of fragrance". José Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, commented that Shakira was completely involved {{in the process of developing}} the fragrance and was [...] "extremely hands-on". Didier Maine de Biran, general manager of Puig USA, opined that S by Shakira was different from other celebrity-branded fragrances, saying [...] "What makes this stand out is how involved she [...] was. The key difference is she has the knowledge of what she wants and <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> share it with her fans. She's involved. She's committed.

2500|$|Speak is a first-person, diary-like narrative. Written in {{the voice}} of Melinda Sordino, it {{features}} lists, subheadings, spaces between paragraphs and script-like dialogue. The fragmented style mimics Melinda's trauma. The choppy sentences and blank spaces on the pages relate to Melinda's fascination with Cubism. According to Chris McGee and DeTora, Anderson's writing style allows the reader to see how Melinda struggles with [...] "producing the standard, cohesive narrative" [...] expected in a teen novel. Melinda's distracted narrative reiterates the idea that [...] "no one <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hear what you have to say". In her article, [...] "Like Falling Up into a Storybook", Barbara Tannert-Smith says, By disrupting the present with flashbacks of the past, Anderson further illustrates the structure of trauma.

Anderson superimposed the fragmented trauma plot-line upon this linear high school narrative, making the narrative more believable.|$|E
