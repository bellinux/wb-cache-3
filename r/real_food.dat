5|$|When {{the legendary}} donor Karna {{died in the}} epic Mahabharata war, his soul transcended to heaven, where he was offered gold and jewels as food. However, Karna needed <b>real</b> <b>food</b> to eat and asked Indra, the lord of heaven, the reason for serving gold as food. Indra told Karna that he had donated gold all his life, but had never donated food to his {{ancestors}} in Shraddha. Karna said that since {{he was unaware of}} his ancestors, he never donated anything in their memory. To make amends, Karna was permitted to return to earth for a 15–day period, so that he could perform Shraddha and donate food and water in their memory. This period is now known as Pitru Paksha. In some legends, Yama replaces Indra.|$|E

25|$|For trophic cascades to be ubiquitous, {{communities}} must generally act as food chains, with discrete trophic levels. Most communities, however, have complex food webs. In <b>real</b> <b>food</b> webs, consumers often feed {{at multiple}} trophic levels (omnivory), organisms often change their diet {{as they grow}} larger, cannibalism occurs, and consumers are subsidized by inputs of resources from outside the local community, all of which blur the distinctions between trophic levels.|$|E

Fake foods are also used to display lifelike replicas of <b>real</b> <b>foods</b> for restaurants, grocery chains, museums, banquet halls, casino buffets, cruise ships, and in many other instances in which <b>real</b> <b>foods</b> cannot be displayed. For instance, the American company Fake Foods began when fast food restaurant Wendy's needed artificial kale for their salad bar display.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of Maillard flavor compounds for food quality is undisputed, {{but we are}} far {{from being able to}} control such formation quantitatively in food processing. Kinetic models attempt to predict rates of formation as a function of temperature, pH, water activity/content, and chemical reactivity. There is, however, a gap between mechanistic models for well-defined model systems, and their application to food, where we are left mainly with empirical models. This paper addresses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the current models in their ability to predict Maillard flavor compounds quantitatively, the opportunities to progress with these models to make the step to <b>real</b> <b>foods,</b> and the threats that models are simplifications by their very nature. Topics addressed are the usefulness of uniresponse versus multiresponse models, mechanistic versus empirical models, model systems versus <b>real</b> <b>foods.</b> A combination of kinetics and thermodynamics is proposed as direction for future researc...|$|R

25|$|Food webs {{are limited}} {{representations}} of real ecosystems as they necessarily aggregate many species into trophic species, which are functional groups {{of species that}} have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use these simplifications in quantitative (or mathematical) models of trophic or consumer-resource systems dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for generalized patterns {{in the structure of}} <b>real</b> <b>food</b> web networks. Ecologists have identified non-random properties in the topographic structure of food webs. Published examples that are used in meta analysis are of variable quality with omissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the rise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using network theory had identified patterns that are common to all. Scaling laws, for example, predict a relationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels of species richness.|$|E

500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering <b>real</b> <b>food</b> blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E

The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as [...] "very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it’s steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with {{the shape of the}} streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge." [...] For authenticity, the set was dressed with <b>real</b> <b>food,</b> and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street. The inside of Kamar-Taj was also constructed at Longcross, with [...] "sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary." [...] Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a [...] "truly spiritual, truly magical" [...] feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu.

2500|$|From 1974 to 2005 <b>real</b> <b>food</b> prices (adjusted for inflation) {{dropped by}} 75%. Food {{commodity}} prices were relatively stable after reaching lows in 2000 and 2001. Therefore, recent rapid food price increases are considered extraordinary. [...] A World Bank policy research working paper published in July 2008 {{found that the}} increase in food commodities prices was led by grains, with sharp price increases in 2005 despite record crops worldwide. From January 2005 until June 2008, maize prices almost tripled, wheat increased 127 percent, and rice rose 170 percent. The increase in grain prices was followed by increases in fats and oil prices in mid-2006. On the other hand, the study found that sugar cane production has increased rapidly, and it was large enough to keep sugar price increases small except for 2005 and early 2006. The paper concluded that biofuels produced from grains have raised food prices in combination with other related factors between 70 to 75 percent, but ethanol produced from sugar cane has not contributed significantly to the recent increase in food commodities prices.|$|E

The sweet popcorn, in addition to being sweet, was perceived as saltier when eaten out of a coloured (as compared to a white) bowl, and vice versa for the salty popcorn.
