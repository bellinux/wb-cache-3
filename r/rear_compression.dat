5000|$|Launched in 1971 the 5-speed, [...] double {{overhead}} cam twin cylinder Triumph Bandit delivered [...] and could reach 110 mph. Essentially the same motorcycle as the BSA Fury, the Bandit represented the factory's last attempt {{to compete against}} Japanese imports.The only contemporary road test was by American magazine Cycle Guide in their March 1971 issue upon {{a visit to the}} Triumph and BSA factories at Meriden and Small Heath, respectively. The Bandit's petrol tank colour scheme was Cypress Green (although Cycle World identified it as Jealous Green [...] ) with white-lined black scallops above and below a metal Triumph badge with a chrome styling strip running down the top of the tank. The same paint scheme applied to the mudguards with a white-lined black stripe running down through their centre. The side panels were silver painted with black 'tombstone' style lettering stating the model name and engine size: 'Bandit 350'. The engine was all-alloy as opposed to Triumph's other twins that relied upon an iron barrel and considered by Cycle Guide to be 'beautifully finished' and 'a real thing of beauty'. Cycle Guide criticised the retention of a traditionally Triumph vertically split crankcase halves rather than adopting the Japanese practice of horizontally splitting them. Despite this, it was noted that the engine was oil tight. The small diameter instruments and foot pegs thought mounted too far forward came in for criticism as did the poor conical hub rear brake performance, unlike the 'great' front brake. Lever travel between gears was felt to be too long although the clutch operation was 'silky smooth'. The electrical system was twin coil and 12 volt and an electric starter was offered as an option. Carburetion was by two Amal 27mm carburetors. Cycle Guide were disappointed that the engine could not be expanded beyond 350cc but praised the engine's and exhausts' quietness. Two exhaust systems, a low level ('T35R') and high level (the 'T35SS' Street Scrambler version), were offered, the former offering more top speed. The low level exhaust system was finished in bright chrome, the high level system in matt black with a stainless steel heat shield. The T35SS version also came with what the brochure described as 'detachable electrics'. Tyres for both versions were the same, Dunlop K70; 3.25 x 18 inches for the front and 3.50 x 18 inches for the <b>rear.</b> <b>Compression</b> ratio was also the same for both : 9.5:1.|$|E
40|$|The Casaglia Monte della Colonna (CMC) body, {{from the}} middle Miocene Marnoso-arenacea Formation of the Northern Apennines, {{covering}} more than 350 square kilometers, provides {{a rare opportunity to}} study the geometry and the internal deformation of a large, basin-wide submarine landslide. Although the head zone of the landslide has not been preserved, the body has a transitional zone, a contractional ramp cutting off more than 200 meters of the footwall stratigraphic succession, and a very wide lobe spilling over onto. the adjoining basin plain deposits. The extent of the body, the depth of the ramp cut-off and the widening of the lobe are comparable with the largest present-day submarine landslides, not often observed in fossil examples. Internal deformation structures are distributed differently in the ramp and lobe zones. The ramp zone has antiformal stacking of duplexes and steeply inclined folds. The lobe has a well-defined strain partition: {{the upper part of the}} body is affected by extensional structures such as listric normal faults and extensional duplexes; the lower part is de formed by recumbent folds, boudinage and stacking of blocks, which are compatible with flow-induced, heterogeneous simple shear. This distribution is consistent with a kinematic model of extrusion-spreading, implying <b>rear</b> <b>compression</b> in the ramp zone with thickening and shortening of the body, and spreading in the lobe with thinning and stretching. The localized buckling present in the distal part of the lobe may be related to the onset of lateral confinement,, due to local topographic features of the basin plain (synsedimentary intrabasinal high). The various degrees and styles of stratal disruption in the mass wasting body depend on the different combination of progressive simple shear, layer-parallel extension and shortening. Different structural associations occur in well-defined parts of the body due to kinematics of emplacement (spreading, flow and buckling). These associations may be diagnostic of. gravitational mass wasting processes rather than shallow-level tectonic deformation...|$|E
50|$|Compression damping {{refers to}} systems that slow {{the rate of}} {{compression}} in a front fork shock or <b>rear</b> shock. <b>Compression</b> damping is usually accomplished by forcing a hydraulic fluid (such as oil) through a valve when the shock becomes loaded. The amount of damping {{is determined by the}} resistance through the valve, a higher amount of damping resulting from greater resistance in the valve. Many shocks have compression damping adjustments which vary the resistance in the valve. Often, lockouts function by allowing no or very little compression.|$|R

By adjusting the pulse intensity of laser to increase with time, we directly ablated the iron target with laser to achieve isentropic <b>compression.</b> <b>Rear</b> surface velocities {{of the iron}} targets were recorded by VISAR (Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector).

50|$|The second mass-produced F4 1000, the F4 1000 R and F4 1000R CRC Gold limited edition, was {{released}} in 2006 and came with a 174-horsepower - 175 horsepower and 308 km/h for limited edition (128 kW) engine. The F4 1000 R also has upgraded Brembo Monobloc radial brakes, forged black Brembo wheels, a carbon-nitride coated Marzocchi upside down fork and an upgraded Sachs <b>rear</b> shock absorber (<b>compression</b> & rebound damping adjustable in high & low speed range). The F4 1000 R engine does not utilize the TSS system. A 1+1 (Biposto) version is available that adds a pillion for a passenger. In August 2006 an F4 1000 R was used to set a record for the fastest production class 1000 cc motorcycle of over 185.882 mph (299.148 km/h) at Bonneville Salt Flats.|$|R
40|$|Mountain biking is a {{globally}} popular sport, {{in which}} the rider uses a mountain bike to ride on off-road terrain. A mountain bike has either a front suspension system only or a full-suspension system to decrease the external vibration resulting from the terrain irregularities and to increase riding comfort. Despite the added comfort of full-suspension of mountain bikes, there are some disadvantages because the chain-suspension interaction and bobbing effect absorb some of the rider's pedalling power and lead to the reduction of pedalling efficiency. In this study, a technique for evaluating the pedalling efficiency of a bike rider in seated cycling by using engineering mechanics is developed. This method is also found to be useful for determining the correct crank angle {{for the beginning of}} the downstroke and that of the upstroke during each pedalling cycle. Next, five mathematical models of rider-bike systems are developed in Simulink and SimMechanics, including one hard-tail (HT) bike, and four full-suspension (FS) bikes [single pivot, four-bar-linkage horst link, four-bar-linkage faux bar, and virtual pivot point (VPP) ]. In each of the five rider-bike systems, a PID controller is applied on the rider's elbow to prevent his upper body from falling down due to gravity. A pedalling controller is also developed in Simulink, which is based on the previous theory for evaluating the rider's pedalling efficiency written in Matlab. Another PID controller is used for the pedalling control by sensing the real-time moving speed and applying a suitable pedalling force to achieve a desired speed. The dynamic responses for each of the five rider-bike systems moving on a flat road surface (without bumps) and rough terrain (with bumps) are investigated. The values determined include the pedalling force, pedalling torque and power, forward velocity, contact forces of front and <b>rear</b> wheels, <b>compressions</b> of front suspension (front fork) and rear suspension (rear shock absorber), sprocket distance, chain tension force, and vertical accelerations of handlebar and seats. The numerical results reveal that, while moving on flat road surface, the pedalling efficiency of hard-tail bike is highest, and the bobbing effect of the VPP bike is most serious. However, while moving on rough terrain, the riding conditions {{for each of the four}} full-suspension bikes are more stable than the hard-tail bike...|$|R
