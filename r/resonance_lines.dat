To explain this property, the spin-system response to a driving field is calculated to fourth order in the dipolar spin interaction, taking the spin coupling modulation into consideration. The fourth moment of the whole spectrum is exactly expressed. It is shown that the spin interaction modulation effect depends upon the <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> shape observed without modulation; i) the side bands should be well observable when the <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> has a gaussian shape; ii) the side band amplitudes become negligible when the <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> has a nearly lorentzian shape...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cavity {{measurements}} {{of a high}} frequency (60 GHz) electron spin resonance (ESR) have been carried our for a single crystal of EuB 6 at temperatures 4. 2 - 50 K in magnetic field up to 7 T, which has been aligned along [001] crystallographic direction.

The theory uses second-order perturbation theory to describe an indirect exchange coupling whereby the nuclear spin of one atom interacts with a conduction electron through the hyperfine interaction, and this conduction electron then interacts with another nuclear spin, thus creating a correlation energy between the two nuclear spins. (Alternatively, instead of nuclear spins coupling to conduction spins through the hyperfine interaction, another scenario is for inner electron spins to couple to conduction spins through the exchange interaction.) The theory is based on Bloch wavefunctions and is therefore only applicable to crystalline systems. The derived exchange interaction takes the following form: ...|$|E

By March 1951, Gutowsky's group were examining fluoro-chloro compounds of known purity and predicting the occurrence of resonance lines: for example, POCl3 showed a single resonance line, while POCl2F showed a doublet. Gutowsky, McCall and Slichter related the intensities of lines to their binomial coefficients, proposing {{what turned out to}} be a correct explanation for such couplings, and suggesting a simple predictive rule that became a basis for further structural research. Other papers rapidly followed, in which they critiqued and expanded their initial interpretation. Some of the work was carried out in close collaboration with Erwin Hahn and others at Stanford, and theoretical elaborations of the coupling mechanism were proposed by Ramsey and Purcell, and supported by Gutowsky's experimental work.|$|E
40|$|We derive a semi-analytic {{solution}} for the structure of conduction-mediated transition layers above an X-ray illuminated accretion disk, and calculate explicitly the X-ray line radiation resulting from both <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> scattering and radiative recombination in these layers. The vertical thermal structure of the illuminated disk is found {{to depend on the}} illuminating continuum: for a hard power law continuum, there are two stable phases connected by a single transition layer; while for a softer continuum, there may exist three stable phases connected by two separate transition layers, with an intermediate stable layer in between. We show that the structure can be written {{as a function of the}} electron scattering optical depth through these layers, which leads to unique predictions of the equivalent width of the resulting line radiation from both recombination cascades and <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> scattering.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Electron spin {{resonance}} investigations on styrene–polyisoprene–polystyr-ene {{block copolymer}} loaded with various amounts of multiwalled carbon nanotubes are reported.

40|$|The nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spin—lattice relaxation times along the static and rotating magnetic fields, and the second moment of the nuclear magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> shape are calculated for a system of two identical spins that undergo a hindered rotation about the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the spins. The hindered rotation treated in this model is the jumping of the spins among four equally spaced equilibrium positions, two of the positions differing in energy from the other two.

50|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging or NMR of macromolecular samples, such as protein solutions, at least two types of water molecules, free (bulk) and bound (hydration), are present. Bulk water molecules have many mechanical degrees of freedom, and motion of such molecules thus exhibits statistically averaged behavior. Because of this uniformity, most free water protons have resonance frequencies very near the average Larmor frequency of all such protons. On a properly acquired NMR spectrum this {{is seen as a}} narrow Lorentzian line (at 4.8 ppm, 20 C). Bulk water molecules are also relatively far from magnetic field perturbing macromolecules, such that free water protons experience a more homogenous magnetic field, which results in slower transverse magnetization dephasing and a longer T2*. Conversely, hydration water molecules are mechanically constrained by extensive interactions with the local macromolecules and hence magnetic field inhomogeneities are not averaged out, which leads to broader <b>resonance</b> <b>lines.</b> This results in faster dephasing of the magnetization that produces the NMR signal and much shorter T2 values(<200 μs). Because the T2 values are so short, the NMR signal from the protons of bound water is not typically observed in MRI.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the high optical depth of the intergalactic medium to Lyα photons before the Epoch of Reionization results in a {{negligible}} magnitude for the Wouthuysen-Field effect produced by a radiation source on its distant surroundings, unless (1) the scattering medium has sufficient time for the impinging <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> photons to establish a steady-state frequency distribution or (2) the scattering gas is undergoing internal expansion or has a peculiar motion of tens to hundreds of kms − 1 away from the source. Because of intergalactic attenuation, discrete structures will receive only radiation from a source displaced from the <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> frequency by typically hundreds to thousands of Doppler widths. The incident radiation must diffuse across the <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> to produce a substantial scattering rate. We present steady-state solutions in the radiative diffusion approximation for the radiation field trapped in a clump of gas and show that this may result in an enhancement {{of the strength of}} the Wouthuysen-Field effect by as much as a factor of 10 6 over the free-streaming (single-scattering) limit.

40|$|The {{invariant}} imbedding technique {{is applied to}} the problem of <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> scattering with frequency redistribution. By applying the principles of invariance to the <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> scattering problem a set of non-linear, integrodifferential equations for the scattering and transmission functions are derived. Thus, an alternate approach to the <b>resonance</b> <b>line</b> scattering problem is presented. Rather than solving for the specific intensity directly the {{invariant imbedding}} equations may be solved for the scattering and transmission functions from which the specific intensity may be calculated. The technique is very general and in principle, can accommodate scattering in inhomogeneous atmospheres with arbitrary frequency redistribution and scattering phase functions. Solutions to the invariant imbedding equations in some simple cases are presented. If the scattering is isotropic and completely noncoherent and the atmosphere may be modeled as homogeneous, the scattering and transmission functions may be expressed in terms of generalized H, X and Y functions. This technique is extended to the problems of coupled spectral lines and scattering of radiation from internal sources...|$|R
