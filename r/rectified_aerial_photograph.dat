This method {{is based on}} the shoreline evolutionary trend being the basis for the first set-back line determination. Afterwards the set-back line were adjusted by incorporating changes associated with the acceleration of sea-level rise and the evaluation of the consequences (instantaneous shoreline retreat and potential flood zone) of an extreme storm. The study area was Itapocorói Bay, in northern coast of Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. The&# 13; determined set-back lines were plotted over <b>rectified</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs,</b> allowing for a straight-forward interpretation of results. The segments northward of Piçarras river mouth and right before the Itajuba headland were the most susceptible zones due coastal hazard mentioned. The integrated method showed to be an important tool for coastal management since it adopts a worst-case scenario approach.

40|$|Parts of the Poukawa, Waipukurau and Tukituki Fault Zones in Central Hawke’s Bay District {{have been}} mapped in detail {{according}} to the Guidelines of the Ministry for the Environment’s “Planning for Development of Land on or Close to Active Faults”. Fault traces with associated Fault Avoidance Zones have been mapped to produce corridors surrounding the active fault traces at a scale suitable {{for the purposes of}} cadastral zoning, i. e. c. 1 : 5000.

Mapping of the Fault Avoidance Zones has been undertaken using a Geographic Information System (GIS) in conjunction with <b>rectified</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs,</b> ortho-photographs and LiDAR imagery.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the actual and modern ice margin fluctuations of valley and cirque glaciers in South Akshayuk Pass, Auyuittuq National Park (Baffin Island, NU). The fluctuation {{of the ice}} margins of the Tete de Cirque, Glacier 12, Windy Lake, Niflheim and Glacier 20 A glaciers were analysed using geometrically <b>rectified</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> taken between 1948 and 1977. IKONOS and LANDSAT 7 ETM+ satellite imagery covering the 1977 to 2003 period were also used. The results indicate a mean annual ice margin retreat of 8. 9 m per year during the 1948 to 2003 period. Compared to south and west-facing glaciers, the ones facing north are characterize by a smaller annual retreat rate. Ice margin fluctuations since the Little Ice Age were evaluated using lichenometric measurements of Rhizocarpon geographicum found on the moraines of the Turnweather, Tete de Cirques, Glacier 12, Windy Lake, Niflheim, Glacier 20 A and Sivingavuk glaciers. Moraine ages were determined by measuring the 10 largest-diameter R. geographicum thalli in the sampling area (100 m 2) and converting these measurements to ages using the regional growth curve of R. geographicum. The maximum extent of the ice margins of the valley and cirques glaciers was reached between AD 800 to 1860, mainly between 1840 and 1860 {{at the end of}} the Little Ice Age period. Size-frequency distribution, an analysis of variance, and multiple comparisons showed that some moraines were subjected to local environmental variations, which affected the growth of R. geographicum, with subsequent implications in the interpretation of the lichenometric ages of the moraines and the ice margin fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} Iberian Peninsula {{is dominated}} by a savannah-like ecosystem, the montado, which is a typically Mediterranean cultural adaptation to generally poor productive areas. Montados are exploited for three main uses: forestry, agriculture, and extensive grazing, in proportions that vary according to local conditions (more or less productive land) and historical circumstances. Because these ecosystems occur over a large geographic area (they occupy some 6 million ha), biodiversity {{would be expected to}} vary among montados. However, differences in management practices may also influence species distribution. In this paper, we investigate differences in plant and bird species diversity among 60 montados distributed all across southern Portugal. The environmental variables studied included geographical coordinates, climatological data, soil type, and altitude. We also investigated agro-economic variables that could describe human activities at each site: animal husbandry (breeds, stock density, grazing rotation, etc.), agriculture (fallow rotation frequency, use of fertilizers, etc.), and forestry (cork harvesting, thinning, etc.). Finally, land-use type and metrics were assessed from <b>rectified</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs.</b> Species richness among these two groups was not correlated, sites with high or low numbers of plant species not necessarily having high or low numbers of bird species. However, both plant and bird communities exhibited a similar pattern of species composition and turnover. This pattern was ecologically based, rather than a result of biological similarities between groups: direct gradient analyses and variance partitioning revealed strong correlations between species distribution and spatial gradients, namely longitude and latitude. In trying to distinguish anthropogenic from biophysical processes, we found that both were equally important as drivers of montado biodiversity. Plants and birds exhibited a similar ecological pattern, although environmental conditions were slightly more important in the case of plants, and human activities were slightly more important in the case of birds...|$|R
40|$|Appendix V (modelling movies - DVD) is {{held with}} the print {{copy of this}} thesis, {{available}} from the University of Waikato Library. Whitianga Estuary is a bayhead barrier type estuary located on {{the east of the}} Coromandel Peninsula, North Island, New Zealand. The catchment has undergone many land-use changes since pre-European settlement. In some areas of the catchment land-use has changed from native forest to grasslands to forestry and back to pasture. These changes in catchment land-use all contribute to increased sedimentation into the estuary. Development of the estuary itself has also occurred in recent times. Much growth has been focussed around the estuary due to Whitianga town-ship having a large boating community, and includes a 170 berth marina and wharf situated at the tidal inlet entrance to the estuary. These, and the extensive canal development engineering works can have substantial impacts on the sedimentation regime, and may modify tidal circulation, flushing, and sediment deposition within the estuary. The principle aim of this research is to assess hydrodynamics and sedimentation of the estuary for future management and development purposes, and also to model different scenarios {{in order to determine the}} most cost effective, and least obtrusive design for a proposed boat-ramp and approach channel near the marina. To determine sedimentation rates, sediment cores from four locations were collected to depths of 1 m. Coring locations were chosen based on preliminary model run results, selecting areas that appeared to be long-term sediment sinks of a stable nature. Cores were divided into 10 mm sections and prepared for 210 Pb dating and heavy metal analysis, to make an assessment of the vertical sedimentation rates. Recent sedimentation rates were found to be as high as 9 mm/yr post- 1950 s and past sedimentation rates as high as 30 mm/yr pre- 1950 s. The use of heavy metal analysis for dating proved difficult as the background levels of the conservative elements used to normalise results varied, making the geochemical analysis approach inappropriate. As bathymetry is one of the most important aspects of modelling, a large amount of surveying was undertaken for this study. LiDAR, singlebeam data, and recent <b>rectified</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> were interpreted for the creation of a bathymetric grid file to be used for hydrodynamic modelling of the estuary. The 3 DD numerical model was used to determine tidal flows and current velocities. From this initial hydrodynamic model a particle-tracking model was created to determine sediment transport pathways within the estuary. From the initial 20 m model it was then possible to create a number of nested model grids for the purpose of determining the best practice scenario for the creation of a proposed boat ramp and associated approach channel near the harbour entrance. Hydrodynamic results suggest that residual circulation in Whitianga Estuary is nearly in balance, with a low ebb tidal domination present. Particle tracking results suggest that sediment entrained and carried into and within the estuary will accumulate on the intertidal flats. Sediment transport modelling indicates that the impact of a proposed boat-ramp will result in sedimentation of the dredged approach channel due to reductions in residual and tidal velocities...|$|R

30|$|In {{the long}} term, {{continued}} disturbance of the savanna woody vegetation due {{to one or}} more of the influencing factors could result in change in woody vegetation cover. Historical imagery serves as a data source to enable the detection of this change. Historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> can supplement satellite imagery for this purpose, given that satellite imagery is only available since the early 1970 s, and high spatial resolution satellite images only since the late 1980 s. Historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> have the advantage of high spatial resolution, while satellite images are advantageous over <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> in that they enable synoptic coverage of large areas that would require multiple <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> to cover. A number of studies analysing change in woody cover on savannas have used historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> either as a photo only imagery time series (e.g. Hudak and Wessman 1998; Fensham and Fairfax 2003) or in combination with satellite images (e.g. Hudak and Wessman 2001).

40|$|SUMMARY: Otago has {{a wealth}} of engineering, goldmining and {{agricultural}} sites. <b>Aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> are essential to recognise and map sites and helpful in interpreting the meaning of patterns. The patterns may reflect a range of underlying variables such as the exploited resource, the facilities needed to exploit it, transport and social {{factors such as the}} supporting settlements, and also modern heritage management issues. <b>Aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> may also be used in illustrating and dramatising sites. Conventional wide-area aerial photographic coverage is useful but, for detail, custom-flown vertical aerials in medium format film and digital media are better. Historical <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> (which date back to about 1945) also have applications, especially where there has been substantial landscape change. On the upper Shotover River, historical processes depended on settlement enclosure and mining capital investment all of which can be investigated using <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs.</b> In addition, examples of <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> of a range of engineering subjects in Otago are shown...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the result}} of applied remote sensing  for {{geological}} study the mass wasting in Karangkobar, the district of Banjarnegara, Central Java. The study on the mass wasting use the remote sensing method, by interpreting the blackwhite panhromatic <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs,</b> on the scale 1 : 50, 000. The study is aimed at 1) revealing the capacity of the <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> in supporting the study the mass wasting that an be identified by the aerial photographs; 2) to find out the influence of the physical environment and land-use on the mass wasting processes. The study in performed by using the visual interpretation method of the scale 1 : 50, 000 black-white panchromati <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> taken in 1994, using mirror stereoscope. The outcome of the <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> interpretation is varis the quality of data and information. The data of interpretation of <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> and the varis outcome in the spot are further tested in terms of its accuracy, particularly in its reltion with the <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> interpretation. The technique of data analysis of the physical environment and the mass wasting is descriptive – comparative. The result of the study shows that the 1 : 50, 000 black-white panchromatic <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> can be used to identify and study both the mass wasting and influence of the physical environment on the mass wasting processes. The degree of identifying the mass wasting based on the <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> interpretation is 75 %.

40|$|As digital photogrammetric system developed, {{we became}} able to measure {{three-dimensional}} objects on a generic personal computer. And recently <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> is easily obtained, for example {{we can get}} <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> through internet at a low price in Japan. But three-dimensional measurement using by photogrammetry is not popular. One of this cause is that digital mapping system requires photogrammetric knowledge and experience for calculation of orientation parameters and construction of stereo pair models. So we developed a three-dimensional measurement system on network, Web Photogrammetry. This system consists of server and clients. <b>Aerial</b> <b>photographs,</b> these orientation parameters and three-dimensional feature data are stored on a server. Clients are connected with a server by a network and have stereoscopic display. When we access a server by WWW browser, {{we are able to}} browse <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> stereoscopically that are retrieved from server. Stereoscopic image are shown on WWW browser and measure three-dimensional objects over there. If three-dimensional feature data are stored on this server, these are shown stereoscopically over the <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs.</b> We can store measured data on a server and share these data with other users. It is important to implement this system that stereo image are shown on WWW browser so quickly. So stereo image is generated at a client and server delivers stereo par <b>aerial</b> <b>photographs</b> and these orientation parameters to clients. Then to realize enough response for measurement environment, clients communicate asynchronously with a server and parts of <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> image data are cached at a client. We believe that anyone having stereoscopic display and network can measure three-dimensional objects without photogrammetric knowledge and experiences by using this system. As a result three-dimensional spatial data will be used in more variously field. In addition we can deliver <b>aerial</b> <b>photograph</b> quickly by this system for photo interpretation, for example when disaster happened. 1...|$|R
