40|$|As the {{majority}} of licensed professional psychologists concentrate in urban areas and university settings, mental health service delivery to members of rural communities is inadequate and, in some areas, unavailable. Three primary difficulties with mental health service delivery in rural America include availability of, access to, and acceptance of psychological services. In addition, the practice of <b>rural</b> <b>psychology</b> places many unique demands on psychologists. Professional and personal isolation, ethical dilemmas associated with dual relationships, and problems with confidentiality, {{are some of the}} issues which challenge rural practitioners. This paper examines the current need for and difficulties with mental health service delivery in rural areas, and makes recommendations for recruitment, preparation and training of professional psychologists to work in rural communities...|$|E

It was found that both the development level and the county economy model affect the youths’ employment model and intention which in turn affects the economy development greatly. By taking Gongcheng Yao Autonomous county in Guangxi as an example, in comparison with Quanzhou county in Guangxi, the rural youth’s employment intentions {{as well as the}} influence were studied. The successful multicultural integration employment mode and the interaction mechanism between the rural youth employment and the county economy development provides a guide for county economy development.

Journal of <b>Rural</b> Community <b>Psychology,</b> E 13 (1). 2 Shamanic and Native American healers have utilized methods to produce altered {{states of consciousness}} in themselves and their patients for thousands of years. These methods include sonic driving, photic driving, and other means of changing consciousness. Recent research on non-drug methods to produce altered states has revealed that they probably work by changing the brainwaves of the subjects, so that they enter an alpha state and become more susceptible to suggestion. A reasonable conclusion is that since ancient times Native American healers have developed reliable methods to, in effect, hypnotize their patients so they {{are more susceptible to}} suggestions that will help them feel better. This puts Native American healing for psychological disorders on a continuum with modern psychotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{psychology}} {{has not had}} {{a strong}} presence in rural and remote regions of Australia. It is believed that the lack of rural experiences during training contributes to reluctance among graduates for working in rural areas. In mid- 2000, a clinical psychology intern program was established at Bendigo, within the Loddon Campaspe Southern Mallee region of Victoria. This paper examines the changes, challenges and supportive structures associated with the intern program since its initial evaluation in 2002. The program has continued to receive referrals and to be well-regarded by staff and interns. The program is also suggested to {{have played a role in}} contributing to a greater appreciation for clinical psychology within the inpatient setting and the employment of a part-time psychologist. Challenges identified include the difficulties for interns in providing single-session treatment, and the difficulties establishing quantitative research on inpatient outcomes. It is expected that this paper will be useful for other services that are considering introducing <b>rural</b> clinical <b>psychology</b> internships...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{dissertation}} is {{to indicate}} {{that a large number}} of problems in rural communities are the consequence of ineffective knowledge management, and that the effective management of knowledge could significantly improve the range and quality of services provided to community members. Knowledge is reviewed by examining the process of changing social facts into data, data into information and information into knowledge. Knowledge management is examined by reviewing the history of knowledge management as well as defining the term knowledge management. A generic model for knowledge management is developed that divides knowledge management into five basic processes namely; knowledge identification, knowledge mobilisation, knowledge generation/elaboration, knowledge application and knowledge evaluation. The model further describes the knowledge management ”enablers” that can either facilitate or debilitate the management of knowledge. Various practical suggestions are proposed that will facilitate the implementation of a knowledge management programme in a <b>rural</b> community. PsychologyMA (<b>PSYCHOLOGY...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to confirm and identify possible and intrinsic factors which may influence the academic achievement of senior secondary pupils in the rural Eastem Cape. The literature study indicates that factors such as parental involvement, motivation, the role of teachers and peers as well as learners' attribution of meaning, involvement, and experience have a direct influence on academic achievement. To confmn {{the influence of the}} above factors, the researcher conducted a structured interview with ten respondents, consisting of four pupils, their parents and two teachers. Questions to parents investigated their relationship with theii·children in terms of discipline, motivation as well as involvement in their education. Questions to pupils investigated their relationship with their parents, teachers, peers and self. Learners' level of self-actualization in terms of attribution of meaning, involvement, experience and self-concept was also examined. The research revealed that most of the parents are not adequately involved in their children s education, and the fmdings confirmed this as an extrinsic factor that influenced the learners achievement. The findings also indicated that teachers have somewhat lost sight of their role in promoting learners' potential, contributing to the high failure rate in the Eastern Cape rural schools. The fmdings further confirmed that the learners level of self­ actualization, in terms of attribution of meaning, involvement and experience influences academic achievement. Based on the findings, recommendations were made to improve the situation of education in the <b>rural</b> Eastern Cape. <b>Psychology</b> of EducationM. Ed. (Psychology of Education...|$|R
40|$|Students in resource-scarce environments {{navigate}} {{through a}} multitude of barriers (Richter, 2007). The pathways that individuals travel through towards positive adaptation are far from fixed (Ungar, 2005 a), but rather a continuous intersection of navigating through adversity and negotiating supports (Ungar, Brown, Liebenberg, et. al, 2008). Hence, resilience (adapting positively {{in the face of}} significant adversity) can be buoyed in a space where support is provided (Ebersöhn & Ferreira, 2011). Scant research warrants whether partnerships with rural schools contribute to fostering positive adaptation of students in relation to their pathways to resilience (measured by educational outcome variables). This study forms part of a larger running longitudinal project, namely: Flourishing Learning Youth (FLY; Ebersöhn & Maree, 2006); a <b>rural</b> school-Educational <b>Psychology</b> partnership which had its inception in 2006. The partnership involves numerous services, specifically career related support to grade nine students and guidance to educators. This retrospective case study (Yin, 2009; Zainal, 2007) utilised a concurrent mixed methods research design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007) within a pragmatic lens to study educational pathways to resilience. This was explored by means of qualitatively investigating partnerships, as well as quantitatively examining student access and academic performance (as indicators of educational resilience). The theoretical underpinnings rested on concepts from the Resiliency Wheel (Henderson & Milstein, 1996) through a transactionalecological understanding of resilience in learning. Data collection strategies consisted of: semi-structured interviews with two teacher-participants and retrospective document analysis of school records (performance schedules) for two grade nine cohorts. The cohorts were followed from grade 9 to grade 11. Data analysis techniques consisted of T-Tests and descriptive statistics on sampled documents for the quantitative strand. Through these statistical methods, it was anticipated that patterns in access and performance, could speak to partnerships influence as one factor in students pathways to resilience, or not. Concurrently, thematic analysis of interview transcripts was done for the qualitative strand. The triangulation of these methods assisted in creating a more comprehensive picture of the relationship between partnerships and the outcome variables used to gauge educational pathways to resilience. Results which emerged qualitatively allowed for answering questions surrounding the nature, processes and benefits of partnerships in a rural school, as well as risks and protective resources within and around the school. Quantitative results regarding outcome variables of access and performance highlighted the risks found qualitatively, to indicate that despite observable enabling partnership processes and benefits, students appear to find high academic challenging (in three measured school subjects). A better understanding on the various pathways to resilience of students in resourcescarce environments could assist with appropriate services and interventions that partners may wish to exchange.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between hope, self-esteem and positive and negative experiences among first year university students studying psychology at the University of Adelaide. Our research uses a mixed-methods approach, by combining responses to standardised measures of hope and self-esteem with open ended responses. The outcomes of the project included; 1) A {{better understanding of the}} challenges facing international and domestic students who have chosen to study psychology at the University of Adelaide, 2) identification of the key experiences that lead to positive and negative outcomes in this student cohort, and 3) strategies to inform university and school policy and practice in the care of international students and students from <b>rural</b> areas studying <b>psychology</b> at the University of Adelaide. A key aspect of effective adaptation to any stressful life event is the ability to maintain a sense of self worth throughout the process. In our study we focussed on the self esteem of first year students, comparing those who come from geographically and culturally diverse places to students associated with the more ‘traditional’ backgrounds. There is a substantial body of work looking at how academic self-esteem affects students’ ability to achieve grades. However, fewer studies have attempted to look at the link between factors thought to be fundamental to broader aspects of psychological well-being and experiences at university among students who are from geographically and culturally diverse places. The focus of our research moves beyond the traditional focus on the academic achievement, to overall levels of self-esteem and hope. Our research also focuses on students from rural backgrounds and those who are the first in their family to attend university. The results of our research suggest that students from non-traditional backgrounds (both international and domestic) face very specific barriers to achieving the best from their time at university and self-esteem may act as a buffer against more negative psychological outcomes such as depression. Some of the negative experiences reported by the students in our sample have been reported by international students attending other universities in Australia and include loneliness, isolation, racism, confusion regarding course expectations and adjustment difficulties. In sum, our research raises issues of duty of care for students’ psychological health and the need for better understanding support structures that allow students to achieve positive outcomes {{during the first year of}} their education. We discuss the implications of our research in the context of the increasing diversity of students attending university. [URL]...|$|R
