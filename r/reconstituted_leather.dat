5000|$|Bonded leather or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>leather</b> is an {{economical}} {{material that}} uses leftover organic leather (from tanneries or workshops) that are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or latex on to a fiber sheet. The varying degree of organic leather {{in the mix}} (10% to 90%) affects the smell and texture. Its reduced cost makes it popular for furniture upholstery, especially for commercial furniture that requires durabilityâ€”though durability can vary widely depending on the formulation.|$|E
5000|$|Bonded leather, {{also called}} <b>reconstituted</b> <b>leather</b> or blended leather, {{is a term}} used for a {{manufactured}} upholstery material which contains animal hide. It is made as a layered structure of a fiber or paper backer, a pulp made from shredded leather, and a polyurethane coating which is embossed with a leather-like texture. Related products, bicast leather or coated leather, are made by splitting, shaving, or grinding leather to reduce its thickness, and then laminating it.|$|E
5000|$|The actual leather {{content of}} bonded leather varies {{depending}} on the manufacturer and the quality level they are selling. In the home furnishings industry there is much debate and controversy over the ethics of using the term [...] "bonded leather" [...] to describe an upholstery product, which is actually a <b>reconstituted</b> <b>leather.</b> Opinion in the leather industry says that calling a product [...] "bonded leather" [...] is [...] "deceptive {{because it does not}} represent its true nature. It's a reconstituted hide, not an organically grown leather".|$|E
5000|$|The US Federal Trade Commission {{recommends}} {{according to}} 16 C.F.R. Section 24:"For example: An industry product {{made of a}} composition material consisting of 60% shredded leather fibers may be described as: Bonded Leather Containing 60% Leather Fibers and 40% Non-leather Substances." [...] The Federal Trade Commission has said that [...] "The guidelines caution against misrepresentations about the leather content in products containing ground, <b>reconstituted,</b> or bonded <b>leather,</b> and state that such products, when {{they appear to be}} made of leather, should be accompanied by a disclosure as to the percentage of leather or other fiber content. The guidelines also state that these disclosures should be included in any product advertising that might otherwise mislead consumers as to the composition of the product." ...|$|R
