Rather than discussing his own life, MalcolmX spoke about Elijah Muhammad, {{the leader of}} the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> the book was supposed to be about MalcolmX. After several meetings, Haley asked MalcolmX to tell him something about his mother. That question drew MalcolmX into recounting his life story.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of glacial {{activity}} is common, {{and it is}} one of the keys that allows geysers to exist. Glacier till deposits underlie the geyser basins providing storage areas for the water used in eruptions. Many landforms, such as Porcupine Hills north of Fountain Flats, are made up of glacial gravel and are <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> 70,000 to 14,000 years ago, this area was buried under ice.|$|E

25|$|Triggers are <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> may be {{explicit}} or implicit {{about the}} performance of a behavior. Examples of triggers can be alarms, text messages or advertisement, triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic. One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors. As an example if a person is trying to go to the gym everyday, but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person will head back home and pack. In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing, this will take considerably less effort. Although the original article does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model, some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories, e.g., the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Self-efficacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, January 29, {{the prosecution}} delivered a 40-minute closing argument. Blagojevich then delivered his 47-minute closing arguments in defense. Among Blagojevich's statement were continuing <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> {{he believed the}} process to be tainted {{because it did not}} allow him to call witnesses or challenge the evidence (although, as the Chicago Tribune reported two days earlier, the process did in fact allow the governor to call witnesses and challenge the evidence, but Blagojevich had done neither by the deadline). The prosecution then made a 12-minute rebuttal. Blagojevich did not remain in the Statehouse for the prosecution's rebuttal speech or the vote on his impeachment. After giving his closing statement, Blagojevich immediately left Springfield to return to his Chicago home aboard an official state aircraft. Had Blagojevich remained in Springfield for his impeachment, he would have been immediately ineligible to be transported on state aircraft as he would no longer be Governor—he would have been stranded in Springfield, responsible for his own transportation home.|$|E
25|$|It {{was evidently}} {{at the behest}} of this circle of friends that Byrd now {{embarked}} on a grandiose programme to provide a cycle of liturgical music covering all the principal feasts of the Catholic Church calendar. The first stage in this undertaking comprised the three Ordinary of the Mass cycles (in four, three and five parts), which were published by Thomas East between 1592 and 1595. The editions are undated (dates can be established only by close bibliographic analysis) do not name the printer and consist of only one bifolium per partbook to aid concealment, <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> the possession of heterodox books was still highly dangerous. All three works contain retrospective features harking back to the earlier Tudor tradition of Mass settings which had lapsed after 1558, along with others which reflect Continental influence and the liturgical practices of the foreign-trained incoming missionary priests. Mass for Four Voices, or the Four-Part Mass, which according to Joseph Kerman was probably the first to be composed, is partly modelled on John Taverner's Mean Mass, a highly regarded early Tudor setting which Byrd would probably have sung as a choirboy. Taverner's influence is particularly clear in the scale figures rising successively through a fifth, a sixth and a seventh in Byrd's setting of the Sanctus.|$|E

Tim de Lisle from Daily Mail acknowledged that while some parts are unoriginal, the song succeeds through its [...] "colossal simplicity". According to a critic from Entertainment Ireland, [...] "Caught in a Moment" [...] {{is one of three}} tracks from the album that displays the group's [...] "funky vocals and brattish attitude". A writer for Daily Record described it as a [...] "slow, thoughtful number" [...] with sophisticated sounds.

After seeming to be unaffected by the comments, O'Brien arrives at his dressing room and cheerfully prepares to hang himself.

2500|$|One of {{the themes}} in the story {{involves}} the tension between destiny and self-determination. According to Richard Gillmore, the main characters are torn between a sense of inevitability, [...] "that the world goes on its way {{and that it does}} not {{have much to do with}} human desires and concerns", and the notion that our futures are inextricably connected to our own past actions. Enda McCaffrey details a character who refuses to acknowledge his own agency, noting that Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) ignores repeated <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> he doesn't have to behave as he does and suggesting that by relegating the lives of Carla and the gas station clerk to a coin toss, he hands [...] "responsibility over to 'fate' in an act of bad faith that prevents him from taking responsibility for his own ethical choices." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arrival of the United States Railroad Administration in 1917 began {{a series}} of pointed <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> Monson Railroad's oil {{headlights}} and link-and-pin couplers no longer met federal safety standards. [...] The railroad kept the link-and-pin couplers for another quarter century of operations; but the oil headlights were removed when damaged by derailments. [...] The locomotives thereafter ran without any headlights. [...] Monson briefly considered a Davenport Locomotive Works 2-6-2 (similar to those being built for United States Army trench railways) before purchasing another Vulcan in 1918. [...] Hinkley locomotive #1 was retired when the second Vulcan locomotive was delivered. [...] Elimination of need for a source of spare Hinkley parts encouraged the innovative shop crew to strip old Hinkley #2 of all exterior fittings and attach a snowplow blade. [...] Although the new snowplow was less likely to ride up on snow drifts, it was more likely to derail; so the old wedge plow remained in service.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} that in late November 2012, Kat's lover would [...] "turn stalker", with Inside Soap saying that [...] "there {{is no way that}} the mystery man is letting her get away so easily [...] That's proved when he ups his game to get Kat to meet with him at their lovenest". An insider told the magazine that Kat's man is [...] "persistent, ruthless and utterly fixated on her. This could be a very dangerous game for Kat to play. Might the man who loves her completely destroy her life?" [...] It was also reported in November that Derek would be killed off from the series at Christmas, and it was speculated that he would be murdered. Alfie and Kat were both named as suspects, amongst many others, with Soaplife saying that if Derek is Kat's lover, he might turn violent if she continues to reject him and she might be forced to kill him, or Alfie might find out that Derek is Kat's lover and murder him in revenge, referring back to Richie's <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> Alfie had been in jail and would want to harm Kat's lover. In fact, Alfie quickly became the favourite with bookmakers William Hill.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, {{the decline}} of the British Empire and the {{economic}} hardships in Britain at the time forced the reduction in the size and capability of the Royal Navy. Navy planners expected to maintain unrealistically high force levels, and were eventually constrained to be a [...] "medium power", relying on the Americans to be the primary defence against Soviet threats. The increasingly powerful U.S. Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as a means of keeping peace around the world. Although the late 1940s were generally quiet, the mining of the Saumarez and Volage off Albania in 1946, attempts to control illegal immigration to Palestine in 1947, and the Yangtse Incident of 1949 were <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> the world was not entirely at peace. A half-dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier, were routinely on station throughout the Korean War. The naval blockade was a main driving factor in the armistice. The Navy also landed troops during the Suez crisis of 1956. However, the threat of the Soviet Union and British commitments throughout the world created a new role for the Navy. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the Royal Navy contributed ships to the Standing Naval Force Atlantic. Its role became primarily one of anti-submarine and mine-countermeasures fleets, though it continued to maintain a diesel-electric submarine force. It also continued its [...] "East of Suez" [...] presence though the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 reduced this role.|$|E
