5|$|<b>Ratites</b> run, and {{penguins}} {{swim and}} waddle: {{but the majority}} of birds are rather small, and can fly. Some birds use their ability to fly to complete epic globe-crossing migrations, while others such as frigate birds fly over the oceans for months on end.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} <b>ratites,</b> emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.|$|E
5|$|The {{tinamous}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family, Tinamidae, within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the <b>ratites</b> (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis.|$|E
50|$|Other {{scientists}} are less convinced that Palaeotis is a struthioniform, placing it instead {{as a more}} basal <b>ratite.</b> It {{may be related to}} the mysterious Remiornis, a putative <b>ratite</b> known from the Eocene of France. Various other <b>ratite</b> remains also occur in the European Paleogene and early Miocene, and these may represent various independent linages, leading to further confusion.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} years a growing demand for <b>ratite</b> meat, {{including}} ostrich, emu, and rhea has been observed in the world. <b>Ratite</b> meat is recognised as a dietetic product because of low level of fat, high share of PUFA, favourable n 6 /n 3 ratio, and higher amounts of iron content in comparison with beef and chicken meat. The abundance of bioactive compounds, e. g. PUFA, makes <b>ratite</b> meat highly susceptible to oxidation processes. Moreover, pH over 6 creates favourable environment for fast microbial growth during storage conditions affecting its shelf life. However, availability of information on <b>ratite</b> meat shelf life among consumers and industry is still limited. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present review is to provide current information about the effect of <b>ratite</b> meat packaging type, i. e. air packaging, vacuum packaging with skin pack, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on its shelf life quality during storage, including technological and nutritional properties...|$|R

5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the <b>ratites</b> due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a relationship to the Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities have historically been suggested for the dodo, including {{that it was a}} small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E
5|$|This large kiwi {{is one of}} five {{species of}} kiwis {{residing}} in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). Great spotted kiwis are related most closely to the little spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand, 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea, and cassowary. All <b>ratites</b> are flightless. Kiwi are closely related to the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted kiwi, great grey kiwi, or roroa (Apteryx haastii) is {{a species}} of kiwi endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. The great spotted kiwi, {{as a member of}} the <b>ratites,</b> is flightless. It is the largest of the kiwi. The rugged {{topography}} and harsh climate of the high altitude, alpine, part of its habitat render it inhospitable to a number of introduced mammalian predators, which include dogs, ferrets, cats and stoats. Because of this, populations of this species have been less seriously affected by the predations of these invasive species compared to other kiwi. Nonetheless, there has been a 43% decline in population in the past 45 years, due to these predators and habitat destruction. This has led it to be classified as vulnerable. There are less than 16,000great spotted kiwis in total, almost all in the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson, the northwest coast, and the Southern Alps. A minority live on island reserves.|$|E
40|$|Author version made {{available}} {{in accordance with}} Publisher copyright policy. The evolution of the <b>ratite</b> birds has been widely attributed to vicariant speciation, driven by the Cretaceous breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madagascan elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest <b>ratite</b> lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant birds and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these birds are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal <b>ratite</b> lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted dispersal in all major <b>ratite</b> lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs...|$|R
40|$|Two {{groups of}} flightless <b>ratite</b> birds existed in New Zealand during the Pleistocene: the kiwis and the moas. The latter are now extinct but {{formerly}} included 11 species. We have enzymatically amplified and sequenced approximately 400 base pairs of the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene from bones and soft tissue remains of four species of moas {{as well as}} eight other species of <b>ratite</b> birds and a tinamou. Contrary to expectation, the phylogenetic analysis shows that the kiwis are {{more closely related to}} Australian and African ratities than to the moas.

5|$|A {{study by}} Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel {{published}} in 2003 {{also found that}} the tyrannosaurid arctometatarsals and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a 'tensile keystone model' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus, increase the animal's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families; while still allowing resiliency that is otherwise reduced in <b>ratites,</b> horses, giraffids and other animals with metapodia to a single element. The study also pointed out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more elastic strain energy, which could have improved locomotor efficiency and decrease the strain energy transferred to the bones. The study suggested that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well. Hence, the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals, then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs. The scientists found that arctometatarsals may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration, lateral acceleration and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods. It is also stated in their study that this may imply, though not demonstrate, that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus.|$|E
5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to <b>ratites</b> such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E
25|$|Of Gondwanan origin, {{tinamous}} {{are members}} of the <b>ratites,</b> which comprise the Palaeognathae ("old jaws"), while all other living birds {{are members of}} Neognathae ("new jaws"). Unlike other palaeognaths, tinamous do have a keeled sternum, but like the other palaeognaths, they have a distinctive palate. It was formerly believed that the Tinamiformes separated from the <b>ratites</b> early on due to their retention of a keeled sternum. The tinamous' possession of powder-down feathers and preen glands, which the <b>ratites</b> lack, was a source of confusion in determining their taxonomy.|$|E

They were the dominant herbivores in New Zealand's forest, shrubland and subalpine ecosystems for thousands of years, and until the arrival of the Māori were hunted only by the Haast's eagle. Moa extinction occurred around 1300 CE - 1440 CE ± 20 years, primarily due to overhunting by Māori.|$|E

25|$|These mistaken {{assignments}} of alvarezsaurids to {{birds were}} caused primarily by {{features that are}} strikingly, or even uniquely, avian. The sternum, for example, is elongated and deeply keeled for an enlarged pectoralis muscle, {{as it is in}} neognathous birds and volant <b>ratites.</b> One bone in the skull of Shuvuuia appeared to be an ectethmoid fused to a prefrontal. The ectethmoid is an ossification known only in Neornithes. Other birdlike characters included the palatine, foramen magnum, cervical and caudal vertebrae, and many others.|$|E
25|$|Contour {{feathers}} are not uniformly distributed on {{the skin}} of the bird except in some groups such as the penguins, <b>ratites</b> and screamers. In most birds the feathers grow from specific tracts of skin called pterylae; between the pterylae there are regions which are free of feathers called apterylae (or apteria). Filoplumes and down may arise from the apterylae. The arrangement of these feather tracts, pterylosis or pterylography, varies across bird families and has been used in the past as a means for determining the evolutionary relationships of bird families.|$|E
25|$|Many {{very large}} birds, such as <b>ratites,</b> {{flamingos}} {{and the largest}} swans, are extremely difficult to band because the cost of making a band which is capable of securely fitting their strong, heavy legs is prohibitive. At the other extreme, the smaller species of river and tree kingfishers, todies and certain lories, have such narrow tarsii that no band can be securely placed around it without imposing danger to blood circulation. With some gamebirds, such as the Indian Peafowl, spurs on the legs interfere with the bands, which thus can cause injury to the birds.|$|E
