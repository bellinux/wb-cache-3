5|$|The {{recovery}} of the eastern areas of the Roman Empire from the Persians once again raised the problem of religious unity centering on {{the understanding of the}} true nature of Christ. Most of the inhabitants of these provinces were Monophysites who rejected the Council of Chalcedon. Heraclius tried to promote a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism but this philosophy was rejected as heretical by both sides of the dispute. For this reason, Heraclius was viewed as a heretic and bad ruler by some later religious writers. After the Monophysite provinces were finally lost to the Muslims, Monotheletism rather lost its <b>raison</b> <b>d'être</b> and was eventually abandoned.|$|E

Shiva is often {{described}} as wandering the universe as a homeless beggar-ascetic with his consort Parvati's <b>raison</b> <b>d'être</b> being to bring him back to his marital and home life. Shiva is also depicted as asking for alms from the goddess Annapurna, a form of Parvati as the goddess of food. The Satarudriya describes Shiva as gathering food through begging, evocative of his Bhikshatana form. In spite of this he is described as a sustainer of the universe and of life-sustaining food.|$|E

In 2011, Iraq ordered 18 F-16IQ (Block 52) for $3 billion, an average cost of $165 million per unit. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates ordered 30 F-16s Block 60 aircraft with the average cost of $200 million. In 2017, Romania purchased 12 refurbished used F-16A/Bs from Portugal for a total of €628 million, roughly $680 million, an average cost of $56 million. This cost led the Polish deputy minister for national defence Bartosz Kownacki to counsel against buying used F-16s, saying that buying a new F-35 would be better value. In March 2017, the US government released plans to sell 19 new F-16s with 23 engines, radars, and armament to Bahrain for total cost of $4.867 billion.|$|E

In several cases these tests were not only applied to clinical diagnostics, but also in studies that provided important insights into the function of the endocrine system, the regulation of foetal growth, unusual features of endocrine regulation in pregnancy and, most recently, to the detection and characterization of novel infectious disease agents and the diagnosis and therapy of leukaemia...|$|R

This paper puts the concept of method in the context of related concepts and proposes a multi-level model of the elements of a method to argue that a contribution on each of these levels can be of value and that the introduction of methods can fail on each of these levels. Implications thereof for industry and academia are discussed, concluding that a clear description of methods and their intended use is important for enabling proper validation of each of the method’s elements and for communicating methods to academia and industry...|$|R

The first draft of this reflection was originally written by Bowman in response to certain reactions to his academic interest in martial arts (hence the occasional use of the pronoun ‘I’, rather than ‘we’), but Judkins proposed that the piece form part of this issue’s editorial, because of the importance of thinking about what this ‘martial arts studies’ thing is that we are doing, what the point of it may be, and whether or not it may be trivial...|$|R

However, available historical data does not support the argument that Greece was saved from communism by U. S. aid and assistance. In fact, current information indicates that the <b>raisons</b> <b>d'etre</b> for this policy were based on misperceptions and the lack of accurate information. Grave doubts about the efficacy of the Truman Doctrine have also been cast by the continued spread of communism beginning with the communist victory in China in 1949 and the Korean War in 1950.

40|$|In Introduction, I {{explain the}} meaning I {{give to the}} {{qualifier}} term "robust" and justify my preference for the expression robustness concern rather than robustness analysis, which I feel {{is likely to be}} interpreted too narrowly. In Section 2, I discuss this concern in more details and I try to clarify the numerous <b>raisons</b> <b>d'être</b> of this concern. As a means of examining the multiple facets of robustness concern more comprehensively, I explore the existing research about robustness, attempting to highlight what I see as the three different territories covered by these studies (Section 3). In Section 4, I refer to these territories to illustrate how responses to robustness concern could be even more varied than they currently are. In this perspective, I propose in Section 5 three new measures of robustness. In the last section, I identify several aspects of the problem that should be examined more closely because they could lead to new avenues of research, which could in turn yield new and innovative responses.

40|$|Changing {{political}} norms {{mean that}} the governing {{role of the state}} now involves interaction at both supra-national and sub-national levels and with an ever-increasing array of actors. In recent years the interaction of state and society is frequently analysed in terms of governance (John 2001, Hambelton et. al. 2003, Sørensen 2006). The governance approach has led to institutional and processual change affecting, for example, the provision and redistributional roles of the state as well as the making and implementation of policies. Governance is perceived as a useful frame of analysis because it accommodates the multiplicity of issues, interests, agencies and modes of policy-making and regulation involved in governing complex polities. The governance approach has also increased the salience of the local and regional levels since they are frequently the site of intersection between the horizontal and vertical networks involved in governance (Quinn, 2007). Yet, there is debate about the classification and functions of regions and the nature and purpose of regional development. The term "region " has been variously used to describe historical, cultural, economic or political entities, thus posing problems of nomenclature, not only for academic theorists but for economists, politicians and citizens.
