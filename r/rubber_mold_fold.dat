50|$|Spin casting, {{also known}} as {{centrifugal}} <b>rubber</b> <b>mold</b> casting (CRMC), is a method of utilizing centrifugal force to produce castings from a <b>rubber</b> <b>mold.</b> Typically, a disc-shaped mold is spun along its central axis at a set speed.

40|$|Purpose: Conventional {{investment}} casting of turbine blades {{is a time}} consuming and expensive process due to the complications in wax injection steps and the complex shape of airfoil surfaces. By using rapid {{investment casting}}, a substantial improvement in the gas turbine blade manufacturing process can be expected. However, this process {{needs to be able}} to compete with conventional investment casting from a dimensional accuracy view of point. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the manufacture of gas turbine blades via two indirect rapid tooling (RT) technologies, namely epoxy (EP) resin tooling and silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>molding.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The second stage blade of a Ruston TA 1750 gas turbine (rated at 1. 3 MW) was digitized by a coordinate measuring machine. The aluminum-filled EP resin and silicon <b>rubber</b> <b>molds</b> were fabricated using StereoLithography master models. Several wax patterns were made by injection in the EP resin and silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molds.</b> These wax patterns were utilized for ceramic shell fabrication and blade casting. Findings: Dimensional inspection of cast blades showed that silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>molding</b> was not a suitable approach for production of blade wax patterns. The maximum deviation for the final cast blade made using the silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>mold</b> was þ 0. 402 mm. The maximum deviation for the final cast blade made using the EP resin mold was lower at 20. 282 mm. This showed that EP resin tooling could enable new cost-effective solutions for small batch production of gas turbine blades. Practical implications: The research results presented will give efficient industrial approach and scientific insight of the gas turbine blade manufacturing by use of rapid technologies. Originality/value: There are some general research works related to utilization of rapid technologies for manufacturing of gas turbine blade. However, this paper presents a unique procedure of integrated reverse engineering and RT technologies for rapid investment casting of gas turbine blade through presenting comprehensive comparison between two techniques from dimensional accuracy view of point...|$|R
