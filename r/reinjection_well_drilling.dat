40|$|The end of 2001, about 196 {{production}} <b>wells,</b> (including 12 <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells)</b> {{had been}} <b>drilled</b> in Tianjin. The annual production rate was 22 Mm 3 in 2001 and the reinjection rate was about 1. 66 Mm 3. The depth {{to the water}} level ranges from 22 to 70 m and the draw-down rate is 6 - 9 m/year. The effect of reinjection in the WR 45 doublet is analysed, but no temperature changes have been observed in surrounding geothermal production wells, up to the present. The main side effect anticipated from reinjection is a cooling of the reservoir. Tracer tests are very important for understanding the mode of transport and flow-channel/fracture-space characteristics in doublet production/reinjection systems, and to estimate the possible cooling resulting from injection...|$|R

30|$|Since {{the first}} {{geothermal}} <b>well</b> <b>drilled</b> in 1993, over 40 geothermal <b>wells</b> have been <b>drilled</b> in the region, with a depth ranging from 1, 464 to 4, 080  m. The recorded reservoir temperatures are between 55 °C to 120 °C. New geothermal boreholes drilled {{in the past}} few years reached greater depths and are mostly at 3, 000  m or beyond, and directional drilling techniques have also been applied in the region. Similar to Xiongxian (Section 3.3), geothermal fluid produced from the reservoir is utilized for space heating in the urban area of Xianyang. These wells only operate every year from November 15 th to March 15 th the following year. In Xianyang, reinjection into sandstone formation is performed at an experimental scale, being aware of the risk of clogging the reservoir formation, or the <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> itself (Ungemach [2003]; Erlingsson et al. [2010]). Several <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells</b> have been constructed and tracer tests are being carried out to obtain more information of the reservoir formation. Large-scale reinjection is planned for the near future.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the lack}} of PS-InSAR {{measurements}} south of the geothermal power plant owing to the poor coherence of the signal over time, {{we can assume that}} the surface deformation has a circular pattern around the geothermal power plant. The levelling data show that the maximum displacement is {{on the east side of}} the power plant in the drift direction of the <b>reinjection</b> <b>well.</b> This observation is consistent with the origin of the deformation located around the <b>reinjection</b> <b>well</b> and is related to a leakage in the well. The modelling with the Mogi model and the Yang model suggests that this leakage occurs at a depth around 450  m, which is consistent with the existence of a non-cemented zone in the <b>reinjection</b> geothermal <b>well.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{determining}} {{the behavior of}} thermal water brought to surface and how this might impact <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells</b> and the rock during reinjection. The biggest problem is that <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells</b> are predisposed to choking. We searched for a method to examine this process, including a model for physico-chemical changes in the water—rock interaction. Two different samples of powdered rock (designated α and β) were analyzed using thermal water samples from production and <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells.</b> The pH shows {{significant differences between the}} samples from wells where free water treatment was carried out, and those from the aerated thermal waters, {{as well as for the}} rock sample. Basically, a decrease in sediment volume can be obtained by increasing the pH. The salt effect was more coherent. Its result was an interesting case of W-shaped graphs from the producing well. On the other hand there is virtually no difference between the samples with acid titration...|$|R
40|$|The Ogiri {{geothermal}} system is characterized {{with the presence}} of steam-water two-phase zone and the fractured zone along Ginyu Fault which is the main target. For representing these characters, a numerical reservoir model has been developed. In the present study, we applied the MINC method to the grid blocks corresponding to the production zone of numerical model and carried out the history matching simulation with the model by using the code TOUGH 2 (Pruess et al, 1999). 1. INTORODUCTION The Ogiri geothermal power plant located in the West Kirishima area was opened in early 1996. Nittetsu Kagoshima Geothermal Co. (NKGC) supplies the geothermal steam to the power plant with installed capacity of 30 MWe that has been operated by the Kyushu Electric Power Co. In the exploitation stage in the West Kirishima area, 50 exploratory <b>wells</b> were <b>drilled</b> (Goko, 2000) and 10 production <b>wells</b> and 7 <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells</b> were completed when the power plant started its operation (Japan Geothermal Energy Association, 2000). At present, the numbers of production and <b>reinjection</b> <b>wells</b> are 14 and 9, respectively.
