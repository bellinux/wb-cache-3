5|$|HMS <b>Resistance</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} capital {{ship in the}} Royal Navy to be fitted with a ram and was given the {{nickname}} of Old Rammo.

The ship was reassigned to the Channel Fleet in 1873 before reverting to her former duties in 1877. <b>Resistance</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned in 1880 and was used for gunnery and torpedo trials beginning in 1885. The ship was sold for scrap in 1898 and foundered the following year en route to the breaker's yard. Her wreck was salvaged and later scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Godoy's {{attempt to}} subdue the Maya around Champoton was {{unsuccessful}} {{and the local}} Kowoj Maya resisted his attempts to assert Spanish dominance of the region. This <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> sufficiently tenacious that Montejo the Younger sent his cousin from Tabasco to Champoton to take command. His diplomatic overtures to the Champoton Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule. Champoton was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucatán Peninsula; it was increasingly isolated and the situation there became difficult.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtatán (then {{known by}} the name of Ystapalapán) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle, a {{companion}} of Pedro de Alvarado, together with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction (reducción in Spanish) of San Mateo Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place at San Pedro Soloma, San Juan Ixcoy and San Miguel Acatán by 1560. Q'anjob'al <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests from the Spanish reducciones. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, resistance that was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch'ol to the north. The continued <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> so determined that the Chuj remained pacified only while the immediate effects of the Spanish expeditions lasted.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> stubborn, and Montejo did not {{complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although the conquest {{of the west and}} centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E

In a letter to Lieutenant-General Pire, commander of the , General Eisenhower praised {{the role that the}} Belgian resistance had played in disrupting German supply lines after D-Day. The continuing actions of the resistance stopped the Germans ever being able to use the country as a secure base, never fully becoming pacified.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> to topple Somerset as Lord Protector, so that in 1549 it was feared by some that the Reformation would cease.

5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks.

He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} for the assassination of Robert Holzinger, {{the head of the}} deportation program, in 1942. Holzinger, an active collaborator, was an Austrian Jew selected by the Germans for the role. The assassination led to a change in leadership of the AJB. Five Jewish leaders, including the head of the AJB, were arrested and interned in Breendonk, but were released after public outcry. A sixth was deported directly to Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander {{immediately}} headed south. While {{the other}} cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight.

50|$|Both {{electro-mechanical}} {{and digital}} potentiometers generally have poor tolerances (typically ±20%), poor temperature coefficients (many hundreds of ppm per degree C), and a stop <b>resistance</b> that <b>is</b> typically about 0.5-1% {{of the full}} scale resistance.

5|$|About 154 BC, a major revolt was re-ignited in Numantia, {{which is}} known as the First Numantine War, and a long war of <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> fought between the {{advancing}} forces of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania. The praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba and the proconsul Lucius Licinius Lucullus arrived in 151 BC and began the process of subduing the local population. In 150 BC, Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed, ingloriously ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|According to German {{assessments}} of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets, although recent research suggests a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast {{in a press conference}} the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never had to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future Lebensraum in the east.|$|E

In October2006, Eli Lilly announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $2.1billion, or $32 a share. After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders as well as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) suggesting the deal should be rejected, Lilly increased its offer to $2.3billion or $34 per share, a 6% increase. Again, <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> voiced by some large shareholders, and ISS advised shareholders against accepting the new offer, which it still deemed insufficient.

5|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with {{the surrender of}} Marengo, Captain Bruilhac surrendered Belle Poule, the damage inflicted by Amazon {{and the presence of}} Warren's squadron persuading him that further <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> hopeless. French losses in the engagement were severe, Marengo suffering extensive damage to her hull and rigging and losing 63 men killed and 83 wounded from a crew of 740. The latter included both Linois and his son with serious wounds and Captain Vrignaud, who had to have his right arm amputated. Losses on Belle Poule included six killed and 24 wounded from her complement of 330. British losses were comparatively light, London suffering ten dead and 22 wounded and Amazon four killed and five wounded. London was the only British ship damaged, mainly in her rigging, which was hastily repaired {{in the aftermath of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further <b>resistance</b> <b>was</b> hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
