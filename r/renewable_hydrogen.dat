A hydrogen plant was designed, and the economics of the system were evaluated by simulating the introduction of the system in the Dakotas region of the United States in both a regulated and a deregulated electricity market. The analysis shows that the system is economically competitive for a high price of natural gas ($ 12 - 13 MMBtu) and a capital cost reduction (33 %) of wind turbines. The hydrogen production is sufficient to supply the current demand of the Great Lakes refineries. With today's electricity prices, a competitive production cost of $ 1. 5 /kg hydrogen is achievable. The analysis indicates large economic incentives to develop HTE systems that operate efficiently in reverse as fuel cells to displace the gas turbines that operate only a few hundred hours per year and thus have high capital cost charges. The capital cost of the HTE system has a significant impact on system economics, with large incentives to develop reversible HTE/ FC systems to reduce those costs. Such a system would expand the use of nuclear beyond electricity generation, and allows a larger penetration of renewables by providing an energy storage media and bringing flexibility to the grid operators.

40|$|Generally, wind {{to power}} {{conversion}} is calculated by assuming {{the quality of}} wind as measured with a Weibull probability distribution at wind speed during power generation. We build on this method by modifying the Weibull distributions to reflect the actual range of wind speeds and wind energy density. This was combined with log law that modifies wind speed based on the height from the ground, to derive the wind power potential at windy sites. The study also provides the Levelized cost of renewable energy and hydrogen conversion capacity at the proposed sites. We have also electrolyzed the wind-generated electricity to measure the production capacity of <b>renewable</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> We found that all the sites considered are commercially viable for hydrogen production from wind-generated electricity. Wind generated electricity cost varies from $ 0. 0844 to $ 0. 0864 kW h, and the supply cost of <b>renewable</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is $ 5. 30 to $ 5. 80 /kg-H 2.
