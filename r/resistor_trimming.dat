There are being originated continually increasing power densities by minimizing sizes. Thick Film Technology is including good chances to solve problems which are compounded with this development. Before known microwave devices (Al_ 2 O_ 3 ceramics) are not suitable to solve these problems because of not sufficient heat conductivity of Al_ 2 O_ 3. So it is aimed in this project to rule these increasing power densities by using ceramics with distinct higher heat conductivity (Aluminium nitride ceramics) and also by developing new special thick film inks. By development of special technologies (printing, firing and <b>resistor</b> <b>trimming</b> of inks) it is possible to benefit these better characteristics of the new material. As a result of this technological development microwave devices were realized (attenuators and power terminations) which have very good microwave characteristics (attenuation and reflexion factor) up to high frequencies (10 GHz).

It is shown that pulse current trimming techniques {{can be used to}} <b>trim</b> the poly-SiGe <b>resistors</b> by up to 50 % from their orig-inal values with accuracy better than 0. 5 %. The temperature co-efficient of resistance (TCR) is shown to be linearly proportional to the percent change in electrically trimmed poly-SiGe resistance. Fi-nally, we demonstrate resistance cycling using an electrical trim/re-covery sequence, indicating that the technique is reversible and is governed by dopant segregation/diffusion mechanisms. The results are consistent with those obtained on conventional polysilicon re-sistors suggesting that the introduction of a strained SiGe layer does not adversely affect the electrical trim properties of these re-sistors.

40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) had stringent requirements that made the thermal design unique. To meet instrument stability requirements the system had to be designed to keep temperatures of all components within acceptable limits without heater cycling. Although the spacecraft remains at a fixed 22 sun angle at L 2, the variations in solar constant, property degradation, and bus voltage range all significantly affect the temperature. Large portions of the fuel lines are external to the structure and all components are mounted to non-conductive composite structure. These two facts made the sensitivity to the MLI effective emissivity and bus temperature very high. Approximately two years prior to launch the {{propulsion system}} was redesigned to meet MAP requirements. The new design utilized hardware that was already installed {{in order to meet}} schedule constraints.

40|$|Abstract – The {{successful}} use of embedded resistors in {{many applications}} will {{require that the}} fabricated <b>resistors</b> be <b>trimmed</b> prior to lamination into printed circuit boards to attain required design tolerances. Depending on the application, the economic value of the board being fabricated, and the process used to create the embedded resistors, {{it may also be}} prudent to consider reworking resistors that are incorrectly trimmed or with initial values that are too large (un-trimmable resistors). This paper uses a model of the resistor/board yield coupled with a cost model of the trim and rework processes to identify conditions under which applications should neither trim nor rework, trim but not rework, or perform both trimming and rework of embedded resistors, {{as a function of the}} design tolerance for the resistors and the accuracy with which the embedded resistors can be formed. Example results are presented for several applications ranging from small boards with a high density of embedded resistors to large boards with a low density of embedded resistors. Distinct regions of trimming and rework applicability that are nearly application independent can be identified as a function of design tolerance, printing/plating/etching variation, and the characteristics of the trimming process.

The memory of known words was a bank of 20 screwdriver-adjustable <b>trimmer</b> <b>resistors.</b> (Mims later referred to this as [...] "Screwdriver-Programmable Read Only Memory", SPROM.)

40|$|Techniques for {{interconnecting}} {{balanced and}} unbalanced equipment in audio systems {{seems to be}} a murky topic for many users, technicians, and system designers. It is the subject of numerous calls to our applications engineers. Confusion, and even controversy, is further fueled by some published "guides " whose engineering basis is dubious, at best. This paper briefly explains the hardware, some underlying engineering theory, and includes wiring diagrams for interfaces that solve many typical system problems. A BALANCED input or output uses two signal conductors which have equal impedances to ground. Balanced inputs and outputs are widely used in professional equipment because the input differential amplifier can, in theory at least, totally null its response to ground noise which exists equally on both signal lines. Examples of typical circuits are shown below. 1 - "UNBALANCED " and "BALANCED" What do these terms really mean? Since I have previously written about the subject of balanced lines in some detail, I will just summarize the most important points here. Balance is defined in terms of the impedances of the two signal conductors with respect to a reference, which is usually "ground". An UNBALANCED input or output connects one of its signal conductors to ground and has a non-zero impedance at the other signal conductor. Unbalanced inputs and outputs are very popular in consumer electronics, electronic musical instruments, and low cost (often called "semi-pro") audio equipment. Examples of typical circuits are shown below. Typical Balanced Input Because of its low cost and small size, this "active balanced" differential input circuit (or some variation of it) is very widely used. The pairs of 10 kS <b>resistors</b> are <b>trimmed</b> to match within 0. 01 % in order to null response to ground noise. When used in real-world systems, however, a major drawback of this circuit is its exquisite sensitivity to unbalances in the output (source) impedances of the line driver. This seriously compromises ground noise rejection or CMRR (Common-Mode Rejection Ratio) of the system. Typical Unbalanced Input Usual values for R L are 10 kS to 100 kS, regardless of the equipment type. It is R L that effectively determines the input impedance of the circuit...|$|R
