50|$|The 'traditional' system {{generally}} comprises {{a master}} console (teacher position) which is electrically {{connected to a}} number of <b>rows</b> of student <b>booths</b> (US: carrels), typically containing a student tape recorder and headset with a boom arm microphone.|$|R
60|$|Here it {{was that}} Mirrab the witch and her {{attendant}} wizard were most freely discussed--with bated breath, and with furtive glances cast hurriedly at the black flag, which was just visible above the <b>row</b> of other <b>booths</b> and gayer attractions of the Fair.|$|R
50|$|<b>Booth</b> <b>rows</b> for the Melbourne University Boat Club. On six {{consecutive}} occasions from 2011 to 2016 Booth {{was seated in}} the Victorian Men's VIII who contested the King's Cup at the Australian Rowing Championships. In those crews he saw two King's Cup victories in 2015 & 2016 (both with Booth at stroke) and three second places.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} that New York City’s {{economic}} crisis hit in the 1970s, Veselka was a fixture in the neighborhood. It was able to expand during the economic recovery of the 1980s, at which time the <b>row</b> of phone <b>booths</b> {{at the rear of}} the restaurant came to be used as informal office space for East Village performance artists.|$|R
60|$|So they jogged on {{together}} until passing Saint Catherine's shrine {{they crossed the}} winding Wey once more, and so found themselves in the steep high street with its heavy-caved gabled houses, its monkish hospitium upon the left, where good ale may still be quaffed, and its great square-keeped castle upon the right, no gray and grim skeleton of ruin, but very quick and alert, with blazoned banner flying free, and steel caps twinkling from the battlement. A <b>row</b> of <b>booths</b> extended from the castle gate to the high street, and two doors from the Church of the Trinity was that of Thorold the goldsmith, a rich burgess and Mayor of the town.|$|R
50|$|But, on 11 April 1908, {{there was}} a fire, {{destroying}} the theatre interior, and new structure was built on its former site. Before its destruction, the theatre had a markedly horseshoe-shaped plan. Its rounded ceiling, was painted by Joaquim Rafael and in 1856 it had received a new painting by Paulo Pizzi. The building included four <b>rows</b> of <b>booths,</b> with the booth for the royal family located centrally on the second floor. The large atrium, and the corridors large supported by access from large staircases. Along the second floor {{there was a}} magnificent concert hall. Generally, the theatre had excellent acoustics. The stage wall was painted by Sequeira, but was later replaced in 1825 by paintings contracted to the Spaniard João Rodrigues, and later, Palucci. Until 1838, the theatre was lit by tallow candles, and later by similar candles lit by oil oil.|$|R
50|$|According to {{historian}} David Leighton, of the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, {{the first}} Pima County Fair was held from October 25-28, 1911. The Tucson Chamber of Commerce and the Pima County Fair Commission chose the Elysian Grove amusement park (located about where Carrillo School, {{south of the}} Tucson Convention Center is now at) as the location for the first fair. Elysian Grove consisted of two parts, the fields which were in theopen and the pavilion which had a roof over it. The pavilion held three <b>rows</b> of <b>booths</b> that where rented by local Tucson businesses and also held displays of various items, as well as contests. During the four-day event there {{was a high school}} football game between Tucson High School and Phoenix High School, numerous animal exhibitions such as a stock show, dog show and poultry show as well as many displays put on by local educational institutions.|$|R
60|$|This great street reaches {{from the}} road, which as I said goes from Cambridge to Newmarket, turning short {{out of it}} to the right towards the river, and holds in a line near half a mile quite down to the river-side: in another street {{parallel}} with the road are like <b>rows</b> of <b>booths,</b> but larger, and more intermingled with wholesale dealers; and one side, passing out of this last street to the left hand, is a formal great square, formed by the largest booths, built in that form, and which they call the Duddery; whence the name is derived, and what its signification is, I could never yet learn, though I made all possible search into it. The area of this square is about 80 to 100 yards, where the dealers have room before every booth to take down, and open their packs, and to bring in waggons to load and unload.|$|R
50|$|According to Apple, Leopard {{contains}} over 300 {{changes and}} enhancements over its predecessor, Mac OS X Tiger, covering core operating system components {{as well as}} included applications and developer tools. Leopard introduces a significantly revised desktop, with a redesigned Dock, Stacks, a semitransparent menu bar, and an updated Finder that incorporates the Cover Flow visual navigation interface first seen in iTunes. Other notable features include support for writing 64-bit graphical user interface applications, an automated backup utility called Time Machine, support for Spotlight searches across multiple machines, and the inclusion of Front <b>Row</b> and Photo <b>Booth,</b> which were previously included with only some Mac models.|$|R
50|$|The annual Berryessa Art & Wine {{festival is}} one of the most well known local events in the area and has been a yearly {{tradition}} for over 30 years. The current festival, typically held in May, includes 120-150 artist booths, 14 food booths (all run by non-profit groups from the Berryessa area), a Community <b>Row</b> area with <b>booths</b> from a variety of service groups and non-profits offering information to the festival goers, a Business Row with representatives from the Berryessa community and other local San Jose Businesses, a stage area with entertainment by local amateur entertainers as well as professional entertainment and booths from several local radio stations. The festival is held on the grounds of Penitencia Creek Park.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{a mobile}} home, the {{original}} style diner is narrow and elongated and allows roadway or railway transportation to the restaurant's site. In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area {{against the back}} wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a <b>row</b> of <b>booths</b> against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s - 1940s feature Art Deco or Streamline Moderne elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars). They featured porcelain enamel exteriors, some with the name written on the front, others with bands of enamel, others in flutes. Many had a [...] "barrel vault" [...] roofline. Tile floors were common. Diners of the 1950s tended to use stainless steel panels, porcelain enamel, glass blocks, terrazzo floors, Formica and neon sign trim. Diners built in the 2000s generally have a different type of architecture; they are laid out more like restaurants, retaining some aspects of traditional diner architecture (stainless steel and Art Deco elements, usually) while discarding others (the small size, and emphasis on the counter).|$|R
60|$|Naoyetsu {{is not an}} enlivening spot to be {{landed at}} in a stress of weather; hardly satisfactory, in fact, {{for the length of}} time needed to hire jinrikisha. It {{consisted}} originally of a string of fishermen's huts along the sea. To these the building of the railway has contributed a parallel <b>row</b> of reception <b>booths,</b> a hundred yards in-shore; and to which of the two files to award the palm for cheerlessness {{it would be hard to}} know. The huts are good of a kind which is poor, and the booths are poor of a kind which is good. To decide between such rivals is a matter of mood. For my part, I hasted to be gone in a jinrikisha, itself not an over-cheerful conveyance in a pour.|$|R
6000|$|No {{wonder that}} we must have our annual Cattle-Show, and Fall Training, and perhaps Cornwallis, our September Courts, and the like. Nature herself holds her annual fair in October, {{not only in the}} streets, but in every hollow and on every hill-side. When lately we looked into that Red-Maple swamp all ablaze, where the trees were clothed in their vestures of most {{dazzling}} tints, did it not suggest a thousand gypsies beneath,--a race capable of wild delight,--or even the fabled fawns, satyrs, and wood-nymphs come back to earth? Or was it only a congregation of wearied wood-choppers, or of proprietors come to inspect their lots, that we thought of? Or, earlier still, when we paddled on the river through that fine-grained September air, did there not appear to be something new going on under the sparkling surface of the stream, a shaking of props, at least, so that we made haste in order to be up in time? Did not the rows of yellowing Willows and Button-Bushes on each side seem like <b>rows</b> of <b>booths,</b> under which, perhaps, some fluviatile egg-pop equally yellow was effervescing? Did not all these suggest that man's spirits should rise as high as Nature's,--should hang out their flag, and the routine of his life be interrupted by an analogous expression of joy and hilarity? ...|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{refurbished}} and the exterior was sandblasted in the early-1940s. The decline of rail service after World War II {{led to the}} station's gradual demise, however. Track #1 was out of service on April 10, 1959. Former express tracks numbers 9-14 (“EX” Yard) were taken out of service on March 3, 1971. At some point, the express buildings became a parking garage. Local businesses were still allowed to utilize the station, such as a barber shop, restaurants, candy stores, a snack bar, a podiatrist's office, a dental office, a beauty school, and even a <b>row</b> of telephone <b>booths.</b> Those businesses were gone by 1978. The tracks that were originally numbered from south to north were renumbered {{from north to south}} on July 1, 1978. Despite efforts to repaint the lobby in the early-1980s, random vandalism plagued the station interior causing water damage that was so severe, the street level depot was closed in 1988, and portions were razed during the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Jobs {{once again}} {{delivered}} the keynote {{presentation at the}} WWDC, which was held from August 7 to 11 in Moscone Center West, San Francisco. The Mac Pro was announced as a replacement to the Power Mac G5, which was Apple's prior pro desktop computer and the last remaining PowerPC-based Mac. The standard Mac Pro featured two 2.66 GHz dual core Xeon (Woodcrest) processors, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB hard drive, and a 256 MB video card. An Xserve update, based on the dual core Xeons, was also announced. Redundant power and Lights Out Management were further product improvements to Apple's server lineup. While certain key Mac OS X improvements were undisclosed, there were 10 improvements in the next iteration, Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), including: full 64-bit app support, Time Machine, Boot Camp, Front <b>Row,</b> Photo <b>Booth,</b> Spaces (Virtual Desktops), Spotlight enhancements, Core Animation, Universal Access enhancements, Mail enhancements, and Dashboard enhancements (including Dashcode, and iChat enhancements). Along with the Leopard features that were announced, a major revision to the Mac OS X Server product was announced. New features to the Server included: a simplified set-up process, iCal Server (based on the CalDAV standard), Apple Teams (a set of web-based collaborative services), Spotlight Server, and Podcast Producer. The 2006 WWDC attracted 4,200 developers from 48 countries, while there were 140 sessions and 100 hands-on labs for developers. More than 1,000 Apple engineers were present at the event, and the DJ BT performed at the Apple Campus in Cupertino.|$|R
60|$|They {{came into}} busier {{streets of the}} Port again, and then passed through {{the square of the}} Lower Town Market, with the market-house in the midst, the shops and {{warehouses}} on either side, the long <b>row</b> of tented <b>booths</b> with every kind of peasant-wares to sell, and the wide stairway dropping to the river which brought the abundance of the neighboring country to the mart. The whole place was alive with country-folk in carts and citizens on foot. At one point a gayly painted wagon was drawn up {{in the midst of a}} group of people to whom a quackish-faced Yankee was hawking, in his own personal French, an American patent-medicine, and making his audience giggle. Because Kitty was amused at this, Mr. Arbuton found it the drollest thing imaginable, but saw something yet droller when she made the colonel look at a peasant, standing in one corner beside a basket of fowls, which a woman, coming up to buy, examined as if the provision were some natural curiosity, while a crowd at once gathered round.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} which housed them originated as a two storey, timber-fronted tenement {{built in}} 1440 and {{known as the}} [...] "Buith Raw" [...] (Scots for <b>booth</b> <b>row).</b> Over the years, the row was extended and heightened until it consisted of seven tenement buildings of varying height, date and form, stretching {{the full length of}} St. Giles' from which it was separated by a narrow alleyway. At some point, the row of tenements took on the name of [...] "Luckenbuiths" [...] from the lockable booths situated at street level. The earliest reference to the name Luckenbooths is in a sasine of 1521 where it is said (in Latin) to be commonly known as the Lukkynbuthis.These ancient buildings, with their varied frontages and roof-lines, formed a picturesque feature in the High Street. The west-most tenement was contiguous with the Belhouse of the Old Tolbooth. The timber-fronted [...] "land" [...] immediately in front of the steeple of St. Giles' was only three storeys high with a low-pitched roof so that the clock on St. Giles' (since removed) could be seen by passers-by in the High Street while its neighbour to the west rose to six storeys. The two most easterly lands were newer and substantial building of polished ashlar. The first of these was apparently built not later than the reign of Charles I. The east-most was built {{at the end of the}} 17th century and presented its main front down the High Street.|$|R
6000|$|But {{with the}} arts {{it is quite}} another matter. While you will search in vain, in his civilization, for {{explanations}} {{of even the most}} simple of nature's laws, you will meet at every turn with devices for the beautifying of life, which may stand not unworthily beside the products of nature's own skill. Whatever these people fashion, from the toy of an hour to the triumphs of all time, is touched by a taste unknown elsewhere. To stroll down the Broadway of Tokio of an evening is a liberal education in everyday art. As you enter it there opens {{out in front of you}} a fairy-like vista of illumination. Two long lines of gayly lighted shops, stretching off into the distance, look out across two equally endless <b>rows</b> of torch-lit <b>booths,</b> the decorous yellow gleam of the one contrasting strangely with the demoniacal red flare of the other. This perspective of pleasure fulfils its promise. As your feet follow your eyes you find yourself in a veritable shoppers' paradise, the galaxy of twinkle resolving into worlds of delight. Nor do you long remain a mere spectator; for the shops open their arms to you. No cold glass reveals their charms only to shut you off. Their wares lie invitingly exposed to the public, seeming to you already half your own. At the very first you come to you stop involuntarily, lost in admiration over what you take to be bric-a-brac. It is only afterwards you learn that the object of your ecstasy was the commonest of kitchen crockery. Next door you halt again, this time in front of some leathern pocket-books, stamped with designs in color to tempt you instantly to empty your wallet for more new ones than you will ever have the means to fill. If you do succeed in tearing yourself away purse-whole, it is only to fall a victim to some painted fans of so exquisite a make and decoration that escape short of possession is impossible. Opposed as stubbornly as you may be to idle purchase at home, here you will find yourself the prey of an acute case of shopping fever before you know it. Nor will it be much consolation subsequently to discover that you have squandered your patrimony upon the most ordinary articles of every-day use. If in despair you turn for refuge to the booths, you will but have delivered yourself into the embrace of still more irresistible fascinations. For the nocturnal squatters are there for the express purpose of catching the susceptible. The shops were modestly attractive from their nature, but the booths deliberately make eyes at you, and with telling effect. The very atmosphere is bewitching. The lurid smurkiness of the torches lends an appropriate weirdness to the figure of the uncouthly clad pedlar who, with the politeness of the arch-fiend himself, displays to an eager group the fatal fascinations of some new conceit. Here the latest thing in inventions, a gutta-percha rat, which, for reasons best known to the vender, scampers about squeaking with a mimicry to shame the original, holds an admiring crowd spellbound with mingled trepidation and delight. There a native zoetrope, indefatigable round of pleasure, whose top fashioned after the type of a turbine wheel enables a candle at the centre ingeniously to supply both illumination and motive power at the same time, affords to as many as can find room on its circumference a peep at the composite antics of a consecutively pictured monkey in the act of jumping a box. Beyond this [...] "wheel of life" [...] lies spread out on a mat a most happy family of curios, the whole of which you are quite prepared to purchase en bloc. While a little farther on stands a flower show which seems to be coyly beckoning to you as the blossoms nod their heads to an imperceptible breeze. So one attraction fairly jostles its neighbor for recognition from the gay thousands that like yourself stroll past in holiday delight. Chattering children in brilliant colors, voluble women and talkative men in quieter but no less picturesque costumes, stream on in kaleidoscopic continuity. And you, carried along by the current, wander thus for miles with the tide of pleasure-seekers, till, late at night, when at last you turn reluctantly homeward, you feel as one does when wakened from some too delightful dream.|$|R
