The Humber Estuary and North Sea mark its southern and eastern limits. Archaeological investigations have revealed artefacts and structures from all historical periods since the last ice age.

5|$|At the 2001 census, the {{economic}} activity of {{residents in the}} Westgate-on-Sea electoral ward was 32.9% in full-time employment, 12.3% in part-time employment, 7.8% self-employed, 4.3% unemployed, 2.1% students with jobs, 4.3% students without jobs, 18.1% retired, 6.2% looking after home or family, 9.5% permanently sick or disabled and 2.3% economically inactive for other reasons. The percentage of <b>retired</b> <b>people</b> {{was significantly higher than}} the national figure of 14% and the percentage of unemployed people was high compared with the national rate of 3.4%. The number of permanently sick or disabled people was much higher than the national figure of 5.3%. 12% of residents aged 16–74 had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 20% nationwide.

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the declining {{population}} trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of <b>retired</b> <b>people</b> were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland. Another use for marginal land in exposed positions is the provision of renewable wind energy; Cefn Croes Wind Farm near Devil's Bridge has 39 turbines and a nominal capacity of 58,500kW.|$|E
40|$|This thesis, {{as part of}} {{the project}} Iniquites geographiques et bien-etre: la {{population}} agee de l'Outaouais, has two objectives: finding out if retirement influences the <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> perceived well-being, and attempting to target characteristics that influence the 55 [...] 75 -year-old <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> well-being. The exhaustive literature review is followed with a description of the Outaouais region and its people, a conceptual frame, and research questions analyzing the impact of retirement on well-being, before identifying the effect of several characteristics (sex, social capital, human capital and some geographic characteristics) on the <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> well-being. Following is the methodology describing our survey and the statistical methods used to analyze the data. Presented in two chapters, the first one descriptive and the second one analytical, the results between retirement and well-being are not conclusive. It is a different story for characteristics influencing the <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> well-being, as some have a subtle influence on life conditions' satisfaction and others have a huge influence on the <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> well-being. Sex and marital status have little influence on the <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> life conditions, whereas human capital and mobility have a large, influence on both the <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> well-being and their life conditions' satisfaction. In conclusion, we think that retirement is not a major event, but its effect, combined with other factors; would {{have an impact on the}} <b>retired</b> <b>people's</b> well-being in Outaouais...|$|R

5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age <b>retired</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{the county}} has also {{witnessed}} a growing trend towards immigration of <b>retired</b> <b>people</b> {{from other parts of}} the United Kingdom, particularly those from the southern counties of England attracted by the generally lower property prices and the slower and more relaxed pace of life.

25|$|One {{explanation}} is that older Californians with fixed incomes had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising {{as a result of}} California's population growth, increasing housing demand, and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much, that some <b>retired</b> <b>people</b> could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. An academic study found support for this explanation, reporting that older voters, homeowners, and voters expecting a tax increase were more likely to vote for Proposition 13.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To assess if {{older people}} {{with higher levels}} of social capital {{experience}} higher levels of sense of mastery than those with lower levels of social capital and to assess whether this association is stronger for <b>retired</b> older <b>people</b> than for older workers. Methods: The data originates from a general population mental health survey conducted among 2610 older people (50 years of age or older) in Finland in 2011. The response rate was 57. 1 %. The association between sense of mastery, measured by Pearlin’s Sense of Mastery Scale, and social capital, measured by social networks, organisational activities, trust, and sense of belonging, were tested by logistic regression analyses. Results: The results showed that older workers experienced greater sense of mastery than <b>retired</b> older <b>people.</b> Trust and neighbourhood belonging were positively associated with sense of mastery. Conclusions: Inequalities in mental wellbeing between older people included in or excluded from the workforce are a public health challenge. Our findings imply that social capital needs to be prioritised as a means for enhancing mental health. More attention should be paid to promote mental wellbeing in <b>retired</b> older <b>people...</b>|$|R
