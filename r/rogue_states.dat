25|$|International {{relations}} analyst Parag Khanna {{states that}} by making massive {{trade and investment}} deals with Latin America and Africa, China established its presence as a superpower along with the European Union and the United States. China's rise is demonstrated by its ballooning share of trade in its gross domestic product. Khanna believes that China's consultative style has allowed it to develop political and economic ties with many countries including those viewed as <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> by western diplomacies.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, China's arrival on {{the world}} oil scene has been perturbing for {{established}} players. China has been attacked for its increasingly close relationship with <b>rogue</b> <b>states,</b> such as Sudan and Angola, countries known for their human rights abuses, political censorship, and widespread corruption. China's world image has suffered from the critiques, leading the nation {{to move to a}} more diplomatic approach, avoiding crisis areas, such the Niger Delta. Nevertheless, as a consumer country and budding powerhouse, China has little choice in choosing its source of supply.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} that so many people are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates of the society of states are concerned about <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to do much more than most now do.|$|E

25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that {{it would be good to}} reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E
500|$|The {{argument}} {{for a national}} missile defense system in the United States was traditionally to protect the country from a Soviet missile attack.

[...] The decision was also praised by Senator Bob Menendez, who authored §8772, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.|$|E

The bank is making large loans to <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> and simultaneously acting as their munitions broker. The script offers the chilling insight that the creditors are the real winners of any conflict. A.O.

2500|$|Red {{mercury is}} thought {{by some to}} be the {{invention}} of an intelligence agency or criminal gang for the purpose of deceiving terrorists and <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> who were trying to acquire nuclear technology on the black market. [...] One televised report indicated that the Soviet Union encouraged the KGB and GRU to arrange sting operations for the detection of those seeking to deal in nuclear materials.

The former Prime Minister of Niger, Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki, reported to Wilson that he was unaware of any contracts for uranium sales to <b>rogue</b> <b>states,</b> though he was approached by a businessman on behalf of an Iraqi delegation about [...] "expanding commercial relations" [...] with Iraq, which Mayaki interpreted to mean uranium sales.

2500|$|In 2008, Professor of Political Science Robert O.

[...] Putin's support of the anti-American terrorist organizations and <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> [...] "set the stage for the invasion of Georgia as Putin sought to spread Russian influence throughout the South Caucasus as well as the Middle East." [...] Putin offered Russian citizenship to people living in the separatist regions, and encouraged the South Ossetians to periodically fire artillery shells at Georgian positions outside of South Ossetia, forcing Saakashvili into a military response against the region, thus providing a pretext for Russian military to intervene.|$|E

2500|$|At times Cockburn {{displayed}} prescience in his writing. On 12 September 2001, {{he wrote}} [...] "The targets abroad {{will be all}} the usual suspects: <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> (most of which, like the Taliban or Saddam Hussein, started off as creatures of US intelligence). The target at home will be the Bill of Rights." [...] Cockburn went on to join {{the opposition to the}} 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq by American, British and other national military forces (the self-described [...] "Coalition of the Willing"). He forged alliances with libertarians and others concerned by the USA Patriot Act. In the wake of the capture of Saddam Hussein, Cockburn penned a column entitled [...] "How to kill Saddam", in which he argued that the ensuing trial of Hussein would be a sham, conducted by a [...] "kangaroo court", and that Hussein's conviction and ultimate execution were foregone conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in {{the early}} 16th century, much of France's {{military}} efforts were dedicated to securing its overseas possessions and putting down dissent among both French colonists and native populations. French troops were spread all across its empire, primarily {{to deal with the}} local population. The French colonial empire ultimately disintegrated after the failed attempt to subdue Algerian nationalists in the late 1950s, a failure that led to the collapse of the Fourth Republic. [...] Since World War II, France's efforts have been directed at maintaining its status as a great power and its influence on the UN Security Council. France has also been instrumental in attempting to unite the armed forces of Europe for their own defense in order to both balance the power of Russia and to lessen European military dependence on the United States. For example, France withdrew from NATO in 1966 over complaints that its role in the organization was being subordinated {{to the demands of the}} United States. French objectives in this era have undergone major shifts. Unencumbered by continental wars or intricate alliances, France now deploys its military forces as part of international peacekeeping operations, security enforcers in former colonies, or maintains them combat ready and mobilized to respond to threats from <b>rogue</b> <b>states.</b> France is a nuclear power with the largest nuclear arsenal in Europe, and its nuclear capabilities, just like its conventional forces, have been restructured to rapidly deal with emerging threats.|$|E
