40|$|An {{extension}} of the Grey Fuzzy Waste Load Allocation Model (GFWLAM) developed in an earlier work is presented here {{to address the problem}} of multiple solutions. Formulation of GFWLAM is based on the approach for solving fuzzy multiple objective optimization problems with max–min as the operator, which usually may not result in a unique solution. The multiple solutions of fuzzy multiobjective optimization model should be obtained as parametric equations or equations that represent a subspace. A two-phase optimization technique, two-phase GFWLAM, is developed to capture all alternative or multiple solutions of GFWLAM. The optimization model in Phase 1 is exactly same as the optimization model described in GFWLAM. The optimization model in Phase 2 maximizes the upper bounds <b>of</b> fractional <b>removal</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> and minimizes the lower bounds <b>of</b> fractional <b>removal</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> keeping the value of goal fulﬁllment level same as obtained from Phase 1. The widths of the interval-valued fractional removal levels play an important role in decision-making as these can be adjusted within their intervals by the decision-maker considering technical and economic feasibility in the ﬁnal decision scheme. Two-phase GFWLAM widens the widths <b>of</b> interval-valued <b>removal</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>pollutants,</b> thus enhancing the ﬂexibility in decision-making.

50|$|Photochemical {{reactions}} are {{initiated by the}} absorption of a photon, typically in the wavelength range 290-700 nm (at {{the surface of the}} Earth). The energy of an absorbed photon is transferred to electrons in the molecule and briefly changes their configuration (i.e., promotes the molecule from a ground state to an excited state). The excited state represents what is essentially a new molecule. Often excited state molecules are not kinetically stable in the presence of O2 or H2O and can spontaneously decompose (oxidize or hydrolyze). Sometimes molecules decompose to produce high energy, unstable fragments that can react with other molecules around them. The two processes are collectively referred to as direct photolysis or indirect photolysis, and both mechanisms contribute to the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{from the}} {{waste water stream}} {{involves}} both absorption and adsorption of organic compounds and some inorganic species such as nitrite and nitrate ions by the layer of microbial bio film. The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area {{in addition to the}} external surface of the medium. Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved oxygen which the bio-film layer requires for the biochemical oxidation of the organic compounds and releases carbon dioxide gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it eventually sloughs off into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a clarifier or sedimentation tank for the separation and removal of the sloughed film. Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.|$|E
