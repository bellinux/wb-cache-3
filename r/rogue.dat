5|$|While {{there are}} some direct {{variants}} of <b>Rogue,</b> such as Brogue, most variants of <b>Rogue</b> could be classified into two branches based on two key games, Moria and Hack, that were developed {{in the spirit of}} <b>Rogue.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1847, the Whitman {{massacre}} and the Cayuse War in {{what became}} southeastern Washington raised fears among white settlers {{throughout the region}} {{and led to the}} formation of large volunteer militias organized to fight Indians. Along the <b>Rogue,</b> tensions intensified in 1848 at the start of the California Gold Rush, when hundreds of men from the Oregon Territory passed through the <b>Rogue</b> Valley on their way to the Sacramento River basin. After Indians attacked a group of returning miners along the <b>Rogue</b> in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma Indians. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through the <b>Rogue</b> Valley for white miners and settlers.|$|E

50|$|During {{the events}} of Final Crisis, the <b>Rogues</b> {{rejected}} membership into the Secret Society offered by Libra. With Libra desperate to induct all of the Flash's villains, he recruits the New <b>Rogues,</b> who had first appeared as the Penguin's goons, to force the <b>Rogues</b> to join. The members consisted of: Chill, Burn, Weather Witch, Mirror-Man, and Mr. Magic. The New <b>Rogues</b> had captured Captain Cold's father and were threatening to kill him if the <b>Rogues</b> did not report to Libra. The <b>Rogues</b> then attacked the New <b>Rogues,</b> killing each one.|$|R
50|$|In Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge, the <b>Rogues</b> {{withdraw}} from Libra's society and plot to {{take revenge on}} a movement-restored Inertia before they retire.

Even with the New <b>Rogues</b> slain by the <b>Rogues,</b> Libra doesn't give up that easily. They still turn down Libra even after Zoom is depowered by Inertia who is then killed by the <b>Rogues.</b>|$|R

5|$|Against his will, Gygax {{was back}} in charge again; he {{immediately}} looked for a quick product to get NIPI off the ground.

5|$|Although the <b>Rogue</b> Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} {{density of the}} <b>Rogue</b> watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern <b>Rogue</b> basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E

5|$|People {{have lived}} along the <b>Rogue</b> River {{and its tributaries}} for at least 8,500years. European explorers made first contact with Native Americans (Indians) {{toward the end of}} the 18thcentury and began beaver {{trapping}} and other activities in the region. Clashes, sometimes deadly, occurred between the natives and the trappers and later between the natives and European-American miners and settlers. These struggles culminated with the <b>Rogue</b> River Wars of 1855–56 and removal of most of the natives to reservations outside the basin. After the war, settlers expanded into remote areas of the watershed and established small farms along the river between Grave Creek and the mouth of the Illinois River. They were relatively isolated from the outside world until 1895, when the Post Office Department added mail-boat service along the lower <b>Rogue.</b> As of 2010, the <b>Rogue</b> has one of the two remaining rural mail-boat routes in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The DEQ has {{collected}} water-quality {{data in the}} <b>Rogue</b> basin since the mid-1980s and has used it to generate scores on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). The index is meant to provide an assessment of water quality for general recreational uses; OWQI scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). Of the eight <b>Rogue</b> basin sites tested during the water years 1997–2006, five were ranked good, one was excellent, and two—Little Butte Creek and Bear Creek, in the most populated part of the <b>Rogue</b> basin—were poor. On the <b>Rogue</b> River itself, scores varied from 92 at RM138.4 (RK222.7) declining to 85 at RM117.2 (RK188.6) but improving to 97 at RM11.0 (RK17.7). By comparison, the average OWQI score for the Willamette River in downtown Portland, the state's largest city, was 74 between 1986 and 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Rebels {{learn that}} Imperial officer Crix Madine wishes to defect to the Rebel Alliance. The Empire {{launches}} {{an attack on}} Corellia, where Madine is stationed, to prevent his departure. <b>Rogue</b> Squadron, {{with the help of}} Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon, fights off the Empire and helps escort Madine safely off the planet. Soon after, <b>Rogue</b> Squadron is joined by Gold Squadron, a group of Y-wings now led by Crix Madine; they are dispatched to the moon of GerrardV to aid its quest for independence from the Empire. They encounter the 128th TIE interceptor Squadron and disable Kasan Moor's TIE. When <b>Rogue</b> Squadron tells Moor that she has been taken prisoner, she offers to defect and provide the Rebel Alliance with Imperial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>Rogue</b> led developers {{to create their}} own versions of the game, though their efforts were originally limited by the lack of access to Rogues source, which was not released until BSD v4.3 in 1986. These developers resorted to building games from scratch similar to <b>Rogue</b> but with features that they wanted to see. These versions would be distributed with source code, and along with the original <b>Rogue</b> source, other developers were able to create software forks of the games, adding in new monsters, items, and gameplay features, creating several dozen variants. This process was aided by switching code to languages with better data typing, including object-oriented and scripting languages, and cleaning up and modularizing the code so that contributors can better follow where changes can be made.|$|E
