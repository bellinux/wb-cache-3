40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to perform a task and needs {{analysis}} of <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> occupations in Katsina State. The analysis does the following: identifies competencies required in the field, surveys the skilled manpower need of <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> personnel, and identifies job opportunities that exist in the area of occupation in Katsina State. The people in Katsina State need a standard for <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> occupations, considering the industrial development taking place in the modern world of technology. In addition, a shortage of skilled manpower in <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> has already proved a serious constraint to other development across the state and nation in general. The literature states that 7, 510 of workers are needed and only 2, 756 of workers are available (Bello, 2005). 111 The objectives for this study were: 1. Determine the future needs of <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> jobs in Katsina State, Nigeria. 2. Identify program content in <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> for the technical institutions, secondary technical colleges and other vocational schools in Katsina State, 3.

40|$|Purpose: The <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> process {{requires}} {{testing equipment}} {{that along with}} customized computer software properly supports the analysis of casting component characteristic properties. Due {{to the fact that}} this evaluation process involves the control of complex and multi-variable melting, casting and solidification factors, it is necessary to develop dedicated software. Design/methodology/approach: The integration of Statistical Process Control methods and Artificial Intelligence techniques (Case-Based Reasoning) into Thermal Analysis Data Acquisition Software (NI LabView) was developed to analyze casting component properties. The thermal data was tested in terms of accuracy, reliability and timeliness in order to secure <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> process effectiveness. Findings: Quantitative values were defined as “Low”, “Medium” and “High” to assess the level of improvement in the <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> analysis by means of the Artificial Intelligence-Based Control System (AIBCS). The traditional process was used as a reference to measure such improvement. As a result, the accuracy, reliability and timeliness were significantly increased to the “High” level. Research limitations/implications: Presently, the AIBCS predicts a limited number of casting properties. Due to its flexible design more properties could be added. Practical implications: The AIBCS has been successfully used at the Ford/Nemak Windsor Aluminum Plant (WAP) to analyze Al casting properties of the engine blocks. Originality/value: The <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> research community has immensely benefited from these developed information technologies that support the <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>casting</b> {{enables the}} {{production}} of simple and complex parts that meet {{a wide variety of}} needs. Nearly all manufactured goods contain one or more cast components. Major end-uses include power generation equipment, defense systems and machinery, motor vehicles, transportation equipment, oil field machinery, pipelines, industrial machinery, construction materials, and other products vital to our economic and national security. The scope of the study is mainly made to cover the following areas:- I – Investigate the availability of materials in the Sudan for moulds construction for different <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> processes as well as for producing parts by casting. The research showed that Sudan contains good quantities of scrap of various metal alloys beside natural resources of natural metals like iron and copper. II – Investigate the situation of <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> Industry in the Sudan and the techniques adopted to the current activities. The survey work made on this area showed that the quality of the products is very poor because the industry of <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> is lacking the following requirements:- i – Adoption of Scientific techniques. ii – Skilled labour. iii – Specialized engineers. iv – Proper equipment and tools. Due to the above reasons <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> does not play any role in the plan of the development of Sudan. The adoption of the correct techniques will make the industry able to reduce its cost of production to become competitive with other manufacturing methods. Also energy content can be reduced by improving product quality-thereby reducing scrap and melting requirements. III – The research exerted great emphasis to put the foundry equipment of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture (U of K) in good operational conditions to realize the three <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> processes, sand casting, die casting and centrifugal casting can be performed...|$|R
