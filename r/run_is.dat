5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the <b>run</b> <b>is</b> unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the <b>run</b> <b>is</b> earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|In {{its upper}} reaches, most of Scotch <b>Run</b> <b>is</b> closed to public access. For this reason, a 1997 report stated that {{this section of}} the stream offered poor {{recreational}} opportunities. However, the report stated that the stream provided good recreational opportunities in its lower reaches. According to the report, both sections of the stream are poor sites for angling.|$|E

2500|$|Four <b>runs</b> <b>are</b> scored if {{the ball}} bounces before {{touching}} or {{going over the}} edge of the field and six runs if it does not bounce before passing over the boundary in the air. These events are known as a four or a six respectively. [...] When this happens the <b>runs</b> <b>are</b> automatically added to the batsman's and his team's score and the ball becomes dead. If the ball did not touch the bat or a hand holding the bat, four <b>runs</b> <b>are</b> scored as the relevant type of extra instead; six <b>runs</b> cannot <b>be</b> scored as extras, even if the ball clears the boundary, which is in any case extremely unlikely. Prior to 1910, six <b>runs</b> <b>were</b> only awarded for hits out of the ground.|$|R
30|$|Initially, 10 {{simulation}} <b>runs</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted in}} order to identify critical variables that may significantly influence the performance of PARAMICS. Variables related to driver behaviour (e.g. the distributions of aggressiveness and awareness), compositions of vehicles, driver’s familiarity, etc. were examined. The number of simulation <b>runs</b> <b>was</b> based on number of vehicles (NV). The average NV value was 32, 580 and the standard deviation was 335. The estimated number of runs with a margin of error of 1  % was 5.12  ≈  6. The required simulation <b>runs</b> <b>were</b> conducted with different seed numbers.

5|$|Baseball is a bat-and-ball {{game played}} between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team {{attempts}} to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around {{a series of}} four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A <b>run</b> <b>is</b> scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.|$|E
5|$|Earned <b>runs</b> <b>are</b> <b>runs</b> that <b>are</b> {{directly}} {{attributable to}} a pitcher's efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned <b>runs</b> <b>are</b> primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a judgment call by the official scorer.|$|R
