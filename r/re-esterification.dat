50|$|In mammals, tri{{glycerol}} or its backbone, glycerol 3- phosphate, {{is usually}} synthesized from glucose through glycolysis. Glucose will be degraded though glycolysis until fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is broken down to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is significant in synthesizing triglycerides {{because it can}} be used to generate glycerol 3-phosphate. However, glycerol 3-phosphate is generated through a different pathway when an organism is deficient of carbohydrates such as glucose. During fasting or low carbohydrate diet, glycerol 3-phosphate is generated by another metabolic pathway called glyceroneogenesis which uses precursors other than glucose. Glyceroneogenesis is considerably important because it is the dominant pathway to generate lipids during fasting or starvation. Not only it produces lipids for the organism but it also regulates lipid levels in the cell. Glyceroneogenesis involves <b>re-esterification</b> of fatty acids to generate triglycerides. In other words, it can regulate fatty acid concentration in the cytosol. Strong activity in glyceroneogenesis will induce the <b>re-esterification</b> of fatty acid which will result in decrease of fatty acid concentration in the cytosol. Therefore, glyceroneogenesis is significantly related to lipid control of mammals.|$|E

50|$|Regulation of Glyceroneogenesis is a {{therapeutic}} target of Type II diabetes. The release of triglycerides {{in the liver}} should be inhibited as well as release of free fatty acid in adipose tissues. Insulin {{is used as a}} down regulator in liver of glyceroneogenesis. Suppression in glyceroneogenesis will decrease the triglyceride being released in to the bloodstream from liver. However, the problem with insulin is that it also suppresses glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue. In order to restrict the release of free fatty acid from adipose tissues, fatty acids must be re-esterified by glyceroneogenesis. Thiazolidinedione (Figure 8) is a substance which only affects glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue. Thiazolidinedione will increase the transcription of PEPC-K and eventually induce the activity of glyceroneogenesis. As a result, <b>re-esterification</b> of fatty acids take place in the cell and prevents the release of fatty acids to the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|Failure in {{regulating}} glyceroneogenesis {{may lead to}} Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder caused by high level of blood glucose and blood lipid. Type2 diabetes {{can be caused by}} over production of triglycerides in liver due to excessively active glyceroneogenesis, or excess release of fatty acids from adipose tissues. Since the activity of glyceroneogenesis is mostly dependent on PEPC-K, fluctuating the expressions for PEPC-K will dramatically influence the activity of glyceroneogenesis. Over expressing PEPC-K in liver will eventually result in over production of triglycerides which can elevate the lipid level in the bloodstream. Conversely, in adipose tissue, down regulated glyceroneogenesis may trigger Type 2 diabetes. Suppressed glyceroneogenesis will result in increase of free fatty acids in the adipose tissues, because <b>re-esterification</b> of free fatty acid will not occur. Therefore, glyceroneogenesis overly induced in liver and reduced in adipose tissues may be the trigger for Type2 diabetes.|$|E
50|$|When {{pyruvate}} of lactate {{is used as}} {{the precursor}} for glycerol 3-phosphate, glyceroneogenesis follows exactly the same pathway as gluconeogenesis until it generates dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Lactate catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase will form pyruvate with expense of NAD+. Furthermore, by using 1 ATP and bicarbonate, pyruvate will be converted to oxaloacetate. which is catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase. Oxaloacetate will be catalysed by PEPC-K to generate phosphoenolpyruvate. This phosphorylation and decarboxylation of oxaloacetate is the significant step in glyceroneogenesis because the entire pathway is regulated by this reaction. After the production of phosphoenolpyruvate, gluconeogenesis will continue until dihydroxyacetone phosphate is generated, which produces 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as intermediates. When dihydroxyacetone phosphate is produced, glyceroneogenesis will branch off from gluconeogenesis. With expense of NADH, dihydroxyacetone phosphate will convert to glycerol 3- phosphate (Figure 4), which is the final product of glyceroneogenesis. In addition, triglyceride can be generated by <b>re-esterification</b> of 3 fatty acid chains on glycerol 3-phosphate. Therefore, glyceroneogenesis is a metabolic pathway starting from lactate or pyruvate, and it is similar to gluconeogenesis but the pathway will branch out when dihydroxyacetone phosphate is generated. Instead of producing fructose 1,6- bisphosphate as gluconeogenesis does, glyceroneogenesis converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate.|$|E
50|$|Having {{encountered}} {{obesity in}} {{children as a}} medical doctor in the 1970s, Leibel believed that biology played a stronger role than “will power” in human obesity and joined Jules Hirsch in theorizing about the psychobiology of obesity - a belief that body weight {{was the result of}} complex interactions between genes and the environment rather than a simple matter of free will. In 1978, based on his theory that genetics {{played a major role in}} determining body weight regulation in humans, Leibel left Harvard University to join Jules Hirsch at Rockefeller University with the goal of finding the factor that drove eating. In collaboration with Douglas Coleman, Leibel determined that a mutation of the ob gene resulted in mice that were unable to manufacture a working satiety-signaling protein and that a db mutation resulted in mice that had the protein, but lacked the ability to detect the signal. Leibel and Hirsch began a series of scientific investigations aimed at laying the groundwork for determining the connection between genetics and obesity. Over the course of eight years, Leibel's work ranged from studies of glycerol to the development of a radioisotpic technique for analysis of free fatty acid <b>re-esterification</b> in human adipose tissue to the metabolic characterization of obesity. After concluding that the tools of molecular genetics were key to moving his research forward and finding the obesity gene, Leibel initiated a collaboration with then-junior Rockefeller University faculty member and molecular biologist Jeffrey Friedman in 1986, and began to assemble a team of researchers including Streamson C. Chua, Nathan Bahary, Don Siegel, Yiying Zhang, Ricardo Proenca and others. Leveraging his respected and senior status within the scientific community, Leibel obtained ongoing funding from the National Institutes of Health and other sources, allowing the team to develop and utilize new techniques in their research such as chromosome microdissection.|$|E

40|$|This study {{characterizes the}} effects of {{shivering}} thermogenesis on metabolic fuel selection in Wistar rats. Because lipids account {{for most of the}} heat produced, we have investigated: (1) whether the rate of appearance of non-esterified fatty acids (Ra NEFAs) is stimulated by shivering, (2) whether mono-unsaturated (oleate) and saturated fatty acids (palmitate) are affected similarly, and (3) whether the partitioning between fatty acid oxidation and <b>re-esterification</b> is altered by cold exposure. Fuel oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry and fatty acid mobilization by continuous infusion of 9, 10 -[3 H]oleate and 1 -[14 C]palmitate. During steady-state cold exposure, results show that total heat production is unequally shared by the oxidation of lipids (52 % of metabolic rate), carbohydrates (35 %) and proteins (13 %), and that the same fuel selection pattern is observed at all shivering intensities. All previous research shows that mammals stimulate Ra NEFA to support exercise or shivering. In contrast, results reveal that the Ra NEFA of the rat remains constant during cold exposure (∼ 55 μmol kg− 1 min− 1). No preferential use of mono-unsaturated over saturated fatty acids could be demonstrated. The rat decreases its rate of fatty acid <b>re-esterification</b> from 48. 4 ± 6. 4 to 19. 6 ± 6. 3 μmol kg− 1 min− 1 to provide energy to shivering muscles.

Here we collated data from 331 experiments in 255 healthy volunteers over a 23 -year period, in which subcutaneous {{abdominal adipose tissue}} metabolism was studied by measurements of arterio-venous differences after an overnight fast. NEFA and glycerol were released in a ratio of 2. 7 : 1, different (P < 0. 001) from the value of 3. 0 that would indicate no fatty acid <b>re-esterification.</b> Fatty acid <b>re-esterification</b> was 10. 2 ± 1. 4 %. Extraction of triacylglycerol (TG) (fractional extraction 5. 7 ± 0. 4 %) indicated intravascular lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase, and this contributed 21 ± 3 % of the glycerol released. Glucose uptake (fractional extraction 2. 6 ± 0. 3 %) was partitioned around 20 - 25 % for provision of glycerol 3 -phosphate and 30 % into lactate production. There was release of lactate and pyruvate, with extraction of the ketone bodies 3 -hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, although these were small numerically compared with TG and glucose uptake. NEFA release (expressed per 100 g tissue) correlated inversely with measures of fat mass (e. g., with BMI, r(s) = - 0. 24, P < 0. 001). We examined within-person variability. Systemic NEFA concentrations, NEFA release, fatty acid <b>re-esterification,</b> and adipose tissue blood flow were all more consistent within than between individuals.

40|$|Hamster hepatocytes, {{like human}} hepatocytes, secrete {{triacylglycerol}} (TAG) as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) {{in association with}} apolipoprotein (apo) B 100, whereas in the rat, TAG is secreted predominantly in association with apoB 48. Nevertheless, in hepatocytes from both species, a minimum of between 60 % and 70 % [69. 1 +/- 1. 4 % (hamster), 60. 6 +/- 2. 5 % (rat) ] of the VLDL TAG was secreted following lipolysis and <b>re-esterification</b> of intracellular TAG. The fractional rates of hepatocellular TAG turnover (lipolysis and <b>re-esterification)</b> were similar in both species [1. 83 +/- 0. 28 pools/ 24 h (hamster), 1. 39 +/- 0. 23 pools/ 24 h (rat) ]. Comparison of the relative changes in the 3 H and 14 C specific radioactivities of the VLDL and cellular TAG, pre-labelled with [3 H]glycerol and [4 C]oleate, suggested that fatty acids released by lipolysis either were recruited directly into a VLDL assembly pool or were recycled to the cellular pool following <b>re-esterification.</b> Recycling in the hamster was somewhat greater than in the rat (66. 1 +/- 5. 7 % versus 53. 7 +/- 4. 8 % of TAG lipolysed respectively). Similarly, {{a larger proportion of}} newly synthesized TAG was retained within the cell, rather than secreted as VLDL, in the hamster compared with the rat (37. 9 +/- 2. 8 % versus 20 +/- 3. 8 %, P< 0. 01).

Rat hepatocytes were more sensitive to inhibition of VLDL secretion by insulin than were those from hamster. In neither case did insulin affect total or fractional TAG turnover.

De novo lipogenesis and futile metabolic cycling based on lipolysis and fatty acid <b>re-esterification</b> which {{is engaged in}} regulation of fatty acid level in bloodstream are occuring there.

In our previous studies in mice fed high-fat (cHF; ~ 60 % calories as fat) diet and maintained at 20 °C, dietary LC n- 3 PUFA could counteract accretion of body fat, without inducing mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) in adipose tissue, suggesting that the anti-obesity effect was not linked to adaptive (UCP 1 mediated) thermogenesis. To exclude a possible dependence of the anti-obesity effect on any mechanism inducible by cold, experiments were repeated in mice maintained at thermoneutrality (30 °C). Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed either cHF diet, or cHF diet supplemented with LC n- 3 PUFA, or standard diet for 7 months. Similarly as at 20 °C, the LC n- 3 PUFA supplementation reduced accumulation of body fat, preserved lipid and glucose homeostasis, and induced fatty acid <b>re-esterification</b> in epididymal white adipose tissue. Food consumption was not affected by LC n- 3 PUFA intake. Our results demonstrated anti-obesity metabolic effect of LC n- 3 PUFA, independent of cold-induced thermogenesis and they suggested that induction of fatty acid <b>re-esterification</b> creating a substrate cycle in white fat, which results in energy expenditure, could contribute to the anti-obesity effect.

40|$|Hepatic VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) {{assembly}} is {{a complex}} process that is largely regulated by the provision of lipid for apolipoprotein B assembly. Intracellular stored TAG (triacylglycerol) undergoes an initial lipolysis followed by <b>re-esterification</b> of the lipolytic products to form TAG prior to their incorporation into a VLDL particle. TGH (TAG hydrolase) is a lipase that hydrolyses intracellular TAG within the hepatocyte. We have utilized both dexamethasone-injected mouse and primary hepatocyte models to address whether stimulation of TAG biosynthesis by the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, altered hepatic lipolysis and <b>re-esterification</b> {{and the provision of}} stored TAG for lipoprotein secretion. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in decreased TGH expression, primarily due to a dexamethasone-induced decrease in TGH mRNA stability. The expression and activities of diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 and 2 were stimulated by dexamethasone. The combination of reduced intracellular TAG lipolysis and increased TAG biosynthesis contributed to the accumulation of TAG within the livers of dexamethasone-injected mice. The rate of hepatic TAG secretion in dexamethasonetreated mice was maintained at similar levels as in control mice. Our data demonstrate that stimulation of de novo TAG synthesis by dexamethasone increased the proportion of secreted TAG that was derived from de novo sources, while the utilization of stored TAG for secretion was reduced.

Despite severe intestinal fat malabsorption, the mice maintain normal concentrations of plasma lipids and liver-derived apoB 100 -containing lipoproteins. We investigated the metabolic mechanisms by which plasma lipid levels are kept normal. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) and cholesterogenesis were measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA). Plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) fluxes and hepatic <b>re-esterification</b> of labelled plasma NEFA were also measured. Hepatic and plasma triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations and plasma NEFA fluxes were not different between chylomicron-deficient mice and controls. The contribution from DNL to the hepatic TG pool was only modestly higher in chylomicron-deficient mice [12 +/- 2. 1 % (n= 7) compared with 3. 7 +/- 1. 0 % (n= 9); means+/-S. E. M. ], whereas cholesterogenesis was markedly elevated. The fractional contribution from plasma NEFA to hepatic TG was greatly elevated in the chylomicron-deficient animals (62 % compared with 23 %). Accordingly, 73 % of hepatic TG was neither from DNL nor from plasma NEFA in controls, presumably reflecting prior contribution from chylomicron remnants, compared with only 26 % in the chylomicron-deficient group. The long-term contribution from DNL to adipose fat stores reached approximately the same steady-state values (approximately 30 %) in the two groups. Body fat accumulation was much lower in chylomicron-deficient animals; thus, whole-body absolute DNL was significantly lower. We conclude that plasma and hepatic TG pools and hepatic secretion of apoB-containing particles are maintained at normal levels in chylomicron-deficient mice, not by de novo fatty acid synthesis, but by more avid <b>re-esterification</b> of plasma NEFA, replacing the normally predominant contribution from chylomicrons, and that some dietary fat can be absorbed by apoB-independent mechanisms...|$|E

However the expression of key genes responsible for the uptake, transport, oxidation, and <b>re-esterification</b> of FA remained unchanged following 15 and 40 h of fasting. Likewise there was {{no change in the}} mRNA abundance of transcription factors. This suggests a unique role for UCP 3 in the regulation of FA homeostasis during fasting as adaptation to 40 h of fasting does not require alterations in the expression of other genes necessary for lipid metabolism. <br /...|$|E

40|$|ED is from 2003 in the {{laboratory}} of Neurobiologie des processus adaptatifsFA (fatty acid) recycling in adipose tissue {{appears to be an}} important pathway for regulating FA release into the blood during fasting. <b>Re-esterification</b> requires G 3 P (glycerol 3 -phosphate), which cannot be synthesized from glucose because glycolysis is much reduced under such circumstances. In addition, G 3 P can scarcely originate from glycerol since glycerol kinase has a very low activity in white adipose tissue. It was shown about 35 years ago that a metabolic pathway named glyceroneogenesis, which allows G 3 P synthesis from non-carbohydrate precursors like pyruvate, lactate or amino acids, is activated during fasting. The major enzyme in this pathway was shown to be PEPCK-C [cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); EC 4. 1. 1. 32]. The present review analyses the mechanisms by which a series of hormones and nutrients affect PEPCK-C gene transcription and glyceroneogenesis and describes evidence for dysregulation of this pathway in type 2 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|VITAMIN A and {{cholesterol}} esters {{have been shown}} to undergo extensive hydrolysis in the lumen of the small intestine during the process of absorption; they are re-esterified to appear in the lymph mostly as esters 1, 2. However, the vitamin A esters of the lymph, blood and liver of the rat are formed by long-chain fatty acids 3 and in the normal rat liver, probably as palmitates 4. On the other hand, cholesterol esters are usually made up of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the lymph and blood of rats 5. For the absorption of the two lipid materials, the enzymes of the pancreas have been largely implicated, while not much {{attention has been paid to}} the possible role of the mucosal enzymes. From the behaviour of the mucosal enzymes, as presented here, it appears that probably these enzymes play a more important part in the <b>re-esterification</b> of the two lipid materials during their absorption...|$|E
40|$|A {{mouse model}} of {{chylomicron}} deficiency was recently de-veloped; these mice express a human apolipoprotein (apo) B transgene {{in the liver}} but do not synthesize any apoB in the intestine. Despite severe intestinal fat malabsorption, the mice maintain normal concentrations of plasma lipids and liver-derived apoB 100 -containing lipoproteins. We investigated the metabolic mechanisms by which plasma lipid levels are kept normal. De noo lipogenesis (DNL) and cholesterogenesis were measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA). Plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) fluxes and hepatic <b>re-esterification</b> of labelled plasma NEFA were also measured. Hepatic and plasma triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations and plasma NEFA fluxes were not different between chylomicron-deficient mice and controls. The contribution from DNL to the hepatic TG pool was only modestly higher in chylomicron-deficient mice [12 ‡ 2 – 1 % (nfl 7) compared with 3 – 7 ‡ 1 – 0 % (nfl 9); means‡S. E.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Glucose-dependent insulinotropic {{polypeptide}} (GIP) {{has been}} implicated in lipid metabolism in animals. In humans, however, {{there is no clear}} evidence of GIP effecting lipid metabolism. The present experiments were performed in order to elucidate the effects of GIP on regional adipose tissue metabolism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Eight healthy subjects were studied on four different occasions. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue metabolism was assessed by measuring arterio-venous concentration differences and regional adipose tissue blood flow during GIP (1. 5 pmol/kg/min) or saline infused intravenously alone or in combination with a hyperinsulinemichyperglycemic (HI-HG) clamp. RESULTS—During GIP and HI-HG clamp, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow, hydrolysis of circulating triacylglycerol (TAG) (P � 0. 009), and glucose uptake (P � 0. 03) increased significantly while free fatty acid (FFA) output (P � 0. 04) and FFA/glycerol release ratio (P � 0. 02) decreased compared with saline and HI-HG clamp. CONCLUSIONS—In conclusion, GIP in combination with hyperinsulinemia and slight hyperglycemia increased adipose tissue blood flow, glucose uptake, and FFA <b>re-esterification,</b> thus resulting in increased TAG deposition in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue.
