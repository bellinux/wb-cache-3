25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} are herbivore scavengers. Their diets contains over 300 {{species of}} plants. They consume {{a very wide}} range of plants, but mainly eat broad-leaved grass, regular grass, wiregrass, and terrestrial legumes. They also eat mushrooms, and fruits such as gopher apple, pawpaw, blackberries, and saw palmetto berries. In addition, gopher tortoises eat flowers from the genera Cnidoscolus (nettles), Tillandsia (Spanish and ball moss), <b>Richardia,</b> and Dyschoriste. Juvenile tortoises tend to eat more legumes, which are higher in protein, and fewer grasses and tough, fibrous plants than mature tortoises. Gopher tortoises {{have been known to}} scavenge carrion and eat excrement. As gopher tortoises usually get water from the food they eat, they usually only drink standing water in times of extreme drought.|$|E

40|$|Zantedeshia aethiopica (arum lily) is a noxious weed in {{south-western}} Australia. Herbicides are {{ineffective in}} controlling it in native forest and bushland. Biological {{control of weeds}} using indigenous or 'naturalised' plant pathogens in an inundative or 'mycoherbicide' strategy is an effective, host specific method of weed control. The work in this thesis tested the hypothesis that there are pathogens of Z. aethiopica present in the weed population of Z. aethiopica in south-western Australia. The objective {{of the study was}} to provide the groundwork to establish a potential bio-control programme for Z. aethiopica. Surveys were conducted for fungal, bacterial and nematode pathogens of Z. aethiopica over three geographic regions in south-western Australia: Perth metropolitan area; Garden Island nature reserve; and the Buselton-Augusta region. The diversity in fungi isolated varied amongst the three regions, with the greatest diversity of fungi being recovered from the Busselton-Augusta region of the study and the least diversity from the Garden Island region. Possible explanations for this variation are differences in rainfall, soil organics and soil pH. A total of 782 isolates werer recovered from diseased roots and rhizomes of Z. aethiopica. Of these the fungal genera most commonly isolated from root or I rhizome rots were Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia and Alternaria species. These genera are all potential plant pathogens which have been isolated from z. aethiopica by workers world-wide. The most commonly isolated fungal species were Fusarium solani and Fusarium oxysporum. A frequently isolated Pythium sp. was identified as P. coloratum. This is a new host pathogen association. The most commonly occurring fungi associated with leaf lesions were Phoma species. It is unlikely that the Phoma spp. isolated were Phoma zantedeschia as the isolated organisms failed to fit the original description of this species which has clusters of of multi-septate chlamydospores. This is significant as it indicates that P. zantedeschia, a pathogen of Z. aethiopica in a number of countries throughout the world, is unlikely to be present in southwestern Australia. Another serious pathogen isolated from Z. aethiopica both overseas and in New South Wales which was not isolated in this study is Phytophthora <b>richardiae.</b> Bacteria were associated with soft rots of rhizomes. Out of 50 bacterial isolates, nine of the most commonly occurring forms were examined in detail. Five were identified as Pseudomonas spp. and four as Erwinia species. These 9 isolates were tested for pathogenicity toward Z. aethiopica by infecting roots of Z. aethiopica grown in an aeroponics system. There was some indication that one of the Erwinia isolates may have been pathogenic toward Z. aethiopica. The differences were not significant (p>O. OS) but it is postulated that this is because of the high standard error, which could have been compensated for by increasing the number of replicates per treatment. Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani isolated from rhizome rots of z. aethiopica were also tested for pathogenicity toward Z. aethiopica in an aeroponics system. Lesion development was greater in response to inoculation with Fusarium isolates Foxl and Fs 2 than in the non-inoculated controls, particularly in wounded treatments. The nematode Meloidogyne javanica was identified as the causal agent of galled roots observed on Z. aethiopica at 2 sites. This is a new host pathogen association. Meloidogyne javanica has a very broad host range and hence is not suitable as a biological control agent against Z. aethiopica. The diverse range of pathogenic genera isolated from Z. aethiopica gives reason for some optimism in the search for a bio-control agent to control the noxious weed Z. aethiopica. The existence of host specific pathovars of Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria spp., which have been use in the biocontrol of weeds, offer avenues for further research into biocontrol of Z. aethiopica...|$|R

There were 18 species of weeds before treatments which were dominated by Panicum maximum, Eleusine indica, and Borreria laevis. After the organic matter treatments there were 22 weeds species, which classified into 17 genus and 11 families, floristically. The main weeds were <b>Richardia</b> Brasiliensis, Borreria alata, and Eleusine indica. The weeds diversity index was less to medium with the point of 1. 33 to 1. 85. The community coefficient between before and after organic matter treatment was < 30 %, while the average of communities coefficient between organic matter treatments above 75 %...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de avaliar os efeitos de diferentes épocas de controle de plantas daninhas, realizado através de capina manual ou aplicação de herbicidas, sobre a produtividade e características agronômicas do milho, foi instalado um experimento na Fazenda Escola "Capão da Onça" (UEPG), em Ponta Grossa-PR, no sistema de plantio direto na palha. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi de blocos ao acaso, em esquema fatorial 2 x 5, com seis repetições. O híbrido utilizado foi XL 212, semeado no dia 11 / 11 / 97. Os herbicidas utilizados, com as respectivas épocas de aplicação, foram: atrazine (1400 + 1400 g/ha), aos 2 e 19 dias após a emergência (DAE); atrazine + nicosulfuron (1400 + 12 g/ha), aos 8 DAE; atrazine + nicosulfuron (1600 + 20 g/ha), aos 19 DAE; atrazine + nicosulfuron (1000 + 40 g/ha), aos 26 DAE e nicosulfuron (60 g/ha), aos 31 DAE. As capinas manuais foram efetuadas nestas mesmas épocas. As plantas daninhas predominantes foram Brachiaria plantaginea, Triticum aestivum, Raphanus raphanistrum, Galinsoga parviflora e <b>Richardia</b> brasiliensis. Observou-se que o atraso na época de controle das plantas daninhas, a partir de dez DAE, afetou negativamente as características das plantas avaliadas, mais acentuadamente para o controle com herbicidas. Exceto o peso de 100 grãos, os demais componentes da produção e a produtividade diminuíram com o atraso na época de controle a partir de dez DAE. With {{the objective}} of evaluating the effect of different timings of weed control performed by hand weeding or herbicide application, on the corn yield and agronomic characteristics, an experiment was {{set up on the}} "Capão da Onça" School Farm (UEPG) in Ponta Grossa - PR, under the no-tillage cropping system. The experimental arrangement employed was a randomized block design in a 2 x 5 factorial with six replications. The hybrid utilized was the XL 212, planted on 11 / 11 / 97. The herbicides used and their respective applications timings were: atrazine (1400 + 1400 g/ha) at 2 and 19 days after the emergence (DAE); atrazine + nicosulfuron (1400 + 12 g/ha) at 8 DAE; atrazine + nicosulfuron (1600 + 20 g/ha) at 19 DAE; atrazine + nicosulfuron (1000 + 40 g/ha) at 26 DAE; and nicosulfuron (60 g/ha) at 31 DAE. The hand weeding procedures being performed at the same timings. The predominant weeds were Brachiaria plantaginea, Triticum aestivum, Raphanus raphanistrum, Galinsoga parviflora and <b>Richardia</b> brasiliensis. It was observed that the delay in weed control timing from ten DAE onward negatively affected the characteristics of the plants evaluated, more markedly so for the control through herbicides. Except for the weight of 100 kernels, the other components of yield and grain yield declined with the delay in control timing from ten DAE onward...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to their direct effects on crop production through competition and allelopathy, weeds can serve as reservoirs of other pests including plant-parasitic nematodes, resulting indirectly in yield loss. Weeds enable plant-parasitic nematodes {{to survive in the}} absence or even presence of the crop, thus providing a source of nematode infection for the following season. The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct a survey of common weeds and associated plant-parasitic nematodes at four agricultural sites, thereby demonstrating the importance of weeds as reservoirs of these pests. Two organic farms and two conventional farming systems were visited. Soil samples were taken from the root zones of predominant weed species at each site, and nematodes were extracted, identified, and counted. Purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.), pigweed (Amaranthus spp.), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), and crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) were the weeds most frequently encountered. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) were the major plant-parasitic nematodes frequently found in association with these weeds in relatively high numbers. A greenhouse experiment confirmed the susceptibility of American black nightshade (Solanum American Mill.), yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.), purple nutsedge (C. rotundus L., Florida pusley (<b>Richardia</b> scabra L.), and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) to M. incognita, but Virginia pepperweed (Lepidium virginicum L.) was relatively resistant to this nematode. The implications of these results and importance of weeds as hosts for plant-parasitic nematodes are discussed...|$|E
