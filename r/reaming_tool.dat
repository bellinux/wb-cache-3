40|$|This article {{presents}} an original study about {{the dynamic of}} a machining operation based on the coupling receptance methodology. The Frequency Response Function (FRF) of a machine tool is numerically coupled with the FRF matrix of a multi-stage <b>reaming</b> <b>tool</b> in order to predict its dynamic behavior during the operation. This coupling results in a mix of measured and numerical FRF matrix and is used for solving the stability prediction of the operation with an analytical methodology. Stability lobes are computed in respect with the load factor. It {{is shown in the}} paper that this methodology is suitable for adjusting the cutting conditions {{in the case of a}} given operation where the tool is identified but also for a numerical model of a tool, for instance at a design stage. As a conclusion, the presented methodology can help to target the best cutting conditions for a given machine-tool and toll but also help the manufacturer in the tool choice or design in order to guaranty the stability of the operation...|$|E

50|$|It is {{also used}} on a lathe to hold {{drilling}} or <b>reaming</b> <b>tools</b> for machining {{a hole in the}} work piece. Unlike drilling with a drill press or a milling machine, the tool is stationary while the workpiece rotates. Holes can only be cut along the axis that the workpiece is set to spin.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} of production engineering for a precision hole are {{to ensure the}} required quality as well as minimal production costs. The interactions between machine, tool and the pre-drilled hole result in uncertainties during the final reaming process. For this purpose the reaming process itself {{and the appearance of}} process faults were focused in a large number of publications. Due {{to the fact that the}} reaming process is an inherent part of a process chain and thus directly linked to a pre-machining process (drilling process), the influence of a pre-drilled hole is neglected till date. For that reason the present paper deals with the influence of a diagonal pre-drilled hole on the reaming process with multi blade tools. Pretests show that the radial deviation of the pre-drilled hole seems to be an important input parameter for the reaming process within the process chain. Based on this new input parameter the question whether the <b>reaming</b> <b>tool</b> follows the path of the pre-drilled hole or not has arisen. To achieve a better understanding of this issue, cutting tests were accomplished to investigate this influence. For this purpose, holes with different radial deviations were manufactured on a five axis machining center and reamed in a second step. The bored holes were evaluated with the help of a coordinat...|$|E
