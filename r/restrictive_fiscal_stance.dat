40|$|This paper explores some {{potential}} determinants of exchange rate credibility {{with reference to}} the Italian experience of the 1990 's. The analysis relies on a nonlinear framework emphasizing shifts between credible and non-credible states, and assuming a significant degree of persistence in the above regimes. Almost all fiscal and debt management indicators display significant effects on devaluation expectations. The main policy implications of the paper are that a <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance,</b> a lengthening of average debt maturity and an increase in the share of foreign-denomnated debt are crucial to stabilize the Lira exchange rate and to qualify Italy in the former group of countries which will join EMU...|$|E
40|$|The closing decade for Italy {{has been}} marked by the most {{important}} fiscal consolidation effort among the euro zone countries. The discretionary dimension of consolidation, although pursued in an unstable political environment, has been significant and the effort entirely structural. Italy has not completely allowed fiscal stabilisers to work and stabilisation has been based on pro-cyclical tax growth. The <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance,</b> coupled with tight monetary conditions has penalised growth, amplified the gap with the European Union and caused a fall in households disposable income. The increase in tax revenues, {{as a result of a}} comprehensive reform of taxation and of the tax declaration procedure, has allowed to lower personal income tax.

40|$|The {{first and}} a half year of term of the new right-wing {{government}} in Italy translated neither into the « second economic miracle », announced during the campaign, nor into the reforming momentum impressed by the previous left-wing coalition. The policy-mix counting on keynesian revival of domestic demand and on supply-side policies, failed to improve the sluggish economic situation. The announcements of tax amnesties and incentives, aimed at feeding a virtuous circle which would amplify the effects of economic policy, proved ineffective. Their lack of credibility and their inability to dissipate uncertainty favoured saving rather than investment and consumption. No progress in structural reforms was made. Further tax reform is now constrained by a <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance,</b> while a more comprehensive reform of welfare is no more among government priorities.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an intense debate among economists about the causes of {{unemployment}} in Europe. Broadly speaking, the views can be grouped into two familiar camps: those with a more (neo-) classical outlook - stressing the importance of factor price movements, institutional rigidities and structural change - and those with a more Keynesian leaning, focusing on the <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy <b>stance</b> in Europe or the long-term hyster- 2) esis effects of the worldwide recession of 1981 - 82. Lately, a new intermediate position has been added by Fitoussi, Phelps (1988), who point to the crowding-out of investment in Europe through the peculiar American policy mix of the eighties, thus making the United States the culprit of Europe's malaise. All major Keynesian positions (and also the one by Fitoussi, Phelps) rely on the tacit, but crucial assumption that - by and large - the unemployment of the eighties is an analytically new phenomenon to be explained separately from the experience of the seventies which is by now grudgingly admitted to have been a period of more classical than Keynesian unemployment. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to show that this assumption is not warranted so that, at least in some important respectsj the eighties are simply the natural continuation and maybe culmination of developments which go back to the seventies. Empirically, we shall make our case for one country only, the Federal Republic of Germany, but similar lines of reasoning may apply to other EEC countries, of course with proper adjustments and qualifications. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of fiscal policy in Russia since the 1998 crisis along several dimensions, {{using a variety of}} indicators. Russia has progressed tremendously in recent years on public debt sustainability, largely thanks {{to the fact that the}} real interest rates on public debt have been negative and growth has been high. However, the constant oil-price balance shows a progressive worsening starting in 2001, with a modest reversal in 2004. The analysis of the non-oil fiscal balance shows that Russian fiscal policy has had a mixed record. Part of the windfalls were spent before the introduction of the oil stabilization fund, but most of the oil revenues have been saved during the last two year. This poses an important challenge for future years when the automatic saving mechanism provided by the oil stabilization fund will be weakened by the approved increase in the reference oil price. The standard fiscal impulse shows that budget policy has not contributed to the increase in aggregate demand since 2003. However, the fiscal position was not tight enough to contain the inflationary effects of the exceptional oil windfalls on the economy as a whole.

The main objective is to compare macro-financial conditions and policies {{in the run-up to the}} crisis as well as to compare the policy responses to it, so as to highlight, inter alia, possible country-specific constraints. While sharing a common pre-crisis pattern of strong capital inflows and robust growth, a key difference in the conduct of macroeconomicpolicies is that some countries adopted expansionary (and procyclical) fiscal policies. These moves exacerbated external vulnerabilities and compromised the ability to discretionarily use the fiscal instrument in acountercyclical fashion.

The estimated fiscal vulnerabilities stem from disproportionate policy responses concerning government expenditures and a lacking discipline to control pro-cyclical fiscal spending.

This paper proposes an indicator of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> which computes the fiscal adjustment required to reach a specific debt-GDP targeted given the forecasts of future deficit and interest rates obtained from an unrestricted (recursively-estimated) VAR model. The index is easy to compute and can be decomposed to disclose the different contribution of revenue, expenditure, nominal yields, inflation and growth to the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance.</b> For this reason it provides a transparent and detailed measure of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance,</b> particularly suitable for multi-country surveillance. As a result, the index improves on the tax-gap indicators widely used by governments and international agencies, and is far more informative than formal econometric tests of fiscal sustainability. The time series of the indicator for individual EU countries and the US show that their fiscal position has fluctuated considerably over the last 40 years, and has particularly deteriorated since 2007. The index predicts that the adjustment required to restore pre-crisis debt-GDP levels are higher for high debt countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. They become more severe the shorter is the time horizon for the adjustment. As a large degree of uncertainty surrounds the assessment of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> in the medium and long run, we argue that policy makers should inform their policy based on the worst case scenario predicted by the indicator...|$|R
40|$|Despite large {{automatic}} stabilizers, {{the performance}} of the Euro area as a whole in terms of fiscal stabilization is relatively poor. This report argues that a meaningful <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> for the Euro area should rely on the current account as a complement to the output gap, and be coordinated only in 2 ̆ 01 cexceptional 2 ̆ 01 d times, the usual bottom-up approach of fiscal policy remaining appropriate for 2 ̆ 01 cnormal 2 ̆ 01 d times. In such setting, the European Fiscal Board would {{play a key role in}} advising the Commission on the existence of 2 ̆ 01 cexceptional 2 ̆ 01 d circumstances, on the adequate aggregate <b>fiscal</b> <b>stance</b> and on its desirable distribution across member states...|$|R

On the structural front, significant progress was achieved in fiscal management, the privatization of small- and medium-size enterprises, and trade and price liberalization. Executive Directors underscored that Azerbaijan faces the challenge of achieving sustainable growth of non-oil output, diversifying the economy, and reducing poverty while maintaining macroeconomic stability {{at a time when}} oil revenue is projected to increase substantially.
