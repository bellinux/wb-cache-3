It is found that, after cooling in electric fields down to the CM phase, the magnetic chirality {{is proportional to the}} <b>electric</b> <b>polarization.</b> Also we confirmed that the magnetic chirality can be switched by the polarity of the <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> in both the CM and LT-ICM phases. These facts suggest an intimate coupling between the magnetic chirality and the <b>electric</b> <b>polarization.</b> However, upon the transition from the CM to LT-ICM phase, the reduction of the <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> is not accompanied by any reduction of the magnetic chirality, implying that the CM and LT-ICM phases contain different mechanisms of the magnetoelectric coupling.

40|$|Ferroelectric {{compounds}} {{possess a}} spontaneous and reversible <b>electric</b> <b>polarization,</b> P. Magnetic materials, {{on the other}} hand, display a spontaneous order of magnetic dipoles induced by electron spins. The cross-coupling between P and magnetism, which can potentially lead to novel memory storage devices, is found in magnetoelectric compounds, where magnetization can be induced by an applied electric field (or vice versa), and in so-called magnetic ferroelectrics, where a spontaneous polarization is induced by spin ordering. Understanding the physics underlying the rich variety of observed phenomena in these compounds is both of fundamental and technological interest. In this thesis we study model Hamiltonians for compounds in which magnetic ordering and <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> are coupled. Using symmetry considerations, the form of microscopic couplings between spins and <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> are obtained for different systems. These expressions are used to reveal the mechanism behind the magnetoelectric effect in Cr 2 O 3 and to find the origin of so-called electromagnon excitations in YMn 2 O 5. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of materials with so-called magnetic spiral states allows us to explain a number of recently observed phenomena, in which <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> is controlled by an applied magnetic field. These include the rotation of <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> by rotating an applied magnetic field, and the clamping of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain walls. Finally, novel effects, such as the high-temperature induction of <b>electric</b> <b>polarization</b> by arrays of ferromagnetic domain walls, are predicted. ...|$|R

This compound is a rare example of coupled hysteretic behavior in the magnetic and electric properties. The ferromagnetic-like magnetic hysteresis loop that couples to hysteretic polarization can be attributed not to ordinary ferromagnetic domains, but to the rich physics of magnetic frustration of Ising-like spins in the axial next-nearest neighbor interaction model.
