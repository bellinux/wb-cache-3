5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. <b>Ringworm</b> is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as <b>ringworm,</b> candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as <b>ringworm</b> and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, <b>ringworm,</b> sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

So, this study was aimed to check the prevalence of dermatophytosis in dogs, cats, and in pet owners. Materials and Methods: A total of 362 clinically suspected cases of dermatophytosis from dogs (123 in number), cats (202 in number), and human beings (37 in number) were collected and studied from in and around Kolkata to detect the presence of significant dermatophytes. Direct microscopy and cultural examination of the isolates were performed following standard methodology. Identification and characterization of the isolates were done by different biochemical tests.

5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection.

50|$|Given {{the climate}} of the Cold War, there was an {{increase}} in the amount of interest in radioactive material in the United States. One of the main experimenters at the Holmesburg prison was Dr. Albert M. Kligman who shared this same interest in radioactive materials. Dr. Kligman would end up applying for a By-Product Material License to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to store radioactive isotopes for the purpose of testing on Holmesburg prisoners. Before this climate, the use of radioactive isotopes had been restricted to X-ray machines which were used for diagnoses and treatment against <b>ringworms.</b> One of Dr. Klingman’s first radioactive experimenting protocols was testing the turnover rate of the human skin in a study entitled “Studies of Human Epidermal Turnover Time Using S35 Cysteine and H3 Thymidine and of Cutaneous Permeability Using C14 Testosterone and Corticosteroid.”  In these studies, human skin was radioactively labeled and male patients were recruited from the Holmesburg prison from 21 to 50 years old. In these studies anywhere from 50 to 200 subjects had been tested upon. Dr. Kligman stated that the radioactive thymidine posed no threat to the patients because it was “excised within minutes” and that radioactive materials were never consciously left within an inmate’s body.  The use of radioactive thymidine was eventually disapproved in 1965.   These studies were overseen by the dermatology department at the University of Pennsylvania.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{nutritional}} status and morbidity pattern of primary school children. Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional study was administered {{in the five}} governmental schools located in Dhankuta town (Dhankuta district) and Ineruwa town (Sunsari district). The schools were selected using simple random sampling technique. From these selected schools, a total number of 818 students studying from Grade I to V were enumerated in the study using census survey method. Results: Among 818 students, 61 % {{of the students were}} found to be malnourished. The students were more stunted (21. 5 %) than wasted (10. 4 %). Only 5. 4 % of the students were found to be both wasted and stunted. The collected blood and stool samples from the students revealed parasitic infestation of 65. 8 % and anaemia of 58 %. The most common diseases in those schools were: skin diseases (20 %), dental caries (19. 8 %), and lymphodenopathy (10. 5 %). Among skin diseases, pediculosis was more common among girls while <b>ringworms</b> and scabies were common among boys. Conclusion: The study revealed that high percentage of primary school students was malnourished. It was found that there was a high prevalence of parasitic infestation and anaemia.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of biological products from forests has become common in providing critical sources of medicine, food, and fodder and cash income, making dry forests the largest natural supermarket {{for millions of people}} in sub Saharan Africa. The study examined the role of Non-Timber Forest Products in the enhancement of rural livelihoods in ward 8 of Chirumanzu District. The study identified and evaluated the role of NTFPs using quantitave and qualitative approaches. Data was acquired through the use of questionnaires, interviews, observations and secondary sources of data. The researcher then used Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) to evaluate data. The study results confirmed that the households harvested four categories of NTFPs that include foods, medicinal plants, leafy vegetables and construction materials. Biological products harvested played a pivotal role in the enhancement of rural livelihoods by providing sustainable diets, ethno pharmaceutical uses and ethno veterinary uses. Ethno pharmaceutical uses included the utilisation of Aloe Vera (Zumbani) as a mosquito repellent and Ximenia (mutsvanzvabere) is used for treating livestock <b>ringworms.</b> The researcher observed that each household harvested an average yield of 300 kgs of Vitex Payos (tsvubvu), 500 kgs of Miombo leaf litter (murakwani) and 400 kgs of thatch grass. Commercialization of NTFPs also enhanced household incomes of US$ 545 per season which was above the poverty datum line of a family of 5. The researcher found out that the indigenous fruits provided more nutritional benefits than exotic fruits and are important in poverty alleviation for example Strychinos spinosa (matamba) has a K content of 1370 d whilst most exotic fruits like oranges have a Kcal content of 400 d. This proves that some indigenous fruit trees are more nutritional than exotic trees. The respondents are highly dependent on Miombo leafy litter because of limited access to inorganic fertiliser. This study recommends that Chirumanzu Rural District Council (RDC) should maintain and upgrade the communication infrastructure to enhance NTFPs market base through accessible road networks. Overally, the research findings concluded that NTFPs are pivotal for the enhancement of rural livelihoods...|$|R
25|$|Clotrimazole may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of tinea corporis (<b>ringworm),</b> tinea cruris (jock itch) and tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{steroids and}} {{antibiotic}} ointments such as Neosporin {{have not only}} shown to be ineffective in treating dermatophytosis caused by Aphanoascus fulvescens, but have {{also been shown to}} enhance its fungal growth. <b>Ringworm</b> infections caused by A.fulvescens in animals have been successfully treated with anti-fungal drugs such as Tinactin, which contains tolnaftate as its active ingredient, and Grisactin, which contains griseofulvin as its active ingredient. However, topical treatment of human A.fulvescens infections with tolnaftate-containing drugs has been shown to worsen the lesions, causing further inflammation and increased sensitivity. Treatment with griseofulvin has proven somewhat effective in reducing lesion sizes and appears to have a dose-dependent effect. It should be noted however that while lesions continue to heal after increased griseofulvin administration, there is some residual scarring of the infected area. Currently, there is no documentation providing evidence of an anti-fungal treatment that is completely effective against human dermatophytosis caused by A.fulvescens.|$|E

30|$|Although SAH {{measure is}} widely used in {{empirical}} research, for a given true but unobserved health state, if survey respondents report their health differently depending on certain characteristics like conceptions of general health, utilization of health services, expectations for own health, financial incentives to report ill health, and comprehension of the survey questions, measurement error in SAH is no longer random. Bound (1991) highlights if measurement error in a given variable is not “classical,” it can introduce serious biases in estimates leading to simple attenuation to misattributing relationships. Economic circumstances and geographic location may alter health expectations through factors like peer effects, societal norm, and access to medical care. Reporting of health may vary with education through the awareness factor, i.e., conceptions of illness, understanding of disease {{and knowledge of the}} availability, access, and effectiveness of health care. Antman and McKenzie (2007) and Escobal and Laszlo (2008) point a number of reasons why measurement error may be more of a problem in developing country settings for which validation data are not readily available. It becomes particularly problematic as there can be high degree of heterogeneity among the respondents in this setting in terms of literacy level and health awareness. Noteworthy {{is the fact that the}} state of Kerala (with one of the lowest levels of mortality among Indian states) has consistently reported the highest morbidity rate (approximately three times the all-India average) in three successive rounds of nationally represented survey NSS, whereas in contrast, Bihar, with one of the highest mortality rates, reported the lowest morbidity. Banerjee et al. (2004) mentions that sick individuals in a poor disease endemic area, with limited health access or opportunities for medical treatment, may report being in good health because some type of illnesses may be perceived as “normal” phenomena due to their prolonged, widespread occurrence in the area, where people might be adapted to the sickness that they experience. Schultz and Strauss (2008) mention some illnesses such as blindness, <b>ringworms,</b> or malaria may be perceived as normal phenomena due to their prolonged, widespread occurrence in a disease prone area without health access, where individuals may not see themselves as particularly unhealthy.|$|R
