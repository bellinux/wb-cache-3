40|$|Adenoviral vectors can direct {{high-level}} {{expression of}} a transgene, but, due to a host immune response to adenoviral antigens, expression is of limited duration, and repetitive administration has generally been unsuccessful. Exposure to foreign proteins beginning in the neonatal period may alter or ablate the immune response. We injected adult and neonatal (immunocompetent) CD- 1 mice intravenously with an adenoviral vector expressing human blood coagulation factor IX. In both groups of mice, expression of human factor IX persisted for 12 - 16 weeks. However, in mice initially injected as adults, <b>repeat</b> <b>administration</b> of the vector resulted in no detectable expression of the transgene, whereas in mice initially injected in the neonatal period, <b>repeat</b> <b>administration</b> resulted in high-level expression of human factor IX. We show that animals that fail to express the transgene on <b>repeat</b> <b>administration</b> have developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies to adenovirus, whereas those that do express factor IX have not.

25|$|Antibodies {{are a key}} {{component}} of the adaptive immune response, playing a central role in both in the recognition of foreign antigens and the stimulation of an immune response to them. The advent of monoclonal antibody technology has made it possible to raise antibodies against specific antigens presented on the surfaces of tumors. Monoclonal antibodies can be acquired in the immune system via passive immunity or active immunity.The advantage of active monoclonal antibody therapy {{is the fact that the}} immune system will produce antibodies long-term, with only a short-term drug administration to induce this response. However, the immune response to certain antigens may be inadequate, especially in the elderly. Additionally, adverse reactions from these antibodies may occur because of long-lasting response to antigens. Passive monoclonal antibody therapy can ensure consistent antibody concentration, and can control for adverse reactions by stopping administration. However, the <b>repeated</b> <b>administration</b> and consequent higher cost for this therapy are major disadvantages.|$|E
40|$|The {{intravenous}} injection of concanavalin A (Con A) activates T cells and induces cytokine dependent liver injury in mice.

In spleen cells prepared from repeated Con A treated mice, the production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma 24 h after co-incubation with Con A decreased, and that of IL- 4 and IL- 10 increased. In naive mice, plasma ALT level after Con A injection was decreased by the transfer of spleen cells prepared from the repeated Con A treated mice.

The caudate-putamen and accumbens, comprising the basal ganglia input structures, and the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, lateral and medial habenula, mesopontine rostromedial tegmental nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex exhibited Fos expression enhanced by acute self-administration of cocaine (SAC), but desensitized after <b>repeated</b> <b>administrations.</b> Fos expression was mainly enhanced by acutely self-administered cocaine in basal ganglia output and intrinsic structures and the intermediate nucleus of lateral septum, medial division of the central amygdaloid nucleus and zona incerta, but, in contrast, was sensitized in these structures after <b>repeated</b> <b>administrations.</b> Acute and <b>repeated</b> SAC left Fos expression unaffected or marginally enhanced in most extended amygdala structures, of which nearly all, however, exhibited robustly increased Fos expression after repeated saline self-administration, occasionally to levels exceeding those elicited by cocaine. Thus, self-administered cocaine mainly elicits Fos expression, which persists or increases with <b>repeated</b> <b>administrations</b> in some structures, but declines in others. In addition, Fos expression is sensitized in most extended amygdala structures merely by the act of repeated self-administering.

Subsequently, these assays were used to quantify vector-derived mRNA after delivery of naked DNA and DNA/liposome formulations expressing human and murine cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to the mouse airways. Vector-derived mRNA was detected in samples following the delivery of naked DNA or DNA/liposomes to the mouse airways, and no reduction in vector-derived mRNA was observed upon <b>repeat</b> <b>administration,</b> a finding that is consistent with the murine and human CFTR being tolerated by the mouse.

2500|$|Initial {{studies found}} that upon acute and <b>repeated</b> <b>administration,</b> {{tianeptine}} decreased the extracellular levels of serotonin in rat brain without a decrease in serotonin release and it was hence called a [...] "(selective) serotonin reuptake enhancer".

Its other active metabolites include the minor active metabolites temazepam and oxazepam. These metabolites are conjugated with glucuronide, and are excreted primarily in the urine. Because of these active metabolites, the serum values of diazepam alone are not useful in predicting the effects of the drug. Diazepam has a biphasic half-life of about one to three days, and two to seven days for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. [...] Most of the drug is metabolised; very little diazepam is excreted unchanged.

Western analysis confirmed that AdOprF. RGD.

Intramuscular immunization of C 57 BL/ 6 mice with AdOprF. RGD. Epi 8 resulted in the generation of anti-OprF antibodies at comparable levels to those induced following immunization with AdOprF, but immunization with AdOprF. RGD. Epi 8 was associated with increased CD 4 and CD 8 gamma interferon T-cell responses against OprF as well as increased survival against lethal pulmonary challenge with agar-encapsulated P. aeruginosa. Importantly, <b>repeat</b> <b>administration</b> of AdOprF. RGD.

40|$|Cognitive {{deficits in}} {{schizophrenia}} are severe and affect multiple cognitive modalities. These impairments are not adequately treated by currently available medications, and their etiology remains poorly understood. Translational animal models of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are crucially {{important for the}} investigation of the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia and the development of more effective treatments for these deficits. The noncompetitive N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) has become widely accepted as an inducing condition in models of various aspects of schizophrenia. Through exploration of a variety of doses and injection schedules, we developed a <b>repeated</b> PCP <b>administration</b> regimen that reliably induces cognitive deficits with relevance to schizophrenia. While a single injection of PCP nonspecifically suppressed responding in the 5 -choice serial reaction time task (5 -CSRTT), a test of multiple cognitive modalities, <b>repeated</b> PCP <b>administration</b> following our regimen selectively impaired attention, increased impulsivity, disrupted cognitive flexibility, and slowed processing speed, as assessed by the 5 -CSRTT. The <b>repeated</b> PCP <b>administration</b> regimen also disinhibited impulsive responding and reduced task efficiency in the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure, a test of reward function. Chronic treatment with clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic medication with partial effectiveness on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, attenuated the attentional impairment and impulsivity induced by <b>repeated</b> PCP <b>administration</b> in the 5 -CSRTT, as well as the PCP-induced disinhibition of responding in the ICSS procedure. Chronic quetiapine, another atypical antipsychotic with a different receptor profile than clozapine, and chronic nicotine did not attenuate disruptions of 5 -CSRTT performance by <b>repeated</b> PCP <b>administration.</b> Acute administration of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 / 3 (mGluR 2 / 3) agonist LY 379268 exacerbated 5 -CSRTT disruptions induced by <b>repeated</b> PCP <b>administration.</b> The mGluR 2 / 3 antagonist LY 341495 did not affect PCP-induced 5 -CSRTT deficits when administered acutely and attenuated PCP-induced increases in 5 -CSRTT timeout responding when delivered chronically. <b>Repeated</b> PCP <b>administration</b> blunted the increase in glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and chronic clozapine treatment attenuated the increased PFC glutamate efflux induced by repeated PCP.
