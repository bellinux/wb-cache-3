5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, <b>rasagiline),</b> promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and <b>rasagiline)</b> {{increase the}} amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to potentially toxic amphetamine metabolites caused by selegiline, another promising treatment is in MAO B propargyl amine inhibitor <b>rasagiline</b> (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))). The oral bioavailability of <b>rasagiline</b> is 35%, it reaches T(max) after 0.5–1.0 hours and its half-life is 1.5–3.5 hours. <b>Rasagiline</b> undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by cytochrome P450 type 1A2 (CYP1A2). <b>Rasagiline</b> is initiated at 1-mg once-daily dose as monotherapy in early PD patients and at 0.5–1.0mg once-daily as adjunctive to levodopa in advanced PD patients.|$|E

25|$|Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, {{headquartered}} in Petah Tikva, Israel, {{is the largest}} generic drug manufacturer {{in the world and}} one of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. It specializes in generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients and has developed proprietary pharmaceuticals such as Copaxone and Laquinimod for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and <b>Rasagiline</b> for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Selegiline {{is partly}} metabolized to levomethamphetamine (L-methamphetamine), {{one of the}} two enantiomers of methamphetamine, in vivo. While these {{metabolites}} may contribute to the drug's ability to inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, they have also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and hallucinations in some people. A newer antiparkinson MAO-B inhibitor, <b>rasagiline,</b> metabolizes into 1(R)-aminoindan which has no amphetamine-like characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline and <b>rasagiline)</b> {{increase}} {{the level of}} dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolization. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, reducing MAO-B results in higher quantities of L-DOPA in the striatum. Similarly to dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors improve motor symptoms and delay the need of taking levodopa when used as monotherapy in the first stages of the disease, but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa. Evidence on their efficacy in the advanced stage is reduced, although it points towards them being useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. Although an initial study indicated selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, this has been later disproven.|$|E
25|$|GAPDH {{has been}} implicated in several {{neurodegenerative}} diseases and disorders, largely through interactions with other proteins specific to that disease or disorder. These interactions may affect not only energy metabolism but also other GAPDH functions. For example, GAPDH interactions with beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) could interfere with its function regarding the cytoskeleton or membrane transport, while interactions with huntingtin could interfere with its function regarding apoptosis, nuclear tRNA transport, DNA replication, and DNA repair. In addition, nuclear translocation of GAPDH {{has been reported in}} Parkinson's disease (PD), and several anti-apoptotic PD drugs, such as <b>rasagiline,</b> function by preventing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. It is proposed that hypometabolism may be one contributor to PD, but the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH involvement in neurodegenerative disease remains to be clarified. The SNP rs3741916 in the 5' UTR of the GAPDH gene may be associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5000|$|The FDA drug label {{carries a}} {{warning of the}} risk of {{serotonin}} syndrome when <b>rasagiline</b> is used with antidepressants or with meperidine. [...] However the risk appears to be low, based on a multicenter retrospective study in 1504 people, which looked for serotonin syndrome in people with PD who were treated with <b>rasagiline</b> plus antidepressants, <b>rasagiline</b> without antidepressants, or antidepressants plus Parkinson's drugs other than either <b>rasagiline</b> or selegiline; no cases were identified.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to potentially toxic amphetamine metabolites caused by selegiline, another promising treatment is in MAO B propargyl amine inhibitor <b>rasagiline</b> (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))).

50|$|There {{is a risk}} of {{psychosis}} or bizarre behavior if <b>rasagiline</b> is {{used with}} dextromethorphan {{and there is a}} risk of non-selective MAO inhibition and hypertensive crisis if <b>rasagiline</b> is used with other MAO inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{discoverer}} of {{the anti}} Parkinson {{activity of the}} medications selelgiline (l-deprenyl) and <b>rasagiline</b> which {{is considered to be}} the first disease modifying drug used for Parkinson's disease and ladostigil for Alzheimer's disease. Experts have recently questioned whether <b>rasagiline</b> actually has significant disease modifying properties.|$|E
50|$|MAO inhibitors within 14 days. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, <b>rasagiline,</b> selegiline, and tranylcypromine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rasagiline</b> has {{not been}} tested in {{pregnant}} women and is Pregnancy Category C in the US.|$|E
50|$|Racemic <b>rasagiline</b> was {{discovered}} and patented by Aspro Nicholas in the 1970s {{as a drug}} candidate for treatment of hypertension.|$|E
50|$|People who {{are taking}} meperidine, tramadol, methadone, propoxyphene, dextromethorphan, St. John’s wort, cyclobenzaprine, or another MAO {{inhibitor}} should not take <b>rasagiline.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Rasagiline</b> {{was tested}} for {{efficacy}} {{in people with}} multiple system atrophy in a large randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind disease-modification trial; the drug failed.|$|E
5000|$|Moussa B.H. Youdim {{developed}} <b>Rasagiline,</b> a drug marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals as Azilect (TM) for {{the treatment}} of neurodegenerative disease, especially Parkinsons.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rasagiline</b> is molecularly a propargylamine derivative. [...] The form {{brought to}} market by Teva and its {{partners}} is the mesylate salt, and was designated chemically as: 1H-Inden-1-amine-2,3-dihydro-N-2-propynyl-(1R)-methanesulfonate.|$|E
50|$|Selegiline {{itself has}} neuroprotective and neuro-rescuing effects, but {{concern over the}} {{resulting}} levomethamphetamine's neurotoxicity led to development of alternative MAOB inhibitors such as <b>rasagiline,</b> that do not produce toxic metabolites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rasagiline</b> (Azilect, TVP-1012, N-propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan) is an {{irreversible}} inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B {{used as a}} monotherapy {{to treat}} symptoms in early Parkinson's disease or as an adjunct therapy in more advanced cases.|$|E
50|$|Teva {{conducted}} {{clinical trials}} attempting {{to prove that}} <b>rasagiline</b> did not just treat symptoms, but was a disease-modifying drug - that it actually prevented {{the death of the}} dopaminergic neurons that characterize Parkinson's disease and slowed disease progression. They conducted two clinical trials, called TEMPO and ADAGIO, to try to prove this. The FDA advisory committee rejected their claim in 2011, saying that the clinical trial results did not prove that <b>rasagiline</b> was neuroprotective. The main reason was that in one of the trials, the lower dose was effective at slowing progression, but the higher dose was not, and this made no sense in light of standard dose-response pharmacology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rasagiline</b> is used {{to treat}} {{symptoms}} of Parkinson's disease both alone and {{in combination with other}} drugs. It has shown efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinsons, and appears to be especially useful in dealing with non-motor symptoms like fatigue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rasagiline</b> {{is broken}} down via CYP1A2, {{part of the}} {{cytochrome}} P450 metabolic path in the liver. It is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency and its use should be monitored carefully in patients taking other drugs that alter the normal effectiveness of this metabolic path.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rasagiline</b> {{is a drug}} {{to treat}} Parkinson's disease {{discovered}} by Prof. Moussa B.H. Youdim of Technion and John Finberg. It was developed in collaboration with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd, in Israel. Having won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the drug is now marketed worldwide as AzilectTM.|$|E
50|$|DOPAC can be {{oxidized}} by hydrogen peroxide, {{leading to}} the formation of toxic metabolites which destroy dopamine storage vesicles in the substantia nigra. This may contribute to the failure of levodopa treatment of Parkinson's disease. A MAO-B inhibitor such as selegiline or <b>rasagiline</b> can prevent this from happening.|$|E
50|$|The FDA label {{contains}} {{warnings that}} <b>rasagiline</b> may cause severe hypertension or hypotension, may make people sleepy, may make motor control worse in some people, may cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior, may cause impulse control disorder, {{may increase the}} risk of melanoma, and upon withdrawal may cause high fever or confusion.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the older}} antiparkinson drugs {{selegiline}} and <b>rasagiline,</b> safinamide is a selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, reducing degradation of dopamine; {{in contrast to}} the other two, its action is reversible. Safinamide also inhibits glutamate release and dopamine reuptake. Additionally, it blocks sodium and calcium channels, the relevance of which for its antiparkinson action is however unknown.|$|E

50|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the death of cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter. An enzyme called monoamine oxidase (MAO) breaks down neurotransmitters. MAO has two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-B breaks down dopamine. <b>Rasagiline</b> prevents the breakdown of dopamine by irreversibly binding to MAO-B. Dopamine is therefore more available, somewhat compensating for the diminished quantities made in the brains of people with Parkinson's.|$|E
50|$|Moussa Youdim, a biochemist, {{had been}} {{involved}} in developing selegiline as a drug for Parkinsons, in collaboration with Peter Reiderer. He wanted to find a similar compound that would have fewer side effects, and around 1977, {{at about the same time}} he moved from London to Haifa to join the faculty of Technion, he noticed that <b>rasagiline</b> could potentially be such a compound. He called that compound, AGN 1135.|$|E
50|$|Selegiline was {{the first}} {{selective}} MAO-B inhibitor. It is partly metabolized to levomethamphetamine (l-methamphetamine), {{one of the two}} enantiomers of methamphetamine, in vivo.
