500|$|Devastated, {{she left}} court {{for a month}} of {{mourning}} before returning to her post at her mother's side. The Queen's journal reports that Queen Victoria [...] "ent over to Beatrice's <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> a while with her. She is so piteous in her misery." [...] Despite her grief, Beatrice remained her mother's faithful companion, and as Queen Victoria aged, she relied more heavily on Beatrice for dealing with correspondence. However, realising that Beatrice needed a place of her own, she gave her the Kensington Palace apartments once occupied by the Queen and her mother. The Queen appointed Beatrice to the governorship of the Isle of Wight, vacated by Prince Henry's death. In response to Beatrice's interest in photography, the Queen had a darkroom installed at Osborne House. The changes in the family, including Beatrice's preoccupation with her mother, may have affected her children, who rebelled at school. Beatrice wrote that Ena was [...] "troublesome and rebellious", and that Alexander was telling [...] "unwarrantable untruths".|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E
2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer came into the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on the table behind us. This {{is one of the}} most cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer asked me what I would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E
60|$|Lutchester {{was welcomed}} {{as an old}} friend by both the Ambassador and his wife. The former drew him to a divan from which he could watch the {{entrance}} to the <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> by his side.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked up}} <b>and</b> down the <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>sat</b> silently Watching him.|$|R
60|$|John, who {{had been}} walking about the <b>room,</b> came <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down {{opposite}} to his brother. He leaned a little forward.|$|R
60|$|Her hostess quietly {{crossed the}} <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down by her side.|$|E
60|$|Austen {{crossed the}} <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> {{on the edge}} of the desk beside his father's chair.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cliffe {{was resting}} before dinner when Evelyn entered her <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down without speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose they}} are gone by this time,' said Anne, as Lady Merton left the <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>sat</b> down to her desk to write to her brother.|$|R
60|$|So Maria Port <b>sat</b> in her <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{the ladies}} <b>sat</b> {{in the parlor}} below; <b>and</b> they <b>sat,</b> <b>and</b> they <b>sat,</b> <b>and</b> they <b>sat,</b> <b>and</b> at last it began to grow dark.|$|R
60|$|He {{went to his}} <b>room</b> <b>and</b> shaved, <b>sat</b> for a {{long time}} thinking, and then {{suddenly}} knelt by his bed and prayed. He had never prayed before in all his life....|$|R
60|$|Then Mrs. Kinnaird quietly {{closed the}} door before she crossed the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down near the girl.|$|E
60|$|Kramer {{went into}} the control <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down at the control board. Looking at the useless {{apparatus}} made him feel strange.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Porter {{went to her}} <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down to think. She was a {{woman of}} action, and she soon reached a decision.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel stalked {{out of the}} <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> Mrs. Clibborn <b>sat</b> down to meditate.|$|R
60|$|He {{came into}} her <b>room</b> {{presently}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down by her fireside. She had gone to her dressing-table and unfastened a necklace; now with this winking and glittering in her hand she came and stood beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{accepted}} his suggestion; and {{he ordered the}} tea. While it was coming, he walked up <b>and</b> down the <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>sat</b> by the fire, and not a word passed between us on either side.|$|R
60|$|Without {{even taking}} her bonnet off Mary {{dropped into a}} chair when she entered her <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> there till Margot brought in the broth.|$|E
60|$|While {{he waited}} in the library for Mr. Forbes to return from Fairview a man was shown into the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down quietly in a corner.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oho!' he {{said when}} he had regained his own <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> himself down in a chair with his arms akimbo. 'Oho! Are you there, my friend? In-deed!' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{fact was}} made {{apparent}} to Christie one evening {{when she went}} down to the weekly gathering in one of the melancholy moods which sometimes oppressed her. She felt dissatisfied with herself because her interest in all things began to flag, and a restless longing for some new excitement to break up the monotonous pain of her inner life possessed her. Being still a little shy in company, she slipped quietly into a recess which commanded a view of both <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> looking listlessly about her while waiting for David, who seldom failed to come.|$|R
60|$|Cynthia rose, with a {{sense of}} {{something}} in the air which concerned her, and went into the dining room. Was it the light falling from above that brought out the lines of his face so strongly? Cynthia did not know, but she crossed the <b>room</b> swiftly <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down beside him.|$|R
60|$|So {{they talked}} till the drinks {{had been brought}} and paid for, till another little party had quitted the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> they <b>sat</b> in their lonely corner, secure from {{observation}} or from any possibility of eavesdropping. Then Mr. Richard Vanderpole leaned {{forward in his chair}} and dropped his voice.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not answer}} him, or look round. She went to her <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down in the growing dusk to think, with a hot lump in her throat.|$|E
60|$|Kit {{went with}} him to his <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down limply. He was covered with dust and wet with dew; his face was haggard {{and his eyes were}} dull.|$|E
60|$|I left Jacky peeking {{still and}} I went to bed. After {{a long time}} Aunt Tommy came up to my <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down on my bed in the moonlight.|$|E
50|$|The park {{itself is}} named for a now-demolished mansion known as Fairoaks. Built in 1884 by E. Townsend Mix, Fairoaks {{was one of the}} grandest Twin Cities mansions of its era. The house itself had 40 <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on a lavishly {{landscape}} lot two square blocks in size. It was built for William D. Washburn, a lawyer who moved to Minneapolis in 1857 and amassed a fortune in the family milling business. Washburn lived in the house until his death in 1912, at which point he willed the mansion to the Minneapolis Park Board. The park board ultimately found the mansion too expensive to maintain, so it was demolished in 1924.|$|R
60|$|The Prince {{followed}} her slight gesture. Inspector Jacks and Dr. Spencer Whiles were certainly {{just a little}} out of accord with their surroundings. The detective's clothes were too new and his companion's too old. The doctor's clothes indeed were as shabby as his waiting <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> where the sunlight was merciless.|$|R
60|$|They were downstairs. Their feet click-clicked on {{the tiled}} passage. They {{had gone into}} the middle <b>room.</b> Aaron <b>sat</b> <b>and</b> listened.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. We will; don't worry. We'll {{be trouble}} enough.--Nice people," [...] said Hartley, as {{he shut the}} door of their <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down. [...] "But the girl ain't what I call pretty." ...|$|E
60|$|On the {{day after}} Mrs. Ray's visit to Exeter, Tappitt, as was now his almost daily practice, made his way into Mr. Honyman's little back <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> there with his hat on, {{discussing}} his affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never felt}} so blasé in my life before," [...] Ethel Walton whispered, as I handed her a favor. Later, when there was an {{intermission}} in the cotillion, she crossed the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> by my side.|$|E
5000|$|The Otowega Club's clubhouse {{was located}} in the area {{at the corner of}} Linden and Starin. It was later used by the Art Institute of Buffalo before being {{demolished}} after World War II. Burke’s Green initially was an unnamed parcel of park land deeded to the city by Bennett, with a beehive style pile of rocks, that had a water pipe up center that drizzled water over the rocks [...]Eventually this fountain was dismantled and an evergreen was placed in the center. Then in the 1960s the park was dedicated to the memory of F Brendan Burke, and renamed Burke's Green. Bennett's house at 354 Depew Avenue was constructed in the area. It included 24 <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> on 3 acres of land. It was demolished in 1935 and 12 building lots created.|$|R
6000|$|Father Cullen reseated {{himself by}} the fire, and again assumed his {{gaze at the}} hot turf, {{just as he was}} before Ussher came in, and looked hopelessly immovable. Thady shifted about uneasily in his chair, then got up and walked round the <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>sat</b> down again; but the curate wouldn't move. At last Father John ended the affair by saying, ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Wake {{left the}} <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> Christine <b>sat</b> on. Though it still wanted fifteen minutes to the hour at which Nicholas {{had promised to}} be there, she began to grow impatient. After the {{accustomed}} ticking the dead silence was oppressive. But she had not to wait so long as she had expected; steps were heard approaching the door, {{and there was a}} knock.|$|R
