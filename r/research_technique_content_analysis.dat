40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to apply the <b>research</b> <b>technique,</b> <b>content</b> <b>analysis,</b> to the five most widely used United States high school history {{textbooks}}. The textbooks were investigated to obtain an objective, systematic, quantitative, and qualitative description of the textual content concerning the period of World War II. The population studied consisted of the five most widely used high school United States history textbooks. Three categories, people, events, and themes were researched in all five textbooks. Each of 126 specific items were coded from each textbook according to inclusion, frequency, magnitude, and direction. Jury validity was utilized, and three professional historians used as independent coders confirmed instrument reliability. Findings 1. Events were included in a greater percentage than people or themes. 2. American, British, and German political leaders were included more frequently than Russian, Italian, or Japanese leaders. 3. Allied leaders were treated more favorably than the Axis leaders. 4. The specific items were superficially treated with the textbook lacking indepth presentation of many specific items. Conclusions 1. There exists a commonness and similarity among the most widely used United States history textbooks with a distinct lack of differences in that they generally present a series of chronological events and facts. 2. The textbooks less than fully achieve the goals established for history courses by state and national organizations. 3. Omissions, biases, inaccuracies, and distortions appear in the most widely used American history textbooks because of the forces of the mass market and apparent inadequate usage of current historiography.

40|$|One can hear, read or even {{produce the}} same news issue in {{different}} ways by using different types of online news media. General news sites, online news papers, newsgroups, RSS-feeds, news alerts, online news forums, newsletters, wikinews sites, … all these news media cover daily news in their own, specific way. The main purpose of this presentation is not {{to focus on the}} news content itself, but on the formal and structural features of the online news media types. Too often, the internet is studied as one, uniform medium instead of a multiform or meta-medium with different types of online news. More specifically, the level of interactivity, multimediality and hypertextuality (the three main features of the internet and online journalism) differs between the online news media. First, interactivity is related to both the user’s control over content as to one’s possibility to give feedback or start a conversation about a specific topic. Second, multimediality is the extend to which different modalities are integrated into one message. Finally, hypertext {{is the way in which}} different parts and bits of news messages are connected. The result is a non-lineair type of storytelling with one anchor text and a (internal or external) linked matrix of according chunks of information. According to the Limited Capacity Model of Lang (2000), the Cognitive Mediation Model of Eveland (2001) and multiple theories within the domain of cognitive psychology (e. g. structural isomorphism), the formal and structural features have an effect on the cognitive processes while learning from the news media. In this presentation, we discuss the methodological challenges of this research. First, we present the operationalisation of the three features of online news. Second, we present the results of a <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> and examine the difficulties of defining a sample and recording unit. Eventually, we underline the need for a combination of multiple <b>research</b> <b>techniques</b> (<b>content</b> <b>analysis,</b> eye tracking study, think aloud protocol) to fully examine the possible effects of formal and structural features on the cognitive processes while learning from the news media. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{in the field of}} Industrial Relations. It {{concerns}} a micro-level investigation of the dynamics of public sector industrial relations in post-apartheid South Africa. It focuses on the Tripartite Alliance between the African National Congress (ANC), the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and explores what the Alliance relationship has meant for the traditional roles of employees and their representatives on the one hand, and employers and their representatives on the other. The thesis examines the political, organisational and societal contradictions and implications for COSATU public sector union affiliates and their members in their relationship to the ANC as an ally (via the Alliance) and the context in which ANC members form part of management (in government). The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (SAMWU) was used as an archetype of a COSATU public sector union affiliate that engages with the State as employer at the municipal level. It is a case study of Makana Local Municipality (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) using qualitative <b>research</b> <b>techniques</b> and <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> to derive the relevant information. The author conducted a series of in-depth interviews of key informants and observations at Makana Local Municipality were done. Based on the empirical data obtained from the investigation, the thesis argues that the traditional roles in the employment relationship at the workplace have been affected by the political alliance. Industrial relations roles have become increasingly vague especially since many within local government share ANC/SACP memberships with members of the trade union. The study also highlights that within an increasingly globalising post-apartheid environment, the Alliance provides mixture of benefits and challenges for workplace negotiations and employment relations in ways that macro-level analyses of employer-employee relationships do not always capture...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} that advertising {{is an important}} and neglected site of racialisation. It argues that advertising {{plays a crucial role}} in the cultural politics of 'race' but that, in order to examine this role, we need a more subtle understanding of the production and consumption of advertising meanings. That the relationship between advertising and racialisation remains understudied is arguably a result of traditional academic approaches to the media which have tended to focus exclusively on textual interpretations of media products by academics themselves. This project has attempted to move beyond such approaches by investigating the social relations of production and consumption of British television advertising in a number of sites, in addition to analysing the content of such advertisements. The project focuses upon young consumers; this is a group to which advertising most frequently targets racialised imagery, a group whose 'cultures' have been actively influenced by racialised minorities, and who are arguably the most 'media literate' of consumers. It employs a variety of <b>research</b> <b>techniques,</b> including <b>content</b> <b>analysis,</b> participant observation in an advertising agency, individual interviews with industry personnel and group discussions with young people in two contrasting London schools. It concludes that, in contrast to accounts of advertising that emphasise 'rational' economics, all stages of the advertising process are rife with racialised meanings. The thesis shows how advertising is sometimes consumed in different ways from those intended by its producers, and that there are significant differences in consumption among different groups of consumers. Such differential patterns of consumption are not adequately explained by reference to traditional social categories such as 'race', gender and class; instead relational categories of difference and distinction have greater explanatory value. The thesis incorporates an attempt to provide a critical handle on the advertising industry, and draws attention to the consistent presence of relations of power in the cultural politics of advertising. It discusses the notion of 'resistance' to such relations by the young people interviewed and concludes that previous research has tended to over-simplify, and over-estimate the extent of, consumer resistance to advertising's dominant meanings...|$|R

(4) howare the perceptions of vocational high school students to the textbooks they use? (5) howis the relevance of Bahasa IndonesiaLesson textbooks based vocational aspects of life skills education? (6) howis the model ofBahasaIndonesia Lesson textbook which is ideal forthe development of life skills forvocational high school students?To answer thatsixproblems, author conducted literature study to get several theories and opinions regarding to the concepts of compilation of textbooks in the relevance to the development of life skills education. Then,author combined these theories with empirical data in the field which is gained through <b>research</b> <b>techniques</b> of <b>content</b> <b>analysis,</b> interviews, and questionnaires. Based on the above, authorgot a number of findings as follows. In the vocational high school curriculum of Bahasa Indonesia Lesson, there is a different emphasis on life skills education, especially for aspects of self-awareness, academic skills, and vocational. In general, BahasaIndonesia Lesson textbooks of the vocational high school had not yet developed a life skills education optimally. This is particularly true for aspects of self-awareness, vocational skills and academic skills. Meanwhile, the teachers argued that they are easy on developing of the curriculum in conjunction with importance of life skills education. The concept of life skills education is not new at all because for them as a vocational high school teachers has been required to direct the lesson materials to the practical things. Opinion of the students of the textbooks they use is that the textbook was quite helpful to understand their strengths or weaknesses in the language skill. Therefore, the concept of life skills education needs to be developed optimally. The exercises contained in the textbooks had not matched yet withthe purposes of the studentsas skilled labor candidates. Activities in the textbook also do not support students' learning experiences. For that, author formulated all textbook compilation model in accordance with the needs of the students with life skills-based education...|$|R
40|$|Coverage of the Third World by {{the media}} in the {{developed}} Western nations has been a subject of intense debate among scholars since the 1970 s. Some of the outspoken media critics have pointed to certain imbalances in Western media reporting on {{some parts of the}} world, including African countries. Such imbalances range from inadequate coverage to emphasis on crisis news events. Other critics argue, however, that Western news reporting on African countries, for example, is crisis-oriented because {{that is the kind of}} news those countries offer to the media given the recurrence of various forms of crises there. The 1984 - 85 Ethiopian famine was one such crisis that received extensive coverage in the Western media. Criticisms of this coverage served to fuel a growing concern among African and other intellectuals, particularly about one aspect of Western media reporting: the failure of those media to put into adequate context African events on which they report. Some critics have pointed out, for example, that although environmental decline is a major underlying cause of famine in Africa, it does not receive attention in Western media coverage of this recurring crisis. This is in spite of the pioneering role of the latter in the promotion of environmental issues in the West as a major social and political concern. From a much broader perspective, however, it appears that the case of imbalanced reporting on Africa in the Western media is not an isolated one. A number of studies on news reporting suggests that the criticism of imbalances in Western news reporting may have more to do with the nature of Western news values than with a wilful attempt on the part of the Western media to report on particular countries in those terms. Thus reporting on African countries by the Western media could be one typical example in which standard Western news practices come into full play. Against this background, the present study sought to investigate Western media coverage of Africa as viewed in terms of the application of Western news values. First, using qualitative analyses of relevant literature, the study undertook a contextualisation of crisis events in African countries, with special reference to famines, by identifying environmental degradation as a crucial factor in the unfolding of such crises. This included explanations for the apparent neglect of African environmental issues by Western media. Discussion on the environment was set in a wider context of a global environmental crisis. The qualitative analyses also examined the issue of imbalances, such as the focus on crisis and the lack of context, in Western media coverage of Africa. This was explored within a theoretical framework that encapsulates aspects of the political economy of the mass media, political ideological differences, and culture as some of the theoretical propositions used by some media researchers to explain imbalances in international news flow. Second, the study used the quantitative <b>research</b> <b>technique</b> of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> to carry out a longitudinal investigation of reporting on African countries in general during 1982 - 87 as well as a case study of the 1984 - 85 Ethiopian famine by three Western dailies: The Times of London, the New York Times, and the Sydney Morning Herald. An IAMCR (International Association for Mass Communication Research) coding scheme was adopted for this purpose. With regard to the qualitative analyses, the study found that even though environmental decline is a major underlying cause of many of Africa's ongoing and recurring crises such as famines, it may not receive attention in Western media reporting on those crises. This appears to be because the nature of Africa's environmental problems does not meet Western news value criteria. As regards the content analyses, the study found, in both the longitudinal and case studies, a dearth of reporting in all three dailies on African environmental issues and an orientation towards reporting events as discrete events, with little or no attention to underlying or contextual information. Crisis and non-crisis events in Africa were found to be, however, equally reported in most of the sample years studied in two of the three dailies. The focus of reporting on the Ethiopian famine was found to be on Western relief activities and on the bizarre or sensational side of the disaster - aspects of reporting that fit into standard Western news practices...|$|R

Cost benefit and defensive arguments dominate the case for corporate responsibility. There is little indication that organisations have identified the opportunity of corporate responsibility initiatives to increase innovation and organisational learning and its contribution to risk management. Recommendations are made regarding the assessment of investment in this area...|$|R

In order to analyse these data, {{it is necessary}} to apply a technique of qualitative data and an intermediate or transitory process known as <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> In 1993, in the Faculty of Sports Science, we studied four diaries of teachers in training by means of <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> In this essay, the authors shows how <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> work, which is its process, the kind of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> that may be used, and which are the <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> characteristics. Here the process to code trainers is explained, which is a basic phase within this analysis technique. Finally, here we find the process followed in a specific application of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> to study the teachers&rsquo; thinking. KEY WORDS: teaching Physical Education, observational <b>techniques,</b> <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> process Es frecuente que el investigador en el &aacute;rea de la ense&ntilde;anza de la Educaci&oacute;n f&iacute;sica se encuentre con un problema grave para analizar los datos verbales recogidos a trav&eacute;s de t&eacute;cnicas observacionales.

40|$|A {{construction}} crisis stimulates {{a network}} of communications within its host organization, the structure of which influences crisis management efficiency. It does so by determining the effectiveness of information transfer between project participants, and thereby the level of uncertainty, misunderstanding and ultimately conflict which materializes. These conclusions arose from research which was concerned specifically with the patterns of communication and behaviour which emerge in response to construction crises. The methodology adopted a longitudinal, multiple case study approach and combined the complementary <b>techniques</b> of <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> and social network analysis. Crisis Management, Efficiency, Communication, Structure, Networks,...|$|R
