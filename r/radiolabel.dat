40|$|Introduction: Ever {{since their}} discovery, liposomes have been <b>radiolabeled</b> {{to monitor their}} fate in vivo.

Since they can play a crucial role in patient management, it is of importance to enable translation of <b>radiolabeled</b> liposomes into the clinic. Areas covered: Liposomes have demonstrated substantial advantages as drug delivery systems and can be efficiently <b>radiolabeled.</b> Potentially, <b>radiolabeled</b> drug-loaded liposomes form an elegant theranostic system, which can be tracked in vivo using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In this review, we discuss important aspects of liposomal research with a focus on the use of <b>radiolabeled</b> liposomes and their potential role in drug delivery and monitoring therapeutic effects. Expert opinion: <b>Radiolabeled</b> drug-loaded liposomes have been poorly investigated in patients and no <b>radiolabeled</b> liposomes have been approved for use in clinical practice. Evaluation of the risks, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity is necessary to meet pharmaceutical and commercial requirements. It remains to be demonstrated whether the results found in animal studies translate to humans before <b>radiolabeled</b> liposomes can be implemented into clinical practice...|$|R

Small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests.

2500|$|Pharmacokinetics: In pre-clinical trials, it is {{possible}} to <b>radiolabel</b> a new drug and inject it into animals. [...] Such scans are referred to as biodistribution studies. [...] The uptake of the drug, the tissues in which it concentrates, and its eventual elimination, can be monitored far more quickly and cost effectively than the older technique of killing and dissecting the animals to discover the same information. [...] Much more commonly, however, drug occupancy at a purported site of action can be inferred indirectly by competition studies between unlabeled drug and radiolabeled compounds known apriori to bind with specificity to the site. [...] A single radioligand can be used this way to test many potential drug candidates for the same target. [...] A related technique involves scanning with radioligands that compete with an endogenous (naturally occurring) substance at a given receptor to demonstrate that a drug causes the release of the natural substance.|$|E

40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} {{procedure is}} described {{for the detection}} of cholera toxin and its component polypeptide chains.

Moreover, <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin, B subunit, and α chain preparations retained substantial ability to bind to intestinal mucosal homogenates. The minimal amount of antitoxin detectable with <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin was 0. 04 antitoxin units/ml. Substitution of <b>radiolabeled</b> B subunit, A subunit, and α chain for <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin decreased the sensitivity of the test. <b>Radiolabeled</b> γ chain did not bind to the antitoxin preparation. Competitive inhibition studies, with titrated anti-choleragen serum and <b>radiolabeled</b> toxin or components, indicated that the minimum concentration of toxin detectable was 7. 0 × 10 − 8 μmol/ml at a 90 % inhibition level. The A subunit and α chain preparations inhibited the binding of the <b>radiolabeled</b> B subunit to antitoxin sites. Conversely, B subunit inhibited the binding of <b>radiolabeled</b> A subunit and α chain to antitoxin. The γ chain did not show any reaction with antitoxin or cross-reaction with either whole toxin or its components.

50|$|Preclinical SPECT and PET are {{two very}} similar {{molecular}} imaging modalities used for noninvasive visualization of biodistribution of <b>radiolabel</b> tracers that are injected into an animal. The major difference between SPECT and PET lies {{in the nature of}} the radioactive decay of their tracers. SPECT tracer emits single γ-photons with the energy of photons that depends on the isotope that was used for radiolabeling. In PET, the tracer emits positrons that, after annihilation with electrons in the subject, produce a pair of 511 keV annihilation photons emitted into opposite directions. Coincidental detection of these annihilation photons is used for image formation in PET. As a result, different detection principles have been developed for SPECT and PET tracers, which has led to separate SPECT and PET scanners.|$|E

A variety of non-radioactive methods are now in widespread use. Fluorescence-based methods include such things as direct labeling with a fluorescent dye like calcein or labeling with europium that becomes fluorescent when released Eu3+ binds to a chelator. Fluorescence can be measured by means of multi-well fluorometers or by flow cytometry methods.
