5|$|Released in November 1991, Loveless was rumoured to {{have cost}} over £250,000 and {{bankrupt}} Creation Records, claims which Shields has denied. Critical reception to Loveless was almost unanimous with praise although {{the album was}} not a commercial success. It peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failed to chart elsewhere internationally. McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation Records soon {{after the release of}} Loveless, due to the album's extensive <b>recording</b> <b>period</b> and interpersonal problems with Shields.|$|E
5|$|For the {{duration}} of the <b>recording</b> <b>period,</b> producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time. Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyseamong othersauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist. As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.|$|E

5|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} Achtung Baby {{was marked by}} several {{releases}} in 2011. At the band's request, a documentary film about the album entitled From the Sky Down was produced. It was directed by Davis Guggenheim, who previously collaborated with the Edge for the documentary It Might Get Loud in 2008. From the Sky Down documents the album's difficult <b>recording</b> <b>period,</b> the band members' relationships, and U2's creative process. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from Rattle and Hum. For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios and during rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, and in October, it was broadcast on multiple television networks worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumentation}} included ten smoked paper analog seismometers {{that were}} configured {{to allow for}} 48 hours of continuous single-component data recording. Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight of the selected sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an FM telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The tapes were then played back and the P-wave and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition {{and at the end}} of the <b>recording</b> <b>period</b> in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate telemetry network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4km/s.|$|E
25|$|Valerie Arem of PCB Productions was {{the voice}} {{director}} for dubbing. Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately. Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice <b>recording</b> <b>period</b> as a positive experience, reinforced {{by the fact that}} they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting. Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff. In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances. For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.|$|E

500|$|Dan Leno (20 December 1860– 31 October 1904) was an English comedian {{and stage}} actor, famous for {{appearing}} in music hall, comic plays, pantomimes, Victorian burlesques and musical comedies, during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. [...] He originated and popularised many songs, sketches and monologues in his music hall acts and made both sound and visual recordings {{of some of}} his work shortly before he died. Although brief, Leno's <b>recording</b> <b>period</b> (1901–1903) produced around thirty recordings on one-sided shellac discs using the early acoustic recording process. They were released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company, one of the early recording companies, which became the parent organisation for the His Master's Voice (HMV) label.|$|E
500|$|Partial {{recording}} of the album took place during September 2010, at Conway Studios with Dr. Luke again as the executive producer. Kesha recorded the abundance of Cannibal over a two-week span {{with a variety of}} producers; the short <b>recording</b> <b>period</b> was due to her only being available for a limited amount of time due to prior commitments. During an interview with Billboard conducted by Chris Willman, one of the potential songs for the album was used {{as an example of how}} Luke and Kesha collaborated to create a song for this record: [...] "There's an unfinished chorus on this new track, in which Gottwald is singing through such distorted Auto-Tune, it's impossible to tell what he's saying-which is deliberate, so he won't unduly influence Ke$ha when she comes up with her own lyrics." ...|$|E

In a July 2013 {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Perry revealed that the band had concurrently recorded a tribute album featuring these songs and would be releasing it after touring behind White Teeth, Black Thoughts.

Schaffner recorded in his book The Beatles Forever: [...] "For a while there... album charts were reminiscent of the golden age of Beatlemania." [...] Preceding Harrison's long-awaited release was the acoustic single [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)", which became his second number 1 hit in the United States. This was accompanied by a billboard and print advertising campaign, including a three-panel poster combining the album's front and back covers, and an Apple publicity photo showing Harrison, now free of the heavy beard familiar from the All Things Must Pass–Concert for Bangladesh era, with his hand outstretched, mirroring Wilkes' album cover image.|$|E
500|$|Along with Gentlemen, Congregation is {{generally}} considered by music journalists {{to be part of}} the Afghan Whigs' peak <b>recording</b> <b>period.</b> Dulli cites it as [...] "the record where we came into our own". Melody Maker dubbed it [...] "the finest rock LP of the decade" [...] and commented that it is [...] "nothing less than rock raping pop, a ferocious deflowering of Motown's romantic ideal". With Congregation, Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody found the band to be [...] "crucial to the birth of '90s alternative rock." [...] AllMusic's Jason Ankeny said that it was the band's artistic breakthrough and [...] "ticket to the big leagues", [...] "an incendiary and insidious set which bridges the gap between the noisy aggression of the band's early releases and the soulful swagger of their later work." [...] Ankeny also cited it as [...] "the grunge era's most overlooked masterpiece" [...] and an indication of the band's musical growth, writing that [...] "while still unmistakably a member of the Sub Pop stable, there's a greater maturity and depth to their sinewy sound, with a newfound grasp of mood and nuance". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it a [...] "quantum leap" [...] over the band's previous work, commenting that it [...] "shows that they ditched grunge for soul because they were no damn good at the former and ladies dig the latter." [...] In 2002, Italian music magazine [...] included the album in its list of 100 Best Albums by Decade. Polish webzine [...] ranked it number 79 on its 2004 list of the Top 100 Albums of the '90s. Italian music journalists [...] and [...] included Congregation in their 2010 book on essential rock albums. The Spin Alternative Record Guide (1995) was somewhat less enthusiastic, writing that [...] "the results feel like dress rehearsals for Gentlemen, with one partial exception, 'Conjure Me,' and one absolute triumph: a surging final track ... that might be the Afghan Whigs' strongest recorded performance." ...|$|E
