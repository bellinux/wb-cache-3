25|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Registry of World Record Size Shells was World Size Records, {{compiled by}} renowned malacologists Robert J. L. Wagner (1905–1992) and R. Tucker Abbott (1919–1995). These record sizes originally appeared in 1964, {{in the first}} edition of Van Nostrand's Standard Catalog of Shells, not as a separate list but interspersed among other species-specific information that made up the bulk of the work. An updated list was published as part of the book's second edition, in 1967. The next update appeared in the work's third edition, which was renamed Wagner and Abbott's Standard Catalog of Shells. Unlike previous editions, this third and final installment of the catalog was a <b>ring</b> <b>binder</b> with loose-leaf content, intended as a continually updated resource. To match the newly retitled work, the list's name was modified to Wagner and Abbott's World Size Records. In this final incarnation, the list appeared as a series of four supplements: the first two were loose-leaf publications that appeared in 1978 and 1982, and these were followed by hole-punched paperback titles in 1985 and 1990.|$|E

Novak, who also acts in the show as Ryan Howard, and the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Jason Reitman, who directed the films Juno and Thank You for Smoking. When speaking about his directorial experience with The Office, Reitman stated that [...] "Anyhow, the whole experience was awesome. They’re all geniuses over there. I didn’t have to contribute much {{at the end of}} the day because they’re all so on their game." [...] He also stated that [...] "Weird moment of production design surprise – There's a three <b>ring</b> <b>binder</b> on Creed's desk with the logo from the Academy of Tobacco Studies that we created for [...] Smoking. I have no idea how it got there and neither does he." [...] B.J. Novak's brother Jesse, a musician, contributed in writing the song that some of the characters sing in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|The ASL Rulebook was revolutionary in its design, {{as far as}} wargames go. [...] Based on {{military}} field manuals, the rule book was contained in a three <b>ring</b> <b>binder.</b> [...] Each chapter was colour-coded {{along the top of}} the page, with brightly coloured section dividers of heavy cardboard stock reproducing charts and diagrams associated with that chapter. [...] Errata would be provided on a regular basis, and coupons in the back of the rulebook could be exchanged by mail for the initial updates to the rulebook. [...] The errata would come in the form of altered pages, with page numbers annotated with the date of any changes; old pages were simply removed from the binder and discarded and the new page inserted. [...] The two largest updates were the '87 and '89 sections that came with many pages. [...] The first edition rules shipped with Chapter A, B, C, D, H, J, and N. Chapter N was a visual inventory of all game pieces included in Beyond Valor and several follow up modules, but was not fully supported. [...] While early modules did contain the appropriate Chapter N pages, some modules did not have the pages included immediately (Paratrooper's Chapter N pages, for example, were not provided until the release of Yanks). [...] HASL modules did not have associated Chapter N pages, and neither did Doomed Battalions.|$|E

5000|$|German Friedrich Soennecken invented <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> in 1886 in Bonn, Germany. He also {{registered}} {{a patent}} on November 14, 1886, for his Papierlocher für Sammelmappen ("paper hole maker for folders", or hole punch). German Louis Leitz, founder of Leitz later made some important changes in development of <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> in Stuttgart-Feuerbach. Leitz introduced the [...] "finger hole" [...] {{on the side of}} the binder to aid removal from crowded shelves.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{design for}} <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> {{was invented in}} 1889 by Andreas Tengwall in Helsingborg, Sweden, and {{patented}} in 1890 under the name 'Trio binder', named after a business consortium of Tengwall and two associates. Tengwall's design uses four rings, in two paired sets. The hole placement of Tengwall's Trio binder is still used as a de facto standard for hole punching in Sweden under the name triohålning. These holes are 21 mm, 70 mm, and 21 mm apart. (In this article, it makes mention that, according to the curator of the Early Office Museum in London, the first patent for <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> was filed in 1859 for a two-ring binder. A few years later three-ring binders became the standard in the United States; the [...] "D" [...] <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> did not come on the market there until the 1940s or 1950s.) ...|$|R

50|$|A loose leaf is a {{piece of}} paper that is not bound in place, but {{typically}} punched so as to be organized in a <b>ring</b> <b>binder.</b> Loose leaves may be sold as free sheets, or made up into notepads, where perforations allow them to be removed easily.|$|E
50|$|A simple budget can {{be written}} {{on a piece of}} a paper with a pencil and, optionally, a calculator. Such budgets can be {{organized}} in <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> or a file cabinet.

5000|$|The {{intensive}} journal {{method is}} a psychotherapeutic technique largely developed in 1966 at Drew University and popularized by Ira Progoff (1921-1998). It {{consists of a}} series of writing exercises using loose leaf notebook paper in a simple <b>ring</b> <b>binder,</b> divided into sections to help in accessing various areas of the writer's life. These include a dialogue section for the personification of things, a [...] "depth dimension" [...] to aid in accessing the subconscious and other places for recording remembrances and meditations.|$|E
50|$|Also {{illustrative of}} the style is that the inside covers of the book were {{decorated}} with caricatures of members of Games Workshop staff. Additionally, the physical rule book, itself, was also notorious for poor construction, as the pages almost invariably {{fell out of the}} binding. This led to a variety of repair solutions - such as drilling holes through the book near the binding and binding it with string or <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> - that, coincidentally, echoed the ramshackle construction techniques of the Orks.|$|R
50|$|The {{new system}} {{replaced}} the older hard-wired system, which came in many 'flavours' (e.g., Plans 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 2A, 105, 107 etc.), {{which could be}} very complicated and required the attendance at the premises of a GPO telephone-engineer, who needed {{a complete set of}} 'N' (wiring) Diagrams, which was very extensive and ran to over 15 volumes of little black <b>ring</b> <b>binders.</b> N diagrams also had their own numbering system (e.g., a Plan 1A had an N diagram of N4502), and were frequently updated.|$|R

5000|$|Lapinlahden Linnut (founded in {{the spring}} of 1983) is a Finnish band which plays humorous rock/pop music. The band started as {{roadside}} musicians. In the beginning, the band used some original instruments such as a <b>ring</b> <b>binder,</b> and they still use an empty beer crate nowadays in their music. Lapinlahden Linnut have made 7 TV-series, and when third of them, Maailman kahdeksan ihmettä, was in Montreaux, it had name: [...] "Rampton Birds -show: Eight wonders of the World". In 2006 band returned to its old, 1990/1991 configuration.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, as {{his focus}} in the {{entertainment}} industry shifted to musical and acting careers, Alien has taken indefinite leave as a host of 100% Entertainment, the only show he has been hosting by 2011, and had his <b>ring</b> <b>binder</b> containing the show's rundown and set scripts sealed into a box, but is left unlocked because he is not quitting the show, or retiring as a TV host for good, much like Jody Chiang locking her microphone. Alien still returns to the show as a guest promoting his other works as an actor or singer.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{version of}} the Old Town School Songbook was an unbound stack of pages {{to be added to}} a three <b>ring</b> <b>binder.</b> It was a {{collection}} of 94 songs mostly North American in origin, but selections from Israel, Ireland, England, and Chile were added. In keeping with the teaching philosophy of the school it favored lots of songs which were suitable for group involvement. Each page had a short history of the song, the chord progression, rhythm indicators, a transcription of the melody and lyrics for the verses. Chord fingering charts were provided for guitar and banjo.|$|E
50|$|Applications {{for paper}} {{drilling}} are e.g. file holes for different <b>ring</b> <b>binders,</b> loose leaf collections, rows of holes for wire comb binding and tags. Many products processed {{on a paper}} drilling machine are stationery. Additionally catalogues, manuals and brochures are drilled on a paper drilling system {{to be able to}} file them in a binder. Sometimes drilled holes are used for decorative purposes. Additionally to different stock types - e.g. offset paper, bond paper, glossy paper, coated paper - a modern paper drilling machine can drill many other materials like plastic films, cardboard, foils etc.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{disadvantage}} of loose-leaf paper is that individual pages {{can be easily}} removed or lost due to tearing or wear of the punched holes. Adhesive reinforcement labels or sheet protectors are available to make pages more durable, and <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> are often equipped with sheet lifters or other features to reduce wear and damage to their paper contents. Ring binders are sometimes banned from use for written journals, logs, or registers, which may even have pre-numbered permanently bound pages to discourage removal of pages, or at least allow a removal to be detected.|$|R
50|$|Looseleaf {{services}} are {{most commonly used}} for research in areas of law which change rapidly due to regulatory and administrative developments (such as tax law, environmental law, financial regulation, and labor law). Looseleaf {{services are}} typically contained in <b>ring</b> <b>binders</b> to keep them updated, because they are published fairly frequently (at minimum monthly, sometimes weekly or bi-weekly) {{in order to keep}} the information therein current. Most law libraries have a subscription to several of these services, and many of the more popular services are available electronically as well.|$|R
