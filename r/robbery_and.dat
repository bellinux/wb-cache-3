The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb <b>robbery,</b> <b>and</b> civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E
