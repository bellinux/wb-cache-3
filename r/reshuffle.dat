5|$|On 7 October 2013, Miliband reshuffled his Shadow Cabinet for {{the third}} time, saying {{that this would be}} the last <b>reshuffle</b> before the general election. In a move similar to his 2011 <b>reshuffle,</b> several MPs from the 2010 intake were promoted, while more long-serving MPs were moved. Tristram Hunt and Rachel Reeves {{received}} promotions, while Liam Byrne and Stephen Twigg were among those demoted.|$|E

40|$|Despite their {{political}} prominence, cabinet <b>reshuffles</b> have not attracted {{a great deal}} of scholarly attention. We provide a theory of cabinet <b>reshuffles</b> that emphasizes both systematic and time-varying causes. In particular, we argue that prime ministers employ cabinet <b>reshuffles</b> to retain power in the face of both intraparty and electoral challenges to their leadership.

Specifically, we demon-strate that: 1. the results are similar if we create alternative dependent variables based on Archigos, 2. consistent with the extant literature (and our expectations), we show that personalist dictators are relatively immune to successful <b>reshuffling</b> coups, 3. although military regimes are more prone to <b>reshuffling</b> coups, they do not solely account for our key finding that terrorism increases the probability of <b>reshuffling</b> coup, 4. we demonstrate that while military regimes are at higher risk of <b>reshuffling</b> coups, they do not solely drive our finding that terrorism leads to <b>reshuffling</b> coups, 5. a placebo test demonstrates that attacks in t+ 1 are not significant predictors of coups in year t, 6. our key findings are not due to influential observations, as we drop the three <b>reshuffling</b> coups with the most terrorism in t − 1 and find similar results; we also jackknife each model by country and find our key results robust...|$|R

50|$|In June 2011, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai <b>reshuffled</b> {{the portion}} of the cabinet {{appointed}} by his party (MDC-T), within the Government of National Unity that was formed on 13 February 2009. Ministers appointed by the other two parties were not <b>reshuffled.</b>|$|R

On March 3, 2010 the Ukrainian Parliament passed a {{motion of no confidence}} in the second Tymoshenko Government. A day before that the coalition had already lost the parliamentary majority. On March 11, 2010 the First Azarov Government was elected.|$|E
5|$|The Barroso Commission {{took office}} in late 2004 after being delayed by {{objections}} from the Parliament, which forced a <b>reshuffle.</b> In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style {{of control over the}} college, which earned him some criticism.|$|E
5|$|During the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, {{except in}} the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which {{resulted}} in a <b>reshuffle</b> in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although his average of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he batted in a variety of positions, as did all of the squad, because Bradman used a rotation system to rest his team because many matches were played consecutively.|$|E
50|$|On 8 February 2012, Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo {{appointed}} him Minister for Provincial Government. (His predecessor, Walter Folatalu, was <b>reshuffled</b> as Minister for Communication and Civil Aviation, replacing Andrew Hanaria {{who had lost}} his seat upon being found to have bribed voters.) On 1 March, Tome was <b>reshuffled</b> {{to the position of}} Minister for Police, National Security and Correctional Services, left vacant by Clay Forau who had been promoted Minister for Foreign Affairs.

5|$|Following {{the loss}} of captain and star striker, Eric Cantona {{at the end of}} the {{previous}} season, Ferguson acquired the services of England international Teddy Sheringham as a direct replacement on a three-year deal from Tottenham Hotspur for £3.5million. Cantona's departure meant that Roy Keane was promoted as captain and a <b>reshuffle</b> of squad numbers occurred; David Beckham was awarded the coveted number 7 shirt and Sheringham was given Beckham's former squad number 10. Henning Berg was the only other new face to arrive at Old Trafford from Blackburn Rovers for a £5million fee at the start of the season.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown visited Doncaster North {{during the}} general {{election}} campaign to support his former adviser.

He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 23 May, responding to comments made by future Speaker John Bercow. In Tony Blair's frontbench <b>reshuffle</b> in May 2006, he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office, as Minister for the Third Sector, with responsibility for voluntary and charity organisations.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 José Manuel Barroso became President: the Parliament {{once again}} {{asserted}} itself in objecting {{to the proposed}} membership of the Barroso Commission. Due to the opposition Barroso was forced to <b>reshuffle</b> his team before taking office. The Barroso Commission {{was also the first}} full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members and hence the number of Commissioners {{at the end of the}} Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May, tens of {{thousands}} of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to <b>reshuffle</b> his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.|$|E

5|$|Despite Blom-Cooper's {{recommendations}} that Bird never {{be allowed to}} hold public office again and strong opposition disapproval, he was made Minister of Science, Technology and Communications in a cabinet <b>reshuffle</b> on 15 May 1996. He soon found himself {{at odds with the}} Prime Minister; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his wife from Guiana Island, where they had lived for 32 years, in order to build a tourist resort, Bird began serving as the Buftons' lawyer. A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them, using force if necessary. Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder, but still evicted.|$|E
5|$|He {{then joined}} the cabinet during a 2004 <b>reshuffle,</b> {{serving as the}} Norwegian Minister of the Environment from summer 2004 to fall 2005. He was the {{youngest}} ever cabinet member from the Christian Democratic Party, and the first Christian Democratic to hold the post. The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the 2005 elections, and as such Hareide had to step down from office that year. His successor was Helen Bjørnøy. Until 2009, Hareide had never been elected to the Norwegian Parliament, but served as a deputy representative during the terms 19972001, 20012005 and 20052009. On the local level of politics {{he was a member}} of Bømlo municipality council from 1991 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a <b>reshuffle.</b> As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E
