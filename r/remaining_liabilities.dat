40|$|If the {{consumer}} is owed a rebate, it {{can be derived from}} premiums paid in January of the experience year, and currently can be delayed until August of the following year. This already represents a 20 month delay. Currently a three month lag for evaluation of incurred claims is used. This represents a minimal amount of potential error when compared to 12 months of incurred payments. A similar margin of error for estimation when comparing to 36 months of incurred claim payment might be associated with using year-end claim reserves, or only a one month run out period. Using data common to financial reporting would relieve some sources of errors in the program, and reduce somewhat redundant accounting. Since public sources would be used for more of the calculation, transparency would be improved. A major byproduct of using financial statement data would be the opportunity to provide potential rebates earlier in the year. Documentation in support: From IRD 010 resolved 8 / 25 / 2010 evaluation we have: Run-out reserves are defined as the reserve that has developed over time.

50|$|The {{advantage}} to Slutzkin of selling instead of liquidating {{the company was}} that selling would be a capital transaction, and therefore tax-free, whereas in liquidation the final dividend distribution would be taxed as income.

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{problems}} of the new state was finance. Since {{the amount of money}} in circulation was not sufficient {{to meet the demands of}} the increasing population, a system of state banks was instituted. State bonds were issued and public lands were sold to secure capital, and the notes of the banks, loaned on security, became a medium of exchange. Prospects of an income from the banks led the legislature of 1836 to abolish all taxation for state purposes. The Panic of 1837 wiped out a large portion of the banks' assets, leaving the state poor. Next came revelations of grossly careless and corrupt management. In 1843 the banks were placed in liquidation. After disposing of all their available assets, the state assumed the <b>remaining</b> <b>liabilities,</b> for which it had pledged its faith and credit.|$|E
5000|$|After the referendum, new {{negotiations}} commenced. On 16 February 2011, the Icelandic parliament {{agreed to}} a repayment deal with the votes 44 for and 16 against, formally entitled Act 13/2011 but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Icesave bill 3. The third version of the Icesave bill entailed new terms and conditions for repayment of the full and remaining Icesave debt to UK and Netherlands, throughout a period stretching from one to 30 years starting from 2016 (with the length depending on how much time Iceland would need to repay its remaining obligations), to the sound of a fixed constant interest rate at 3.2% for 2009-15, which then ultimately would be substituted by a variable interest rate for the years beyond. Another improvement compared to the previous Icesave bills, was that it included an interest rate moratorium (rate being fixed to 0%) for the first three quarters of 2009. The yearly repayment amount would also be capped at the lowest of these two ceilings: Maximum 1.3% of Icelands GDP (i.e. €0.13bn in 2011), or maximum 5% of the total Icelandic government revenue from the previous year (i.e. €0.23bn in 2011). A minimum repayment was however also guaranteed by the mutual agreement, as it could never be less compared to a situation with traditional amortisation over 30 years. Finally the new deal also in practise had removed the demand for equal footing for all [...] "priority claims" [...] towards the Landsbanki receivership, meaning that it was now likely the receivership would repay 100% of the €4bn of owed minimum deposit guarantees during 2011-15, with the accrued interests being the only remaining responsibility for the Icelandic state subsequently to guarantee and cover. It was noted in the bill, that the expected <b>remaining</b> <b>liabilities</b> for the Icelandic state would now only amount to ISK 47bn (€0.24bn) in 2016, meaning it was now likely for the Icelandic state to repay all the <b>remaining</b> <b>liabilities</b> after only two years of amortisation in 2016 and 2017. The Icelandic president however once again refused to sign the new deal on 20 February 2011, and thus triggered a new Icesave referendum to be called. A referendum was held on 9 April 2011, asking the Icelandic electorate to vote yes/no for Icesave bill 3. A group of 15 concerned citizens organised under the name of Advice.is and campaigned for a No in Iceland and internationally.|$|E
40|$|A {{stochastic}} precipitation {{model was}} developed {{using data from}} the Betatakin ruins in Arizona. This was then coupled to a soil moisture model which used the Blaney-Criddle for the potential evapotranspiration estimate and the Hanson method for the actual evapotranspiration estimate. Using this combined model it was then possible to model the response of germinating and growing plants as the soil moisture fluctuated throughout the growing season. Three variations of the model were run, one which only considered the first year and normal precipitation, one in which irrigation was applied as needed and, in another, the plants had to grow and survive for a ten year period. The sensitivity analysis of the on year model showed that increasing the amount of moisture available for the germination process had the largest effect. The irrigation model showed that very little additional moisture would be needed to assure revegetation in the first year. The ten year model showed that even with revegetation in the first year the planted species would have to be drought tolerant. The conclusions of this study are that irrigation should be used {{in the first year of}} revegetation, using drought tolerant species, and then discontinued for the <b>remaining</b> <b>liability</b> period...|$|R
40|$|To {{achieve the}} goal of the 2014 Farm Bill, many {{programs}} (direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and ACRE) that relied on market trends were replaced with other types of risk management tools. Upland cotton producers now have the option between two new risk management programs, Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX) and Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO). The objective of this research is to examine the new STAX and SCO programs to understand their effects on producers? decisions to elect to enroll in the programs as a risk management tool. To analyze these new programs, a simulation model was built using the Excel add-in Simetar?. Fifty-eight scenarios were developed based on the STAX and SCO parameters to analyze the risk ranking preferences and optimal rate of additional coverage for a producer. The model resulted in several conclusions. Irrigated cotton production receives higher program net indemnities than non-irrigated due to irrigated cotton being a higher valued crop. STAX is preferred more often than SCO. Texas farms received higher probabilities of a positive program net indemnity more frequently than Arkansas from STAX and SCO. Risk averse decision-makers prefer to purchase lower and cheaper individual coverage with a subsidized companion policy that allows for the greatest indemnification of <b>remaining</b> <b>liability</b> on their cotton crop...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} research on emerging markets debt, currency crises and fiscal sustainability has placed a significant {{focus on the}} role of currency mismatches with the emphasis placed on the currency composition of explicit government liabilities. The key insight of this paper is that these liabilities, while relevant, usually represent a small share of actual government liabilities: indeed, as an indicator of fiscal solvency, they are relatively uninformative – and possibly misleading – if not matched with the <b>remaining</b> <b>liabilities</b> (promises of wage and pension payments among others) and the asset side of the government’s balance sheet: financial and real government assets as well as the present value of future tax collection. These non-debt liabilities and assets may be affected by changes in the real exchange rate in a way that dwarfs the effect on the explicit liabilities which are typically the focus of attention. With this in mind, this paper proposes a balance-sheet approach that, as illustrated by the practical applications included here, may radically alter the results from traditional sustainability evaluations – and, more generally, the perception of a country’s fiscal vulnerability. ...|$|E
