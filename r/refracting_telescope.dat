5|$|The {{two towers}} of Waterfalls {{impossible}} building are topped with compound polyhedra, one {{a compound of}} three cubes, the other a stellated rhombic dodecahedron known as Escher's solid. Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut Stars, which also contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6cm <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> and was a keen enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars.|$|E

5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was a {{mathematics}} {{teacher at}} a seminary school in Graz, {{where he became}} an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague, and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II. He also taught mathematics in Linz, and was an adviser to General Wallenstein. Additionally, he did fundamental {{work in the field}} of optics, invented an improved version of the <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> (the Keplerian telescope), and was mentioned in the telescopic discoveries of his contemporary Galileo Galilei. He was a corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Europa, {{along with}} Jupiter's three other large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, was {{discovered}} by Galileo Galilei on 8 January 1610, and possibly independently by Simon Marius. The first reported observation of Io and Europa was made by Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20×-magnification <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low magnification of his telescope, so that the two were recorded as a single point of light. The following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Europa by the IAU), Io and Europa were seen {{for the first time}} as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jupiter system.|$|E

5|$|The first {{reported}} observation of Io {{was made by}} Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20x-power, <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low power of his telescope, so the two were recorded as a single point of light. Io and Europa were seen {{for the first time}} as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jovian system the following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Io by the IAU). The discovery of Io and the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter was published in Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610. In his Mundus Jovialis, published in 1614, Simon Marius claimed to have discovered Io and the other moons of Jupiter in 1609, one week before Galileo's discovery. Galileo doubted this claim and dismissed the work of Marius as plagiarism. Regardless, Marius' first recorded observation came from 29 December 1609 in the Julian calendar, which equates to 8 January 1610 in the Gregorian calendar, which Galileo used. Given that Galileo published his work before Marius, Galileo is credited with the discovery.|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E

25|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{argued that}} the faults of the <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> were {{fundamental}} because the lens refracted light of different colors differently. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could {{be made in the}} <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope.</b> However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a reflecting telescope. It was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.|$|E

25|$|Spectacle makers created {{improved}} {{types of}} lenses for the correction of vision {{based more on}} empirical knowledge gained from observing {{the effects of the}} lenses (probably without the knowledge of the rudimentary optical theory of the day). The practical development and experimentation with lenses led to the invention of the compound optical microscope around 1595, and the <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> in 1608, both of which appeared in the spectacle-making centres in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The Natal Observatory was {{initially}} {{equipped with a}} 200mm Grubb equatorial <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> donated by the Natal lawyer and politician Harry Escombe, a 75mm Troughton & Simms transit instrument, a clock by Dent keeping sidereal time, and some precision clocks and other minor instruments. A mean time clock by Victor Kullberg was added in 1892 and a 75mm portable equatorial refractor in 1896. In December 1883 meteorological instruments were received from England and regular meteorological observations initiated at the observatory. Instruments to measure magnetic declination arrived in 1892.|$|E
25|$|The {{refractive}} {{quality of}} lenses is frequently used to manipulate light {{in order to}} change the apparent size of images. Magnifying glasses, spectacles, contact lenses, microscopes and <b>refracting</b> <b>telescopes</b> are all examples of this manipulation.|$|R

25|$|Isaac Newton (1643–1727) {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that {{regardless of whether it}} was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope,</b> due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a curved mirror to form an image may have been known {{since the time of}} Euclid and had been {{extensively}} studied by Alhazen in the 11th century. Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. Niccolò Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book Optica philosophia of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope</b> with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.|$|E
25|$|Winthrop {{also studied}} {{astronomy}} with his 3½ foot <b>refracting</b> <b>telescope.</b> In 1664, {{he wrote a}} letter to Sir Robert Moray regarding a “fifth satellite of Jupiter” that he believed he observed. This was only fifty years after Galileo discovered the first four moons of Jupiter. His letter was cautious since he thought it may be a faint star in close proximity to the other satellites. Winthrop requested that his observations be validated by Lawrence Rooke, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, but nothing was verified. Dr. Edward Emerson Barnard, who was credited for discovering Amalthea, Jupiter’s fifth moon, wrote “It makes me feel specially humiliated just now, for I have only caught the feeblest glimpses of the 5th satellite with the 40-inch during the past two years. Winthrop’s telescope must have been specially good for him to see this faint object with his imperfect instrument in 1664.” Although today it is assumed that Winthrop probably did see a faint star, he is still credited for being a dedicated and vigilant observer of natural phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|The {{same process}} {{can be used to}} make a lens with a concave {{paraboloidal}} surface. The other surface is shaped by the container that holds the molten glass acting as a mould. Lenses made this way are sometimes used as objectives in <b>refracting</b> <b>telescopes.</b>|$|R
