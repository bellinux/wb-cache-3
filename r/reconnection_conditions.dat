40|$|We {{present a}} model of center vortices, {{represented}} by closed random lines in continuous 2 + 1 - dimensional space- time. These random lines are modeled as being piece-wise linear and an ensemble is generated by Monte Carlo methods.

Besides moving, growing and shrinking of the vortex configuration, also reconnections are allowed. Our ensemble therefore contains not a fixed, but a variable number of closed vortex lines. This {{is expected to be}} important for realizing the deconfining phase transition. Using the model, we study both vortex percolation and the potential V (R) between quark and anti-quark as a function of distance R at different vortex densities, vortex segment lengths, <b>reconnection</b> <b>conditions</b> and at different temperatures. We have found three deconfinement phase transitions, as a function of density, as a function of vortex segment length, and as a function of temperature.

40|$|A {{picture of}} {{confinement}} in QCD {{based on a}} condensate of thick vortices with fluxes {{in the center of}} the gauge group (center vortices) is studied. Previous concrete model realizations of this picture utilized a hypercubic space-time scaffolding, which, together with many advantages, also has some disadvantages, e. g., in the treatment of vortex topological charge. In the present work, we explore a center vortex model which does not rely on such a scaffolding. Vortices are represented by closed random lines in continuous 2 + 1 -dimensional space-time. These random lines are modeled as being piece-wise linear, and an ensemble is generated by Monte Carlo methods. The physical space in which the vortex lines are defined is a torus with periodic boundary conditions.

40|$|Based {{on three}} winters of {{observational}} data, we present those ionosphere parameters deemed most critical to realistic space weather ionosphere and thermosphere representation and prediction, in regions impacted by {{variability in the}} cusp. The CHAMP spacecraft revealed large variability in cusp thermosphere densities, measuring frequent satellite drag enhancements, up to doublings. The community recognizes a clear need for more realistic representation of plasma flows and electron densities near the cusp. Existing average value models produce order of magnitude errors in these parameters, resulting in large underestimations of predicted drag. We fill this knowledge gap with statistics-based specification of these key parameters over their range of observed values. The European Incoherent Scatter Svalbard Radar tracks plasma flow Vi, electron density Ne, and electron, ion temperatures Te, Ti, with consecutive 2 – 3 min windshield wipe scans of 1000 × 500 km areas. This allows mapping the maximum Ti of a large area within or near the cusp with high temporal resolution. In magnetic field-aligned mode the radar can measure high-resolution profiles of these plasma parameters. By deriving statistics for Ne and Ti, we enable derivation of thermosphere heating deposition under background and frictional drag-dominated magnetic <b>reconnection</b> <b>conditions.</b> We separate our Ne and Ti profiles into quiescent and enhanced states, which are not closely correlated due to the spatial structure of the reconnection foot point.

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{proposed that the}} ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed above the GZK limit could be mostly protons accelerated in reconnection sites just above the magnetosphere of newborn millisecond pulsars originated by accretion induced collapse (AIC-pulsars). Although the expected rate of AIC sources in our own Galaxy is very small (∼ 10 − 5 yr − 1), our estimates {{have shown that the}} observed total flux of UHECRs could be obtained from the integrated contribution from AIC-pulsars of the whole distribution of galaxies located within a distance which is unaffected by the GZK cutoff (∼ 50 Mpc). We presently examine the potential acceleration mechanisms in the magnetic reconnection site and find that first-order Fermi acceleration cannot provide sufficient efficiency. To prevent synchrotron losses, only very small deflection angles of the UHECRs would be allowed in the strong magnetic fields of the pulsar, which is contrary to the requirements for efficient Fermi acceleration. This leaves the one-shot acceleration via an induced electric field within the reconnection region as the only viable process for UHECR acceleration. We formulate the constraints on both the magnetic field topology and strength in order to accelerate the particles and allow them to freely escape from the system. Under fast <b>reconnection</b> <b>conditions,</b> we find that AIC-pulsars with surface magnetic fields 1012 G < B ⋆ ∼ < 1015 G and spin periods 1 ms ∼ < P ⋆ < 60 ms, are able to accelerate particles to energies ≥ 1020 eV, but the magnetic field just above the Alfvén surface must be predominantly toroidal for the particles to be allowed to escape from the acceleration zone without being deflected. Synchrotron losses bring potentially important constraints on the magnetic field geometry of any UHECR accelerators involving compact sources with strong magnetic fields. – 3...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} set of fully kinetic 2. 5 D {{simulations}} of electron dynamics during rapid magnetic islands coalescence in asymmetric conditions. Simulations are performed using the massively parallel fully kinetic implicit moment method code iPIC 3 D (Markidis et al. 2010). The domain is a double periodic box with two current sheets initially representing two different <b>reconnection</b> <b>conditions</b> with the same asymmetric ratio. In the upper sheet the conventional hyperbolic continuous functions for magnetic field and density are initialised across the layer (e. g. Pritchett 2008). In the lower layer the same asymmetric conditions are used {{the presence of an}} extremely steep gradient describing a pure tangential discontinuity. Cases with and without guide field are compared. While the upper layer shows the typical reconnection evolution of an asymmetric configuration, the lower layer very soon develops not-uniformly distributed multiple reconnection points which rapidly evolve in a series of magnetic islands. Quick islands coalescence follows. Even though the electrons dynamics during island merging has been studied in both symmetric and asymmetric conditions (e. g. Pritchett 2007, 2008 b, Drake et al. 2006, Oka et al. 2010, Huang et al. 2014), these simulations show new interesting features such as the presence of three distinct regions, here named X, M and D, with very different properties. Regions X and M manifest typical signatures of ongoing reconnection, distinguishable thanks to the direct comparison with the outcomes of the upper layer. In particular, M-type regions are different because reconnection occurs between two merging islands in a vertical fashion with respect to the direction of the current sheets initially set. In contrast, regions D present a quite diverse features, not showing the typical signatures of a occurring reconnection. The present work is supported by the NASA MMS Grant NNX 08 AO 84 G.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} reconnection {{process is}} known to govern the transfer of solar wind plasma into the terrestrial magnetosphere. Numerical simulations were employed to qualitatively analyse the plasma flow and magnetic field across an MHD shock structure separating magnetosheath plasma from plasma in the magnetosphere at the onset {{as well as for}} the duration of continuing magnetic reconnection. The one-dimensional time-dependent Riemann problem was re-visited in this numerical study in order to qualitatively analyse the development of the MHD discontinuities for non-viscous and non-resistive conditions and thereby provide further in-sight into the initial development of discontinuities at an arbitrary reconnection site along the terrestrial magnetopause where the resistivity could be considered very small or negligible in comparison to the diffusion region. The two-dimensional steady-state Riemann problem was also numerically solved to obtain the ideal MHD 2 D shock structure that is independent of time. The goal of modelling the 2 D MHD shock structure was to obtain a greater understanding into the behaviour of the plasma flow and the magnetic field across the MHD discontinuities for ongoing magnetic <b>reconnection</b> <b>conditions</b> that occur at an arbitrary point on the dayside terrestrial magnetopause transition layer in the direction of the sub-solar point towards the cusp. The 1 D as well as 2 D models were solved by employing a Galerkin method of weighted residuals and a streamline diffusion technique was also employed to linearize the nonlinear ideal MHD equations governing the model. For a symmetric case with uniform plasma parameter conditions and exactly anitparallel magnetic fields in the tangential direction (z) across two equally divided plasma regions in the defined domain, four discontinuities were obtained in the solution for the 1 D model as well as the 2 D which were a pair of symmetric slow shocks and a pair of symmetric fast shocks. These results are in agreement with solution obtained by Lin & Lee (1993) for a similar 1 D Riemann problem with symmetric conditions. On the other hand for an asymmetric case, the same two plasma regions had non-uniform plasma conditions and anitparallel magnetic fields in the tangential direction (z) with different magnitude. Five discontinuities were found to exist in the solution of the 1 D as well as the 2 D models which were a pair of asymmetric slow shocks, a pair of asymmetric fast shocks and a contact discontinuity. When the results obtained in this study are applied to the Earth's magnetosphere, MHD shocks and the contact discontinuity may be present at the magnetopause-boundary layer region with magnetic reconnection and a non-zero normal (x- direction) component of the magnetic field (in this case Bx= 0. 3). Therefore, magnetic reconnection can occur under ideal MHD conditions devoid of resistivity and viscosity at an arbitrary point along the dayside magnetopause transition layer with the formation of five discontinuities about this layer for asymmetric conditions similar to those that are present in the terrestrial magnetosphere.

D-shaped field-aligned phase space distributions of magnetosheath plasma earthward of and hot magnetospheric ions sunward of the magnetopause current layer are observed. The existence of such D-shaped magnetosheath plasma distributions has been predicted as a signature of reconnection. In addition, the observed ion distributions are in stress balance across the magnetopause, and the de Hoffman-Teller frame velocity obtained from the stress balance calculation is {{in agreement with the}} observed distribution function cutoff speed.

40|$|The {{origin of}} radio {{emission}} from plerions is considered. Recent observations suggest that radio emitting electrons are presently accelerated {{rather than having}} been injected at {{early stages of the}} plerion evolution. The observed flat spectra without a low frequency cutoff imply an acceleration mechanism that raises the average particle energy by few orders of magnitude but leaves most of the particles at the energy less than about few hundred MeV. It is suggested that annihilation of the alternating magnetic field at the pulsar wind termination shock provides the necessary mechanism. Toroidal stripes of opposite magnetic polarity are formed in the wind emanated from an obliquely rotating pulsar magnetosphere (the striped wind). At the termination shock, the flow is compressed and the magnetic field annihilates by driven <b>reconnection.</b> Jump <b>conditions</b> are obtained for the shock in a striped wind. It is shown that postshock MHD parameters of the flow are the same as if the energy of alternating field has already been converted into the plasma energy upstream the shock. Therefore the available estimates of the ratio of the Poynting flux to the matter energy flux, $sigma$, should be attributed not to the total upstream Poynting flux but only to that associated with the average magnetic field. A simple model for the particle acceleration in the shocked striped wind is presented...|$|R
40|$|Observations made by Polar of ion-electron bursts on {{the dawn}} {{side of the}} polar cap are presented. They {{occurred}} when conditions external to the magnetosphere corresponded {{to that of the}} sheath region of a magnetic cloud, which was characterized by very high densities/dynamic pressure and a magnetic field which was strong in all components and which was tilted antisunward (Bx&lt; 0) and northward (Bz&gt; 0) with its clock angle lying between 20 and 90 &deg; (By: 8 – 15 nT). A clear temporal development in the energy range spanned by the individual ion bursts (from 0. 2 – 2 keV to 1 – 10 keV) was present. We relate this to a corresponding temporal evolution in the cloud sheath field and plasma. We analyze the solar wind-magnetosphere aspects of the observations using the concepts of (i) (i) overdraped lobe flux, (ii) Bx- and By-regulated sequential reconnections in opposite hemispheres (magnetopause and internal modes), and (iii) newly-closed magnetic flux. In particular, we find that the most energetic ion bursts (accompanied by bi-directionally streaming electrons at 1 – 10 keV and intense magnetosheath-origin fluxes) are located on newly closed field lines generated by internal reconnection occurring between overdraped lobe field lines and the closed geomagnetic field.

40|$|A new {{ground-based}} diagnostic of reconnection at the magnetopause using ULF waves is presented, and we give {{an example}} day in which {{the dynamics of the}} open-closed boundary (OCB) are clearly observed. The diagnostic is based on data from two close (similar to 110 km), magnetic azimuthally spaced magnetometer sites (Davis and Zhongshan, Antarctica). During average IMF conditions Davis passes just equatorward of the last closed field lines in the dayside magnetosphere, and cross-phase measurements indicate propagation away from local magnetic noon (LMN) as expected for the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) acting at the magnetopause. During times when IMF B-z < - 2 nT intervals of broadband activity appear, with the azimuthal component of propagation directed towards noon. Statistical analysis shows a correlation between the negative magnitude of IMF B-z and cross-phase measurements +/- 2 - 6 hours from LMN.

Two {{laser beams}} of nanosecond duration were focused {{in close proximity}} on a solid target to intensities of I similar to 1 x 10 (15) W cm(- 2). Through the well known del n(e) x del T(e) mechanism, azimuthal magnetic fields are generated around each focal spot. During {{the expansion of the}} two plasmas, oppositely oriented field lines are brought together resulting in magnetic reconnection in the region between the two focal spots. The spatial scales and plasma parameters are consistent with the reconnection proceeding due to a Hall mechanism. An optimum focal spot separation for magnetic reconnection to occur is found to be approximate to 400 +/- 100 mu m. Proton probing of the temporal evolution of the interaction shows the formation of the boundary layer between the two expanding plasma plumes and associated magnetic fields, as well as an instability later in the interaction.

40|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted that magnetic reconnection {{is the dominant}} process at the magnetopause that enables the transfer of mass, momentum, and energy from the solar wind into the Earth's magnetosphere. Observations have also shown that magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause can sometimes be quasi-steady but at other times very unsteady (resulting in so-called flux transfer events). The reason for this dual behavior is, however, not understood. Another issue of considerable controversy is {{the existence of a}} "universal" reconnection rate, independent of the system size. Here we use a combination of hybrid (electron fluid, kinetic ions) and full particle simulations to address these issues. Our previous work using hybrid simulations has shown that reconnection can be intermittent even in the anti-parallel case. It is not clear whether this result remains in the presence of kinetic electron physics. In order to minimize the influences of initial imposed perturbations on the simulation results, we start the simulations with an island kinetic equilibrium and let the system evolve self-consistently. We compare the nonlinear evolution of the system as a function of guide field strength and system size and test the hypothesis of a "universal" <b>reconnection</b> rate.

40|$|We study {{magnetic}} <b>reconnection</b> under chromospheric <b>conditions</b> in {{five different}} ionization levels from 0. 5 % to 50 % using a self-consistent two-fluid (ions + neutrals) model {{that accounts for}} compressibility, collisional effects, chemical inequilibrium, and anisotropic heat conduction. Results with and without radiation are compared, using two models for the radiative losses: an optically thin radiation loss function, and an approximation of the radiative losses of a plasma with photospheric abundances. The results without radiation show that reconnection occurs faster for the weakly ionized cases {{as a result of}} the effect of ambipolar diffusion and fast recombination. The tearing mode instability appears earlier in the low ionized cases and grows rapidly. We find that radiative losses have a stronger effect than was found in previous results as the cooling changes the plasma pressure and the concentration of ions inside the current sheet. This affects the ambipolar diffusion and the chemical equilibrium, resulting in thin current sheets and enhanced reconnection. The results quantify this complex nonlinear interaction by showing that a strong cooling produces faster reconnections than have been found in models without radiation. The results accounting for radiation show timescales and outflows comparable to spicules and chromospheric jets. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Another more {{fundamental}} {{explanation for the}} differences between measured and modeled data deals with the forces driving ionospheric plasma flow. The CS 10 statistical convection model is parameterized by the upstream solar wind and IMF and therefore assumes the front-side reconnection rate is the driving factor controlling the ionospheric convection pattern. The expanding/contracting polar cap (ECPC) paradigm, originally described by Siscoe and Huang (1985) and further discussed {{in a number of}} papers (i.e., Cowley and Lockwood 1992; Lester et al. 2007; Milan et al. 2012; Milan 2013), offers a more encompassing explanation for convection drivers. In the ECPC paradigm, convection flow is controlled by the addition or subtraction of magnetic flux to the polar cap due to reconnection in the magnetosphere. Dayside reconnection, controlled by the upstream solar wind and IMF, and nightside <b>reconnection,</b> controlled by <b>conditions</b> in the magnetotail and substorm processes, cause the addition and subtraction of magnetic flux, respectively. The imbalance of the short-term dayside and nightside reconnection rates leads to the expansion and contraction of the polar cap, exciting ionospheric plasma flow in an effort to return the system to an equilibrium state. Note that rates balance over the long term, but not over the short term due to the finite period of time required for information to travel from the dayside reconnection point to the nightside reconnection point.|$|R
40|$|Using {{the high}} tempo-spatial {{resolution}} Hα images observed with the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, we report the solid observational evidence of magnetic reconnection between {{two sets of}} small-scale anti-parallel loops with an X-shaped topology. The reconnection process contains two steps: a slow step with the duration of more than several tens of minutes, and a rapid step lasting for only about three minutes. During the slow reconnection, two sets of anti-parallel loops reconnect gradually, and new loops are formed and stacked together. During the rapid reconnection, the anti-parallel loops approach each other quickly, and then the rapid reconnection takes place, resulting in the disappearance of former loops. In the meantime, new loops are formed and separate. The region between the approaching loops is brightened, and the thickness and length of this region are determined to be about 420 km and 1. 4 Mm, respectively. During the rapid reconnection process, obvious brightenings at the reconnection site and apparent material ejections outward along reconnected loops are observed. These observed signatures are consistent with predictions by reconnection models. We suggest that the successive slow <b>reconnection</b> changes the <b>conditions</b> around the <b>reconnection</b> site and triggers instabilities, thus leading to the rapid approach of the anti-parallel loops and resulting in the rapid reconnection.

40|$|Super-hot looptop sources, {{detected}} in some large solar flares, are compact sources of HXR emission with spectra matching thermal electron populations exceeding 30 megakelvins. High observed emission measure, {{as well as}} inference of electron thermalization within the small source region, both provide evidence of high densities at the looptop; typically more than {{an order of magnitude}} above ambient. Where some investigators have suggested such density enhancement results from a rapid enhancement in the magnetic field strength, we propose an alternative model, based on Petschek reconnection, whereby looptop plasma is heated and compressed by slow magnetosonic shocks generated self-consistently through flux retraction following <b>reconnection.</b> Under steady <b>conditions</b> such shocks can enhance density by no more than a factor of four. These steady shock relations (Rankine-Hugoniot relations) turn out to be inapplicable to Petschek's model owing to transient effects of thermal conduction. The actual density enhancement can in fact exceed a factor of ten over the entire reconnection outflow. An ensemble of flux tubes retracting following reconnection at an ensemble of distinct sites will have a collective emission measure proportional to the rate of flux tube production. This rate, distinct from the local reconnection rate within a single tube, can be measured separately through flare ribbon motion. Typical flux transfer rates and loop parameters yield emission measures comparable to those observed in super-hot sources...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDayside UV {{emissions}} in Saturn's polar ionosphere {{have been suggested}} {{to be the first}} observational evidence of the kronian "cusp" (Gérard et al., 2004). The emission has two distinct states. The first is a bright arc-like feature located in the pre-noon sector, and the second is a more diffuse "spot" of aurora which lies poleward of the general location of the main auroral oval, which may be related to different upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientations. Here we take up the suggestion that these emissions correspond to the cusp. However, direct precipitation of electrons in the cusp regions is not capable of producing significant UV aurora. We have therefore investigated the possibility that the observed UV emissions are associated with reconnection occurring at the dayside magnetopause, possibly pulsed, akin to flux transfer events seen at the Earth. We devise a conceptual model of pulsed reconnection at the low-latitude dayside magnetopause for the case of northwards IMF which will give rise to pulsed twin-vortical flows in the magnetosphere and ionosphere {{in the vicinity of the}} open-closed field-line boundary, and hence to bi-polar field-aligned currents centred in the vortical flows. During intervals of high-latitude lobe reconnection for southward IMF, we also expect to have pulsed twin-vortical flows and corresponding bi-polar field-aligned currents. The vortical flows in this case, however, are displaced poleward of the open-closed field line boundary, and are reversed in sense, such that the field-aligned currents are also reversed. For both cases of northward and southward IMF we have also for the first time included the effects associated with the IMF B y effect. We also include the modulation introduced by the structured nature of the solar wind and IMF at Saturn's orbit by developing "slow" and "fast" flow models corresponding to intermediate and high strength IMF respectively. We then consider the conditions under which the plasma populations appropriate to either sub-solar reconnection or high-latitude lobe reconnection can carry the currents indicated. We have estimated the field-aligned voltages required, the resulting precipitating particle energy fluxes, and the consequent auroral output. Overall our model of pulsed <b>reconnection</b> under <b>conditions</b> of northwards and southwards IMF, and for varying orientations of IMF B y, is found to produce a range of UV emission intensities and geometries which is in good agreement with the data presented by Gérard et al. (2004). The recent HST-Cassini solar wind campaign provides a unique opportunity to test the theoretical ideas presented here...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} number of 3 D kinetic PIC {{simulations}} aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind the onset of magnetic reconnection [1]. Traditionally, the reigning paradigm has been that microinstabilities lead to anomalous resistivity and allow reconnection to progress even in collisionless systems where under ideal <b>conditions</b> <b>reconnection</b> would be severely impeded. Our work aims at revisiting this issue using the 3 D kinetic simulation tool, CELESTE. CELESTE uses an implicit time discretization of the particle equations of motion and of the Maxwell's equations allowing to resolve the scales of interest, while averaging over the smallest scales. To understand reconnection processes we need to resolve the skin depth and the particle motion in the reconnection region, but we can step over the smaller scales (Debye length, and electron plasma frequency). The overall advantage is a reduction {{of at least one}} order of magnitude in the number of cells in each direction, and one order in time. Our analysis shows that the microinstabilities alter the initial equilibrium at a fundamental level. Besides creating a small scale turbulent fluctuating magnetic and electric field, the microinstabilities induce a macroscopic alteration of the equilibrium. Three macroscopic changes are induced. First, an anisotropic heating creates a strong temperature anisotropy enhancing the cross field temperature [2]. Second, the current layer is intensified and its profile is peaked and in cases bifurcated [2, 3, 4]. Third, a velocity shear is created [5, 6]. Each of these three effects impact profoundly the onset and evolution of reconnection. We present specific results proving the three effects and their role in the reconnection process. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{objectives of}} this thesis were {{to use the}} new PolarDARN radars to study the convection patterns at high latitudes and to attempt to explain them in terms of reconnection. Because the IMF is important in reconnection, studies of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) components Bx, By and Bz were done. The study showed that was lower by 21. 5 % than from Jan. 2006 to Dec. 2008, so By was expected {{to play an important role}} in reconnection. The IMF, spiral angle, and the amount of warping of the solar magnetic field in interplanetary space decreased slightly during this 36 -month period. The decrease in IMF was a more sensitive indicator of the solar minimum than the decrease in the 10. 7 cm solar microwave flux. A solar magnetic sector boundary study from the Jan 1, 2007 – Dec 31, 2008 interval showed the occurrence of four or two sectors in a synodic solar rotation cycle. A sector boundary crossing frequently takes place in less than 3 hours. The transition from four sectors to two sectors is surprisingly smooth, in that no interruption in the 27 -day synodic period occurs. A superposed epoch analysis of solar wind speed near sector boundary crossings showed a speed minimum about half a day before the crossing, and a maximum about two days after the crossing. The standard deviation reached a minimum at about the same time as the velocity. The sector boundary study also showed that, since Dec. 2007, there were six roughly 27 -day synodic solar rotation cycles near spring equinox when “away” field dominated, and that the following seven 27 -day cycles close to the autumnal equinox were dominated by “toward” field. This is consistent with the quasi-sinusoidal annual magnetic sector polarity oscillations that occur for about three years during solar minimum. These oscillations are due to the mainly dipolar magnetic field which is roughly aligned with the Sun’s axis, tilted 7. 25 ° from the normal to the ecliptic plane. The three-year oscillation for the present minimum between Solar Cycles 23 and 24 appeared to begin in Dec. 2007. For the past four solar minima, an El Nino event has occurred during the last of the three oscillations, and the El Nino and sinusoidal magnetic oscillation ended together. The new solar cycle began about 6 months before that. During the past eight years, a new 3 D topological “null-separator” formulation of magnetic reconnection and its effect on convection has been led by Dr. M. Watanabe in ISAS at the University of Saskatchewan. This formulation includes two types of interchange reconnection (Russell and Tanaka) as well as the traditional Dungey <b>reconnection.</b> For <b>conditions</b> when the IMF clock angle was within 30 ° of a Bz+ dominant convection, the new reconnection model shows that the convection can be driven strictly by the two types of interchange reconnection. The model predicts the existence of a “reciprocal cell” on closed field lines and an “interchange merging cell” surrounding an interior lobe cell. The construction of the PolarDARN radars at Rankin Inlet and Inuvik, completed in December, 2007, allowed polar cap convection to be measured for predominantly Bz+ conditions. The existence of the two predicted features was confirmed. This also required that satellite data be analyzed to determine the location of the open-closed-field-line-boundary (OCFLB). Several PolarDARN studies are represented to show convection for different IMF clock angles and seasons...|$|R
