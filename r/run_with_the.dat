5|$|On August 15, 2017, {{water was}} {{restored}} to the fountain as a test <b>run,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intention that it will stay on until November, when the ice rink reopens. The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian violinist Ole Bull {{attempted}} {{unsuccessfully to}} start a colony in the Kettle Creek watershed in 1852. A village was built by John Gartsee in 1853 at the confluence of Trout <b>Run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> creek. The first schoolhouse in the watershed was built in 1858 on Yochum Hill. A railroad bridge was built {{at the mouth of}} the creek in 1859.|$|E
5|$|The {{bobsleigh}} run (Pista Olimpica di Bob – Eugenio Monti), {{was originally}} constructed in 1928. The track was rebuilt and expanded {{several times during}} the years leading up to the Olympics. A state-of-the-art signal board was installed displaying a diagram of the <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> position of each sleigh on the run shown with lights.|$|E

5|$|Following his 2010 playoff <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Canucks, Raymond {{was added}} to Team Canada's roster for the 2010 IIHF World Championship in Germany, his first {{international}} tournament. Joining the team midway through the tournament during the qualification round, he recorded his lone point of the tournament, an assist, on a goal by Matt Duchene during a 3–2 loss to the Czech Republic. The following game, Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinal by Russia, losing the game 5–2. Raymond also played in the 2016 Spengler Cup, recording 7 points in 5 games for Team Canada, who won the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1910, the BX {{fulfilled}} {{a heroic}} role. The Chilco {{had been on}} its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to make one last <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> BX with the necessary supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without {{as much as a}} scratch on her paint.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 2009, Rodríguez {{was traded}} to the Texas Rangers for minor league {{reliever}} Matt Nevarez and two PTBNL. Teammate David Murphy switched his uniform number to #14 so Rodríguez could wear the #7 he previously wore with the Rangers. In his first game with the Rangers, Rodríguez went 3-for-4 with an RBI double and two singles. He hit his first home <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rangers since 2002 on August 29, a solo shot against Minnesota Twins reliever José Mijares.|$|E
50|$|An {{easement}} or {{license to}} drill for oil, gas, or minerals generally <b>runs</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land, {{and thus is}} an appurtenant easement. However, a utility easement generally <b>runs</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> owner of the easement, rather than running <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land, and as such, {{is an example of}} an easement in gross.|$|R

5|$|On September 8 Braun, the Brewers' career {{home run}} leader, hit his 300th career home <b>run.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> home run {{he became the}} 6th {{baseball}} player {{to have at least}} 300 home runs and 180 stolen bases in his first 11 big league seasons, joining Willie Mays (368 HRs, 240 SB), Reggie Jackson (313 HRs, 188 SB), Barry Bonds (334 HRs, 380 SB), Sammy Sosa (336 HRs, 224 SB), and Alex Rodriguez (381 HRs, 205 SB). After the 2017 season, Braun was also ranked first on the Brewers' all-time list in slugging percentage (.540), second in RBIs (989), and third in runs scored (937), doubles (345), triples (45), and stolen bases (193). Through 2017, he was sixth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage.|$|E
5|$|On senior day in Tuscaloosa, Alabama dipped down {{to college}} football's Football Championship Subdivision and {{defeated}} the Mocs of UT-Chattanooga 45–0. After being stopped {{on their first}} possession, Alabama reached the end zone on the next five consecutive possessions in running up a 35–0 lead in the first half. First-quarter touchdowns included a 2-yard Trent Richardson run, a 25-yard Mark Ingram run, and a 19-yard Julio Jones reception from Greg McElroy. In the second quarter, touchdowns were scored by Javier Arenas on a 66-yard punt return and on a 40-yard Ingram <b>run.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> only third quarter points coming on a 41-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal, Bama's final points of the afternoon came on a 21-yard Roy Upchurch touchdown run in the fourth.|$|E
5|$|Speedie {{was hired}} in 1960 as an end coach for the Houston Oilers in the American Football League (AFL). The Oilers won the AFL {{championship}} that year, but Speedie left in 1961 after the head coach, former teammate Lou Rymkus, was fired. He then {{took a job as}} an assistant for the AFL's Denver Broncos and was promoted to head coach in 1964. His two-year <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team was unsuccessful, however. After his resignation in 1966, Speedie became a scout for the Broncos, a job he kept until his retirement in 1982. Despite lobbying by friends and former teammates, Speedie was not selected for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The 1938 Ashes Tour of England was McCabe's {{last for}} Australia. He was again {{appointed}} vice-captain for the tour. In the second tour match, McCabe scored 110 in an innings win over Oxford University. His 50 against Essex {{in the final}} match before the Tests {{was the only other}} fifty in the first nine matches, in which he scored 301 runs at 37.62. He took a total of 4/50 in an innings win over Northamptonshire. McCabe’s lean <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat was causing concern for the Australians, as the other batsmen had been productive.|$|E
5|$|The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge {{is located}} in a {{predominantly}} rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County within the Cacapon River valley. Baker Mountain, a forested narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises to the immediate west, and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise to the bridge's east. The confluence of Capon Springs <b>Run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cacapon River lies just north (downstream) of the bridge. George Washington National Forest is located to the bridge's southeast, covering the forested area south of Capon Springs Road.|$|E
5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts {{to open the}} third quarter, the Bulldogs {{sustained}} their longest drive of the game. They drove 97 yards in 16 plays, but Tyler Russell threw a pass that was intercepted by Robert Lester in the endzone for a touchback that halted the drive. On the Alabama drive that ensued, State managed to force a punt, however it was fumbled by Deontae Skinner that gave the Crimson Tide possession at the Bulldogs' 28-yard line {{early in the fourth}} quarter. Three plays later, Phillip Ely threw his first career touchdown pass to Eddie Lacy from 27 yards for a 31–0 Alabama lead. On the kickoff that ensued, Christion Jones forced a Jameon Lewis fumble that was recovered by Landon Collins at the State 43-yard line, and eight plays later Alabama led 38–0 on a three-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown <b>run.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Crimson Tide reserves in on defense, the Bulldogs did manage to break up the shutout bid late in the fourth quarter when State scored their lone points on a two-yard Dak Prescott touchdown pass to Robert Johnson and made the final score 38–7. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 75–18–3 (77–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

5|$|After {{moving to}} the Montreal area, the LeDucs debuted in the International Wrestling Association with a scripted attack on local wrestler Johnny Rougeau. This led to a feud between the LeDucs and the Rougeaus (Johnny and his real-life brother Jacques). Jos LeDuc was booked to win the Montreal version of the International Heavyweight Championship by {{defeating}} Johnny Rougeau in 1971. The bookers also decided {{to give him a}} <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> International Tag Team Championship that year, which LeDuc won while teaming with Tony Baillargeon. While in Montreal, the LeDucs also competed for Grand Prix Wrestling and were booked in a feud with the Vachon brothers (Mad Dog and Butcher) as well as Killer Kowalski. The LeDucs had two reigns as the Grand Prix Wrestling Tag Team Championship in 1972 and 1973.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1940 Lindwall made his first grade rugby league debut in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the St. George club {{alongside}} his older brother Jack, {{who had been with}} the club since 1938. He played at fullback and assumed goal-kicking responsibilities. Lindwall's cricketing improved during the 1940–41 season, taking 34 wickets at 16.45, approximately doubling his wickets while halving their cost. By this time, many of his colleagues had enlisted in the armed services and the competition was beginning to thin out during World War II. Lindwall missed the 1941 NSWRFL season due to illness, and in doing so missed out on the team that won the premiership that season. In October 1941, Lindwall was selected to make his first-class cricket debut against Queensland in Brisbane, just after turning 20. Playing along his childhood hero McCabe, Lindwall put in a wayward performance. He conceded an expensive 81 runs in 15 wicketless overs and made just one <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat. The Sheffield Shield season was cancelled a month later after the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, that signalled the widening of the war into the Pacific arena. The Sydney grade cricket competition continued, and Lindwall helped St. George to a hat-trick of premierships with 27 wickets at 22.19 and 405 runs at 27.00.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , A Link to the Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While A Link to the Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as bombs are in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. A Link to the Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E

5|$|Of these 27 players, 14 were {{right-handed}} batters, 11 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters. The San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are {{the only}} franchises to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: for the Giants, Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds, and, for the Red Sox, Jimmie Foxx, Williams, and more recently Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz. Five 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, and Alex Rodriguez—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Gary Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> New York Mets, {{the first time that}} a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest. The most recent player to reach 500 home runs is Ortiz, who hit his 500th home run on September 12, 2015. As of the end of the 2017 Major League Baseball season, Albert Pujols is the only active member of the 500 home run club.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles could not stand up to the demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to <b>run</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E
