40|$|A general {{method is}} {{described}} for formally specifying and reasoning about distributed systems with any desired degree of immediacy for revoking authentication. To effect revocation, `authenticating entities' impose freshness constraints on credentials or authenticated {{statements made by}} trusted intermediaries. If fresh statements are not presented, then the authentication is questionable. Freshness constraints are derived from initial policy assumptions and authentic statements made by trusted intermediaries. By adjusting freshness constraints, the delay for certain revocation can be arbitrarily bounded. We illustrate how the inclusion of freshness policies within certificates enables {{the design of a}} secure and highly available <b>revocation</b> <b>service.</b> We illustrate the application of the method and new techniques in an example...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the hardest}} tasks of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is to manage {{revocation}}. Different revocation mechanisms have been proposed to invalidate the credentials of compromised or misbe- having users. All these mechanisms aim to optimize the transmission of revocation data to avoid unnecessary network overhead. To that end, they establish release policies bas ed {{on the assumption that}} the revoca- tion data follows uniform or Poisson distribution. Temporal distribution of the revocation data has a significant influence on the performance and scalability of the <b>revocation</b> <b>service.</b> In this paper, we demonstrate that the temporal distribution of the daily number of revoked certificates is statistically self-similar, and that the currently assumed Poisson distribu- tion does not capture the statistical properties of the distribution. None of the commonly used revocation models takes into account this fractal behavior, though such behavior has serious implications for the design, control, and analysis of revocation protocols such as CRL or delta-CRL.

40|$|Abstract: Vehicular {{networks}} {{are becoming more}} and more important in our society because of the great benefits that can be obtained from them. Most research contributions propose specific mechanisms where the presence of a Certification Authority is necessary, which implies a centralized system in charge of certification and <b>revocation</b> <b>services.</b> In our work we propose a more realistic view of what will be the beginning of these networks, where privacy and integrity are required and where misbehaving or faulty nodes have to be detected and prevented from disrupting the network operation in a self-organized way. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{non-repudiation}} services where digital signatures usually {{serve as}} irrefutable cryptographic evidence for dispute resolution, trusted time-stamping and certificate <b>revocation</b> <b>services,</b> although very costly in practice, must be available, to prevent big loss due to compromising of the signing key. In [11], {{a new concept}} called intrusion-resilient signature was proposed {{to get rid of}} trusted time-stamping and certificate <b>revocation</b> <b>services</b> and a concrete scheme was presented. In this paper, we put forward a new scheme that can achieve the same effect in a much more efficient way. In our scheme, forward-secure signature serves as a building block that enables signature validation without trusted time-stamping, and a one-way hash chain is employed to control the validity of public-key certificates without the CA's involvement for certificate revocation. We adopt a model similar to the intrusion-resilient signature in [11], where time is divided into predefined short periods and a user has two modules, signer and home base. The signer generates forward-secure signatures on his own while the home base manages the validity of the signer's public-key certificate with a one-way hash chain. The signature verifier can check the validity of signatures without retrieving the certificate revocation information from the CA. Our scheme is more robust in the sense that loss of synchronization between the signer and the home base could be recovered in the next time period while it is unrecoverable in [11]. To facilitate the implementation of our signature validation scheme, we further present a new forward-secure signature scheme which is more efficient than all of the existing forward-secure signature schemes...|$|R
40|$|Authentication {{in various}} {{communication}} systems and protocols is {{often based on}} X. 509 identity certificates. The verification of these certificates requires a global trust anchor (certificate authority) that is accepted by the communication partners that attempt to authenticate to each other. The non-availability of the services of this trust anchor, especially certificate <b>revocation</b> <b>services,</b> prevents successful authentication and communication. The trust anchor therefore constitutes a single point of failure. This is not acceptable for mission-critical communication systems such as the future aeronautical telecommunications network that will support air traffic control communications. Within this paper, an extension to X. 509 identity certificates is proposed that allows the authenticating partners to verify each other's certificate without a global trust anchor. Instead, a distributed architecture is introduced where communication partners only require {{the services of a}} local trust anchor. No inter-trust domain operations are therefore required for the verification of our extended certificate format...|$|R

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{network is}} a {{wireless}} network {{without the support}} of network infrastructure. Security {{is one of the main}} challenge in ad hoc network due to dynamic topology and mobility of nodes. In this paper, we present a new composite key management scheme based on a combination of techniques such as hierarchical clustering, partially distributed key management, offline certification authority and mobile agent. In this method, network is hierarchically structured into clusters based on node’s trust value. The information about node <b>revocation</b> and PKG <b>service</b> nodes are exchanged in the network using mobile agents. The cluster head maintains public keys of its members which overcomes the storage problem in PKI where each node maintains public key of other nodes in network and avoids centralized CA to generate keys, thus enhances security.

50|$|Muchalls Castle was the {{location}} of an important {{turning point in the}} Reformation in Scotland. In 1638 at Edinburgh signatories to a Covenant opposed imposition of the Episcopal liturgical system then backed by the King. Aberdeen {{was one of the last}} holdouts to confirm this covenant, its opposition led by six scholars at Marischal College and King's College remembered as the Aberdeen doctors. Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, Laird of Muchalls Castle, along with James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, Dickson, Henderson, Lord Coupar, the Master of Forbes and others formed a delegation of Covenanters to approach the doctors. The doctors offered the Cup of Bon Accord to the Covenanters and had laid out an elaborate banquet; however, very dramatically, the Covenanters refused the Cup, stating they would not meet until the doctors had signed the Covenant. The doctors were very disturbed and composed a list of queries, demanding the Covenanters response. Muchalls Castle was the site of the Covenanters meeting where they drew up their plucky and learned response to the doctors. From this confrontation and other concomitant events, Charles I unexpectedly made sweeping reforms and concessions to the Covenanters including <b>revocation</b> of the <b>Service</b> Book and Canons, repeal of the Perth Articles and enjoined subscription to Craigs Negative Confession of 1580, a document condemning papal errors.|$|R

Even if the IRS had determined policy, beyond its authority in deciding, opposing this case would be politically foolish. In the event he was recalled to the United States from a banking conference to be present for the Treasury's announcement; when he arrived he found that his seniors were all absent and he was required to announce this choice. Treasury and Department of Justice had worked this out between themselves, and White House staff were furious. A political firestorm followed, and efforts to mitigate it were unsuccessful. (The Supreme Court of the United States subsequently held, in Bob Jones University v. United States, that the IRS did have this power even though petitioner had complied with the language of the statute.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic coalitions are {{the means}} through which {{a group of}} {{entities}} with common interest collaborate to achieve significant mission objectives. The coalition participants are often distributed across geographic areas, have different levels of technological capability, and have language and cultural barriers to effective communication. In the information age, the execution of all the coalition functions will be heavily mediated through information technologies. The purpose of our effort is to develop, demonstrate and deliver a scalable, reliable, and survivable application platform that enables efficient formation, operation, and management of secure dynamic coalitions suitable for the military environment. Our approach consists of four key innovative ideas: (1) Create a Secure Collaborative Space from shared space technologies developed in the distributed computing research community. (2) Build a certification authority (CA) service based on threshold cryptography, integrated into the collaborative space. Intrusion-tolerance and scalability will be achieved through multiple groups of shared CA servers. The CA servers will be integrated with external authentication and policy mechanisms. (3) Implement a certificate <b>revocation</b> notification (CRN) <b>service</b> based on event notification mechanism in the shared space.
