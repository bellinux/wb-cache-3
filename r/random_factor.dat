However, random fractal means that under the condition that the rules for generating fractal graphics are unchanged; the final generated graphics will be different due to the influence of <b>random</b> <b>factors.</b> Although <b>random</b> fractal has its own rules, the final generated graphics are unpredictable due to the introduction of <b>random</b> <b>factors</b> in the generation process, that is, the graphics produced by two operations in different time can have the same fractal dimension, but the shapes may be different, so random fractal has no repeatability.|$|R

Based on the {{computation}} {{method of}} reliability in limit state theory, the paper analyzes sensitivity of gear reliability {{with the change}} of various <b>random</b> <b>factors.</b> Taking the reliability computation of circular gear as an example, it systematically calculates the change of gear reliability with the change of average value and RMS error of random variables. Based upon the computed result, it analyzes and finds out sensible <b>random</b> <b>factors</b> that have larger influence on gear reliability {{for the convenience of}} strict control of gear design, manufacturing, use and maintenance in future in order to guarantee the requirement for gear reliability. Computed result in this paper can be used as reference for the study on gear reliability in future. Intorduction Gear {{is one of the key}} parts in machine driven system and its reliability receives much concern and people have been making wideisranged researches on it [1 ～ 4]. Most researches are related to computation method of gear reliability and its computation & solution procedure and none of them are concerned about the analysis and study on the sensitivity caused by the change of various <b>random</b> <b>factors.</b> Gear structure is complicated, which results in numerous <b>random</b> <b>factors</b> that influence its reliability and also complicated computation method of reliability.

I describe procedures for statistical power analysis in such experiments and demonstrate how these procedures can be used to answer difficult questions of optimal design in the presence of stimulus sampling. Next I discuss the implications of these power analysis results for how direct replications ought to be conducted for studies that involve stimulus sampling. Finally I discuss power analysis for general ANOVA designs that can consist of any number of fixed or <b>random</b> <b>factors,</b> each with any number of levels, and with any valid pattern of nesting or crossing of the factors.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the present}} paper is to perform a {{comprehensive}} study of the covariance structures in balanced linear models containing <b>random</b> <b>factors</b> which are invariant with respect to marginal permutations of the <b>random</b> <b>factors.</b> We shall focus on model formulation and interpretation rather than the estimation of parameters. It is proven that permutation invariance implies a specific structure for the covariance matrices. Useful results are obtained for the spectra of permutation invariant covariance matrices. In particular, the reparameterization of random effects, i. e., imposing certain constraints, will be considered. There are many possibilities to choose reparameterization constraints in a linear model, however not every reparameterization keeps permutation invariance. The question is if there are natural restrictions on the random effects in a given model, i. e., such reparameterizations which are defined by the covariance structure of the corresponding factor. Examining relationships between the reparameterization conditions applied to the <b>random</b> <b>factors</b> of the models and the spectrum of the corresponding covariance matrices when permutation invariance is assumed, restrictions on the spectrum of the covariance matrix are obtained which lead to “sum-to-zero” reparameterization of the corresponding factor...|$|R
