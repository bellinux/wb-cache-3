5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> {{the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness {{hypothesis}} include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

25|$|The MRHA's {{constitutionality}} has not {{yet been}} tested in court. The Act prima facie violates Article 15(1) since the imposition of a restraining order effectively inhibits a person's rights to profess, practise and propagate his or her religion. However, given Parliament's <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> the enactment of the MRHA, {{it is likely that the}} Act amounts to a general law relating to public order. Thus, its constitutionality may be preserved by Article 15(4).|$|E
25|$|Randomness {{can be seen}} as {{conflicting}} {{with the}} deterministic ideas of some religions, such as those where the universe is created by an omniscient deity who is aware of all past and future events.

This is one of the <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> religious opposition to evolution, which states that non-random selection is applied to the results of random genetic variation.|$|E

25|$|The ABL is jointly {{owned by}} MLB (75%) and the ABF (25%). Rather than {{following}} more traditional {{models of the}} franchises being owned privately by individuals or organisations, the league {{is the owner of}} each team. One of the <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> this structure is to closely manage the financial situation, helping to ensure that all teams are equally viable.

25|$|Also, an {{extremely}} independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, {{which is the}} duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.|$|E

25|$|While penetrative rape {{generally}} {{does not}} involve {{the use of a}} condom, in some cases a condom is used. This significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and disease transmission, both to the victim and to the rapist. <b>Rationales</b> <b>for</b> condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of sex workers or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning {{and the use of the}} condom as an added prop. Concern for the victim is generally not considered a factor.|$|E
25|$|One of the Tsar’s {{principal}} <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> risking war in 1914 was {{his desire}} to restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo-Japanese war. Nicholas also sought to foster {{a greater sense of}} national unity with a war against a common and ancient enemy. The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse ethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years before the First World War. Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhuman working conditions. Instead of restoring Russia's political and military standing, World War I led to the horrifying slaughter of Russian troops and military defeats that undermined both the monarchy and society in general to the point of collapse.|$|E
25|$|Although Marshall was {{personally}} opposed to slavery, he consistently failed {{to put his}} beliefs into action - as he feared an upset to the societal order of the Untied States. As a young attorney, he represented prominent Virginia abolitionist Robert Pleasants, who sought to enforce his father's will and free slaves, although such was illegal at the time his late father had written the will. Although Marshall won before Chancellor George Wythe and the specific slaves were ultimately freed, in the final opinions in that case, Virginia justice Spencer Roane (who would become Marshall's rival) began enunciating the rationale for slaveholding as a property right, contrary to the lofty principles of natural law enunciated by Judge Wythe (and his former pupil Thomas Jefferson in the U.S. Declaration of Independence). Marshall's good friend John Wickham was another of {{the architects of the}} legal <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> slaveholding which transformed Richmond into a leading slave-trading center.|$|E

500|$|The {{allegations}} had {{a negative}} impact on the popularity of Thaksin and his government, despite the fact that no evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of a plot.

While conventional neoclassical economic theories of the 1960s and 1970s explained these as the result of free choices made by women and men who simply had different abilities or preferences, feminist economists pointed out the important roles played by stereotyping, sexism, patriarchal beliefs and institutions, sexual harassment, and discrimination. The <b>rationales</b> <b>for,</b> and the effects of, anti-discrimination laws adopted in many industrial countries beginning in the 1970s, has also been studied.|$|E

[...] The Thai military eventually successfully executed a coup against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006. [...] One of the junta's stated <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> the coup was that Thaksin had insulted the King.|$|E

500|$|... "Jamestown 2007" [...] marked Virginia's quadricentennial year, celebrating 400 {{years since}} the {{establishment}} of the Jamestown Colony. The celebrations highlighted contributions from Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, each of which had a significant part in shaping Virginia's history. Warfare, including among these groups, has also had an important role. Virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the French and Indian War, the American Revolution and the Civil War, to the Cold War and the War on Terrorism. Stories about historic figures, such as those surrounding Pocahontas and John Smith, George Washington's childhood, or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period, have also created potent myths of state history, and have served as <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> Virginia's ideology.|$|E
500|$|... another non-fiction travelogue which Steinbeck {{wrote in}} 1962, {{is seen as}} a more rounded view of the author late in life, but The Log from the Sea of Cortez is {{regarded}} as showing the direct influence of Ed Ricketts and his philosophies on Steinbeck, and provides clues to the underlying <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> some events in his novels. In particular, [...] "About Ed Ricketts" [...] reveals how closely he was tied to the characters in Steinbeck's novels: parts are taken almost verbatim from descriptions of [...] "Doc" [...] in Cannery Row. The book is also important for seeing something of Ed Ricketts himself. It was the only example of his philosophical writings published in his lifetime. The [...] "Essay on Non-teleological Thinking" [...] was part of a trilogy of philosophical essays he had written before the trip, and which, with Steinbeck's help, he continued to try to have published until his death.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography called Hàn-lô ( [...] ; {{literally}} Chinese-Roman), and sometimes Han-Romanization mixed script, a style not unlike written Japanese or (historically) Korean. In fact, the term Hàn-lô does not describe one specific system, but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization. That romanization is usually POJ, although recently some texts have begun appearing with Taiwanese Romanization System (Tâi-lô) spellings too. The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes (estimated to be around 15 percent of running text) which are not definitively associated with a particular character. Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue, including creating new characters, allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings (but dissimilar etymology) to represent the missing characters, or using romanization for the [...] "missing 15%". There are two <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> using mixed orthography writing, with two different aims. The first is to allow native speakers (almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters) to make use of their knowledge of characters, while replacing the missing 15% with romanization. The second is to wean character literates off using them gradually, to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text.|$|E
