A representative of Hope not Hate said the number of phone calls to its helpline concerning anti-Muslim incidents greatly increased after the murder. Hope not Hate reported 193 Islamophobic incidents, including attacks on 10 mosques, as of 27 May. On 1 June, Tell MAMA, a government-funded project, reported 212 anti-Muslim incidents, including 125 online incidents, 17 incidents involving [...] physical attack, and 11 attacks on mosques. It was reported on 9 June that government funding for Tell MAMA would not be renewed, due to concern over the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> reported by the organisation, although the decision had been made before Rigby's death.|$|E

40|$|As {{more and}} more {{high-throughput}} protein-protein interaction data are collected, the task <b>of</b> estimating the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> different <b>data</b> sets becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present our study of two groups <b>of</b> protein-protein interaction <b>data,</b> the physical interaction data and the protein complex data, and estimate the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>data</b> sets using three different measurements: (1) the distribution of gene expression correlation coefficients, (2) the reliability based on gene ex-pression correlation coefficients, and (3) the accuracy of protein function predictions. We develop a maximum likelihood method to estimate the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> protein interaction <b>data</b> sets according to the distribution of correlation coefficients of gene expression profiles of putative interact-ing protein pairs. The results of the three measurements are consistent with each other.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>data</b> {{for minor}} {{actinides}} was evaluated {{by using the}} results of the post-irradiation experiment for actinide samples irradiated at the Dounreay Prototype Fast Reactor.

From the comparison between the experimental data and the calculational results, in general, the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>data</b> for the minor actinides are at an adequate level for the conceptual design study of transmutation systems.
