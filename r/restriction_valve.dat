40|$|High heat {{transfer}} rates at reasonably low temperature differences {{can be obtained}} by utilizing a boiling fluid. The use of boiling {{heat transfer}} is often limited by onset of a heat transfer crisis named the Critical Heat Flux (CHF). The CHF is accompanied by an inordinate increase in temperature with the most severe consequence being related to the physical burnout of the heated surface. Two-phase boiling flows in channels are sometimes prone to flow instabilities. Density Wave Oscillations (DWO) is {{the most common type of}} thermo-hydraulic instability. DWO are fluid waves of alternating higher and lower densities propagating across the system. It is characterized by large cyclic fluctuations in flow rate and pressure and has a period of about twice the heated channel transit time. The literature survey condenses previous results and identifies different approaches for obtaining them in experimental studies. The purpose of this study is to perform an experimental investigation on the effect of flow instabilities on the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop characteristics of a 5 mm uniformly heated horizontal boiling in-tube system utilizing R 134 a as the working fluid. The experiments confirmed that the system stability is improved by opening the inlet <b>restriction</b> <b>valve</b> and omitting exit orifice. The influence of the pump system characteristics on DWO was also explored. Establishing an unconditional stable system configuration allowed for generation of reference data. DWO was found to occur when vapor quality becomes sufficiently high in a system operating with inlet and exit restrictions and some degree of inlet subcooling. Mimicking DWO by superimposing flow oscillations by cycling the pump drive was also a viable solution. It was found that the overall heat transfer decreased proportionally to the flow amplitude. Shifting the period of oscillation from its natural frequency to lower frequencies reduces the heat transfer. The saturated boiling heat transfer coefficient was highly dependent on heat flux, and almost independent of flow rate, indicating that nucleate boiling was the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Comparisons were made to saturated boiling correlations. Heat transfer scales generally well with pressure drop, except a sudden reduction when DWO commences. The local heat transfer coefficient in the test section outlet increased with heat flux until it suddenly dropped due to an abrupt increase in wall temperature, distinguished as the normal CHF. The onset of DWO was found to trigger premature CHF at heat fluxed of about 90 % the normal CHF. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aortic valve {{diseases}} are either of congenital etiology or secondary to rheumatic, subacute bacterial or degenerative involvement. Lesions, even severe ones, might be symptomless, often for prolonged periods. The indications for surgical treatment {{are based on}} well defined clinical, radiological, electrocardiographic and hemodynamic criteria. The existence of dyspnea, angina, and pulmonary edema indicates immediate surgical treatment. With the exception of congenital stenoses which are curable by conservative operations, all the other aortic valve diseases when they reach the surgical stage, require valve replacement by an artificial or a biological valve. Because of the imperfection of these valvular substitutes, this treatment {{should be considered as}} palliative and as such be confined to the treatment of lesions which endanger patients' life.

These sites, along with Valve and various video game streamers, have come under scrutiny due to ethical and legal questions relating to gambling on sporting matches, underage gambling, undisclosed promotion, and outcome rigging. Evidence of such unethical practices was discovered in June 2016, and led to two formal lawsuits filed against these sites and Valve in the following month. Valve subsequently has taken steps to stop such sites from using Steam's interface for enabling gambling, leading to about half of these sites to close down, while driving more of the skin gambling into an underground economy.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve high heat removal rates for micro scale cooling, it may be {{necessary}} to exploit boiling heat transfer. The size of corresponding heat sinks is continuously decreasing from mini size to micro size, and one of the most practical and extensive cooling methods is boiling heat transfer in plain microchannels and microtubes, which might be limited by inherent boiling instabilities. This study provides useful information about boiling instability phenomena in microtubes and offers a parametric comparative investigation. Experimental data are obtained from microtubes having 254 ∼μm and 685 ∼ μm inner diameters, which were tested at low mass fluxes (78. 9 - 276. 3 kg/m 2 s) to reveal potential boiling instability mechanisms. De-ionized water was used as working fluid, while microtubes were heated by Joule heating. Configurations prone to boiling instabilities (low system pressures, low mass fluxes) were imposed to observe boiling instabilities in microtubes. Fine <b>restriction</b> <b>valves</b> were introduced to the system for providing flow restriction at the inlet. Alongside the experiments without any inlet restriction, experiments were conducted with configurations having inlet restrictions, where pressure drops over inlet restriction elements were 4 and 8 times as much as pressure drop over the microtube to suppress boiling instabilities. Temperature and pressure drop fluctuation signals were recorded and processed before premature CHF (Critical Heat Flux) conditions and at impending premature CHF conditions. Furthermore, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the recorded data is performed for revealing the frequency correlations of the obtained fluctuations for observing the change in the FFT behavior. A significant rise in energy of the side lobes, which are basically the high frequency spectral regions, was observed from FFT profiles for impending premature CHF conditions implying that FFT could be used as a detection tool for premature CHF...|$|R

Peak mitral diastolic closure rate was reduced to 120 +/- 80 mm/s, compared with normal (250 +/- 60 mm/s). Peak rate of increase of dimension was normal (13. 4 cm/s), though the pattern of filling was disturbed, with the duration of rapid filling prolonged in 5, and shortened in 15, suggesting <b>restriction.</b> Mitral <b>valve</b> opening, normally synchronous with minimum dimension, was delayed by a mean of 76 ms, and during this period there was an abnormal increase in dimension.

None of these findings correlated with the reduction in peak mitral diastolic closure rate. Noninvasive methods thus show that relaxation may be abnormal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

30|$|Due to the {{abundance}} of water phase in oilfield operations as it is produced along with the oil in often large quantities, viscosity reduction in heavy crude oils and bitumens {{can be achieved by}} transporting these crude oils as oil-in-water emulsions (Langevin et al. 2004). This does not impose any operational problems during emergency shutdowns (Simon and Poynter 1970) since emulsions can be stabilized {{for long periods of time}} using nonionic surfactants because they are cheap and thermodynamically stable in saline water (Rivas et al. 1998). Emulsions are prepared by mixing the oil and water phases through stirring and/or flow through flow <b>restrictions</b> such as <b>valves</b> and chokes. The produced oil-in-water emulsions can have a viscosity more than two orders of magnitude lower than the oil (Yaghi and Al-Bemani 2002). An additional advantage of the transport of heavy oil via oil-in-water emulsions is the reduction in pipe corrosion sediment formation (Poynter and Tigrina 1970).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the testing of a statistical, rule-based fault detection and diagnostic method on a rooftop air conditioning unit. When faults occur in the unit, the measured thermodynamic states differ from the states which are predicted by a model for normal system behavior, generating residuals. The magnitude and statistical uncertainty of the residuals determine the detection sensitivity of the technique. The directional changes in the residuals are statistically compared with a set of rules in order to diagnose a fault. By experimentally introducing faults to the air conditioning unit at five different operating conditions and recording the changes in output states, the detection sensitivity of the technique was quantified and the robustness of the diagnostic rules was verified. Results show that the technique is able to reliably detect refrigerant leakage, condenser fouling, evaporator fouling, liquid line <b>restriction,</b> and compressor <b>valve</b> leakage over a wide range of operating conditions, before a significant decrease in the capacity and COP has occurred. However, the sensitivity of the technique is influenced by the operating conditions of the unit. 2...|$|R

50|$|Water and gas taps have {{adjustable}} flow: {{gate valves}} are more progressive; ball valves more coarse, typically used in on-off applications. Turning a valve knob or lever sets adjusts flow by varying the aperture {{of the control}} device in the valve assembly. The result when opened in any degree is a choked flow. Its rate is independent of the viscosity or temperature of the fluid or gas in the pipe, and depends only weakly on the supply pressure, so that flow rate is stable at a given setting. At intermediate flow settings the pressure at the <b>valve</b> <b>restriction</b> drops nearly to zero from the Venturi effect; in water taps, this causes the water to boil momentarily at room temperature as it passes through the restriction. Bubbles of cool water vapor form and collapse at the restriction, causing the familiar hissing sound. At very low flow settings, the viscosity of the water becomes important and the pressure drop (and hissing noise) vanish; at full flow settings, parasitic drag in the pipes becomes important and the water again becomes quiet.|$|R

Euthanasia was chosen due to low output syn-drome during the surgical repair attempted when the dog was 5 years old. Postmortem examination revealed markedly thickened pulmonary valve due to the increase of extracellular matrix which might be produced by increased α smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts. The thickening of the valve was associated with <b>restriction</b> of the <b>valve’s</b> motion, resulting in restenosis in the present case.

Mutations in the human gene are implicated in the congenital heart disorder, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), but the signalling effects of plakoglobin loss in ARVC have not been established. Here we report that knockdown of plakoglobin in zebrafish results in decreased heart size, reduced heartbeat, cardiac oedema, reflux of blood between heart chambers and a twisted tail. Wholemount in situ hybridisation shows reduced expression of the heart markers nkx 2. 5 at 24 hours post fertilisation (hpf), and cmlc 2 and vmhc at 48  hpf, while there is lack of <b>restriction</b> of the <b>valve</b> markers notch 1 b and bmp 4 at 48  hpf. Wnt target gene expression was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and found to be increased in morphant embryos indicating that plakoglobin is antagonistic to Wnt signalling.

However, {{the utilization of}} leaflet mobilization and extension with the pericardium to increase the surface of coaptation may achieve satisfactory results. We reviewed our experience with leaflet extension in rheumatic mitral repair with emphasis on the technique and mid-term results. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2010, 62 of 446 rheumatic patients had leaflet extension with glutaraldehyde-treated autologous peri-cardium {{as part of their}} mitral repair procedure. Their clinical and echocardiographic data were prospectively analysed. RESULTS: The mean age of the rheumatic patients was 20. 2 ± 11. 7 years; range 3 – 60 years. Fourty-eight (77. 4 %) patients had predomin-ant MR, while 22. 6 % had mixed mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation (MS/MR). Leaflet extension was performed in the posterior, anterior and both leaflets in 77, 13 and 10 % of patients, respectively.

40|$|The thioredoxin-regulated {{chloroplast}} protein CP 12 forms a multienzyme complex {{with the}} Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). PRK and GAPDH are inactivated when present in this complex, a process shown in vitro to be dependent upon oxidized CP 12. The importance of CP 12 in vivo in higher plants, however, {{has not been}} investigated. Here, antisense suppression of CP 12 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was observed to impact on NAD-induced PRK and GAPDH complex formation but {{had little effect on}} enzyme activity. Additionally, only minor changes in photosynthetic carbon fixation were observed. Despite this, antisense plants displayed changes in growth rates and morphology, including dwarfism and reduced apical dominance. The hypothesis that CP 12 is essential to separate oxidative pentose phosphate pathway activity from Calvin-Benson cycle activity, as proposed in cyanobacteria, was tested. No evidence was found to support this role in tobacco. Evidence was seen, however, for a <b>restriction</b> to malate <b>valve</b> capacity, with decreases in NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity (but not protein levels) and pyridine nucleotide content. Antisense repression of CP 12 also led to significant changes in carbon partitioning, with increased carbon allocation to the cell wall and the organic acids malate and fumarate and decreased allocation to starch and soluble carbohydrates. Severe decreases were also seen in 2 -oxoglutarate content, a key indicator of cellular carbon sufficiency. The data presented here indicate that in tobacco, CP 12 has a role in redox-mediated regulation of carbon partitioning from the chloroplast and provides strong in vivo evidence that CP 12 is required for normal growth and development in plants. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.

40|$|Objective Women with cardiac disease {{becoming}} pregnant have {{an increased}} risk of obstetric and fetal events. The aim {{of this study was to}} study the incidence of events, to validate the modified WHO (mWHO) risk classification and to search for event-specific predictors. Methods The Registry Of Pregnancy And Cardiac disease is a worldwide ongoing prospective registry that has enrolled 2742 pregnancies in women with known cardiac disease (mainly congenital and valvular disease) before pregnancy, from January 2008 up to April 2014. Results Mean age was 28. 2 ± 5. 5 years, 45 % were nulliparous and 33. 3 % came from emerging countries. Obstetric events occurred in 231 pregnancies (8. 4 %). Fetal events occurred in 651 pregnancies (23. 7 %). The mWHO classification performed poorly in predicting obstetric (c-statistic= 0. 601) and fetal events (c-statistic= 0. 561). In multivariable analysis, aortic valve disease was associated with pre-eclampsia (OR= 2. 6, 95 %CI= 1. 3 to 5. 5). Congenital heart disease (CHD) was associated with spontaneous preterm birth (OR= 1. 8, 95 %CI= 1. 2 to 2. 7). Complex CHD was associated with small-for-gestational-age neonates (OR= 2. 3, 95 %CI= 1. 5 to 3. 5). Multiple gestation was the strongest predictor of fetal events: fetal/neonatal death (OR= 6. 4, 95 %CI= 2. 5 to 16), spontaneous preterm birth (OR= 5. 3, 95 %CI= 2. 5 to 11) and small-for-gestational age (OR= 5. 0, 95 %CI= 2. 5 to 9. 8). Conclusion The mWHO classification is not suitable for prediction of obstetric and fetal events in women with cardiac disease. Maternal complex CHD was independently associated with fetal growth <b>restriction</b> and aortic <b>valve</b> disease with pre-eclampsia, potentially offering an insight into the pathophysiology of these pregnancy complications.

40|$|The {{project is}} to investigate, study, and develop a large-field, {{beryllium}} filtered cold neutron source for use in performing neutron radiography {{for a wide variety}} of basic research activities at the UC Davis/ McClellan Nuclear Radiation Center (MNRC). The UCD/ MNRC’s 2 -MW TRIGA reactor which went online in 1990, and is the youngest research reactor in U. S. is renowned for its world-class facilities for performing thermal neutron radiography. It provides support for non-destructive inspection of materials and technology in the automotive, aerospace, and material science areas. The proposed research intends to study, design, modify, and transform one of the existing four thermal neutron radiography beams into a large-field, beryllium filtered cold neutron radiographic beam. When added to the extensive experiences in thermal neutron radiography, this additional capability will further enhance the existing thermal neutron radiography to support basic research activities in the automotive, aerospace, material, chemical, and biological sciences. It will also make investigating crucial dynamic (real-time) engineering problems such as flow <b>restrictions</b> across <b>valves</b> or two-phase flow situations feasible. The project is dedicated to advancing our existing technology of implementing neutron radiography and development of fundamental nuclear science and technology. 	Thermal neutron radiography is a well-known powerful tool for non-destructive inspection of materials, especially industrial materials, as a complementary technique to X-ray radiography. The capability of neutron radiography, as compared with X-ray radiography, is determined by the features of the neutron-matter interactions. X-rays interact mainly with the electron shells of the atoms, therefore the cross sections for X-rays increase with the atomic number making it very difficult to image low atomic number elements (i. e. hydrogen, carbon, etc.). In contrast, neutrons interact with atomic nuclei, so that dependence on atomic number is not observed. This major difference enables thermal neutron radiography to significantly outperform X-ray radiography in detecting elements such as H, Li, O, N, B, Cd, Gd in structural metals such as Al, Fe, Zr, Sn, W, Pb. In comparison to thermal neutrons (Eavg = 0. 0253 eV), beryllium filtered cold neutrons (energies < 0. 005 eV) are attenuated to an even greater extent by the elements listed above and to a lesser extent by those structural metals listed above. As a consequence, imaging contrast and sensitivity are significantly enhanced for detecting minute quantities of hydrogen in thick layers of metal. On the other hand, all existing cold neutron sources are confined to < 6 cm in diameter in the U. S., which potential applications are thus limited. Based on the existing experiences and facilities of thermal neutron radiography at the UCD/ MNRC, we investigate and study such a large-field, beryllium filtered cold neutron source to expand our understanding of cold neutron nuclear characteristics and support basic research applications in other scientific fields...|$|R

Fault evaluation {{was added to the}} more common steps of fault detection and diagnostics to consider the special aspects of performance degradation faults over abrupt faults. A model for testing these techniques in a simulation environment was developed. The model is described and experimental validation results are presented in this thesis. The model has a modular design that enables easy adaptation to different equipment configurations. It can be easily tuned with a few simple measurements and can simulate faults in the cycle. ^ The fault detection technique described in this thesis evaluates the impact of measurement errors on the confidence that current measurements are different from the predictions of a normal performance model. If the statistical confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold, then a fault is indicated. Diagnostics are performed by statistically evaluating a generic set of rules indicating the direction change of each measurement. This diagnostic technique does not require a learning phase for each piece of equipment, is capable of detecting a 5 % refrigerant leak, and can distinguish between refrigerant leaks, condenser fouling, evaporator fouling, liquid line <b>restrictions,</b> and compressor <b>valve</b> leakage. ^ Four fault impact evaluation criteria were developed to determine if the fault is severe enough to justify the service cost. These criteria are: comfort, economics, safety, and environmental hazard. Evaluating these criteria evolved into a constrained optimization problem to minimize lifetime service and energy costs while maintaining the other criteria as constraints. This problem was solved exactly using dynamic programming to create a minimum cost baseline for comparison with a simplified near-optimal scheduler, regular interval maintenance, and comfort constrained only maintenance. It was found that optimal service scheduling reduced lifetime operating costs by as much as a factor of two over regular service intervals and 50 % when compared to constrained only service. The near-optimal algorithm gave operating costs that were within 1 % of the optimal results. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposed}} a methodology to predicting asphaltene precipitation in wells with advanced completions. A fundamental comprehensive two-phase flow model was proposed to predict asphaltene precipitation in horizontal production wells. The main {{objective of the}} research was to incorporate compositional and non-isothermal effects into an isothermal physical flow model and to investigate conditions that promote asphaltene precipitation. The precipitation induced by flow restriction found in equipment installed as parts of advanced well completion was the main focus. The proposed model consisted of a black-oil network model and a compositional asphaltene model allowing investigation of both physical and phase behaviour of flowing fluids in non-isothermal environment. The original network model was an isothermal model. In order {{to take into account}} heat transport in wellbores, an approach to predict wellbore temperature profile using a network-type model was proposed. This enabled the proposed network model to predict pressure, temperature, flow rate, and phase fractions of the produced fluid {{in different parts of the}} well. Local asphaltene precipitation predictions were able to be conducted at locations where asphaltene formation was likely to occur. In this research an asphaltene model was proposed. The model was developed based on a pseudo-three-phase solid-type asphaltene model. An isenthalpic flash was used to reflect the characteristics of flows through restrictions. By using the {{proposed a}}sphaltene model, asphaltene onset conditions can be predicted and asphaltene phase behaviour at the conditions of interest can be determined. [...] In this study the proposed methodology was used and successfully predicted flow behaviour in example well networks. It was found that different completion schemes have different effects on fluid conditions in the well and, in turn, asphaltene precipitation behaviour. The example simulations suggested that the drastic pressure drop induced by the <b>valve</b> <b>restriction</b> can cause asphaltene to precipitate. In the example cases the precipitation occurred inside the restriction thus downstream and upstream conditions were not sufficient for evaluation of asphaltene precipitation. In addition temperature also has effects on asphaltene precipitation prediction. The isothermal assumption for production systems, where the temperature in the well is always constant and equal to the reservoir temperature, may not be sufficient to accurately describe the asphaltene phase behaviour in the well. An increase in fluid temperature inside the restricted flow path also has effects on prediction of the asphaltene onset pressure. The extent of these temperature effects depend on the shift in the predicted onset pressure compared with the prevailing pressure drops in the entire well network...|$|R
