5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} in the native community, White was portrayed negatively in the English-language press in his lifetime and in the published histories after his death.

40|$|Between species {{differences}} in <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> {{can lead to}} biases in our global view of evolution, ecology and conservation. The increase in meta-taxonomic comparative analyses on birds underlines the need to better address how <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is distributed in this class. Methods {{have been developed to}} choose which species should be studied to obtain unbiased comparative data sets, but a precise and global knowledge of <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is required to be able to properly apply them. We address this issue by providing a data set of <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> (number of papers from 1978 to 2008 in the Zoological Record database) estimates for the 10 064 species of birds. We then test whether <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is associated with phylogeny, geography and eleven different life history and ecological traits. We show that phylogeny accounts for {{a large proportion of the}} variance, while geographic range and all the tested traits are also significant contributors to <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> variance. We identify avian taxa that are under- and overstudied and address the importance of <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> biases in evaluating vulnerability to extinction, with non-threatened species studied twice as much as threatened ones. Our <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> data set covering the entire class Aves provides a tool for researchers to incorporate this potential confounding variable in comparative analyses...|$|R
40|$|Using the political-economic {{history of}} the {{development}} of telephony during the 1870 s as a backdrop, this paper studies a two-player Tullock contest that includes both <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> (R&D) and legal effort (i. e., rent-seeking effort). The two types of efforts complement each other and positively influence the payoff of the contest. We assume that legal effort affects the prize value, increasing the winner’s prospective rents, and <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> impacts the probability of winning the contest. The results of the model break new ground in showing that <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> is a function of legal <b>effort,</b> wherein <b>research</b> <b>effort</b> increases with rent-seeking effort. The model also shows the existence of a strategic equivalence between rent seeking and patent races...|$|R

From 1793 to 1821 Accum lived in London. Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise.

5|$|However, {{these results}} {{also noted that}} the system might be able to work against longer-ranged missiles. Although these {{traveled}} at very high speeds, their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler, and the longer flight times provided more time to prepare. Both projects were allowed to continue as <b>research</b> <b>efforts,</b> and were transferred to the US Air Force when that force separated from the Army in 1947. The Air Force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled Thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their GAPA surface-to-air missile (SAM) efforts. The next year Wizard's funding was also rolled into GAPA to develop a new long-range SAM design, which would emerge a decade later as the CIM-10 Bomarc.

5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various <b>research</b> <b>efforts</b> aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
