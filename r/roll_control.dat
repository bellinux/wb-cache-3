5|$|In short, the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical rudder. Its role was not to change the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is highly}} maneuverable at both {{supersonic}} and subsonic speeds. Computerized {{flight control system}} and full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable. The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60° alpha while having some <b>roll</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
50|$|The Propulsive Wing <b>controls</b> {{pitch and}} <b>roll</b> <b>controls</b> through {{vectored}} thrust. By distributing multiple thrust deflection flaps along the span, the high-velocity jet doubles {{as both the}} main thrust producer, as well as <b>roll</b> and pitch <b>control.</b> Collective changes in the trailing edge flaps control pitch, and spanwise differential changes <b>control</b> <b>roll.</b> Due to the circulation control effect of vectored thrust, a substantial rolling moment can be produced with very little control input.|$|R
50|$|All {{versions}} had {{a single}} mainwheel with nose and tail skids, varying in skid sizes and mainwheel position. The IS-3c and IS-3d were drastically different in having a conventional wooden fuselage and further minor variations in wing construction and <b>roll</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R

5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (<b>roll)</b> <b>control.</b> The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing. Its 36 ft span wing is supported by cables attached to an inverted [...] "V" [...] kingpost. The control system is three-axis, with <b>roll</b> <b>controlled</b> by spoilers, using a side stick and pitch and yaw controlled by ruddervators. The pilot is accommodated on an open seat without a windshield. The landing gear features a steerable nose wheel and suspension on all three wheels.

25|$|The Fokker D.III (Fokker {{designation}} M.19) was a German single-seat fighter aircraft of World War I. It was {{the last}} Fokker front-line design to use wing warping for <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> as originally designed, before ailerons had been introduced to Fokker combat designs.|$|E
25|$|An {{autopilot}} used a Rate integrating gyroscope for directional control. The rate integrating gyroscope {{could be}} pre-programmed {{to turn the}} SM-73. Pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> were provided by elevons either operating in phase or asymmetrically. Yaw control was provided by a rudder. The control system positioned flight controls by sending electrical signals to hydraulic actuators located at each flight control.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor {{relative to the}} airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|E
5000|$|The {{airframe}} is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminium tubing and covered in Dacron sailcloth. The 33 ft span wing is braced by cables from a kingpost. The controls are three-axis, with <b>roll</b> <b>controlled</b> by three small spoilers mounted on each wing. The standard factory supplied engine was the Rotax 377 of [...] and it is mounted on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, with the propeller in between the four tailboom tubes. The aircraft can be assembled or disassembled for storage or ground transportation by two people in fifteen minutes.|$|R

30|$|Features and Benefits: As the {{instrument}} tip articulation is computer assisted, {{it allows the}} surgeon to control the movements through individual manipulations with yaw and <b>roll</b> <b>controls</b> on the handle’s interface. The articulating instrument allows 2 more degrees of liberty to the conventional instruments with 4 degrees of liberty. Through articulation of {{the instrument}} tip, the system allows the surgeon to position the angles to the desired tissue planes easier. Fine dissection and cauterization is possible. The opening and closing of the jaws or blades are manually controlled through a trigger on the handle allowing the surgeon to have tactile feedback.|$|R
25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).|$|E
25|$|The design's {{potential}} for supersonic performance and reduced transonic drag stirred {{interest in the}} U.S. Navy. By 1953, redesigns led to a completely new aircraft bearing {{no more than a}} familial resemblance to the Cougar. The new wing had full-span leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps with <b>roll</b> <b>control</b> achieved using spoilers rather than traditional ailerons. For storage on aircraft carriers, the F-11 Tiger's wings manually folded downwards. Anticipating supersonic performance, the tailplane was all-moving. The aircraft was designed for the Wright J65 turbojet, a license-built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire.|$|E

Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed <b>roll</b> <b>control.</b> Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights.
