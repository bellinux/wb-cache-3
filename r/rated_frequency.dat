50|$|Operation of a {{transformer}} at its designed voltage {{but at a}} higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers {{may need to be}} equipped with 'volts per hertz' over-excitation, ANSI function 24, relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than <b>rated</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background and aims:    To {{estimate}} {{sample size}} for Cohen’s kappa agreement test {{can be challenging}} especially when {{it is expected that}} the true marginal <b>rating</b> <b>frequencies</b> are not the same. This study aims to present the tables that display a minimum sample size determination for an agreement test when certain assumptions are hold. Method:    We adopted the sample size formula provided by Flack and colleagues (1988) to calculate the minimum sample sizes required using PASS software. The power is pre-specified to be at least 80 % and the alpha to be less than 0. 05. The effect sizes were derived from several pre-specified estimates such as the pattern of the true marginal <b>rating</b> <b>frequencies</b> and {{the difference between the two}} kappa coefficients in the hypothesis testing. Results:    When the true marginal <b>rating</b> <b>frequencies</b> are the same, the minimum sample size determination can range from 2 to 698 depending on the actual value of the effect size. When the true marginal <b>rating</b> <b>frequencies</b> are not the same, then the majority of the minimum sample size required for this condition is more than double than that required sample size when the true marginal <b>rating</b> <b>frequencies</b> are the same. Conclusion:  Concerning that the sample size formula could produce a very extreme small sample size, therefore, the determination of K 1 and K 2 should be based on reasonable estimates. We recommend for all sample size determinations for Cohen’s kappa agreement test, the true marginal <b>rating</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be assumed the same. Otherwise, it will be necessary to multiple the estimated minimum sample size by two to accommodate if the true marginal <b>rating</b> <b>frequencies</b> is not the same...|$|R

50|$|The K6 was {{originally}} launched in April 1997, running at speeds of 166 and 200 MHz. It {{was followed by}} a 233 MHz version later in 1997. Initially, the AMD K6 processors used a Pentium II-based performance rating (PR2) to designate their speed. The PR2 rating was dropped because the <b>rated</b> <b>frequency</b> of the processor was the same as the real frequency. The release of the 266 MHz version of this chip was not until the second quarter of 1998 when AMD was able to move to the 0.25 micrometre manufacturing process. The lower voltage and higher multiplier of the K6-266 meant that it was not 100% compatible with some Socket 7 motherboards, similar to the later K6-2 processors. The final iteration of the K6 design was released in May 1998 running at 300 MHz.|$|E

During a time block, it is normal that frequency goes above rated 50 Hz frequency and comes down below <b>rated</b> <b>frequency</b> {{as the number of}} frequency excursions above 50 Hz are more than 100 in a day. Thus the average frequency in a time block remains close to the 50 Hz without giving much benefit in the applicable UI tariff for a Discom who is consuming the surplus power available in the grid or generators with valid scheduling who is reducing the generation when frequency is above 50 Hz. Similarly, the generators and Discoms who are not adhering to grid discipline are not penalised with UI tariff in excess of normal tariff when average grid frequency in a time block is used for fixing UI/DSM charges. Each time block is further needs to be separated into two parts for application of UI charges. One for the duration the frequency is more than 50 Hz whose average frequency is considered for fixing UI/ DSM charges to consume the excess power in the grid or reduce excess power generation. Another for the duration the frequency is less than 50 Hz whose average frequency is considered for fixing UI/DSM charges to reduce over drawl and encourage additional power generation.|$|E

40|$|The {{reversible}} synchronous {{machines in}} a pumped station {{are put into}} operation frequently for effective operation of the hydro pumped-storage system. The detection of loss-of-excitation (LOE), which is a common failure for synchronous machines, must be guaranteed not only in normal operation, but also under starting and other possible operation conditions. A model of pumped-storage units under the starting condition was developed using the SimPowerSystems in Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results and real tests of a pumped-storage power plant in northeast China were presented. The LOE characteristics during starting were analysed for the first time. Since the frequency of voltage and current runs up gradually from zero to the <b>rated</b> <b>frequency</b> during starting, conventional LOE protections based on impedance under the <b>rated</b> <b>frequency</b> have to be disabled during starting.

The rats were induced hypertension by administering NaCl solution high concentration for 14 days, and then they were treated with the test materials given to each group for another 14 days without stopping the induction.
