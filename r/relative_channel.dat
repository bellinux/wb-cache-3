40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that sectoral heterogeneity itself, without additional bells or whistles, has important, first-order {{implications for the}} transmission of aggregate shocks to aggregate variables in an otherwise standard DSGE model. The effects of sectoral heterogeneity on this transmission are decomposed into two channels: a “relative price ” channel and a “relative productivity” <b>channel.</b> The <b>relative</b> price <b>channel</b> results from changes in the relative prices of aggregates, such as investment vs. consumption, {{in response to a}} shock. The <b>relative</b> productivity <b>channel</b> arises from changes in the distribution of inputs across sectors. We show that, for standard multi-sector models, this latter channel is second-order, but becomes first-order if we consider a nontraded input such as capital utilization or introduce a wedge that thwarts the steady-state equalization of marginal products of a traded input across sectors. For reasonable parameterizations, the <b>relative</b> productivity <b>channel</b> causes aggregate productivity to vary procyclically in response to even non-technological shocks, such as changes in government purchases...|$|R

30|$|Our {{methodology}} is as follows. We {{set up a}} {{road traffic}} simulation for two selected highway scenarios. First, we derive the rate of CAMs which are generated by each vehicle based on its movement. Second, we introduce a new statistical channel model which computes the probability for a successful message reception based on distance between sender and receiver, and a newly defined <b>relative</b> <b>channel</b> load. This allows the calculation of the rate of CAMs received by vehicles equipped with VANET technology. We use the statistical channel model to give approximation formulae to validate {{the results of the}} simulation. We use these formulae to conduct parameter studies of the <b>relative</b> <b>channel</b> load and received CAM rates. Finally, we use our simulation and analytic estimations to quantify the frequency of CAMs received from a certain vehicle depending on distance and characterize the local origin of all received CAMs.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{our study}} {{is only valid}} for <b>relative</b> <b>channel</b> loads up to ρ[*]=[*] 25 %. That value is reached in the A 5 scenario for a penetration rate of φ[*]=[*] 40 % and in the A 6 scenario for a penetration rate of φ[*]=[*] 80 %. For the A 5 scenario, penetration rates φ of 10 % and 20 % lead to <b>relative</b> <b>channel</b> loads of 6.25 % and 12.5 %, respectively. The congestion control mechanism tries to mitigate channel congestion by adjusting several regulators like transmit power control, transmit rate control, transmit data rate control, and transmit access control. This effectively means that the transmission rate of a sender can be reduced which leads to message queuing, delay, and loss. Thus, CAM information may be outdated when it arrives at the receiver. To avoid such situations, the time between consecutive CAMs needs to be increased to generate them less frequently, which in turn decreases the surrounding awareness of the receiving vehicles. As we have not integrated congestion control in our simulative and analytical approximation, the <b>relative</b> <b>channel</b> loads larger than 25 % are overestimated. From a relative load of 40 % onwards, the wireless channel is even considered congested. We conclude that CAMs can fill the radio channel {{in the presence of}} moderate and high penetration rates in the future {{to such an extent that}} the available transmission capacity might not suffice to deliver all CAMs in time.|$|E
