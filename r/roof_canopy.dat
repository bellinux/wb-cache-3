40|$|The use of {{vegetation}} to block shortwave radiation can reduce cooling loads in hot climates. From July 22 nd, 1989 to October 7, 1989, this study, using shade cloth to simulate vegetative canopies, compared the electricity used for air conditioning between quarter-scale models. The treatments were: (1) canopies {{of the same}} density on east, west, and/or south walls, (2) wall <b>canopies</b> versus <b>roof</b> <b>canopies</b> of the same density, (3) wall canopies of different densities, and (4) <b>roof</b> <b>canopies</b> of different densities. Although the savings in electricity in any treatment was usually less than 11 %, the results showed: dense canopies gave better savings than medium canopies, which, in turn, gave better savings than the least dense canopies; wall canopies gave better results than a roof canopy; an east wall canopy gave better results than a west wall canopy; and shading all walls except the north gave better results than shading only {{the east and west}} wall...|$|R
