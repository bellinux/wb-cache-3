50|$|Another {{concern with}} land farming {{is that while}} lower molecularweight {{petroleum}} compounds biodegrade efficiently, higher molecular weight compounds biodegrade more slowly. This means that repeated applications can lead to accumulation of high molecular weight compounds. At high concentrations, these recalcitrant constituents can increase soil-water <b>repellency,</b> affect plant growth, reduce {{the ability of the}} soil to support a diverse community of organisms, and render the land farm no longer usable without treatment or amendment. Recent studies have supported the idea that field-scale additions of earthworms with selected organic amendments may hasten the long-term recovery of conventionally treated petroleum contaminated soil. The burrowing and feeding activities of earthworms create space and allow food resources to become available to other soil organisms that would be unable to survive otherwise. The use of earthworms in Europe has improved the biological quality of soils of some large-scale land-reclamation projects.|$|E
50|$|The high {{surface tension}} of water causes {{droplets}} {{to assume a}} nearly spherical shape, since a sphere has minimal surface area, and this shape therefore demands least solid-liquid surface energy. On contact with a surface, adhesion forces result in wetting of the surface. Either complete or incomplete wetting may occur depending {{on the structure of}} the surface and the fluid tension of the droplet.The cause of self-cleaning properties is the hydrophobic water-repellent double structure of the surface. This enables the contact area and the adhesion force between surface and droplet to be significantly reduced resulting in a self-cleaning process.This hierarchical double structure is formed out of a characteristic epidermis (its outermost layer called the cuticle) and the covering waxes. The epidermis of the lotus plant possesses papillae with 10 Âµm to 20 Âµm in height and 10 Âµm to 15 Âµm in width on which the so-called epicuticular waxes are imposed. These superimposed waxes are hydrophobic and form the second layer of the double structure. This system regenerates. This bio-chemical property is responsible for the functioning of the water <b>repellency</b> of the surface.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{progress}} in relating {{the incidence of}} water <b>repellency</b> to other soil attributes, relating the severity of water <b>repellency</b> to different soil management and landuses and determining the value of soil survey in predicting the risk of water <b>repellency.</b> Data sets of soils from south-western Australia are used for this analysis. The relationship between water <b>repellency</b> and other soil attributes such as clay and organic matter contents {{has been found to}} be multivariate in nature, with a general form: Water <b>repellency</b> â a Organic Matterb/Clay(c) where a, b and c are constants. Multiple regressions, which use a variety of attributes related to soil organic matter and soil surface area (e. g. clay, silt, amorphous iron contents), can explain up to 63 % of the variation in water <b>repellency.</b> Water <b>repellency</b> increases in severity with increasing organic carbon content or decreasing soil surface area and vice versa. This relationship explains the poor or non-existent bivariate relationships between various soil attributes and water <b>repellency</b> reported in several studies and allows the re-interpretation of studies into the effects of liming, zero-till and different rotation lengths on water <b>repellency</b> as each affect soil organic carbon (OC) content. It is also consistent with observations that water <b>repellency</b> is more prevalent on sandy soils and reported reductions in water <b>repellency</b> following applications of clay and fine inorganic materials. It similarly explains the occurrence of water <b>repellency</b> on soils with > 5 % clay; accumulation of sufficient amounts of OC can induce water <b>repellency</b> in any soil. Soil management and landuse affect water <b>repellency.</b> Water <b>repellency</b> is less severe in soils under crops compared to pastures and this has been considered as being caused by differences in organic matter composition. This is re-interpreted as being due to differences in organic matter amount as cultivation mineralises and dilutes soil organic matter in the topsoil. Water <b>repellency</b> is also a feature of soils under natural vegetation (Eucalyptus, Banksia spp.) and may be more severe than that for agricultural soils. Increments of organic matter from natural vegetation can induce water <b>repellency</b> to a greater extent than equivalent amounts of organic matter from agricultural species. Thus, water <b>repellency</b> can be considered as a natural feature of soils, rather than a form of land degradation due to farming. Comparisons between the water <b>repellency</b> associated with different soil management or landuses are problematic due to differences in not only OC content and composition but also other soil properties such as surface area, due to the spatial separation of the areas compared. Given the underlying relationship between clay content and water <b>repellency,</b> field texture data from soil surveys can be used to predict the risk of water <b>repellency</b> developing, this providing a basis for optimum management practice. The degree to which this water <b>repellency</b> develops will be dependent on management practices and their effects on soil organic matter content. Quite costly, but profitable, ameliorative management (e. g. clay application) can thus be applied to sites where required, rather than to large areas on a non-specific basis...|$|E
40|$|Post-fire land {{degradation}} is often attributed to fire-induced soil water <b>repellency,</b> {{despite the fact}} that soil water <b>repellency</b> is a natural phenomenon in many soils and is therefore not necessarily caused by fire. To improve our understanding of the role of soil water <b>repellency</b> in causing fire-induced {{land degradation}}, a long-term monitoring study was performed in which the temporal variation of topsoil water <b>repellency</b> (0 â 2. 5 -cm depth) was captured in a Portuguese shrubland before and after fire between November 2007 and March 2010. In addition, similarities and dissimilarities between changes following burning and clipping were assessed in a plot experiment. Soil water <b>repellency</b> appeared to be the rule rather than the exception, both before and after fire, and was strongly related to soil moisture and organic matter content. Surprisingly, despite the low soil temperatures during the fire (60 Â°C) and the lack of direct soil moisture changes, fire significantly increased the persistence of soil water <b>repellency</b> (the water drop penetration time). Vegetation removal by burning and clipping {{played a key role in}} determining post-fire water <b>repellency</b> in litter and at the soil surface and considerably reduced the time needed to both develop and eliminate water <b>repellency</b> of the litter and surface soil. Where pre-fire (or ânaturalâ) soil water <b>repellency</b> is abundant, an increase in erosion after fire cannot be solely caused by soil water <b>repellency.</b> Nevertheless, fire-induced removal of the protective canopy cover may increase the hydrologic significance of soil water <b>repellency</b> in burned landscape...|$|E
40|$|Many soils may be water {{repellent}} to some degree, challenging the common perception that soil water <b>repellency</b> {{is only an}} interesting aberration.

In the present study the persistence of water <b>repellency</b> was examined on samples from topsoils in Thrace, north-eastern Greece, using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) test. The soil samples were collected from agricultural fields throughout the prefectures of Xanthi and Rodopi. Six sites were selected for intensive sampling of water <b>repellency</b> and soil moisture content in transects. Water <b>repellency</b> was measured on field-moist soil samples and after drying the samples at increasing temperatures, to study the influence of drying temperature on the persistence of soil water <b>repellency.</b> Measurements of soil samples taken in agricultural fields under different crops, e. g. winter wheat, tobacco, clover, olive groves, kiwi fruit, and vineyards, in the area of Thrace, revealed that 45 % of the locations exhibited actual water <b>repellency</b> during dry periods. Drying of samples from the Sostis site resulted in wettable soil, whereas drying of samples from the Mitriko site increased <b>repellency.</b> Therefore, water <b>repellency</b> should preferably be measured on samples taken in the field under dry conditions in order to reveal and determine the highest persistence of water <b>repellency</b> that might occur in the field...|$|E

Extraction efficiency {{and the role of}} the extracts in causing soil water <b>repellency</b> was examined by determining extract mass, sample organic carbon content and water <b>repellency</b> (after drying at 20 Â°C and 105 Â°C) pre- and post-extraction, and amounts of aliphatic CâH removed using DRIFT, and by assessing the ability of extracts to cause <b>repellency</b> in acid-washed sand (AWS). Key findings are: (i) none of organic carbon content, amount of aliphatic CâH, or amount of material extracted give any significant correlation with <b>repellency</b> for this diverse range of soils; (ii) sample drying at 105 Â°C is not necessarily useful before extraction, but may provide additional information on extraction effectiveness when used after extraction; (iii) the extraction removed <b>repellency</b> completely from 13 of the 15 repellent samples; (iv) extracts from all repellent and wettable control soils were capable of inducing <b>repellency</b> in AWS.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to improve our {{knowledge}} of the temporal and spatial variations of soil water <b>repellency</b> following wildfire, in particular for the eucalypt stands that now dominate the landscape of north-central Portugal. Topsoil water <b>repellency</b> was monitored on 21 occasions over a 10 -month period, starting in September 2005, six weeks after a moderately severe wildfire. This was done, on mostly alternating dates, in two neighbouring commercial eucalypt plantations, one with an undisturbed and one with a ploughed soil profile, in the foothills of the Gralheira Massif in north-central Portugal. Water <b>repellency</b> severity was measured in situ at soil depths of 2 - 3 and 7 - 8 cm using the 'Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet' (MED) test, and accompanied by soil moisture measurements using a ThetaProbe(TM) or, at a few occasions, sample analysis in the laboratory for gravimetric content. The results show a broadly seasonal pattern of overall very high water <b>repellency</b> in dry periods and reduced or no <b>repellency</b> following prolonged rainfall. This was more pronounced at the undisturbed compared to the ploughed site, as the latter exhibited strong to extreme water <b>repellency</b> at almost all sampling dates. Significant changes in <b>repellency</b> severity, including major increases, occurred within periods as short as 6 - 7 days, suggesting that the sampling intervals used here may have not captured the full dynamics of topsoil <b>repellency.</b> <b>Repellency</b> severity was consistently lower at greater soil depth, in particular when considering the whole Study period. Soil moisture Was found to relate to the temporal variations in <b>repellency.</b> As found in previous Studies, however, soil moisture alone was not sufficient to predict the temporal variations in water <b>repellency.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier B.
