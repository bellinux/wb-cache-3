The Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners halted work in April 1905 for redesign. By that date, the tunnels had been dug out and steelwork had been installed. Work resumed in October 1905 with two additional tracks added, making four under Fulton Street and five under Flatbush Avenue. The additional trackways were added outside the trackways already set in place.|$|R

50|$|Brooklyn {{was once}} served by an {{extensive}} network of streetcars, {{many of which}} were replaced by the public bus network that covers the entire borough. There is also daily express bus service into Manhattan. New York's famous yellow cabs also provide transportation in Brooklyn, although they are less numerous in the borough. There are three commuter rail stations in Brooklyn: East New York, Nostrand Avenue, and Atlantic Terminal, the terminus of the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island <b>Rail</b> <b>Road.</b> The <b>terminal</b> is located near the Atlantic Avenue - Barclays Center subway station, with ten connecting subway services.|$|R

50|$|At Bushwick Place and Johnson Avenue, {{there was}} the Long Island <b>Rail</b> <b>Road</b> Bushwick Freight <b>Terminal.</b> It was {{abandoned}} by the LIRR and was leased out for other uses, including a meat packing facility, and most recently, to a manufacturer of styrofoam coolers as a warehouse for styrofoam pellets. The roof had collapsed following a fire set by the resident homeless in May 2003.

50|$|On October 26, 2015, a 1920 ft2 m2 {{seating area}} in Grand Central Terminal’s lower level dining {{concourse}} was closed {{in order to}} build structural framework that will allow for the future construction of stairways and escalators that will connect Grand Central’s lower level to the Long Island <b>Rail</b> <b>Road</b> concourse and <b>terminal</b> underneath Grand Central Terminal. This was deemed as a major milestone in the construction of East Side Access by Dr. Michael Horodniceanu, President of MTA Capital Construction. On November 10, 2015, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to celebrate the emergence of the project into Grand Central Terminal.|$|R
25|$|On April 10, 1888, the Union Elevated {{opened the}} first piece of the Myrtle Avenue Elevated, from Adams Street at City Hall east over Myrtle Avenue to Grand Avenue, where it junctioned with the Brooklyn Elevated. The company {{operated}} through {{to the end of the}} Brooklyn Elevated at Van Siclen Avenue. Another branch operated by the Union Elevated, the Broadway Elevated from Gates Avenue northwest to Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, opened on June 25, 1888. This was extended to Broadway Ferry on July 14, 1888. The Myrtle Avenue Elevated was extended north over Adams Street to Sands Street at the Brooklyn Bridge on September 1, 1888, and the Union Elevated began running between Sands Street and Van Siclen Avenue. The Union Elevated opened the Hudson Avenue Elevated, a branch of the Brooklyn Elevated from the intersection of Hudson and Park Avenues south to the Long Island <b>Rail</b> <b>Road's</b> Flatbush Avenue <b>terminal,</b> on November 5, 1888, and began operating between Fulton Ferry and Flatbush Avenue.|$|R
40|$|Freight {{distribution}} in cities is mostly done by road and {{is responsible for}} 30 to 40 % of the energy consumed by transport and these percentages grow when certain pollutant, such as PM, are considered. City logistics is mostly organised on a private basis and each logistics operator has its own clients, vehicles and storage areas. No cooperation exists between operators to rationalise the distribution trips. Urban penetration of freight by rail is scarce and inner-city <b>rail</b> <b>road</b> <b>terminals,</b> wherever there were any, are being dismissed because the increasing cost of inner city land is making more convenient to sell land inside the cities and to make new terminals outside of them. Consequently urban freight distribution by heavy duty vehicles {{is becoming more and}} more common. In this framework a joint research team of ENEA (the Italian national energy and environmental research agency) and CTL (the recently started excellence centre on freight transport and logistics) organised several acquisition campaigns to monitor the present situation of city logistics in Rome under many aspects including energy consumption and environmental impact with the aim of defining strategies and tools to make it more sustainable. The acquisition campaigns were made collecting in real time a number of parameters from the vehicles distributing goods to supermarkets in Rome either fresh food from the new “fruit and vegetable gross market” 2 km east (Guidonia) of the outer road ring of Rome (GRA) and from a logistic platform 15 km south (Pomezia-Santa Palomba) of GRA or other goods from one of the few remaining inner city rail terminals (San Lorenzo). Such campaigns showed how size and power of the presently used vehicles are dimensioned on the “outer city” leg of the trip because inside the city much smaller and less powerful vehicles can be employed. It would be therefore possible, if city logistics were re-organised, to employ hybrid vehicles. In details a 9 kW generator series hybrid can easily substitute a 120 kW conventional vehicle. The approach to make city logistics more sustainable must definitely be an integrated technological and regulatory approach. Under the vehicle technology point of view hybrids have either to be dimensioned for outer-city trips, like the dual mode Microvett Daily or the regulatory framework should promote the introduction of logistic platforms inside the urban ring in which case electric vehicles either pure or hybridised with small size generator or FC, (5 - 10 kW), like the MicroVett Neo FCHV, could have a real chance as proven by another Microvet experience in the city of Vicenza...|$|R
25|$|A contract, later {{known as}} Contract 1, was {{executed}} on February 21, 1900, between {{the commission and}} the Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont, {{for the construction of}} the subway and a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. Ground was broken at City Hall on March 24. A plan for an extension from City Hall to the Long Island <b>Rail</b> <b>Road's</b> Flatbush Avenue <b>terminal</b> station (now known as Atlantic Terminal) in Brooklyn was adopted on January 24, 1901, and Contract 2, giving a lease of only 35 years, was executed between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company on September 11, with construction beginning at State Street in Manhattan on November 8, 1902. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 as the operating company for both contracts; the IRT leased the Manhattan Railway, operator of the four elevated railway lines in Manhattan and the Bronx, on April 1, 1903. Operation of the subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of all stations from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the course}} of the 1990s the village saw {{redevelopment}} as a government center as well as business center. There are more government employees from all levels of government in the village than there are in the county seat in Mineola. According to James York, the municipal historian, writing in 1998, the population during the day might rise to nearly 200,000, from a normal census of 50,000. Retailers' interest in the village was rekindled, due to the aggressive revitalization efforts of former Mayor James Garner, who served from 1989 to 2005, and former Community Development Agency Commissioner, Glen Spiritis, who served under Garner's administration. Specifically, two large tracts of retail property have recently undergone redevelopment. [...] The former [...] Times Squares Stores (or TSS) property on Peninsula Boulevard and Franklin Street has been redeveloped as Hempstead Village Commons, a [...] retail center including Pep Boys and Staples. The former Abraham & Straus department store on [...] has recently undergone demolition and been replaced by a large retail development consisting of Home Depot, Old Navy, Stop & Shop and many other smaller establishments. A considerable infusion of state and federal funding as well as private investment have enabled the replacement of blighted storefronts, complete commercial building rehabilitations and the development of affordable housing for the local population. The replacement of the 1913 Long Island <b>Rail</b> <b>Road</b> Hempstead <b>Terminal</b> with a modern facility was completed in 2002 and a four-story, 112 unit building for senior housing, with retail on the ground level was completed at Main and West Columbia Streets in January 1998. Thirty two units of affordable townhouses known as Patterson Mews at Henry Street and Baldwin Road was completed and fully occupied in 1997.|$|R
