6000|$|Golf is a {{thoroughly}} national game; {{it is as}} Scotch as haggis, cockie- leekie, high cheekbones, or <b>rowanberry</b> jam. A spurious imitation, or an arrested development of the sport, exists {{in the south of}} France, where a ball is knocked along the roads to a fixed goal. But this is naturally very poor fun compared to the genuine game as played on the short turf beside the grey northern sea on the coast of Fife. Golf has been introduced of late years into England, and is played at Westward Ho, at Wimbledon, at Blackheath (the oldest club), at Liverpool, over Cowley Marsh, near Oxford, and in many other places. It is, therefore, no longer necessary to say that golf is not a highly developed and scientific sort of hockey, or bandy-ball. Still, there be some to whom the processes of the sport are a mystery, and who would be at a loss to discriminate a niblick from a bunker-iron. The thoroughly equipped golf- player needs an immense variety of weapons, or implements, which are carried for him by his caddie--a youth or old man, who is, as it were, his esquire, who sympathizes with him in defeat, rejoices in his success, and aids him with such advice as his superior knowledge of the ground suggests. The class of human beings known as caddies are the offspring of golf, and have peculiar traits which distinguish them from the professional cricketer, the waterman, the keeper, the gillie, and all other professionals. It is not very easy to account for their little peculiarities. One thing is certain--that when golf was introduced by Scotchmen into France, and found a home at Pau, {{in the shadow of the}} Pyrenees, the French caddie sprang, so to speak, from the ground, the perfect likeness of his Scottish brother. He was just as sly, just as importunate in his demands to be employed, just as fond of [...] "putting at short holes," [...] more profane, and every bit as contemptuous of all non-golf- playing humanity as the boyish Scotch caddie, in whom contempt has reversed the usual process, and bred familiarity with all beginners.|$|E

40|$|Autumn Northern Bullfinch {{abundance}} at bird observatories {{around the}} Baltic Sea con-firmed periodic irruptive behaviour outside of its normal wintering range, but age-ratio data suggested dispersal was not linked to reproductive success. Rowan berries are im-portant food of Fennoscandian Northern Bullfinches and show synchronised masting in annual fruit production over large spatial scales. Norwegian and Finnish annual berry abundance indices from 1972 – 2004 {{were used to}} test the hypothesis that poor <b>rowanberry</b> production in normal wintering areas was responsible for efflux of birds to other areas. Annual Finnish wintering bird surveys and catches at local bird observatories correlated with <b>rowanberry</b> abundance indices, supporting the prediction that highest Bullfinch abundance would occur in normal wintering areas in years with heavy <b>rowanberry</b> crops. Northern Bullfinch autumn abundance at Danish and Swedish bird observatories (outside the normal winter range) showed inverse correlations with Norwegian <b>rowanberry</b> crops, supporting the prediction of highest irruptions in years of lowest <b>rowanberry</b> abundance from the normal wintering range. These data suggest that at large spatial scales, berry masting can have profound effects on the annual distribution and migratory behaviour of birds consuming the crop. 1...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the anthocyanins, ascorbic acid content and the antiradical activity in less common fruit species native in the territory of Slovakia (black mulberries, cornelian cherries, blackberries, blackthorn, <b>rowanberries)</b> and honeyberries (Lonicera kamtschatica) originated from Kamtschatka. Anthocyanins were evaluated after extraction from solid materials with acidified ethanol or after direct solution of liquid samples with HCl in ethanol solution by spectrophotometer measurement. To evaluate the antiradical activity, a spectrophotometer method based on the reaction of antioxidants with a stable radical 2, 2 - diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyle (DPPH•) in methanol solution was used. The reduction properties of ascorbic acid are used in the measurement. The highest value of anthocyanin pigments was found out in honeyberries (Lonicera kamtschatica) of all analyzed clones. Black mulberries of the genotype M 104 and cornelian cherries of the genotypes 55 a 44 are the most significant sources of ascorbic acid among analysed less common fruit species. It is an interesting fact that blackthorns (Prunus spinosa) contenting the lowest value of ascorbic acid (10. 31 ± 1. 016 mg. 100 g- 1) and medium value of anthocyanins (1. 71 ± 0. 08 g. kg- 1) shows the highest level of antiradical activity (461. 25 ± 3. 69 % ≈ EC 50 = 0. 1084 ± 0. 0101). A similar phenomenon was observed in honeysuckles, too. According to these results we can suppose that another flavonoids (flavonols, flavons and flavanols) can also significantly contributed to antiradical activity of the blackthorns and edible honeysuckles. In summary, analysed less known fruit species are important sources of nutritive compounds, particularly anthocyanins, ascorbic acid and show significant free radical scavenging ability...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} still less expolited species of small fruit, {{evaluation}} of its {{physical and chemical}} parameters and proposal of a new soft drink {{from one of the}} studied species of furit. Firstly, for the characterisation of basic nutrition parameters (dry matter, content of organic acids and saccharides) and biologicaly active substances (vitamin C, anthocyanins and phenolic compounds) suitable titration, spectrophotometric, chromatographic and electrophoretic methods were chosen, optimized and validated. The sample preparation procedure was optimized as well. For three years (2010 – 2012) the content of listed parameters was monitored in some cultivars of five species of small fruit: in seven cultivars of sea buckthorn, in ten cultivars of cornelian cherry, in twelve cultivars of <b>rowanberry,</b> in two cultivars of chokeberry and in seventeen cultivars of elderberry. By means of Duncan’s test, analysis of principal components (PCA) and cluster analysis (CLU) the main differences between studied cultivars were observed mainly in sea buckthorn and <b>rowanberry,</b> where single cultivars were easily distinguishable from others on the basis of genetic origin. On the basis of comparison of determined parameters in studied species of fruit and with collaboration with fruit processing company the suitable species of fruit for commercial utilization was chosen – elderberry, as a important source of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds. A new soft drink as a proposal of utilization of this fruit was created – fruit juice or nectar with portion of elderberry juice. Mixed juices and nectars with various composition were prepared from elderberry and grape juice and the sensory analysis of these drinks was performed. The best evaluated were 100 % fruit juices prepared with 30 – 50 % portion of elderberry juice. The composition was jurally protected. On the basis of this protection the product consisted from 100 % fruit juice with 10 % of elderberry component mixed with apple and grape juice was introduced to the market by the fruit processing company...|$|E
40|$|Sweet {{rowanberries}} originated by the crossbreeding of wild rowanberries {{with other}} fruit species such as apples, medlars or black chokeberries. They are highly resistant to cold climate. In contrast with wild rowanberries, they have sweet mild taste and show less parasorbic acid toxicity, which can be eliminated, when the consumption is excessive, by heating. The objective of the work was to determine selected antioxidant properties in 6 cultivars. The analyses showed that the contents of total phenolics, total flavonoids and ascorbic acid were high. Similarly, antioxidant capacity (6. 58 - 9. 62 g of ascorbic acid equivalents kg(- 1)) was also high. The work brings novel data, in particular, when comparing the cultivars; moreover, results regarding reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging activity in sweet rowanberries are being published for the first time. The sweet <b>rowanberry</b> extracts (10 %) showed inhibitory ability on hydroxyl radical (16. 12 - 24. 73 %), superoxide anion (26. 74 - 34. 02 %), nitric oxide (24. 75 - 31. 39 %), and lipid peroxidation (7. 93 - 13. 12 %). The values obtained are even many times higher than those found in common commercial fruit species like apples. Therefore, sweet rowanberries {{appear to be a}} promising fruit species for human nutrition, especially due to their high content of bioactive substances and ease of cultivation in worse climatic and soil conditions...|$|E
