40|$|Economic {{growth in}} Australia {{and the rest}} of the world is linked to the scale of {{construction}} and mining, and the amount of earth moved each year in these operations is difficult to fathom. When distributed evenly across the world’s population, each individual moves several tonnes of earth each year. This paper highlights current and future research initiatives within the ARC Centre of Excellence for Geotechnical Science and Engineering (CGSE) aimed at developing rigorous, mechanics-based models for fundamental ploughing and cutting processes in soils. State-of-the-art physical modelling is integrated with the development of new techniques for analytical and numerical modelling to elucidate and predict the full progression of forces and deformations in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional processes. A new analytical model for cutting in dry sand is presented, and preliminary results from numerical and physical modelling are described. The analyses <b>reveal</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> available models fail to consider and illustrate how the development of rigorous models may facilitate improvements in production and efficiency in earthmoving operations. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} of materials using electrical pulses utilises effects other than resistive heating to stimulate {{changes in their}} microstructure and hence the properties. The direct effect of electropulsing has not, however, been fully understood. There remain issues that delay the industrialisation of the method and there are gaps in the scientific understanding of mechanisms. The thermodynamic description of electropulsing {{is based on a}} few oversimplified geometric models. The corresponding kinetic description remains qualitative and less than helpful in stimulating applications. The role of electropulsing in multiphase materials where the magnetic permeabilities of the phases are different has not been explored. Experiments on electropulse induced powder sintering <b>reveal</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> are not related to resistive heating, but their origin has yet to be identified.

40|$|Grooming {{behavior}} {{has been reported}} to be a response to novelty and other stressors. However, studies that sought to identify anxiety-related measures in the elevated plus-maze have not found grooming as a reliable index. Grooming has been implied with dearousal after a stressful experience. In the present work, a detailed investigation of this behavior was performed in a test with a longer duration (i. e., 10 min) than the usual duration in the elevated plus-maze. The level of anxiety was manipulated prior to the test by confining male rats to environments known to differ in the degree of aversive stimulation, including a familiar cage, a closed arm of the elevated plus-maze, and an open arm (i. e., the most aversive arm) of the elevated plus-maze. Grooming behavior was classified into three constituent elements: rostral grooming, head grooming, and body grooming. The groups were compared with regard to conventional measures of the elevated plus-maze and grooming behavior. Prior confinement to an open arm led to a delayed effect of decreased open-arm exploration undetectable {{during the first half of}} the test compared with rats previously confined to a closed arm. Prior confinement to an open arm also increased the total duration of grooming during the second half of the test. These increases were found to be partially attributable to increases in the rostral element of grooming. The percentage of interrupted bouts was also found to discriminate the group previously confined to an open arm. These results indicate that prolongation of the session can <b>reveal</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> are otherwise undetectable and that under such conditions some grooming measures can be useful in the evaluation of anxiety-like behavior...|$|E

When only a {{fraction}} of the bioactive natural products diversity has been explored, huge opportunities still remain for discovering novel leads for the development of new drugs. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly vascular tumour arising from epithelial elements. Mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are responsible for VHL disease and arise in the majority of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) as well as in other types of cancer. Renal carcinoma cell lines with naturally occurring VHL mutations (RCC 4 VA) and their genetically matched wild-type VHL (RCC 4 VHL) counterparts were seeded onto 96 -well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Fungal extracts were tested on both cell lines. Clinically useful antitumor agents were used as positive controls and as reference points to establish the efficacy and selectivity of the new compounds. Renal cell carcinoma cell lines expressing VHL or not were treated with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE). The day after cell inoculation, extracts were added and during the following days of incubation, fluorescence intensity was measured as a surrogate marker for cell viability. The most promising extracts selectively inhibited growth of pVHL-defi- cient cells but not of wild-type VHL cells. We used High Content Bio-imaging, a complete cellular imaging workflow that integrates instruments and software to acquire and analyze images, to evaluate their effect. Cell imaging can <b>reveal</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> would be overlooked by other cell assay approaches. This target-based whole cell screen is a new strategy, which ensures cell permeability and target selectivity especially in natural product screening where natural product purification is a labour of extensive work.

40|$|Background: It is {{generally}} accepted that periodontal disease progresses {{by a series}} of bursts that are interspersed by periods of stability or even gain of attachment. In order to analyze longitudinal data on a patient 2 ̆ 7 s disease experience, it is necessary to use models which accommodate serial dependence. Ante-dependence between the results of a series of periodontal examinations over time can be modeled using a Markov chain. This model describes temporal changes in patients 2 ̆ 7 levels of disease in terms of transition probabilities, which allow for both regression and progression of the disease. The aim {{of the present study was}} to demonstrate the use of a Markov chain model to analyze data from a longitudinal study investigating the progression of periodontal disease in an adult population. Methods: The study population consisted of 504 volunteers; however, only 456 were included in the analysis because the remaining 48 subjects did not give consecutive data. Subjects were examined at baseline, 6 months, and 1, 2, and 3 years. Probing depths (PD) were recorded using an automated probe. Disease was defined as four or more sites with PD greater than or equal to 4 mm. Markov chain modeling was used to determine the effect of age, gender, and smoking on the natural progression and regression (healing) of periodontal disease. Results: Smoking and increasing age had no effect on the progression of disease in this population, but did have a significant effect (P values less than or equal to 0. 05) in reducing the regression of disease; i. e., their effect on disease appears to be inhibition of the natural healing process. Gender had no significant effects. Conclusions: These results demonstrate how ante-dependence modeling of longitudinal data can <b>reveal</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> may not be immediately apparent from the data, with smoking and increasing age being seen to inhibit the healing process rather than promote disease progression...|$|E

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper an exact {{solution}} of a finite capacity multiplexer model in ATM environments. The multiplexer having a finite capacity S and a speedup factor of N is offered by a superimposed traffic of a fixed number M of isochronous sources. The multiplexer operates in discrete-time, i. e. the input lines are slotted by T and the output line by T=N. A tight upper bound {{for the duration of}} the transient phase is obtained. This leads to the derivation of a recursive solution to obtain the state probabilities and performance measures of interest like blocking probability for arbitrary choice of M and N, where known results in the literature are contained as special cases. These results form a basic requirement for the investigations of traffic processes, where the number of sources is modulated by an external random process (e. g., the Generally Modulated Deterministic Process GMDP). The algorithm is of polynomial complexity.
