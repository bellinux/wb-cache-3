While she was an NCMP, Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill 2009 which would permit an organ donor to receive a <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> payment as a reimbursement for medical checks, insurance and other medical expenses, and loss of income. Lim spoke of her worry that the bill might lead to a backdoor organ trading and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E

25|$|Whether the {{hierarchical}} Bayes method confers a substantial advantage in practice remains controversial, however.

25|$|This {{approach}} operates {{under the}} assumption that local interactions play a large role in stabilizing the overall protein conformation. In any short sequence, the molecular forces constrain the structure, leading to {{only a small number of}} possible conformations, which can be modeled by fragments. Indeed, according to Levinthal's paradox, a protein could not possibly sample all possible conformations within a biologically <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time. Locally stabilized structures would reduce the search space and allow proteins to fold on the order of milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|The dye {{molecules}} {{are quite}} small (nanometer sized), {{so in order}} to capture a <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the incoming light the layer of dye molecules needs to be made fairly thick, much thicker than the molecules themselves. To address this problem, a nanomaterial is used as a scaffold to hold large numbers of the dye molecules in a 3-D matrix, increasing the number of molecules for any given surface area of cell. In existing designs, this scaffolding is provided by the semiconductor material, which serves double-duty.|$|E

Students enter with a <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> prior real-world work experience and take classes during weekdays like other university students.

There are also many Egyptian immigrants in Benghazi. A small Greek community also exists in Benghazi. The Greek island of Crete is a short distance from Benghazi and many families in Benghazi today bear Cretan surnames. There are even a few Italian-related families, left from the colonial times before World War II.|$|E
50|$|Perfect {{arbitration}} {{would result}} in throughput limited only by the maximum throughput of each crossbar input or output. For example, if all traffic coming into line cards A and B is destined for line card C, then the maximum traffic that cards A and B can process together is limited by C. Perfect arbitration {{has been shown to}} require massive <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> computation, that scales up much faster than the number of ports on the crossbar. Practical systems use imperfect arbitration heuristics (such as iSLIP) that can be computed in <b>reasonable</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|R

25|$|Foods {{contribute}} {{virtually all}} of the copper consumed by humans. The best dietary sources include seafood (especially shellfish), organ meats (e.g., liver), whole grains, legumes (e.g., beans and lentils) and chocolate. Nuts, including peanuts and pecans, are especially rich in copper, as are grains such as wheat and rye, and several fruits including lemons and raisins. Other food sources that contain copper include cereals, potatoes, peas, red meat, mushrooms, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as kale), and fruits (coconuts, papaya and apples).

The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically, this {{is readily}} explained. Barbiturate overdoses {{typically}} cause death by {{depression of the}} respiratory center, but the effect is variable. Some patients may have complete cessation of respiratory drive, whereas others may only have depression of respiratory function. In addition, cardiac activity can last {{for a long time}} after cessation of respiration. Since death is pronounced after asystole and given that the expectation is for a rapid death in lethal injection, multiple drugs are required, specifically potassium chloride to stop the heart. In fact, in the case of Clarence Ray Allen, a second dose of potassium chloride was required to attain asystole. The position of most death-penalty supporters is that death should be attained in a <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{the method}} of "classification with empirically {{observed}} statistics" [...] also known as empirical classification, empirical detection, universal classification, and type-based detection [...] is configured and applied to the despreading/detection receiver operation of a spread-spectrum (SS), {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) communications system. In static and Rayleigh-fading environments, the empirical detector is capable of adapting to unknown noise environments in a superior manner than the linear matched-filter despreader/detector, and done with <b>reasonable</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> training. Compared to the optimum detector, when known, the empirical detector always approaches optimal performance, again, with <b>reasonable</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> training. In an interference-limited channel, we show that the single-user likelihood-ratio detector, which is the optimum single-user detector, can greatly outperform the matched filter in certain imperfect power-control situations. The near optimality of the empirical detector implies that it, too, will outperform the matched filter in these situations. Although the empirical detector has the added cost of requiring chip-based phase synchronization, its consistent and superior performance in all environments strongly suggests its application in lieu of the linear detector for SS/CDMA systems employing long, pseudo-random spreading. In order to apply empirical classification to digital communications, we derive the empirical forced-decision detector and show that it is asymptotically optimal over a large class of empirical classifiers...|$|R
