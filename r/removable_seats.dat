25|$|In 1990, {{the hall}} briefly closed {{as part of}} a £500,000 {{modernisation}} programme to rewire the building and improve the technical facilities, as well as redecorating the backstage area. In 1999, <b>removable</b> <b>seats</b> were installed {{in the front of the}} stalls, in response to rock concerts where fans at the front wanted to move around freely, as well as increasing capacity. The official capacity of the hall is now 2,075.|$|E
500|$|The 747-200B was {{the basic}} {{passenger}} version, with increased fuel capacity {{and more powerful}} engines; it entered service in February 1971. [...] In its {{first three years of}} production, the -200 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7 engines (initially the only engine available). Range with a full passenger load started at over [...] and increased to [...] with later engines. Most -200Bs had an internally stretched upper deck, allowing for up to 16 passenger seats. The freighter model, the 747-200F, could be fitted with or without a side cargo door, and had a capacity of 105tons (95.3 tonnes) and an MTOW of up to 833,000lb (378,000kg). It entered service in 1972 with Lufthansa. The convertible version, the 747-200C, could be converted between a passenger and a freighter or used in mixed configurations, and featured <b>removable</b> <b>seats</b> and a nose cargo door. The -200C could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck.|$|E
2500|$|The {{horizontal}} study found, for example, that a 10-member crew has adequate volume {{for rapid}} and orderly entry and egress; the available volume and proximity to others {{was more than}} reasonably acceptable for a 10-member crew; more side-head room was desirable for the last row of seats to accommodate someone taller than a wider aisle, <b>removable</b> <b>seats</b> and more training could improve emergency personnel capabilities and performance; more downward viewing capability for the pilot was desirable. The cockpit display and seat design needed to be integrated with window placement.|$|E

2500|$|On August 27, 2013, Nashville mayor Karl Dean {{revealed}} {{plans for}} two new riverfront parks {{on the east}} and west banks of the Cumberland River downtown. Construction on the east bank park began in the fall of 2013, and the projected completion date for the west bank park is 2015. Among many exciting benefits of this Cumberland River re-development project is the construction of a highly anticipated outdoor amphitheater. Located on the west bank, this music venue will be surrounded by a new [...] park and will replace the previous thermal plant site. It will include room for 6,500 spectators with 2,500 <b>removable</b> <b>seats</b> and additional seating on an overlooking grassy knoll.

50|$|In 2006, Wrightbus {{launched}} the Eclipse SchoolRun; effectively an entirely high floor {{version of the}} Eclipse Commuter, bodied on Volvo B7R coach chassis. The Eclipse SchoolRun, as the name suggests, was mainly intended for school bus work. Northern Ireland bus operator Ulsterbus were the only customer to order the Eclipse SchoolRun, ordering 160 of the type in 2006. The first 110 were delivered with 66 seats in a high density 2+3 layout, including several <b>removable</b> <b>seats</b> {{at the front of}} the bus, which can be removed to allow the provision of wheelchair space; the final 50 buses were delivered with 62 seats and a permanent wheelchair area to save time in taking out and putting back the <b>removable</b> <b>seats.</b> The final Eclipse SchoolRun was completed in 2008.|$|E

40|$|In {{the event}} of a collision, the safe and {{reliable}} deployment of side airbags which include side-torso and combination airbags through <b>removable</b> car <b>seat</b> covers that use tearseam technology has been recently questioned. It is well known that a side-torso airbag system in automotive seats can reduce injuries and prevent fatalities in {{the event of}} a collision. <b>Removable</b> car <b>seat</b> covers suitable for side airbag systems are popular accessories in the automotive industry from the perspective of upholstery protection and aesthetics. This study demonstrated a better-suited technology in which laser ablation down the side panel of <b>removable</b> car <b>seat</b> covers, produced a pre-determined strength within a weakened zone that allowed a reliable airbag deployment in {{the event of a}} collision. This paper investigates the effect of laser power as a key factor in the laser ablation process and its influence on the bursting strength of the car seat cover materials. The laser-ablation of the <b>removable</b> car <b>seat</b> covers can ensure the consistent airbag deployment under environmental conditions and temperatures ranging between ambient (22 ± 2 °C), cold (- 35 ± 2 °C) and hot (85 ± 2 °C). The durability and deployment performance of these car seat covers after UV exposure was also investigated...|$|R

The photo was later used on a Falkland Islands 54p stamp.|$|E
5000|$|The ZX's {{interior}} space and value received praise from critics and consumers. Of particular note was {{the rear seat}} arrangement; it was mounted on a sliding platform that allowed the seat to be moved rearwards to increase rear legroom, or forwards to increase cargo space. Unfortunately, only the seat backs folded down on models so fitted. Lower specification models with fully folding and <b>removable</b> <b>seats</b> had more ultimate capacity.|$|E

In its final configuration, the C-87 could carry between 20 and 25 passengers or 12,000 lbs of cargo. Because of war production bottlenecks and shortages, many C-87 aircraft were fitted with turbosuperchargers producing lower boost pressure and power than those fitted to B-24s destined for combat use, and ceiling and climb rate were accordingly adversely affected.|$|E

This was generally done in the sitting down position, using a <b>removable</b> <b>seat</b> which was hung from the engine room access ladder. Four levers were used to control the two Gardner 8L3s engine's RPM settings and the direction of drive to the propellers via reversing gearboxes. A governor (speed control) control lever was used to adjust the engine revolutions, and a gearbox lever was used with positions for ahead, neutral and reverse.|$|R
