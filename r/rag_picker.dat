5000|$|Many {{terms are}} {{used to refer to}} people who salvage recyclables from the waste stream for sale or {{personal}} consumption. In English, these terms include <b>rag</b> <b>picker,</b> reclaimer, informal resource recoverer, binner, recycler, poacher, salvager, scavenger, and waste picker; in Spanish cartonero, chatarrero, pepenador, clasificador, minador and reciclador; and in Portuguese catador de materiais recicláveis. A more contemporary term, focusing on the outcome of the professional activity, is [...] "informal sector recycling". However, the word [...] "informal" [...] can be partly misleading, because in practice a continuum between total informality and proper organization in taxed registered formal activities may be encountered.|$|E

40|$|In India, collection, segregation, transportation, and {{disposal}} of solid waste are often unscientific and chaotic. Uncontrolled dumping of wastes {{on the outskirts of}} towns and cities has created over-flowing landfills, which have environmental impacts in the form of pollution to soil, groundwater, and air, and also contribute to global warming. Without proper planning the pace of this urban growth could cause a strain to the municipal infrastructures like water supply, sewage and solid waste disposal causing public health problems. In the absence of formalized waste segregation practices, recycling has emerged only as an informal sector using outdated technology, which causes serious health problems to waste–pickers. The present research is aimed at finding out a possible alternative for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management. It is aimed at participation and facilitation of the <b>rag</b> <b>pickers</b> in the solid waste disposal system so that better earning for the <b>rag</b> <b>pickers</b> are ensured with safe methods for segregation and also facilitates optimum recycling and reuse. Items reclaimed by <b>rag</b> <b>pickers</b> will be procured by the company at market price for further processing, e. g. paper for recycling or burning based on state of the materials, plastics for further segregation in plastic recycling plant. Uniqueness of the system will lie in the mechanical segregation plant installed in the MSW unit. This system will also eliminate the requirement of huge amount of land for landfill...|$|R

He unfolds the truth behind Selina's death {{with the help}} of her childhood friend Prof.Shyamala Menon (Parvathy), who lost connection with Selina after she discontinued her grade 10 studies abruptly. In course of investigation, he discovers that Selina happened to become pregnant in her childhood following a gang rape and her father forcibly took her back from school after the school quietly dismissed her. But what makes the film different is that Selina is unaware of this incident. She did not accept the fact even after the birth of her baby. She considered herself as a virgin and called her son Immanuel meaning the son of Holy virgin Mary. Her child was moved to an orphanage by her father Antony (Karamana Janardanan Nair). She lost her memory after losing the child in an accident while trying to jump out of car. Seeing her son after a Decade as a <b>Rag</b> <b>Picker,</b> she is emotionally shocked and commits suicide. The film has a lot of memorable scenes including the climax, when Shyamala comes to know that she and Selina were raped while unconscious, after smoking bhang.|$|E

50|$|AIF’s {{approach}} is to link the urban poor and migrants with various types of self-employment and wage employment opportunities that are emerging in an urban informal sector economy, by taking full advantage of a growing economy, mainly around the growing services, manufacturing and construction sectors.

5000|$|Luks was a born rebel {{and one of}} {{the most}} {{distinctive}} personalities in American art. [...] "He is Puck. He is Caliban. He is Falstaff," [...] his contemporary, the art critic James Gibbons Huneker, wrote. Like many of the later Abstract Expressionist men, he made a great display of his masculinity and could seldom retreat from a dare. He took pride in being known as the [...] "bad boy" [...] of American art, liked to characterize himself as entirely self-created, and downplayed the influence of Robert Henri, or any contemporary, on his artistic development. He was given to hyperbolic statements and was often intentionally vague about autobiographical details, preferring to maintain an aura of self-mythologizing mystery. He was equally at home at a prize fight or in a tavern as in a museum or a gallery. Luks was always a heavy drinker, and his friend and one-time roommate William Glackens often had to undress him and haul him to bed after a night of drunken debauchery. Although many sources confirm this tendency, they also characterize him as a man with a kind heart who befriended people living on the edge who became subjects for his works of art. Examples of this are numerous: e.g., Widow McGee (1902) or The Old Duchess and The <b>Rag</b> <b>Picker</b> (both of 1905), in which Luks depicted with sensitivity elderly, down-and-out women who knew the harsh realities of the street. Luks was a paradox: a man of enormous egotism and a great generosity of spirit.|$|E

Among the soaring skyscrapers, choking exhaust fumes, nonstop traffic jams, and towering monuments, one discovers old Beijing—newly styled, perhaps, but no less present and powerful than in its ancient incarnation. Beijing Time conducts us into this mysterious world, at once familiar and yet alien to the outsider. The ancient Chinese understood the world as enchanted, its shapes revealing the mythological order of the universe. In the structure and detail of Tian’anmen Square, the authors reveal the city as a whole. In Beijing no pyramids stand as proud remnants of the past; instead, the entire city symbolizes a vibrant civilization. From Tian’anmen Square, we proceed to the neighborhoods for a glimpse of local color—from the granny and the young police officer to the <b>rag</b> <b>picker</b> and the flower vendor. Wandering from the avant-garde art market to the clock towers, from the Monumental Axis to Mao’s Mausoleum, the book allows us to peer into the lives of Beijingers, the rules and rituals that govern their reality, and the mythologies that furnish their dreams.

5000|$|Though {{documentation}} exists of <b>rag</b> <b>pickers</b> and {{scrap metal}} collectors supplying goods to paper mills and foundries {{as early as}} the 17th century, modern waste picking did not flourish in the US and Europe until the 19th century. [...] Just as in the developing world, the combination of industrialization and urbanization led to three trends which favored the blossoming of the informal waste collecting industry: increased generation of urban waste, increased demand for raw materials from industry, and increased numbers of urban dwellers in need of livelihoods. In that era, waste pickers were known as wharf rats, tinkers, rag and bone men, mudlarks, and ragpickers. By the mid-20th century waste picking decreased, as waste management industries were formalized, and welfare states decreased the poor’s reliance on informal recycling.|$|R

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted over a period of seven months (April 2013 -October 2013) in a 500 -bedded hospital where the average quantum of biomedical waste is 0. 8 kg/bed/day. The issues related to transportation {{of health care}} waste from 39 generation sites to the health care waste storage site inside the hospital (intramural transfer) were addressed and analysed in a predesigned proforma. Results: The biomedical waste management team inspected the generation sites in the hospital on a daily basis and conformance to the procedures was checked. It was found that waste was collected at scheduled timings in 99. 6 % occasions; however, compliance to wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) was poor and ranged from 1. 22 − 1. 84 %.

40|$|After a trip {{to market}} everyone, doesn’t matter, housewife, {{teenager}} or a businessman, all brings polythene (plastics) bag to the home. Although we are aware about the impacts of those polythene bags, we use it very extensively as it is handy and easily available. From street hawkers to department stores, customers are provided with plastic bags to carry their purchased belongings home. In 2003, plastics were 9. 5 % of the country's total solid waste output (Viraraghavan 2005). These numbers are more alarming when coupled {{with the fact that}} the higher density plastic bags of the past were recycled by the plastic industry, while today’s thin plastic bags are left to clog the environment. Initially, plastic bags were made of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), more than 20 microns thick, which when discarded, were collected by <b>rag</b> <b>pickers</b> and sold to plastic industries which can be easily recycled.

To isolate and identify the potential pathogens that degrade the waste, samples were collected from 7 dumpsites and one control site. Serial dilutions of the samples were carried out and aliquots (0. 1 mL) of the diluted samples were inoculated into appropriate media. Similarly, blood, stool, urine and nasal swabs were collected from 80 waste scavengers and 20 control subjects. The blood samples were used for the determination of haematological parameters and widal test, while urine, stool and nasal swabs were used for microbiological analysis. Five genera of bacteria were isolated from the waste dumpsites, which include Staphylococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus sp. while the control sites showed growth of Bacillus sp., only. The culture result from waste scavengers also showed similar organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Salmonella sp.

40|$|Background: Inhalant use {{has existed}} in India since the 1970 s and has {{increased}} significantly {{over the last}} decades, especially among street-oriented young people. The latter constitute a heterogeneous category: children from street families, children 'of' the street, <b>rag</b> <b>pickers,</b> and part-time street children. There are also inhalant-using schoolchildren and young people in slums. Methods: Fieldwork was conducted for 1 year. Team ethnography, multi-sited and comparative research, flexibility of methods and writing field notes were explicit parts of the research design. Most research was undertaken with six groups in four areas of Delhi, exemplifying six generic categories of inhalant-using street-oriented young people. Results: Inhalants in India are branded: Eraz-Ex diluter and whitener, manufactured by Kores, are used throughout Delhi; Omni glue in one specific area. There is {{a general lack of}} awareness and societal indifference towards inhalant use, {{with the exception of the}} inhalant users themselves, who possess practical knowledge. They conceive of inhalants as nasha, encapsulating the materiality of the substances and the experiential aspects of intoxication and addiction. Fragments of group interviews narrate the sensory appeal of inhalants, and an ethnographic vignette the dynamics of a sniffing session. These inhalant-using street children seek intoxication in a pursuit of pleasure, despite the harm that befalls them as a result. Some find nasha beautiful, notwithstanding the stigmatization, violence and bodily deterioration; others experience it as an overpowering force. Conclusion: A source of attraction and pleasure, inhalants ravage street children's lives. In this mysterious space of lived experience, their self-organization evolves. Distinguishing between hedonic and side effects, addiction helps to understand inhalant use as at once neurobiological, cultural, and involving agency. The implications are that India needs to develop a policy of treatment and employment to deal with the addiction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Our {{employment}} {{industry is}} divided into the formal and informal sectors. The formal sector being the vital forms the mainstream which is monitored by some form of the government. Whereas the informal sector is seen to breed on a hand to mouth survival to exist that depends on no authority. The informal sector involves {{men and women who}} engage in different jobs which include beggary, shoe-shiners, <b>rag</b> <b>pickers,</b> hawkers on streets etc. These informal errands provide economy for the poor who engage in such work. The struggle of existence for this population breeds inequality, poverty, helplessness, livelihood concerns etc. Such situation calls for a socio-anthropological study so as to mainstream their plight and provide the informal sector with better facilities and recognition. The paper addresses this concern with reference to the case of the hawking community with special attention to the female hawkers in the local trains of Mumbai. This paper explores the realities of train hawking and the plight of female train hawkers. First it looks at the dynamics of their business and highlights their daily struggle for security and survival. Followed by examining the train hawkers as part of the unorganized sector and the need for regulation of employment that would assure them security and independence. An analysis of the legal status of hawkers in India and their right to livelihood is made to understand their struggle with the government. Through primary, secondary resources and transient ethnography, this paper would seek to validate its stance about questioning the existing inequality created between Hawking as a means of earning livelihood and mainstream employment in India which is inherently discriminating and the legislative interventions of the system which would fail to deliver if they are not audited in a timely and adequate manner. In conclusion, the paper would make a critique of the existing systems and offer a few suggestions and practical ideas for betterment of train hawkers especially through a contribution that can be made by civil society and some that could be taken up for further discussion...|$|R
40|$|Background: In India {{every year}} an {{estimated}} 20, 000 patients die of Rabies. Major reason for poor compliance to anti-rabies prophylaxis {{is the high}} cost of anti-rabies vaccine being prescribed intramuscularly (IM) as a routine i. e. 44. 5 USD per course of five injections. In 1992 WHO recommended low cost intra-dermal rabies vaccination (IDRV), which costs only 7. 5 USD or less per animal bite course. Methods: Interviews with doctors revealed that they were not prescribing intra-dermal anti rabies vaccination as they were either not aware or were not confident of this route of rabies vaccination. Also the vaccine vial did not have the label for “intra-dermal use”. These barriers were removed by advocacy efforts with policy makers & drug companies, credit sharing & team building, which led to starting of first intra dermal anti-rabies clinic of North India on 2 nd August 2008. Results: Within a month of start of intra-dermal rabies vaccination clinic, i. e. by 2 nd September, 2008, there was an increase in the hospital patient load by 2. 8 times, and poor patients load by 3. 2 times. In just less than two-year time, 200, 000 USD of poor patients were saved and 5769 patients vaccinated. Each patient was asked to bring one vial on first visit & rest of doses were given “free” by pooling strategy. Pooling strategy involved distribution of one vial of vaccine among four persons and keep the three vials for use one by one by all the four patients on subsequent three visits. Another offshoot of the strategy was to prevent wasting of even few drops of vaccine that used to remain in each vial of 1 ml after distribution among four patients (0. 2 mL or less). Out of more than 5000 vials utilised, every time we would transfer the left out drops of vaccine to the next new vial and use it immediately on a new pool of patients waiting for vaccination. We would, however, discard the unused vaccine after eight hours of reconstitution {{at the end of the}} day. The vaccine so saved turned to be a stock of more than 100 vials in less than two years that we were able to give free to more than 225 <b>rag</b> <b>pickers,</b> garbage collectors and newspaper hawkers on World Rabies Day, Sep 28, 2010. Conclusions: With intra-dermal clinic, we were able to successfully introduce the new cost effective intra-dermal method of rabies vaccination despite all odds & vested interests of companies & old mindset of doctors that had blocked this technique till now. This will go a long way in reducing the burden of disease & death due to rabies from India...|$|R
40|$|Migration is an {{indicator}} {{to understand the}} degree of alteration in socio-economic, political sphere at national as well as international levels. It is also a symptom of disparity in economic and social aspects between the origin of migrant and destination of migrant. Disparities in regional development are main reason for migration in Indian. During year 1951 in India the share of urban population to the total population was only 17 percent. According to 2011 census of India {{the total population of}} the country is 1. 2 billion with annual growth rate of 1. 8 percent. The total urban population is 377 million, which is 31. 6 {{percent of the total population}} of the country. Due to rapid industrial growth and agglomeration of economic activities, cities are pulling people from rural hinterland. The population is largely concentrated in a few large cities and metropolitan cities of the country, it accounts for 35. 4 percent of the total urban population. The urbanization in India is mainly due rural to urban migration of population. During last 50 years the share of rural population of the country has decreased from 82. 0 to 68. 9 per cent. According to National Sample Survey 64 th Round approximately a third of Indians (i. e. some 325 million people, out of a population of 1. 14 billion in 2008) are migrants. Employment seems to be the prime force for migration; in rural areas, 55 per cent of the households have migrated for employment related reasons. Analysis of the statistical data says that after migration a higher percentage of the persons were found to be engaged in economic activities: for males the percentage of workers have increased from 51 per cent before migration to 63 per cent after migration in rural areas while in case of females, it has increased from 20 per cent to 33 per cent in rural areas. Getting employment is always a major area of concern. In most cases it is found that migrants are not getting job in urban areas according to their capacity, they are either engaged in lower capacity job or become self-employed. For rural males, self-employment has appeared as main choice to employment after migration. The share of self-employment in total migrants have increased from 16 per cent before migration to 27 per cent after migration, while the shares of regular employees and casual labours remained almost stable, in both before and after migration. The causes of migration are usually explained with two broad categories, namely, push and pull factors. For rural India, poverty is still considered to be the main push factor for illiterates and moderately educated migrants. The lack of employment opportunities in the rural areas and better employment opportunity and infrastructure facilities in the urban areas attract people to migrate to urban areas. In the rural areas, sluggish agricultural growth and lack of development of the rural non-farm sector raises the incidence of rural poverty, unemployment and underemployment. People from rural areas move towards town or cities with a expectation of better livelihood opportunities. The story of migration has its own tales of sorrow as several children turn into <b>rag</b> <b>pickers</b> and families have to live in inhuman conditions in urban areas. Many don’t get employment throughout the year and commute between urban and rural areas. However, for the landless and marginal farmers who are in constant debt, migration is the only choice for livelihood. Government of Indian has taken various initiatives towards rural development. Some of the rural development programmers undertaken by the Government of India are Community Development Programme, Twenty Point Programme, Drought Prone Areas programme, Desert Development programme, National Fund for Rural Development, Council for Advancement of People’s Action and Rural Technology, Har Khet ko Pani, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, etc. All these programme/ Schemes aim to improve the rural economy. After implementation of Smart City Programme the Government of India has launched SMART Village –a community driven initiative for re-constructuring of rural India. It is also known as Rurban Mission. The National Rurban Mission aims at development of a cluster of villages which conserve and nurture the essence of the rural community life with focus on equity and inclusiveness without compromising with the facilities perceived to be essentially urban in nature, thus creating a cluster of ‘Rurban villages’. The Mission intends to simulate local economic development, enhance basic services and create well planned Rurban clusters. About 300 Rurban clusters will be developed over the next five years, which have latent potential for growth, in all States and Union Territories, which would trigger overall development in the region (. Ministry of Rural Development, 2016). In this article an attempt has been made to understand state wise spatio-temporal characteristics to rural to urban migration and to evaluate the smart city as a tool to curb the rate of rural to urban migration in future...|$|R
