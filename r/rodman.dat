5|$|In December 2013, <b>Rodman</b> {{announced}} he would visit North Korea again. He also said he has plans to bring a number of former NBA players with him for an exhibition basketball tour.

5|$|In the 1996–1997 NBA season, <b>Rodman</b> won {{his sixth}} {{rebounding}} title {{in a row}} with 16.7boards per game, along with 5.7points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up. However, he made more headlines for his notorious behavior. On January 15, 1997, {{he was involved in}} an incident during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. After tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos, <b>Rodman</b> kicked Amos in the groin. Though he was not assessed a technical foul at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000settlement, and the league suspended <b>Rodman</b> for 11games without pay. Thus, he effectively lost $1 million. Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, <b>Rodman</b> was not as effective in the 1997 NBA Playoffs, in which the Bulls reached the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. He struggled to slow down Jazz power forward Karl Malone, but did his share to complete the six-game Bulls victory.|$|E

5|$|NY177 {{begins at}} interchange42 on I-81 {{in the town}} of Adams.

5|$|Recognizing the {{practicality}} of this solution, Admiral <b>Rodman</b> {{requested that}} the Navy Department send another battleship to operate with his division. Specifically, <b>Rodman</b> requested the ship be New Yorks sister ship , to better match Grand Fleet policy, which encouraged the use of matched pairs to aid in rangefinding. Although there was some grumbling at the Navy Department that a five ship division was counter to U.S. Navy policy, they eventually agreed, and on 11 February 1918, Texas arrived at Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably {{entered the}} 1987 NBA Playoffs. They swept the Washington Bullets and soundly beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics {{in what was}} {{called one of the}} {{physically}} and mentally toughest series ever. <b>Rodman</b> feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when he waved his right hand over his own head. When the Celtics took Game Seven, Johnson went back at <b>Rodman</b> in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Just Cause in December 1989, Navy Reserve Commodore Maria Morales from Puerto Rico was {{deployed}} to Panama and served at <b>Rodman</b> Naval Station. According to Morales, in Panama {{she had her}} first real experience with the anguish and impact of an armed conflict, not only on military service members, but on families as well.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career <b>Rodman</b> was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; <b>Rodman</b> was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself {{as one of the best}} rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said <b>Rodman</b> was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1994–1995 NBA season, <b>Rodman</b> {{clashed with the}} Spurs front office. He was suspended {{for the first three}} games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. In the 1995 NBA Playoffs, the 62-win Spurs with reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions Houston Rockets who had only won 47games. It was thought that Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon {{would have a hard time}} asserting himself versus Robinson and <b>Rodman,</b> who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor <b>Rodman,</b> who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court, could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{launched}} {{on the afternoon}} of 20 February 1902 in a small, informal ceremony. Mrs. <b>Rodman</b> Griscom christened the ship, but Kroonland did not budge on the launching way; cold weather had frozen the tallow used to grease the timbers. Hydraulic jacks eventually freed the ship for her plunge into the Delaware River.|$|E
5|$|On November 5, 1999, <b>Rodman</b> and his then-wife, Carmen Electra, {{were charged}} with misdemeanors after police were {{notified}} of a domestic disturbance. Each posted $2,500 in bail and were released with {{a temporary restraining order}} placed on them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rodman</b> {{remained}} a bench player during the 1988–1989 season, averaging 9.0 points and 9.4 rebounds in 27minutes, yet providing such effective defense {{that he was}} voted into the All-Defensive Team, the first of eight times in his career. He also began seeing more playing time after Adrian Dantley was traded at midseason to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, then winning in six games versus the Chicago Bulls—including scoring champion Michael Jordan—and easily defeating the Lakers 4–0 in the 1989 NBA Finals. Although he was hampered by back spasms, <b>Rodman</b> dominated the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds in Game 3 and providing tough interior defense.|$|E
5|$|Rodman's {{first wife}} was Annie Bakes, {{with whom he}} had a {{daughter}} named Alexis (born 1988). They divorced in the early 1990s. <b>Rodman</b> married model Carmen Electra in November 1998 at the Little Chapel of the Flowers in Las Vegas, Nevada. Electra filed for divorce in April 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{regular season}} of the 1997–1998 NBA season ended with <b>Rodman</b> winning his seventh {{consecutive}} rebounding title with 15.0boards per game, along with 4.7points per game. He grabbed 20or more rebounds 11times, among them a 29-board outburst against the Atlanta Hawks and 15offensive boards (along with ten defensive) versus the Los Angeles Clippers. Led by the aging Jordan and <b>Rodman</b> (respectively 35 and 37years old), the Bulls reached the 1998 NBA Finals, again versus the Jazz. After playing strong defense on Malone {{in the first three}} games, he caused major consternation when he left his team prior to Game Four to go wrestling with Hulk Hogan. He was fined $20,000, but it was not even ten percent of what he earned with this stint. However, Rodman's on-court performance remained top-notch, again shutting down Malone in Game Four until the latter scored 39points in a Jazz Game Five win, bringing the series to 3–2 from the Bulls perspective. In Game Six, Jordan hit the decisive basket after a memorable drive on Jazz forward Bryon Russell, the Bulls won their third title in a row and <b>Rodman</b> his fifth ring.|$|E
