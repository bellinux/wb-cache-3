5|$|The edition {{published}} by Faulkner includes over 500 corrections {{to the original}} text, surpassing any other editions. Faulkner's version also contains over 50 passages that either not present in the original or expanded on from the original text. This has suggested to some critics that the Faulkner edition was a later <b>rework</b> of Gulliver's Travels {{and not just a}} correction to printing related mistakes. The inclusion of these many additions was later seen by critics as part of Swift's disapproval of Motte's versions, but others see Motte's version as being more true to the anti-government spirit of Swift's work, which confuses Swift's motivation in allowing Faulkner to reprint the work.|$|E

5|$|When it {{came time}} to {{translate}} The Black Island, which is set in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to make the scenes more true-to-life; such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring scenes of the British countryside were more accurate for discerning British readers. Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough, and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail, which should be put right, asking Studios Hergé to <b>rework</b> it completely. The resulting album is the dramatically updated and redrawn 1966 version that is the most commonly available today. , Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to <b>rework</b> it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product.

40|$|Abstract. In the mould {{manufacturing}} projects, {{there are}} large numbers of uncertainties, such as change of customer demand, change of drawing, bad quality of products etc., and they often lead to numerous task <b>reworked.</b> Because of the random task <b>reworking,</b> the complete time of the project is uncertainty. Based on the critical chain project with task <b>reworking,</b> the paper carried out the research on setting of project buffer. We presented a new idea that the project buffer was calculated based on safety time and possible <b>reworking</b> time, and proposed a method to calculate the buffer of project <b>reworking</b> based on Discrete-time Markov chain. The problem that the classical method to setting critical chain project buffer is infeasible concerning task <b>reworking</b> was solved efficiently. The proposed method can set the project buffer more reasonable...|$|R
40|$|The <b>reworking</b> {{of older}} radiolarian microfossils into near-surface sediments of the {{tropical}} Pacific {{has long been the}} source of confusion for the development of radiolarian stratigraphy and of puzzlement over the mechanism(s) that could effect such pervasive <b>reworking.</b> Widespread dissolution “pits” in the sediments {{of the tropical}} Pacific are believed to be associated with hydrothermal circulation cells in the older oceanic crust and are here linked to processes which expose older sections and inject older non-carbonate material into near-bottom waters. Discharging waters of these circulation cells tend to dissolve carbonate in near-surface sediments; thus, only the non-carbonate material (including radiolarians) is preserved and <b>reworked</b> into younger sediments. Results from the study of two sites in the tropical Pacific indicate that <b>reworked</b> older, stratigraphically important radiolarians are less than 2 % of the total radiolarian assemblage. This constitutes a minimum estimate of the amount of <b>reworked,</b> non-carbonate material in the younger sediments. The oldest <b>reworked</b> radiolarians are no more than 10 m. y. younger than the underlying basement, and radiolarians from the entire older section above that level {{can be found in the}} <b>reworked</b> material. A time series of the flux of <b>reworked</b> material at one site is not constant but instead has varied by a factor of 3 to 4 over the past 2. 5 m. y.

5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring <b>rework</b> {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to <b>rework</b> the character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to improve}} his team's fortunes, Fletcher made several moves over the {{following}} seasons to <b>rework</b> the Flames roster. His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977–78 season as both sought more playing time. Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. They {{made it into the}} playoffs again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points than them, the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three series, 2 games to 0. In March 1979, Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise-leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, led by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher hoped that the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success.|$|E

5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed.

During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and <b>rework.</b> The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
5|$|The M {{class was}} {{authorized}} by Plan Z in 1939, though design work started {{as early as}} 1936; these ships were intended {{to serve as the}} reconnaissance units for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned in the plan. The Navy placed very high requirements for long range, heavy armament, armor proof against guns of the ships' caliber, and high speeds, which forced the designers to compromise crucial aspects of the design, including the armor and armament, both of which were too weak. This led the design staff to <b>rework</b> the plans for the last two ships to rectify some of these flaws. Work began on the first two ships in 1938, but the outbreak of war in September 1939 forced the Navy to abandon work on warships that could not be completed quickly. As a result, those two ships were scrapped and the remaining four were never laid down.|$|E
5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to <b>rework</b> or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E

40|$|Soil <b>reworking,</b> e. g. due to bioturbation, is an {{important}} aspect of soil and landscape evolution. Yet, rates of soil mixing are poorly constrained, especially on pedological and geomorphological relevant time scales of decades to millennia. This study presents a novel method to reconstruct soil <b>reworking</b> rates on such timescales by utilising luminescence signals from individual sand-sized feldspar grains as soil <b>reworking</b> tracers. We propose a post-IR IRSL procedure to harvest two luminescence signals from individual feldspar grains. We applied this method to four soil samples from a single soil profile in Spain, and compared our results to those derived through a more conventional approach based on single-grain quartz luminescence analysis. We also propose novel ways of deriving effective soil <b>reworking</b> rates from luminescence data, using not only apparent burial ages of mineral grains but also the proportion of mineral grains that never reached the soil surface. Our results confirm the general suitability of feldspar post-IR IRSL as soil <b>reworking</b> tracer in terms of measurement performance, luminescence signal resetting and eventually the determination of soil <b>reworking</b> rate. We furthermore demonstrate that the feldspar based method is more time and labour efficient than quartz based methods, and we expect it to be more widely applicable. Most importantly, the method provides a reliable measures of the soil <b>reworking</b> intensity, which was not possible with quartz based methods. We conclude that feldspar single-grain luminescence analysis has the potential to become the method of choice for investigating soil <b>reworking</b> rates...|$|R

5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to <b>rework</b> the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the legal}} action, {{pre-production}} towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival {{which took place}} in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks. Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994. Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become GoldenEye, he announced on 12 April 1994 {{that he would not be}} returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to <b>rework</b> much of the material.

5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to <b>rework</b> and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E
