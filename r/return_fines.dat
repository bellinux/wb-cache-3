40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of grain size {{distribution}} control of the raw material mixture on the permeability of the green sinter bed and the properties of the produced sinter. This was achieved by evaluating the granulation characteristics of the sinter mixture (moisture content, granulation time and mean granule diameter) in terms of its green bed permeability, and evaluating the productivity of the sinter bed, the coke rate, tumble index (TI), abrasion index (AI), reduction disintegration index (RDI) and reducibility (RI) of the produced sinter. The raw sinter mixtures contained combinations of Thabazimbi iron ore, Sishen iron ore, coke, lime and <b>return</b> <b>fines.</b> The grain size distributions were controlled by removing the – 0. 5 mm size fractions of the <b>return</b> <b>fines</b> and coke, and the – 1 mm size fraction of lime. Of the examined mixtures, a mixture of 20 mass% Thabazimbi iron ore, 80 mass% Sishen iron ore and fluxes where the coke, lime and <b>return</b> <b>fines</b> were all sized had the highest granulation effectiveness and permeability. The sintering properties of the mixtures in which the grain size distributions were controlled, were very similar for all the mixtures, but superior to the base case mixture in which the grain size distribution was not controlled...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the effect of raw material properties on the kinetics of iron ore granulation considering in particular the layering mechanisms in wet granulation for different iron ore types. For that purpose, the granulation behaviour of single iron ore binary mixtures and more complex mixtures (iron ores and <b>return</b> <b>fines)</b> has been studied at laboratory scale using pilot drums. A particular interest is paid to the influence of morphology and wettability of iron ores...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{optimise}} the grain size distribution of the raw material mixture for the production of iron sinter. It well known that the constitution of the sinter mix is based on the knowledge of chemical composition and grain size distribution. Although Mittal Vanderbijlpark has fixed specifications on the physical and chemical properties of the sinter for optimal blast furnace performance, the particle size distribution of the sinter mix has not yet been optimized. This was achieved by using the granulation characteristics of the sinter mix and the green bed permeability tests. The influence of the moisture content of the feed, granulation time, and mean granule diameter on permeability was investigated on Thabazimbi and Sishen iron ore, as well as on their mixture with fluxes and without fluxes. The iron ore results indicated that the mixture containing 20 % Thabazimbi iron ore and 80 % Sishen iron ore with fluxes where the coke, lime and <b>return</b> <b>fines</b> were sized by removing the – 0. 5 mm size fraction of the <b>return</b> <b>fines</b> and coke, and the 1 mm size fraction of lime has the highest permeability of all the studied mixtures. The sintering properties of the mixtures of optimised grain size distributions were also investigated and the results were very similar for all the mixtures and better than the base case mixture, which was not optimised with respect to grain size distribution.

40|$|In modern ironmaking, {{granulation}} is {{the first}} step of the sintering process. It is typically carried out in continuous drum granulators using water as a binder, and involves multiple components besides iron ores, such as <b>return</b> <b>fines</b> and other recycled materials (dusts, mill scale, sludges), solid fuel (coke breeze or anthracite) and fluxes (limestone, lime, olivine, dunite or dolomite) (Ball, 1973). As it is necessary to maintain a consistent quality of the granules (size distribution, porosity, strength, etc.) despite of the varying iron ore origins, the question arises as to how the properties of the iron ore particles (size and shape) influence the granulation process. The granulation process is partly influenced by the characteristic of the feed and partly by the action of cohesive force inside the drum granulator (Newitt et al. 1958). The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the effect of raw material properties on the kinetics of iron ore granulation considering in particular the mechanisms ruling wet granulation for two iron ores and to know the factors which determine the texture, shape, porosity and mechanical strength of the granules...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} sinterability of Goa (India) iron ore having high Fe (65. 2 %) content. The sinter basicity (CaO/SiO 2) and its MgO were varied in the 2. 0 to 2. 5 and 1. 5 to 3. 0 range. The effect of process variables on the quality parameters of sinter namely, tumbler index (TI), reduction-degradation index (RDI) and reducibility index (RI) {{as well as the}} productivity of sinter was studied. The {{studies have shown that the}} consumption of coke (C: 74 %) was inter-influenced by the sinter basicity and its MgO content. Increasing the solid fuel consumption was not a viable solution to improve TI and RI simultaneously. The content of coke in the mix could be reduced to as low as 4 % through `low temperature sintering’ at the balanced <b>return</b> <b>fines</b> recirculation (~ 33 wt. percent). The sintering indices in terms of productivity of sinter and its quality improve quite significantly at a higher sinter basicity (CaO/SiO 2 ~ 2. 5) and its lower MgO content (1. 5 %) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{iron ore}} {{sintering}} material coalescence leading to densification {{occurs in the}} flame front. Unless {{a certain level of}} material coalescence is achieved, the obtained sinter product will not have the necessary size or load-bearing strength requirements. The efficiency of this process is dependent on melt volume and flowability of the molten system at flame front. Melt volume is greatly affected by the assimilation process which depends on ore properties – composition, porosity and size. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide information on the effect of solids ratio and melt properties on coalescence. In a sinter plant these parameters alter with changing blend composition. In this study, the behaviour of tablets containing four different iron sources: porous and dense ores, sinter and a chemical reagent, was studied in two fashions: theoretically the influence of assimilation on the properties of the melt and the three-phase system was examined; by experiments with an electric furnace, material coalescence was quantified using sinter density and pore property analysis. Results show that the porous ore tablet was more deformable and had a higher densification degree compared with the dense ore tablet. The highest density was found for the tablets containing sinter and chemical grade reagents. The results indicate that increased level of porous ore or sinter of <b>return</b> <b>fines</b> may enhance coalescence in sintering...|$|E

40|$|In general, milk powders are {{submitted}} to agglomeration {{in order to}} enhance their rehydration properties. This study evaluated the impact of six different methods of agglomeration of the same sweet whole milk powder on the physical and rehydration properties of the final product: non-agglomerated powder (control); agglomerated powder with <b>fines</b> <b>returned</b> {{to the top of the}} dryer, above the internal fluid bed (IFB) or above the cone; and agglomerated powder with <b>fines</b> <b>returned</b> above the IFB with a nozzle that injects steam or sprays water in the middle of the IFB, respectively. As expected, the biochemistry results showed no difference since the same concentrate was used in the whole set of experiments. The physical properties led to higher bulk densities, tapped densities and interstitial air for the control, and higher occluded air and particle size for agglomerated powders, regardless of the agglomeration process. All of these physical properties influenced the rehydratability. In fact, the wetting time and the dispersibility of sweet whole milk powder were significantly improved by the agglomeration method, with the <b>return</b> of <b>fines</b> and steam injection in the IFB. An experimental design of the agglomeration process was devised for this agglomeration approach...|$|R
