40|$|Background: Healthy {{diet and}} regular {{physical}} activity are powerful tools in reducing diabetes and cardiometabolic risk. Various international scientific and health organizations have advocated the use of new technologies to solve these problems. The PREDIRCAM project explores the contribution that a technological system could offer for the continuous monitoring of lifestyle habits and individualized treatment of obesity as well as cardiometabolic risk prevention. Methods: PREDIRCAM is a technological platform for patients and professionals designed to improve the effectiveness of lifestyle behavior modifications through the intensive use of the latest information and communication technologies. The platform consists of a web-based application providing communication interface with monitoring devices of physiological variables, application for monitoring dietary intake, ad hoc electronic medical records, different communication channels, and an intelligent notification system. A 2 -week feasibility {{study was conducted in}} 15 volunteers to assess the viability of the platform. Results: The website received 244 visits (average time/session: 17 min 45 s). A total of 435 dietary intakes were <b>recorded</b> (<b>average</b> <b>time</b> for each intake registration, 4 min 42 s ± 2 min 30 s), 59 exercises were recorded in 20 heart rate monitor downloads, 43 topics were discussed through a forum, and 11 of the 15 volunteers expressed a favorable opinion toward the platform. Food intake recording was reported as the most laborious task. Ten of the volunteers considered long-term use of the platform to be feasible. Conclusions: The PREDIRCAM platform is technically ready for clinical evaluation. Training is required to use the platform and, in particular, for registration of dietary food intake...|$|E
40|$|In {{comparison}} with other imaging modalities MRI offers superior distinction among various soft tissues, being the reason it was used for precise determination of muscle tissue, its borders and surface area. We used MRI for semiquantitative measurements of the skeletal muscle in vivo. The study was performed on Wistar male albino rats. After measuring {{the surface of the}} normal plantar flexor muscles we denervated the sciatic nerve of one hind leg by crushing it with a pair of fine forceps. The surface of the denervated muscles was assessed once weekly until it regained its normal value. The measurements were performed on a superconductive magnet operating at 2. 3 T, with a hole diameter of 22. 5 cm. Multislice multiecho imaging technique was used and T 1 - weighted images (TR= 600 msec, TE= 34 msec) with continuous 3 mm slices in the coronal plane were <b>recorded.</b> <b>Average</b> <b>time</b> of the measurement was 25 minutes. The denervated muscle group atrophied and reached its smallest circumference in the second week after nerve injury. Following the regeneration of their nerve and the reestablishement of nerve muscle connections, the dependent muscles gradually regained their former dimensions so that in the fifth week their circumference was normal. We would like to emphasize that the change in surface area of the plantar flexor muscles closely parallels the change in their tetanic contraction force (1, 2, 3). The results of our experiment suggest the possibility of semiquantitative skeletal muscle size measurements on coronal MRI images, which correlate with their functional state.

40|$|Femoroacetabular {{impingement}} (FAI) {{occurs when}} an osseous abnormality of the proximal femur (cam) or acetabulum (pincer) triggers {{damage to the}} acetabular labrum and articular cartilage in the hip. Although the precise etiology of FAI is not well understood, both types of FAI are common in athletes presenting with hip pain, loss of range-of-motion, and disability in athletics. An open surgical approach to decompressing FAI has shown good clinical outcomes; however, this highly invasive approach inherently may delay or preclude a high level athlete’s return to play. The {{purpose of this study}} was to define associated pathologies and determine if an arthroscopic approach to treating FAI can allow professional athletes to return to high-level sport. Hip arthroscopy for the treatment of FAI allows professional athletes to return to professional sport. Between October 2000 and September 2005, 45 professional athletes underwent hip arthroscopy for the decompression of FAI. Operative and return-to-play data were obtained from patient <b>records.</b> <b>Average</b> <b>time</b> to follow-up was 1. 6  years (range: 6  months to 5. 5  years). Forty two (93 %) athletes returned to professional competition following arthroscopic decompression of FAI.

40|$|Collections of Chironomidae surface-floating pupal exuviae (SFPE) {{provide an}} {{effective}} means of assessing water quality in streams. Although not widely used in the United States, the technique is not new and {{has been shown to be}} more cost-efficient than traditional dip-net sampling techniques in organically enriched stream in an urban landscape. The intent of this research was to document the efficiency of sorting SFPE samples relative to dip-net samples in trout streams with catchments varying in amount of urbanization and differences in impervious surface. Samples of both SFPE and dip-nets were collected from 17 sample sites located on 12 trout streams in Duluth, MN, USA. We quantified time needed to sort subsamples of 100 macroinvertebrates from dip-net samples, and less than or greater than 100 chironomid exuviae from SFPE samples. For larger samples of SFPE, the time required to subsample up to 300 exuviae was also <b>recorded.</b> The <b>average</b> <b>time</b> to sort subsamples of 100 specimens was 22. 5 minutes for SFPE samples, compared to 32. 7 minutes for 100 macroinvertebrates in dip-net samples. <b>Average</b> <b>time</b> to sort up to 300 exuviae was 37. 7 minutes.

40|$|Purpose. A novel dual-output vocal cord {{vibration}} switch {{is described}} and evaluated for two individuals with severe motor disabilities and complex communication needs. An evaluative case series {{was performed to}} compare the new device to its previously proposed single-output counterpart in terms of accuracy, speed and user fatigue. Method. In an ABAB design, participants were followed for up to 16 days as they performed several image matching tasks. Custom-written software <b>recorded</b> the <b>average</b> <b>time</b> taken to match each item, {{as well as the}} total number of selection errors. Participants reported their fatigue levels using a modified five-point Borg scale. Results. For one participant, the dual-output version significantly decreased task completion time and selection error (p 4 0. 05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), thus improving her communication ability. For the second participant, no significant differences were observed between the single- and dual-output systems. Fatigue associated with illness and self-reported stress with school exams were identified as limiting factors. Conclusions. The dual-output vocal cord vibration switch provides a promising new alternative for individuals with severe and multiple disabilities who are able to hum or produce vocalizations.

Longer farrowings were associated with longer intervals (r=. 73), but farrowing duration and litter size at birth were not closely related (r=. 19, P>. 05). Farrowing duration was positively associated with the number of pigs born alive (r=. 34, P<. 0 l). Farrowing interval, a better criterion of speed of farrowing than farrowing duration, was significantly associated with number of pigs alive at birth and at weaning; the correlations were, respectively, -. 75 and -. 78. Farrowing interval was also negatively associated with litter weight at 21 days, the correlation was -. 32 (P<. 05). So naturally it was negatively associated with the National Swine Improvement Federation's sow-productivity index: (r=- 18, P<. 05).

40|$|BackgroundEarly reperfusion {{in acute}} ST-segment {{elevation}} myocardial infarction (STEMI) {{is very important}} to improve patients clinical outcome. Implementing institutional plan to decrease door-to-balloon time is crucial to achieve this goal. Our goal is to met the ACC/AHA recommendations of door-to-balloon time < 90 min. MethodsA chart review of all cases of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) performed. All door-to-balloon <b>times</b> were <b>recorded.</b> The <b>average</b> door-to-balloon <b>time</b> was calculated. Results 536 patients underwent primary PCI for STEMI from September 3, 2008 –Sept 30, 2012. For each patient, the initial presenting time, the first ECG time, the time ER physician saw the patient and activate the cath lab, the time patient arrived to cath lab, and puncture time to balloon inflation were recorded. 52 patients were excluded from the study for not having clear door-to-balloon time. 64. 2 % of the patients met the ACC/AHA recommendation of < 90 min door-to-balloon <b>time.</b> The <b>average</b> door-to-balloon <b>time</b> was 87. 7 (STD+ 35. 5) minutes for all patients. There was significant improvement in door-to-balloon time from 2008 to 2012. <b>Average</b> door-to-balloon <b>time</b> reduced from 105 min in September 2008 –December 2009 to 72 min in 2012. In 2012 door-to-balloon time was below 90 minutes in 86 % of patients versus 46 % in September 2008 –December 2009. ConclusionSixty-four percent of patients underwent primary PCI in King Abdulaziz Cardiac Center met the recommended guidelines. In 2012, 86 % met the recommended guidelines. Our future goal is to achieve the recommended guidelines in all patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Entity {{resolution}} {{is the process}} of identifying groups of records in a single or multiple data sources that represent the same real-world entity. It is an important tool in data de-duplication, in linking records across databases, and in matching query records against a database of existing entities. Most existing entity resolution techniques complete the resolution process offline and on static databases. However, real-world databases are often dynamic, and increasingly organizations need to resolve entities in real-time. Thus, {{there is a need for}} new techniques that facilitate working with dynamic databases in real-time. In this paper, we propose a dynamic similarity-aware inverted indexing technique (DySimII) that meets these requirements. We also propose a frequencyfiltered indexing technique where only the most frequent attribute values are indexed. We experimentally evaluate our techniques on a large realworld voter database. The results show that when the index size grows no appreciable increase is found in the <b>average</b> <b>record</b> insertion <b>time</b> (around 0. 1 msec) and in the <b>average</b> query <b>time</b> (less than 0. 1 sec). We also find that applying the frequency-filtered approach reduces the index size with only a slight drop in recall...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. From 1973 - 1992, the Georgia EPD {{sponsored}} a monitoring {{program in which}} surface salinities were sampled regularly at fixed stations in many of Georgia's estuaries. We used these data to examine changes in the salinities and flushing times of the Savannah, Ogeechee, Altamaha, · Satilla, and St. Marys estuaries over the period of <b>record.</b> Water-year <b>average</b> salinities increased slightly over time {{in four of the}} five estuaries. When data were smoothed with a three-year moving average (based on fast Fourier analysis of river discharge), the increases in salinity were statistically significant in the Satilla and Savannah River estuaries. We used the measured salinity values to estimate flushing <b>times</b> (<b>average</b> transit <b>time</b> of river water through an estuary) over the period of <b>record.</b> Flushing <b>times</b> <b>averaged</b> 28 d in the Ogeechee, 7 din the Altamaha, 63 d in the Satilla, and 65 d in the St. Marys, although there was considerable inter-annual variability in these estimates. These results are discussed in light of current proposals to increase surface water withdrawal from the Georgia rivers. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{designed}} a computerized system providing closed-loop {{control of the}} level of pressure support ventilation (PSV). The system sets itself at the lowest level of PSV that maintains respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), and end-tidal CO(2) pressure (PET(CO(2))) within predetermined ranges defining acceptable ventilation (i. e., 12 300 ml [> 250 if weight < 55 kg], and PET(CO(2)) < 55 mm Hg [< 65 mm Hg if chronic CO(2) retention]). Ten patients received computer-controlled (automatic) PSV and physician-controlled (standard) PSV, in random order, during 24 h for each mode. An estimation of occlusion pressure (P(0. 1)) was <b>recorded</b> continuously. The <b>average</b> <b>time</b> spent with acceptable ventilation as previously defined was 66 +/- 24 % of the total ventilation time with standard PSV versus 93 +/- 8 % with automatic PSV (p < 0. 05), whereas the level of PSV was similar during the two periods (17 +/- 4 cm H(2) O versus 19 +/- 6 cm H(2) O). The time spent with an estimated P(0. 1) above 4 cm H(2) O was 34 +/- 35 % of the standard PSV time versus only 11 +/- 17 % of the automatic PSV time (p < 0. 01). Automatic PSV increased the time spent within desired ventilation parameter ranges and apparently reduced periods of excessive workload...|$|R
