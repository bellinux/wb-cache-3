5000|$|An {{intermediate}} gear {{which does not}} drive a shaft to perform any work is called an idler gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may {{be referred to as}} a <b>reverse</b> <b>idler.</b> For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting a <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> between two gears. Since a driven gear (gear [...] "A") rotating clockwise will drive a second gear ("B") counterclockwise, adding a third gear to the string means that gear [...] "C" [...] will be spinning the same direction as [...] "A". A typical transmission is designed with [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] gears, so when the engine spins, the outputs shaft spins the opposite direction, which drives the vehicle forward. A <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> gear setup is actually typically an [...] "A" [...] and a [...] "C" [...] gear, which are not in contact with each other until a [...] "B" [...] gear is moved between them. Since the transmission is designed to move the car forwards when the output is spinning in the opposite direction from the input shaft, when added to the [...] "B" [...] idler gear, it forces the [...] "C" [...] gear to spin {{in the same direction as}} the [...] "A" [...] gear, and thus the input and output shafts are spinning in the same direction, which drives the car in reverse.|$|R

5000|$|Whenever {{the clutch}} pedal is {{depressed}} to shift into reverse, the mainshaft continues to rotate {{because of its}} inertia. The resulting speed difference between mainshaft and <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> gear produces gear noise grinding. The reverse gear noise reduction system employs a cam plate which {{was added to the}} reverse shift holder. When shifting into reverse, the 5th/reverse shift piece, connected to the shift lever, rotates the cam plate. This causes the 5th synchro set to stop the rotating mainshaft. (13-4) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract：This paper {{attempts}} {{to give a}} detailed model and contact emulation analysis of gear models based on the ANSYS software, the method of which is superior to stree analysis figuring out the causes of mechanical failure. stress nephogram of the emulation analysis indicates the fracture of gear base is mainly caused by inclined press load which results in stress concentrate. This paper offers very valuable reference to product optimization and gear improvement. Instruction The test vehicle makes abnormal sound when the makers have a test for uphill with reverse gear. Entrusted by the makers, we have checked the gearbox. After the disassembling, We find that the tooth of the reverse gear of primary <b>shaft</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> gear have fractured, and in this case, the gear pair are scrapping. In this paper, we analyze the state of taking loads using ANSYS software {{in the process of}} gear mesh, eventually, the reasons of tooth failure are got, that way, the maker can make the gears better and take preventive measures, the quality of products are improved largely. 1 Fault performance and routine analysis 1. 1 The condition of gear failure After disassembling the gearbox, we found the reverse gear of primary <b>shaft</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>idler</b> gea...|$|R

50|$|The {{previous}} discussion normally {{applies only}} to the forward gears. The implementation of the reverse gear is usually different, implemented {{in the following way}} to reduce the cost of the transmission. Reverse is also a pair of gears: one gear on the countershaft and one on the output shaft. However, whereas all the forward gears are always meshed together, there is a gap between the reverse gears. Moreover, they are both attached to their shafts: neither one rotates freely about the shaft. When reverse is selected a small gear, called an <b>idler</b> gear or <b>reverse</b> <b>idler,</b> is slid between them. The idler has teeth which mesh with both gears, and thus it couples these gears together and reverses the direction of rotation without changing the gear ratio.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a screw pressing system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine. The functional parts of the machine included grating unit, extraction unit, prime mover, pulley, transmission belts, bearings and frame. The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs. A cottage sugarcane juice extraction plant based on this technology could provide employment {{and at the same time}} produce sugarcane juice and bagasse at low costs for sugar and biofuel industries. An improvement in the design, analysis and optimization of the worm shaft and press cage is expected to improve the juice yield and extraction efficiency; hence, this is highly recommended.

25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An <b>idler</b> <b>reverses</b> the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|R
5000|$|Pulleys were {{constructed}} of wood, iron, steel {{or a combination}} thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" [...] pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" [...] pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely ("loose") on the <b>shaft</b> (<b>idlers).</b> In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys {{could be used to}} give a variety of speed settings for the machine.|$|R
50|$|Reverse gear {{is usually}} not synchromesh, as {{there is only one}} reverse gear in the normal {{automotive}} transmission and changing gears into reverse while moving is not required—and often highly undesirable, particularly at high forward speed. Additionally, the usual method of providing <b>reverse,</b> with an <b>idler</b> gear sliding into place to bridge what would otherwise be two mismatched forward gears, is necessarily similar to the operation of a crash box. Among the cars that have synchromesh in reverse are the 1995-2000 Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, '00-'05 Chevrolet Cavalier, Mercedes 190 2.3-16, the V6 equipped Alfa Romeo GTV/Spider (916), certain Chrysler, Jeep, and GM products which use the New Venture NV3500 and NV3550 units, the European Ford Sierra and Granada/Scorpio equipped with the MT75 gearbox, the Volvo 850, and almost all Lamborghinis, Hondas and BMWs.|$|R
