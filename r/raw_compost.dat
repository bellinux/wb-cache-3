The <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> was further fortified with the plant growth promoting microorganisms or biocontrol agents like Trichoderma and Pseudomonas to scale up the efficiency of microbial formulations (Galitskaya et al. 2016). The strength of <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> can also be improved {{by the addition of}} poultry wastes and degradation with the help of microbial enzymes (Brandelli et al. 2015). In the very simple steps, bioconversion processes of agricultural wastes can be disseminated among rural population for adoption of such microbe-based models of bio-business. The impact of pelletizing pressure for developing solid state compost from different composting materials like pig solid fraction, bulking agents, e.g., biochar and wood chips, swine manure solid fractions and organic co-formulates was assessed for standardizing physical and mechanical properties of the composted material (Romano et al. 2014; Pampuro et al. 2017 a, b). These studies resulted in developing farmer-friendly and easily adaptable composted products with quality standards for commercialization and enterprising. These models are supposed to be developed for introducing multi-enterprising support for smart agriculture system (Pramanik et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|Aims: In this study, the {{potential}} capability of compost in the simultaneous adsorption of gas-phase n-hexane and benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX) was studied. Materials and Methods: Batch adsorption technique {{was used to}} assess the adsorption properties of compost. The pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetics were considered in order to identify the possible mechanism of the adsorption process. Moreover, the suitability of the adsorbent was evaluated using Langmuir, Freundlich and The Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. Results: After 24 h contact time, the adsorption capacity of one g compost was 1. 42 mg n-hexane and BTEX for initial concentration of 7. 74 mg/l. The adsorption capacities were in order of n-hexane < benzene < toluene < ethylbenzene < xylene. This order is in accordance to the ascending octanol-air partitioning coefficient (K OA) order of the compounds (the lowest for n-hexane and the highest for xylene). The kinetics data proved a closer fit to the pseudo-second order model, while the isotherm experimental data were a good correlation to both Freundlich and Langmuir models. Conclusion: The experimental data show that a material with an organic matrix, that is, <b>raw</b> <b>compost,</b> has a higher adsorption capacity for the gaseous compounds with higher K OA. Overall look to {{the results of this study}} indicates that although the <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> could adsorb gaseous n-hexane and BTEX, its capacity may not be sufficient for the continuous removal of VOCs from the air in the compost-based biofilters, in which biodegradation play a key role...|$|E

They are inevitable for the natural resource management in the farmers’ fields. Controlled composting guided by microbial interventions dependent on defined microbiological processes to decompose agricultural residues properly and timely and produce high-value low-cost bioorganic farm inputs (Ahmad et al. 2007; Singh and Nain 2015; Singh and Prabha 2017; Sudharmaidevi et al. 2017). This is how rapid composting processes can help farmers in timely production of compost and fortified bioorganic farm inputs of desired quality for organic farming needs and high-value commercial crops like vegetables, fruits, flowers, and organic crops (Hoornweg et al. 2000; Seyedbagheri 2010). If farmers need biopesticide-rich compost material for the control of soil-, seed- or seedling-borne fungal pathogens in the field, they can biofortify the <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> with bioagents (Siddiqui et al. 2008; Ng et al. 2016). Similarly, consortium {{of microorganisms}} fixing nitrogen, solubilizing phosphorus and zinc and mobilizing potassium can be utilized to fortify <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> material for desired quality under suitable enriching conditions of temperature and moisture.

So the increase of N accumulation in leafs after compost applying {{could be explained by}} the positive impact of P-compost on biological nitrogen fixation and/or N absorption. Furthermore, mineralization of organic matter in used organic amendments leads to an interesting release of nutrients for plants, in particular nitrogen. In amended soils, the kinetics of mineralization depends on soil texture, moisture regime and the kind of added organic matter (Du Laing et al. 2008). Hargreaves et al.

30|$|Direct {{composting}} {{of agricultural}} crop residues using large windrows allows thermophilic conditions to convert high volume of lignocellulosic wastes into stable compost with specific ingredients of definite C:N ratio (Vigneswaran et al. 2016). The whole process is biochemically sound and mediated by microbial metabolic activities that produce heat, water, CO 2 {{and results in}} mineralization, transformation, and humification (Shilev et al. 2007). The technology is cheaper and sustainable {{in terms of its}} requirements for ingredients, manpower, energy, water, time, resource integration, and reproducibility. As far as the agricultural benefits are concerned, in controlled and defined conditions, the process can yield organic matter disinfected by high temperature. It is also a mineral-rich nutritional substance that improves structural components of the soil by degrading large complex molecules into simple ones for soil fertility (Sonesson et al. 2000). After production of good-quality compost using windrows, biofortification of the raw product can be done with the use of beneficial microbial inoculants (plant growth-promoting bacteria, mycorrhiza, and biocontrol fungi) (Muttalib et al. 2016). Enrichment of <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> material with organic inputs like humic acid, amino acids, phytohormones, mineral nutrients (zinc, iron, boron), phytonutrients, botanicals and vermicompost can further add value to the products that can help in organic farming (Mohler and Johnson 2009).|$|E

30|$|The {{bioconversion}} {{process can}} be fastened {{with the use of}} such functionally characterized microbial inoculants that possess high enzymatic activities for lignocellulosic degradation (Choudhary et al. 2016). Industrial composting for mushroom production is an established biological procedure to produce Agaricus bisporus (Jurak et al. 2014). Mushrooms are among the most fascinating fungal organisms to be used as pretreatment degraders of the lignocellulose constituents of crop residues and perform improved enzymatic release of monosaccharides for biofuels. It also helps to convert residual biomass into valuable protein-rich edible fruits of high nutritional importance (Jurak et al. 2015). Compost preparation for mushroom production involves microorganisms that decompose natural lignocellulose into simple mineral components, on which mushroom mycelial mass grows and produces fruiting bodies (Mouthier et al. 2017). Therefore, besides obtaining high-value protein-rich functional food product from the bioconversion of crop residues by mushroom fungi (Chang 2008), farmers can also get value-added compost for their farms to enhance crop production and soil fertility. Fortification of <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> with plant growth-promoting bacteria and biocontrol agents like Trichoderma harzianum potentially enhance suppressiveness of soil-borne diseases and efficacy of compost microbiota against pathogenic diseases (Pugliese et al. 2011; Ros et al. 2017).

However, although with high proportion of C-rich raw material, mixtures with low initial C/N seems to have favored the accumulation of partially oxidized OM, which may have contributed to high electrical conductivity values in the final composts. Therefore, although favoring the partial transformation of OM into stabilized HS-like, initial mixtures with high proportion of C-rich raw material but with low initial C/ N led to unstable composts.

30|$|A reductionist {{approach}} {{towards the}} use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is the need of the day across the world. Minimizing farm chemicals can solve various problems of the present-day agriculture, especially those which are directly linked with the soils, plants and human health and raise negative ecological impacts. Available post harvest crop residues create sanitation problems {{in the rural areas}} due to uncontrolled anaerobic degradation. While using excessive chemical fertilizers, farmers have almost forgotten to add organic carbon to the soils and this has resulted in lowering the carbon content of the soils over a time scale. Low organic carbon content soils usually become non-responsive to support life of microorganisms, microflora, and fauna and thus lose biological functions. Live soil systems are the integrated part of the crop ecosystem to perform major ecological functions, which majorly include nutrient recycling, carbon sequestration, mineralization, availability of organic substances and volatiles. If crop residues are burnt in the farms, they disturb microbiota of the productive top-soil layers on one hand and pollute air quality on the other. With the help of microbial interventions and developing skills among the rural population, the raw residues can be transformed firstly into mushrooms of high nutrition value for nourishing food and subsequently, the spent waste can further be biologically converted into microbe-enriched compost having specific functional trait. The second option for the on-farm utilization of the crop residue is the need-base production of <b>raw</b> <b>compost</b> from the available residual resources. Its further bioconversion and fortification into bioorganic farm inputs with the help of potential microorganisms with multifunction can be of immense importance for the farming communities. One of the major benefits of using bioconversion technology for agrowaste bioconversion is to making feasible the availability of ready-to-use organic input in the soils. Secondly, this can also help to add desired microbial communities with specific functions, which, if added without any support of organic matter, may not flourish in the low-carbon soils. Thirdly, proper availability of bioorganic materials in the soil supports and enhances nutrient use efficiency of the soils and ensures proper availability of micronutrients for longer time durations. Apart from these direct benefits, there are furthermore benefits associated with application of compost and biofortified farm inputs. Presence of beneficial microbial communities in the soils makes their interactions feasible with the roots of the plants and thus, strengthens rhizosphere. This will help in the plant immunization and making crops resistant against pests and diseases and tolerance against abiotic stresses. In an integrated way, these microbe-mediated processes help improve ecological services around the plant roots and support soil fertility.|$|E

However, cellulosic biofuels are not produced at a competitive level yet, {{mainly because of the}} high production costs of the cellulolytic enzymes. Therefore, this study was aimed at discovering new cellulolytic microorganisms and enzymes. Results Different bacteria isolated from <b>raw</b> <b>composting</b> materials obtained from vegetable processing industry wastes were screened for their cellulolytic activity on solid medium containing carboxymethylcellulose. Four strains belonging to the actinomycetes group were {{selected on the basis of}} their phenotypic traits and cellulolytic activity on solid medium containing carboxymethylcellulose. The strain showing the highest cellulolytic activity was identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing as belonging to Streptomyces genus and it was designated as Streptomyces sp. strain G 12. Investigating the enzymes responsible for cellulase activity produced by Streptomyces G 12 by proteomic analyses, two endoglucanases were identified. Gene coding for one of these enzymes, named CelStrep, was cloned and sequenced. Molecular analysis showed that the celstrep gene has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 379 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 37 amino acid residues. Comparison of deduced aminoacidic sequence to the other cellulases indicated that the enzyme CelStrep can be classified as a family 12 glycoside hydrolase. Heterologous recombinant expression of CelStrep was carried out in Escherichia coli, and the active recombinant enzyme was purified from culture supernatant and characterized. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose following a Michaelis–Menten kinetics with a K M of 9. 13 [*]mg/ml and a v max of 3469 [*]μM[*]min - 1. The enzyme exhibits a half life of around 24 [*]h and 96 [*]h at 60 °C and 50 °C, respectively and shows a retention of around 80 % of activity after 96 [*]h at 40 °C.

As available landfill space decreases {{and the cost of}} siting and building new landfill increases, local authorities are struggling to develop alternative means of meeting the {{waste disposal}} challenge. Landfilling is the most widely used method for solid waste disposal in countries with tropical settlement. Landfills have created various environmental problems such as emissions and leachate. The public has become more aware concerning landfill issues such as increasing concern on the groundwater contamination, potential release of toxic gases and odor. A big part of these problems come from organic waste into the solid waste. Municipal solid waste in Malaysia has a large percent of food waste (around 50 - 60 percent) that makes a lot of problems in disposal methods. It has emerged as a potentially viable means by which local governments can reduce the volume of waste entering landfills by diverting the organic fraction. Composting is a biological process, in which the organic matter is biodegraded by microorganisms under controlled conditions of temperature, moisture content, oxygen, PH and the retention time that can be initiated by mixing biodegradable organic matter with bulking agents to enhance the porosity of the mixture. In this study, a composting plant in Malaysia is considered that uses organic waste from the market (market waste). Five tons organic waste per day is received in the plant, and it is treated by the wind <b>raw</b> <b>composting</b> method. After calculating costs and benefits of this method result shows that total quantitative benefit of this plant is not much higher than a total quantitative cost but this result is just for quantitative parameter. This method has a lot of qualitative benefits such as: reducing the amount of municipal solid waste, transportation cost of carrying municipal solid waste to land fill, emissions and leachate of landfill, increasing life span of landfill and reducing land use. Composting organic materials that have been diverted from landfills ultimately avoids the production of methane and leachate formulation in the landfills regarding to 50 percent of organic waste in municipal solid waste of Malaysia. With removing this amount of waste from MSW with using composting method, not only the environmental problems of land filling can be reduced but also the costs of transportation and other costs of disposal can be reduced by 50 %. Because {{of one of the most}} important problems in tropical settlement is to find proper methods to dispose of municipal solid waste toward decreasing pollution, producing compost can be a suitable way but expanding of this treatment method in Malaysia closely related to economic governmental support...|$|R

Methane contributes 20 % annually to increases in global warming, and is explosive at concentrations of 5 - 15 % in air. Landfills contribute 15 % to total methane emissions. This study was conducted to determine the potential decrease in methane production from landfills if organic waste is composted prior to. The quantities and rates of methane production were measured from simulated landfill cells containing <b>composted</b> and <b>raw</b> simulated refuse. The refuse was composted in an open pile and characterized by temperature, pH, ash content and C 02 evolved during aerobic respiration. Assuming a 1 0 % lignin content, the labile carbon fraction was reduced by an estimated 71 % during composting. Over a of six month period, simulated landfill cells filled with raw waste generated 66 M 3 methane per Mg of dry refuse, while cells containing compost produced 31 M 3 methane per Mg of dry compost. Per unit weight of dry <b>raw</b> material, <b>composted</b> waste placed in a landfill produced only 23 % of the methane that was generated from raw refuse...|$|R

Two-phase olive mill waste (TPOMW, “alperujo”) is a highly biotoxic sludge-like effluent of the olive-oil milling process with a huge seasonal production. One of the treatment approaches that has so far received little attention {{is the use of}} TPOMW as substrate for the cultivation of edible mushrooms. Fifteen fungal strains belonging to five species (Basidiomycota), that is,Agrocybe cylindracea, Pleurotus cystidiosus, P. eryngii, P. ostreatus, and P. pulmonarius, were evaluated for their efficacy to colonize media composed of TPOMW, which was used either <b>raw</b> or <b>composted</b> in mixtures with wheat straw in various ratios. Qualified strains exhibited high values of biological efficiency (e. g., 120 – 135 % for Pleurotus spp. and 125 % for A. cylindracea) and productivity in subsequent cultivation experiments on substrates supplemented with 20 – 40 % composted TPOMW or 20 % raw TPOMW. Only when supplementation exceeded 60 % for rawTPOMW, a negative impact was noted onmushroom yields which could be attributed to the effluent’s toxicity (otherwise alleviated in the respective composted TPOMWmedium). Earliness and mushroom size as well as quality parameters such as total phenolic content and antioxidant activity did not demonstrate significant differences versus the control wheat-straw substrate.

The analysis was performed using an ANOVA including a mixed model with nested factors (climate, raw material and publication effect). Tropical composts presented lower carbon, nitrogen, potassium and soluble-carbon contents, and higher electrical conductivity. The results suggest that compost quality in the tropics was affected by weather conditions during composting (e. g. high temperature and rainfall), which induced high losses of carbon and nutrients. For most properties, industrial, sewage sludge and manure-based composts displayed the highest quality under both climates, while the contrary was found for household and municipal solid waste-based composts. The publication effect represented > 50 % of total variance, which was mainly due to the heterogeneity of the composting procedures.

30|$|The {{reason for}} the low {{germination}} index value of in the initial sample and the sample taken at the 20 th day of the composting process {{could be attributed to}} the presence of phytotoxic compounds in the raw wastes and their production in the substrate during the active phase of composting. Phytotoxic compounds, such as; ammonium ions, fatty acids, and low molecular weight phenolic acids are reported to impair seed germination and root elongation (Delgado 2010; Gómez-Brandón et al. 2008). It was also evident from the chemical analysis of the <b>raw</b> material and <b>compost</b> samples of this study that the highest level of ammonium was recorded at the 20 th day of sampling followed by the initial substrate at day 0. The detrimental effect of high levels of ammonium to seed germination and root elongation was reported in many other studies (Tiquia and Tam 1998; Selim et al. 2012 and Guo et al. 2012).|$|R

Solid organic waste of sugar cane is potentially suitable as a <b>compost</b> <b>raw</b> material processed by introducing lingocellulosic-degrading microbes, particularly Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trichoderma pseudokoningii, and Trichoderma sp. The microbes were formulated in a commercial bioactivator product namely SuperDec. The significant results have been obtained on biodegradation of trash composted by using this bioactivator. Compost maturity could be reached in 7 - 21 days of incubation indicated by the reductions of solid organic waste particle size and C/N ratio. Based on selected production component values of this trial, the production cost of trash-originated compost is Rp. 200,-/kg with nutrient value equivalent to Rp. 260,-/kg.

Dynamic batch tests using synthetic nitrate solutions of 100, 500 and 2000  mg NO 3 L− 1 {{were used to}} investigate the substrate performance at increasing nitrate concentrations under optimal conditions. Further to this, sequential batch tests using genuine nitrified landfill leachate with a concentration of 2000  mg NO 3 L− 1 were carried out to evaluate substrates behaviour {{in the presence of}} a complex mixture of chemicals present in leachate. Results showed that complete denitrification occurred in all conditions, indicating that <b>raw</b> and <b>composted</b> CGR and PB can be used as sustainable and efficient media for landfill leachate bio-denitrification. Of the three substrates, raw garden refuse yields the fastest denitrification rate followed by 10 -week composted CGR and PB. However, the efficiency of the raw CGR was lower when using genuine leachate, indicating the inhibitory effect of components of the leachate on the denitrification process. Ten-week composted CGR performed optimally at low nitrate concentrations, while poor nitrate removal ability was found at higher nitrate concentrations (2000  mg L− 1). In contrast, the PB performance was 3. 5 times faster than that of the composted garden refuse at higher nitrate concentrations. Further to this, multi-criteria analysis of the process variables provided an easily implementable framework for the use of waste materials as an alternative and sustainable source of carbon for denitrification...|$|R
