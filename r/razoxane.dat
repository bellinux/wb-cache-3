50|$|Inspired {{research}} {{and a close}} eye for detail led the UK clinician and pharmacologist Kurt Hellmann to discovery of the unique cytostatic, cytoprotective and antimetastatic biological activities of bisdioxopiperazines in his laboratory at ICRF's Cancer Chemotherapy Unit in the early 1970s.These agents were synthesised as derivatives of EDTA by the ICRF chemist Andrew Creighton and their characteristics and chemistry were excellently summarized by Eugene Herman in 1982. Following Karrer, Goldin and Humphreys' description of the Lewis lung (3LL) carcinoma {{as a model for}} metastases Hellmann set up the 3LL as a screen for antimetastatic compounds in 1968. The first compound to be tested in this first antimetastatic drug screen was the cytostatic agent <b>razoxane</b> 159. As serendipity would have it, it showed almost total suppression of metastases without seeming to affect the growth of the primary implant, thus making <b>razoxane</b> the first fully antimetastatic drug.This work was regarded as a major breakthrough when published in a landmark paper in the BMJ in early 1972. This study, by Le Serve & Hellmann clearly showed {{for the first time that}} a drug which 'normalised the tumour-induced pathologic vasculature', in that it blocked intra-tumoural haemorrhage and hence the spread of cancer cells, prevented lethal metastasis.Such an observation pre-dated by many years the current interest in conversion of tumour vasculature to a more normal morphology and function as a therapeutic approach. In the clinical context the orally active <b>Razoxane</b> subsequently was shown to prevent liver metastases in adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer. More recently it has been demonstrated to potentiate certain schedules of chemoradiotherapy and suppress metastasis in soft tissue sarcomas,in part by improvement of oxygen and drug delivery.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Hellmann brought <b>Razoxane</b> to the {{attention}} of Abraham Goldin and Eugene Herman who found this intracellular active chelator to be highly effective in reducing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in all species tested. This led to a rapid NCI-supported clinical development of the parenteral, highly water-soluble pure enantiomer (+) Dexrazoxane 187 by James Speyer (published in 1988/92) and by Sandra Swain (published in 1997/98). These pivotal prospective clinical studies clearly demonstrated effective, long-term cardioprotection by Dexrazoxane preserving the myocardial reserves in breast cancer patients with no additional toxicities and no reduced anticancer activity. Currently Dexrazoxane is the only FDA/EMA approved agent for preventing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity which according to Ewer & Speyer 'must become an essential part of anthracycline-based modern chemotherapy practice' allowing for the optimization of anthracycline-based treatment modalities in adult and pediatric oncology without enhancing second malignancies. This was also shown by Steven Lipshultz et al. in randomised, controlled clinical trials in long-term surviving children and adolescents in pediatric oncology.|$|E
40|$|The {{mutagenic}} {{activity of}} <b>razoxane</b> (ICRF 159) was studied using the Salmonella/microsome assay and rodent bone-marrow micronucleus and metaphase assays. <b>Razoxane</b> (up to 5000 micrograms/plate) {{did not cause}} {{an increase in the}} mutation frequency in the Salmonella/microsome assay. In the mouse micronucleus assay <b>razoxane</b> (200 and 400 mg kg- 1 i. p.) was cytotoxic to the bone marrow cells (which limited the analysis) but an increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in <b>razoxane</b> dosed animals (5 -fold compared to control value). In the Chinese hamster metaphase assay <b>razoxane</b> (up to 500 mg kg- 1 orally) induced abnormal chromosome condensation and an increase in structural chromosome aberrations (7 fold compared to control value) as well as {{an increase in the number}} of polypoid cells (8 -fold compared to control value).

IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED in a series of experiments (Herman et al., 1974, 1979) that the toxicity of the anthracycline daunomycin (DM) can be greatly reduced by the administration of <b>razoxane</b> (RZ, ICRF- 159). Others (Woodman et al., 1975) have found that not only will RZ reduce the toxicity of DM, but it will also enhance its antitumour activity. The mechanism whereby this distinct improvement in the therapeutic ratio ofDM is obtained remains unclear, and it seemed of some interest therefore to define it more accurately...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -The {{combination}} of a single dose of <b>razoxane</b> (ICRF 159) with a single dose of electron radiation has been studied with the murine sarcoma S 180. A drug dose of 30 mg/kg combined with radiation produced a greater tumour response than either agent alone, {{but it was not}} possible to establish whether the effect was more than additive. Direct measurements of tumour and s. c. oxygen concentrations and studies of tumour-cell respiration were carried out after various <b>razoxane</b> treatments in an attempt to elucidate mechanisms of action. There were no indications at the drug dose levels used in the radiation studies of any significant changes in tissue oxygenation or cellular respiration. THE COMBINATION of the drug, <b>razoxane</b> (ICRF 159 (Â±) 1, 2 -di(3, 5 -dioxopiperazin- 1 -yl propane) and irradiation has been uised in several recent clinical studies (e. g.

40|$|Twenty-five {{patients}} with liver metastases, chiefly due to colorectal cancer, {{were given a}} loading dose of <b>razoxane</b> for 3 days before 5 consecutive days of radiotherapy to the whole liver. Patients also took <b>razoxane</b> during the radiotherapy and then for one month afterwards. Liver tumour volume was measured on CT scans using the ELSCINT 3 D soft tissue imaging programme just before and 4 weeks {{after the end of}} radiotherapy treatment. Twelve of the 25 patients had tumour volume reductions of more than 50 %. The overall major response rate therefore is 12 / 25 (48 %). In two of the major responders the liver metastases were due to recurrent stomach cancer. In addition to the 12 responders, four patients had a reduction of more than 20 % but less than 50 %, thus giving an overall response rate of 16 / 25 (64 %). These results can form the basis of a formal, randomized, controlled clinical trial of radiotherapy alone (or any other treatment) compared with radiotherapy and <b>razoxane</b> in the difficult and life threatening condition presented by liver metastases...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{conventional}} vs protected housing, and those {{caused by the}} periodic application of a psychological stressor (rotational stress, spatial disorientation) on mice kept in a protected housing, with spontaneous tumor metastasis have been determined in mice implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma {{as a function of}} tumor inoculum size and response to treatment with cyclophosphamide and <b>razoxane.</b> With a reduced inoculum size, tumor takes do not occur in mice kept in the protected housing, but do occur with spatial disorientation. With a larger inoculum size, tumor takes occur in all untreated mice, and the weight of spontaneous lung metastasis is significantly increased by spatial disorientation. For mice in protected housing, cyclophosphamide results in the absence of macroscopically detectable tumors in all of the treated mice, whereas the use of spatial disorientation abolishes this therapeutic action. The antimetastatic effects of <b>razoxane</b> are also reduced by rotational stress. These results indicate that housing conditions and a psychological stressor can control tumor takes and metastasis formation. They also indicate that host's antitumor resistance effectors, which are susceptible to neuroendocrine modulation by environmental and psychological stressors, participate to determine the effectiveness of the treatment with a cytotoxic (cyclophosphamide) and antimetastatic (<b>razoxane)</b> antitumor drug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Objectives: Little {{is known}} about the {{radiation}} sensitivity of bile duct carcinomas. The current study was undertaken to prospectively assess the objective response rates in bile duct carcinomas treated with radiotherapy and <b>razoxane.</b> Materials and Methods: Twenty-three patients with advanced cancer of the biliary tree were irradiated together with the radiosensitizer <b>razoxane</b> at a dose of 125 mg twice daily by mouth. There were 16 females and 7 males, median age 68 years. They received a total tumor dose of 48 Gy (range 1. 7 â 60) at the ICRU point with single fractions of 1. 7 to 2 Gy. Results: Among the 23 patients, 14 had measurable disease. Objective tumor responses were seen in 4 / 4 gallbladder carcinomas (1 CR, 3 PR), 4 / 5 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (2 CR, 2 PR), and 1 / 5 hepatobiliary cancers (1 PR), leading to an overall response rate of 64 %.

40|$|A {{variety of}} agents can induce predifferentiation growth arrest (PGA) in human keratinocytes; these include {{transforming}} growth factor (TGF-fl 1) and <b>razoxane.</b> We evaluated {{the ability of}} these and other agents to induce the expression of a variety of transcription factor genes including c-los, c-myc, junB, and c-jun. The results show that both TGF-fl 1 and <b>razoxane</b> induce maximal c-jun mRNA expression 4 days after initiation of treatment concurrent with the development of PGA. In contrast, no detectable induction of c-los, c-myc, or junB was observed. Keratinocytes maintained in the presence of TGF-$ 1 for an additional 3 days continued to show high levels of c-jun mRNA, indicating stable induction. <b>Razoxane</b> treatment also induces PGA and high c-jun mRNA levels for 4 days, but thereafter a decay of c-jun expression occurs. Run-off transcription experiments comparing rapidly growing cells with cells treated with TGF-fl 1 for 4 days demonstrated a significant increase in transcriptional activity of the c-jun gene. This result indicates that the increase in c-jun gene expression {{is due in part to}} a change in transcriptional regulation of c-jun. The stable induction of c-jun mRNA in keratinocytes at the PGA state is unique because the induction of this gene is usually transient. The finding that c-los is not coinduced suggests that c-Jun homodimers or other AP- 1 heterodimers may be formed at the PGA state to facilitate the stable induction of c-jun mRNA. This experimental system should therefore serve as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms for the stable control of c-jun gene expression and the control of AP- 1 -dependent gene expression during the process of keratinocyte differentiation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Razoxane</b> (ICRF 159) is a phasespecific {{cytotoxic}} drug. Under {{certain conditions}} it prevents cell division in EMT 6 mouse tumour cells, but allows DNA synthesis to continue at almost the normal rate (Taylor and Bleehen, 1977). The DNA content of cells exposed to 10 jig/ml <b>Razoxane</b> is 4 x that of normal G 1 cells after a 24 h exposure (cell cycle time 12 h) {{and continues to}} increase with drug-exposure time. We have found, however, that if the drug is removed at 24 h, the cells will divide and begin to proliferate. Two hundred cells treated in this way were plated out into Petri dishes at a concentration of 1 cell/dish, immediately after exposure to the drug. The dishes were incubated for 3 weeks at 370 C and then examined for cell colonies. It was found that, of the 10 % of the cells surviving the cytotoxic effects of the drug, 95 % were polyploid, with double the usual complement of DNA present in untreated EMT 6 cells. One of these polyploid cell lines was selected as a representative sample for further investigation and cloned out once more. This was to ensure {{as far as possible}} that the resulting polyploid cell line was derived from a single cell. The DNA contents of the cells were measured by flow cytofluorimetry (FCF). Cells are stained with a fluorescent DNA coupling agent, propidium iodide (Krishan, 1975) which is then measured by passage through a flow cell (Model 4800 A Biophysics Cytofluorograf).

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} the {{chemistry}} of metal complexes with amino acid derivatives and related ligands. The introduction covers background literature on these complexes particularly in relation to their reactions in solution. A number of copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes of the ligand 2 -(2 '-acetoxyethylamino) ethylamine, NH 2 (CH 2) 2) NH(CH 2) 2 OCOCH 3, have been synthesised and characterised by spectroscopic and magnetic measurements. The complexes isolated depend on whether or not the non-complexing base, triethylamine, is added to the reaction mixture, which contains the ligand (L) as the dihydrochloride or dihydrobromide. Hence complexes such as LH 2 [CuBr 4] or CuLBr 2 may be obtained, depending on the conditions. The tetramethylamide of EDTA has been synthesised and its complexes with a number of metal ions (e. g. Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II), Zn(II), Fe(III), Cd(II)) have been isolated. In these complexes the ligand is either a tetradentate 2 N, 2 O donor or a hexadentate 2 N, 4 O donor. The metal ion promoted hydrolysis of diimides of EDTA and related compound are also described. In particular the hydrolysis of 1, 2 -bis(3, 5 -dioxopiperazin- 1 -yl) propane in the presence of copper(II) has been investigated in detail. This compound is anticancer drug, <b>razoxane,</b> and its activity {{is due to the fact}} that it is metabolised in vivo to a chelating agent which interferes with metalloenzymes necessary for the growth of tumour cells.

40|$|Purpose. Relatively few {{results are}} {{available}} in the literature about the radiation response of unresectable sarcomas in relation to their histology. Therefore, an attempt was made to summarize the present situation. Materials and methods. This report is based on {{a review of the literature}} and the authorâs own experience. Adult-type soft tissue sarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and chordomas were analyzed. Radioresponse was mainly associated with the degree of tumor shrinkage, that is, objective responses. Histopathologic responses, that is, the degree of necrosis, are only discussed in relation to radiation treatment reports of soft tissue sarcomas as a group. Results. Radiation therapy alone leads to major responses in about 50 % of lipo-, fibro-, leiomyo-, or chondrosarcomas. The response rate is less than 50 % in malignant fibrous histiocytomas, synovial, neurogenic, and other rare soft tissue sarcomas. The response rates may increase up to 75 % through the addition of radiosensitizers such as halogenated pyrimidines or <b>razoxane,</b> or by the use of high-LET irradiation. Angiosarcomas become clearly more responsive if biologicals, angiomodulating, and/or tubulin affinic substances are given together with radiation therapy. <b>Razoxane</b> is able to increase the duration and quality of responses even in difficult-to-treat tumors like chondrosarcomas or chordomas. Conclusions. The available data demonstrate that the radioresponsiveness of sarcomas is very variable and dependent on histology, kind of radiation, and various concomitantly given drugs. The rate of complete sustained remissions by radiation therapy alone or in combination with drugs is still far from satisfactory although progress has been made through the use of sensitizing agents.

40|$|Abstract. Background: The {{treatment}} options in advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are limited. In a pilot study, an anti-metastatic and radiosensitizing treatment concept was explored. Patients and Methods: Twenty-one patients with unresectable and/or oligometastatic STS received the drugs <b>razoxane</b> and vindesine supported by radiotherapy and surgery. Long-term treatment was intended in metastatic disease. Forty-one patients with comparable stages of STS treated with contemporary chemotherapy served as non-randomised controls.

40|$|Rapidly growing {{normal human}} {{neonatal}} prokeratinocytes (HPK) cultured in serum-free medium can be induced to undergo either reversible or irreversible growth arrest at distinct cell cycle states. Reversible G 1 arrest was induced by culture of low-density cells in human lymphocyte conditioned medium, by culture in high-density stationary phase conditioned medium, and by culture in isoleucine-deficient medium. Irreversible arrest of HPK growth predominantly in G 1 was induced by culture in growth factor-deficient medium. Irreversible arrest of HPK growth in G 1 and G 2 was also induced by culture in suspension in methylcellulose prepared in complete MCDB 153 medium or by culture in serum-containing medium. Finally, the drug <b>razoxane</b> {{was employed to}} induce irreversible arrest of HPK in G 2. These data establish that there are 2 distinct classes of growth arrest states for HPK and suggest that each arrest mechanism may serve a unique role in the control of keratinocyte differentiation in normal cells.

40|$|Probimane (Pro), an {{anti-cancer}} agent first synthesized in China, is a bisdioxopiperazine derivative. Its parent compound <b>Razoxane</b> (ICRF- 159, Raz), {{was developed in}} the UK and targets neoplasmic metastases in particular. We have discovered that in addition to the inhibition of metastasis, Pro and Raz have different anti-proliferative effects on tumor cells grown in vitro. This finding merits further investigation. In the present study, we have compared Pro and Raz in terms of the relationship between their anti-proliferative effects on tumor cells and their inhibition of hypotonic hemolysis and Calmodulin (CaM) action. We found that Pro decreases red cell lysis by hypotonic saline and inhibits the activity of CaM activated Ca++-Mg++-ATPase in a dose-dependent manner. The differences of anti-proliferative, antihemolytic and anti-CaM effects between Pro and Raz were parallel. Therefore, we propose that the anti-proliferative effects of Pro might operate through CaM inhibition and membrane protection, possibly sialic acid-mediated. Experiments on the effects of these drugs on the dynamics (substrate and time dependence) of red cell membrane CaM-activated Ca++-Mg++-ATPase lead to a new model for their anticancer effects: Pro might be a competitive antagonist of CaM affecting the substrate-product balance of one type of CaM-targeted enzymes-Ca++-Mg++-ATPases...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} single doses of ICRF 159 (<b>Razoxane)</b> on the cell-cycle {{kinetics}} of lines of BKH 21 S cells in vitro were studied {{by means of}} flow micro-fluorometry (FMF). A characteristic accumulation of cells in the 4 n DNA region after 6 h {{in the presence of}} ICRF 159 was evident in cells which were sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the agents, as judged by colony-forming assays. The subsequent accumulation of 8 n cells as the major population within 24 h indicates that this 6 h effect is associated with the induction of tetraploidy through abnormal mitosis, rather than reflecting a G 2 block of potential value in combination therapy. In ICRF 159 -resistant sublines, the cell-cycle distributions were similarly affected, but only the doses of the drug high enough to reduce their surviving fraction. Somatic cell hybrids from crosses between sensitive and resistant cells demonstrated intermediate responses in ICRF 159, both in terms of cell-cycle kinetics and impairment of reproductive integrity. These data suggest a relationship between the 2 manifestations of the cellular action of ICRF 159, and also a possible predictive role for FMF in the assessment of response to this particular agent...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Probimane (Pro), an {{anti-cancer}} agent originating in China, {{was derived from}} <b>razoxane</b> (ICRF- 159, Raz), a drug created in Britain, specifically targeting at cancer metastasis and as a cardioprotectant of anthrocyclines. Pro and Raz are bisdioxopiperazine compounds. In this work, we evaluated the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of Pro and Raz in vivo against two lung tumor models, one of murine origin (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and one of human origin (LAX- 83). Results After determining the lethal dosage of Pro and Raz, we assessed and compared the inhibitory effects of Pro and Raz against primary tumor growth and metastatic occurrences of LLC at the dosage of LD 5. Pro and Raz were active against primary tumor growth and significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of LLC at same dose-ranges (inhibitory rates > 90 %). Both Raz and Pro were effective in 1, 5, and 9 day administration schedules. Three different schedules of Raz and Pro were effective against the primary tumor growth of LLC (35 â 50 %). The synergistic anticancer effect of Raz with bleomycin (Ble) (from 41. 3 % to 73. 3 %) was more obvious than those with daunorubicin (Dau) (from 33. 1 % to 56. 3 %) in the LLC tumor model. Pro was also seen to have synergistic anti-cancer effects with Ble in the LLC model. Both Raz and Pro inhibited the growth of LAX 83 in a statistically significant manner. Conclusions These data suggest that both Raz and Pro may have anti-tumor potentiality and Raz and Pro have combinative effects with Ble or Dau. The potential targets of bisdioxopiperazines may include lung cancers, especially on tumor metastasis.

40|$|Abstract Background Anticancer bisdioxopiperazines, {{including}} ICRF- 154, <b>razoxane</b> (Raz, ICRF- 159) and ICRF- 193, are {{a family}} of anticancer agents developed in the UK, especially targeting metastases of neoplasms. Two other bisdioxopiperazine derivatives, probimane (Pro) and MST- 16, were synthesized at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Cytotoxic activities and mechanisms of Raz (+) -steroisomer (ICRF- 187, dexrazoxane), Pro and MST- 16 against tumor cells were evaluated by MTT colorimetry, flow cytometry and karyotyping. Results Pro was cytotoxic to human tumor cell lines in vitro (IC 50 50 values 50 against HeLa cell line of vincristine (VCR, 4. 56 Î¼M), doxorubicin (Dox, 1. 12 Î¼M) and 5 -fluoruouracil (5 -Fu, 0. 232 Î¼M) are lower than Pro (5. 12 Î¼M), ICRF- 187 (129 Î¼M) and MST- 16 (26. 4 Î¼M), VCR, Dox and 5 -Fu shows a low dose-related â high cytotoxic activity. Time-response studies showed that the cytotoxic effects of Pro are increased for 3 days in human tumor cells, whereas VCR, Dox and 5 -Fu showed decreased cytotoxic action after 24 h. Cell cycle G 2 /M phase arrest and chromosome segregation blocking by Pro and MST- 16 were noted. Although there was similar effects of Pro and MST- 16 on chromosome segregation blocking action and cell cycle G 2 /M phase arrest at 1 - 4 Î¼M, cytotoxicity of Pro against tumor cells was {{higher than that of}} MST- 16 in vitro by a factor of 3 - 10 folds. Our data show that Pro may be more effective against lung cancer and leukemia while ICRF- 187 and MST- 16 shows similar IC 50 values only against leukemia. Conclusion It suggests that Pro has a wider spectrum of cytotoxic effects against human tumor cells than other bisdioxopiperazines, especially against solid tumors, and with a single cytotoxic pathway of Pro and MST- 16 affecting chromosome segregation and leading also to cell G 2 / M phase arrests, which finally reduces cell division rates. Pro may be more potent than MST- 16 in cytotoxicity. High dose- and time- responses of Pro, when compared with VCR, 5 -Fu and Dox, were seen that suggest a selectivity of Pro against tumor growth. Compounds of bisdioxopiperazines family may keep up their cytotoxic effects longer than many other anticancer drugs. </p...|$|E
