50|$|Radial force {{variation}} or <b>road</b> <b>force</b> variation (RFV) is {{a property}} of a tire that affects steering, traction, braking and load support. High values of RFV {{for a given}} tire reflect {{a high level of}} manufacturing variations in the tire structure that will impart ride disturbances into the vehicle in the vertical direction. RFV is measured according to processes specified by the ASTM International in ASTM F1806 - Standard Practice for Tire Testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{tire tread}} and {{sidewall}} elements undergo deformation and recovery {{as they enter}} and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity. Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV) and tangential force variation. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process as a quality check. In the late 1990s, Hunter Engineering introduced the GSP9700 <b>Road</b> <b>Force</b> balancer, which is equipped with a load roller similar to the force variation machine used at the factory to grade tire uniformity. This machine can find the best position for the tire on a given wheel so that the over-all assembly is as round as possible.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} suspension system and its lower arm. These analyses were specifically applied on lower suspension arm to determine its vibration and stress behaviour during its operation. The suspension system {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The main objectives are to have less stress on lower suspension arm system as well as to reduce imposed load by optimization. The optimization of imposed load on lower suspension arm system is directly related to imposed force on the vehicle created by the road. This load has a direct effect on the value of imposed force on lower arm, where the lower arm force will be minimized by reducing the applied load. Hence, genetic algorithms for optimization and MATLAB optimization toolbar are used, as well as, specific M-file codes have been developed into MATLAB for optimization. By determining optimized design values of suspension system for reducing <b>road</b> <b>force,</b> it is possible to survey vibration condition of lower arm according to frequency respond of suspension system and its natural frequency. Therefore, frequency response of its acceleration has been determined according to the whole mass of suspension system. Using FFT technique and making transfer function for frequency response of suspension system, will present responded frequency of suspension system which is using for vibration analysis. For stress analysis, load condition of lower suspension arm system must be determined in advance. Hence, a typical model of McPherson suspension system has been selected for analysis. According to the road profile considered for analysis and the velocity of vehicle, it is possible to obtain both velocity and acceleration equations for whole components of McPherson suspension system. These values are used to determine dynamic force condition of lower arm suspension system during its operation. By using dynamic forces which are governing on lower arm of suspension system, in ABAQUS, the stress condition of lower arm can be determined during its operation...|$|E
40|$|We {{comparatively}} {{assess the}} influence of adaptive cruise control (ACC) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems on highway traffic behaviors. The primary goal is to study the design and implementation of vehicle-vehicle/roadside-vehicle communication, which enhances an ACC system to a CACC one. In addition, the impact of market penetration of ACC/CACC vehicles and controller aggression are also evaluated. Two simulation works are presented. The microscopic work simulates a single ACC/CACC vehicle using MATLAB/SIMULINK. A cut-in scenario and a braking scenario are tested. Vehicle-vehicle communication saves control effort in the former scenario, while shows little effect in the latter. In the macroscopic work we simulate ACC/CACC controlled highway merging with SHIFT language. The results show beneficial effects of communication in terms of braking effort, average velocity, waiting-to-merge queue length, and main lane traffic shock wave caused by merging. The higher the market penetration of controlled vehicles the better the system performs. The aggressiveness of controller has mixed influence, which provides a tradeoff between efficiency and safety. We study the wireless communication among highway vehicles. A vehicle- vehicle Location-Based Broadcast (LBB) communication protocol is designed to meet highway safety applications' communication requirements. The analytical expressions {{of the performance of}} the protocol in terms of probability of transmission failure and channel occupancy are derived with commonly satisfied assumptions. The optimal relation between the performance and design parameters is obtained from the expressions. The sensitivity of the protocol performance is tested for various communication conditions as well as highway traffic conditions. Feasible combinations of the communication and highway traffic parameters are found for certain requirements on protocol performance. The analysis is conducted in accordance to the communication condition in the newly-assigned 5. 9 GHz Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) spectrum. More experiments are done to find out the factors that influence the slip measurements in order to refine our results of friction coefficient estimation. To obtain the circumferential velocity of the wheel, the exact tire radius is needed. The change in the spring constant based on tire air pressure is obtained, and also the increase in tire radius due to the faster velocity is considered. The normal force applied on each wheel due to the vehicle pitch motion resulting from acceleration and deceleration is also estimated using static vehicle model. Brake torque sensor and accelerometer are used to find the normal force. Using the estimated normal force and <b>road</b> <b>force,</b> the tire-road friction coefficient is obtained. The characteristics of the friction coefficient and slip curve are studied on different road conditions with the refined slip measurements. An originally proposed slip-based controller does not seem to work very well in an practical situation due to actuator time delay. However, experimental results show that the existing nonlinear controller with the limited slip assumption shows good performance even in an emergency braking situation. Therefore, instead of using different control algorithm, this research focuses on the control strategies dedicated to emergency situation for the platoon. In order to integrate the benefits from the communication and friction coefficient estimation technique, a safe control strategy is considered in the situation when the platoon of vehicles needs to decelerate rapidly. It is assumed that we have the knowledge of friction coefficients between road and tire and our vehicles are equipped with proper communication methods. Then, the theoretical bounds for the reference trajectory accelerations are calculated that do not cause the actuator saturation using linear vehicle and controller model. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of regular road {{undulations}} on the dynamics of a cornering motorcycle is presented. This work is based on an enhanced version of the motorcycle model described in "A Motorcycle Model for Stability and Control Analysis" (R. S. Sharp and D. J. N. Limebeer, 2001, Multibody Syst. Dyn., Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 123 - 142). We make use of root-locus and frequency response plots that were derived from a linearized version of this model; the linearization is for small perturbations from a general steady-cornering equilibrium state. The root-locus plots provide information about the damping and resonant frequencies of the key motorcycle modes at different machine speeds, while the frequency response plots are used to study the propagation of <b>road</b> <b>forcing</b> signals to the motorcycle steering system. Our results are {{based on the assumption that}} there is <b>road</b> <b>forcing</b> associated with both wheels and that there is a time delay between the front and rear wheel forcing signals - this is sometimes referred to as wheelbase filtering. As has been explained before, control systems are used in the nonlinear simulation code to establish and maintain the machine's speed and roll angle at preset values (for flat road running). These controllers are used to find the machine's equilibrium state and not to emulate a rider's control actions. The results show that at various critical cornering conditions, regular road undulations of a particular wavelength can cause severe steering oscillations. At low speeds the machine is susceptible to <b>road</b> <b>forcing</b> signals that excite the lightly damped wobble and front suspension pitch modes. At higher speeds it is the weave and front wheel hop modes that become vulnerable to <b>road</b> <b>forcing.</b> We believe that the results and theory presented here explain many of the stability related road accidents that have been reported in the popular literature and are therefore of practical import. The models used in this research make use of the multibody modelling package AUTOSIM (Autosim 2. 5 + Reference Manual, 1998, Mechanical Simulation Corporation) and are available at the web site [URL] The motorcycle and tire parameters can be found at the end of the code...|$|R
