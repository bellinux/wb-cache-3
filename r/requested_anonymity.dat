40|$|ABSTRACT INTEGRATING CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND BEST MUSEUM PRACTICES AT TWO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MUSEUMS: THE PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY AND THE KARUK PEOPLE???S CENTER by ?? H??l??ne Rouvier 2010 Master of Arts in Anthropology Museum Studies Option California State University, Chico Fall 2010 Contemporary {{museums are}} at a crossroads. Challenged by {{internal}} and external critiques, they are struggling to reinvent themselves and to remain relevant in a sociopolitical context of resource depletion, global conflict, and issues of human and civil rights. Issues {{of social and economic}} justice, and their accompanying legal mandates, are fueling demands of indigenous and source communities to be part of museum decisionmaking and discourse. This thesis focuses a lens on two museum experiences within the theoretical framework of museums as ???contested arenas??? in which cultures come into contact, collide, and negotiate difference. Such ???arenas??? or forums function as ???borderlands??? where the agency of subjugated knowledges and peoples are acknowledged, and where the figurative ???peripheries??? of the underrepresented help to redefine the ???center??? of the dominant cultural paradigms. Two museums were researched within this framework, using the hypothesis that both would demonstrate this collision of contesting voices, and would also be participating in a process of negotiation and shifting paradigms. Both museums house Native American collections, both facilities are in Northern California. They are dissimilar in other areas. The Phoebe Hearst Museum is a large, established university museum in the urban San Francisco Bay area; the Karuk People???s Center is a smaller, and a younger tribal museum in a remote region of Siskiyou County. Research was limited to collections management ??? in particular the incorporation of culturally sensitive protocols into standard ???best museum practices. ??? Surveys in both settings provided both quantitative and qualitative data; follow up interviews were completed with those interested. Participation was voluntary and respondents could <b>request</b> <b>anonymity.</b> The Phoebe Hearst survey was designed both as community outreach and to gather information for internal procedural review ??? it was provided to over 200 tribal and mainstream museums, and to source communities. A similar survey was given to interested Karuk community members. Two case studies are not representative of either mainstream or tribal museums, but their unique experiences reflected the disconnect that continues in the museum world. While {{this study was designed to}} document an ???arena??? (however contested and uncomfortable) where communities converse, what exists is more xi boundary than borderland. Collections management at the Karuk People???s Center is negotiating traditional and science-based stewardship, the result of recruiting museum professionals trained in ???best museum practices??? but also willing to challenge entrenched assumptions and the status quo. The Phoebe Hearst has incorporated traditional protocols as requested during tribal visits (most often for repatriation documentation and consultation), but there is little evidence of ongoing positive dialogue with native communities. My research reinforces the need for creating spaces for these conversations, benefiting both tribal and mainstream museum communities. Reinventing museum practices will require vision, leadership, and resources. Museums must put their words into action to build the ???contested arenas??? that will build the partnerships needed for museums to matter for future generations. CSU, Chic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. We researched the former secret Apartheid-chemical {{and biological weapons}} programme - code name 'Project Coast' - {{in order to understand}} how it has and has not been treated as an issue of concern by professional organisations and diplomatic proceedings. As background, through the endeavours of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), an extensive legal trial, and various other investigations, the activities of the programme have become treated as emblematic of the perversities of a former time. And yet, each attempt to determine and remember what took place has been structured and delimited by the very investigations that enabled it. In short, our research has asked how the history of Project Coast is situated between revelation and concealment, remembering and forgetting, and the past and the future. We undertook 18 interviews with 20 interviewees from government, civil society, professional associations and elsewhere to explore these issues. In 2 cases interviewees asked for no recording to be made of the interview and in 5 cases for the transcripts not to be deposited. In 1 case where an interviewee <b>requested</b> full <b>anonymity,</b> we determined it was not feasible to protect his identity if a transcript of the interview was deposited given his unique organisational role. The archive includes transcripts of the other 10 interviews. Project description: It is well established that policy agendas define and construct what counts as a concern (Majone 1989). Yet, what remains outside of professional and policy agendas is equally an issue of importance. 'Strategic surprise', for example, is a recurring hazard for those attending to the security implications of science and technology. Yet, why and how some topics are ignored are questions amenable to social sciences and humanities inquiry. This project seeks empirically and theoretically to assess what is *not* taking place in relation to the analysis of the implications of science for security. It will study what is not taking place in different case studies related to the potential for life science knowledge and techniques to serve destructive purposes. Through doing so, the project will consider how such cases can inform other studies of emerging areas of concern and how they can inform empirical social research in general. A number of questions that address themes of ethical blindness, taken for granted assumptions, and the social basis of assessments will be central to this project, including: * How, for who, between whom, and under what circumstances have some applications of science become rendered non-issues? * What are the everyday routines, practices, social structures that shape this process? * How have scientists, diplomats, security analysts, and others fostered attention to or distanced themselves from applications of their work? In relation to Global Uncertainties Programme's goals, this project asks how a diverse range of expertise can be brought together in a systematic fashion to address practical dilemmas associated with openness and collaboration in science. Consideration will be given to how perceptions of and its implications for defence and security vary across professional communities, regulatory regimes, and national contexts. The specific concern with the hostile application of the life sciences examined through the interdisciplinary programme of inquiry outlined in this application will serve as a springboard for addressing what is left outside professional and policy agendas. The ultimate impact anticipated from this project [...] as also demonstrated by the activities set out in the 'Pathways to Impact' section [...] is to support efforts to prevent the malign use of life sciences and, thus, ensuring work to improve human security.

40|$|Smartphones, {{loaded with}} users’ {{personal}} information, are a primary computing device for many. Advent of 4 G networks, IPV 6 and {{increased number of}} subscribers to these has triggered a host of application developers to develop softwares {{that are easy to}} install on the mobile devices. During the application download process, users accept the terms and conditions that permit revelation of private information. The free application markets are sustainable as the revenue model for most of these service providers is through profiling of users and pushing advertisements to the users. This creates a serious threat to users privacy and hence it is important that “privacy protection mechanisms” should be in place to protect the users’ privacy. Most of the existing solutions falsify or modify the information in the service request and starve the developers of their revenue. In this dissertation, we attempt to bridge the gap by proposing a novel integrated CLOPRO framework (Context Cloaking Privacy Protection) that achieves Identity privacy, Context privacy and Query privacy without depriving the service provider of sustainable revenue made from the CAPPA (Context Aware Privacy Preserving Advertising). Each service request has three parameters: identity, context and actual query. The CLOPRO framework reduces the risk of an adversary linking all of the three parameters. The main objective is to ensure that no single entity in the system has all the information about the user, the queries or the link between them, even though the user gets the desired service in a viable time frame. The proposed comprehensive framework for privacy protecting, does not require the user to use a modified OS or the service provider to modify the way an application developer designs and deploys the application {{and at the same time}} protecting the revenue model of the service provider. The system consists of two non-colluding servers, one to process the location coordinates (Location server) and the other to process the original query (Query server). This approach makes several inherent algorithmic and research contributions. First, we have proposed a formal definition of privacy and the attack. We identified and formalized that the privacy is protected if the transformation functions used are non-invertible. Second, we propose use of clustering of every component of the service <b>request</b> to provide <b>anonymity</b> to the user. We use a unique encrypted identity for every service request and a unique id for each cluster of users that ensures Identity privacy. We have designed a Split Clustering Anonymization Algorithms (SCAA) that consists of two algorithms Location Anonymization Algorithm (LAA) and Query Anonymization Algorithm (QAA). The application of LAA replaces the actual location for the users in the cluster with the centroid of the location coordinates of all users in that cluster to achieve Location privacy. The time of initiation of the query is not a part of the message string to the service provider although it is used for identifying the timed out requests. Thus, Context privacy is achieved. To ensure the Query privacy, the generic queries (created using QAA) are used that cover the set of possible queries, based on the feature variations between the queries. The proposed CLOPRO framework associates the ads/coupons relevant to the generic query and the location of the users and they are sent to the user along with the result without revealing the actual user, the initiation time of query or the location and the query, of the user to the service provider. Lastly, we introduce the use of caching in query processing to improve the response time in case of repetitive queries. The Query processing server caches the query result. We have used multiple approaches to prove that privacy is preserved in CLOPRO system. We have demonstrated using the properties of the transformation functions and also using graph theoretic approaches that the user’s Identity, Context and Query is protected against the curious but honest adversary attack, fake query and also replay attacks with the use of CLOPRO framework. The proposed system not only provides 2 ̆ 7 k 2 ̆ 7 anonymity, but also satisfies the 3 ̆c k; s 3 ̆e and 3 ̆c k; T 3 ̆e anonymity properties required for privacy protection. The complexity of our proposed algorithm is O(n) ...|$|R
