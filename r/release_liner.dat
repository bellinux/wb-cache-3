It {{consists}} of one song lasting 46 minutes in its stereo mix and 42 minutes in its surround sound mix. The <b>release’s</b> <b>liner</b> notes state that the piece is an exploration of band leader Greg Jarvis’s synesthesia and was conceived {{as a piece of}} absolute music (music with no specific subject matter). It consists of rehearsed improvisations performed with-in a 12 part fixed song structure, recorded in one take {{at the end of a}} 9000 km tour. In a 2010 interview with Spinner, Jarvis said that “O” was also designed to explore music’s unique capabilities as an art form that unfolds over time.|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, Shire and Noven Pharmaceuticals, {{manufacturers}} of the Daytrana ADHD patch, announced a voluntary recall of several lots of the patch due to problems with separating the patch from its protective <b>release</b> <b>liner.</b> [...] Since then, no further problems {{with either the}} patch or its protective packaging have been reported.|$|E
50|$|The tape {{consists}} of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material such as paper, plastic film, cloth, or metal foil. Some have a removable <b>release</b> <b>liner</b> which protects the adhesive until the liner is removed. Some have layers of adhesives, primers, easy release materials, filaments, printing, etc. made for specific functions.|$|E
5000|$|The vinyl cutter uses a small {{knife to}} {{precisely}} cut {{the outline of}} figures into a sheet or piece of vinyl, but not the <b>release</b> <b>liner.</b> The knife moves side to side and turns, while the vinyl is moved beneath the knife. The results from the cut process is an image cut into the material.|$|E
5000|$|To {{allow for}} the winding and {{unwinding}} of the tape, the backing is coated with a release agent that somewhat prevents the tape from sticking to itself or the sticking of two adhesive layers (double-sided tapes). This is accomplished by using a material that enables the easy removal of favorable interactions at the adhesive-backing or adhesive-adhesive interface, or by making both surfaces immiscible in one another. Two common materials used in polyacrylate-based adhesive tapes are fluorosilicones [...] and vinyl carbamates. Fluorosilicones are immiscible with the polyacrylates-based adhesive [...] whereas the long tails of vinyl carbamates form a high crystalline structure that the adhesive cannot penetrate. Furthermore, during peeling fluorosilicone <b>release</b> <b>liners</b> make no noise [...] whereas vinyl carbamates make loud noises.|$|R
500|$|Crystal Ball (1998), a box set {{featuring}} Prince's twentieth and twenty-first studio albums, {{was originally}} announced in 1987, but delayed due to contract issues with Warner Bros.

50|$|The {{material}} is then 'weeded' where the excess {{parts of the}} figures are removed from the <b>release</b> <b>liner.</b> It is possible to remove the positive parts, which would give a negative sticker, or remove the negative parts, giving a positive sticker. Removing the figure would be like removing the positive, giving a negative image of the figures.|$|E
50|$|A {{sheet of}} {{transfer}} tape with an adhesive backing is {{laid on the}} weeded vinyl. A roller {{is applied to the}} tape, causing to to adhere to the vinyl. The transfer tape and the weeded vinyl is pulled off the <b>release</b> <b>liner,</b> and applied to a substrate, such as a sheet of aluminum. This results in an aluminum sign with vinyl figures.|$|E
50|$|A typical PSA tape {{consists}} of a pressure sensitive adhesive (the sticky part of the tape) coated to a backing material. To prevent the adhesive from sticking to the backing when wound in a roll, a release agent {{is applied to the}} backing or a <b>release</b> <b>liner</b> is placed on the adhesive. Sometimes a primer is coated between the adhesive and backing increasing the bond.|$|E

In the Japanese <b>release's</b> <b>liner</b> notes, critic Mia Clarke described the slow ballad [...] "Off You" [...] as having a lackadaisical feel; Pitchfork Medias Will Bryant {{was struck by the}} song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the Pink Floyd album The Wall. Rolling Stones Arion Berger said [...] "Off You" [...] is [...] "as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty-five-year-old blues recording, and Kim, her voice clear and full of hope, can't help sounding like a young woman who's lived ten awful lifetimes." ...|$|R
