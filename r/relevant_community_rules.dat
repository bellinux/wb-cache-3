Some suspect that the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> is the original text that was later altered to become the Damascus Document, others that the Damascus Document was redacted to become the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule,</b> a third group argues that the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> was created as a utopian ideal rather than a practical replacement for the Damascus Document, and still others that believe the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> and Damascus Document were written for different types of communities, one enclosed and the other open.|$|R

40|$|Community-based {{question}} answering platforms can be rich {{sources of information}} {{on a variety of}} specialized topics, from finance to cooking. The usefulness of such platforms depends heavily on user contributions (questions and answers), but also on respecting the <b>community</b> <b>rules.</b> As a crowd-sourced service, such platforms rely on their users for monitoring and flagging content that violates <b>community</b> <b>rules.</b> Common wisdom is to eliminate the users who receive many flags. Our analysis of a year of traces from a mature Q&A site shows that the number of flags does not tell the full story: on one hand, users with many flags may still contribute positively to the community. On the other hand, users who never get flagged are found to violate <b>community</b> <b>rules</b> and get their accounts suspended. This analysis, however, also shows that abusive users are betrayed by their network properties: we find strong evidence of homophilous behavior and use this finding to detect abusive users who go under the community radar. Based on our empirical observations, we build a classifier that is able to detect abusive users with an accuracy as high as 83 %.

40|$|We {{provide the}} first social choice theory {{approach}} {{to the question of}} what constitutes a community in a social network. Inspired by the classic preferences models in social choice theory, we start from an abstract social network framework, called preference networks; these consist of a finite set of members where each member has a total-ranking preference of all members in the set. Within this framework, we develop two complementary approaches to axiomatically study the formation and structures of communities. (1) We apply social choice theory and define communities indirectly by postulating that they are fixed points of a preference aggregation function obeying certain desirable axioms. (2) We directly postulate desirable axioms for communities without reference to preference aggregation, leading to eight natural community axioms. These approaches allow us to formulate and analyze <b>community</b> <b>rules.</b> We prove a taxonomy theorem that provides a structural characterization of the family of <b>community</b> <b>rules</b> that satisfies all eight axioms. The structure is actually quite beautiful: these <b>community</b> <b>rules</b> form a bounded lattice under the natural intersection and union operations. Our structural theorem is complemented with a complexity result: while identifying a community by the most selective rule of the lattice is in P, deciding if a subset is a community by the most comprehensive rule of the lattice is coNP-complete. Our studies also shed light on the limitations of defining <b>community</b> <b>rules</b> solely based on preference aggregation: any aggregation function satisfying Arrow's IIA axiom, or based on commonly used aggregation schemes like the Borda count or generalizations thereof, lead to communities which violate at least one of our community axioms. Finally, we give a polynomial-time rule consistent with seven axioms and weakly satisfying the eighth axiom. Comment: 39 page...|$|R
