40|$|The {{improvement}} of capital {{construction in the}} USSR is of great national economic significance and goes far beyond {{the framework of the}} construction industry. The explanation is â first â that capital construction is the means of the expanded reproduction of fixed capital that determines the growth of the nation's production potential, the increase in the volume of output, and the greater degree of satisfaction of the social and personal requirements of the Soviet people. Second, the growth of capital construction requires more and more material, labor, and financial resources. The accumulated part of national income is the main source of capital investments. Part of the capital investments are financed by the <b>replacement</b> <b>fund.</b> They are recouped after the greater or lesser period of time required for capital investment planning, project planning, construction, and the start-up of new capacities. Third, the growing scale of construction and its enormous significance in the stage of developed socialism and {{in the creation of the}} material and technological foundation of communist society more and more urgently raise the question of increasing the effectiveness of capital investments. ...|$|E
40|$|The Sharpe {{ratio is}} widely used as a {{performance}} evaluation measure for traditional (i. e., long only) investment funds as well as less-conventional funds such as hedge funds. Based on mean-variance theory, the Sharpe ratio only considers the first two moments of return distributions, so hedge funds – characterised by asymmetric, highly-skewed returns with non-negligible higher moments – may be misdiagnosed in terms of performance. The Sharpe ratio is also susceptible to manipulation and estimation error. These drawbacks have demonstrated the need for augmented measures, or, in some cases, <b>replacement</b> <b>fund</b> performance metrics. Over the period January 2000 to December 2011 the monthly returns of 184 international long/short (equity) hedge funds with geographical investment mandates spanning North America, Europe, and Asia were examined.
