The experiment results show that: the nitriding layer consist mainly of Fe 2 N and Fe 3 N, the layer thickness is 85 ± 5 to 165 ± 15 μm and the cross-section microhardness of the layer is 650 - 1023 HV after treated 10 min at 220 V.

The model comprises three interconnected components: the gas furnace, the distillation column and the rectifier. The furnace is modeled like a well-stirred single volume. The distillation column and the rectifier are discretized along their axial dimension. Several heat transfer mechanisms are simultaneously solved: radiative and convective heat transfer between combustion products and generator finned surface, flow boiling and pool boiling in the two-phase <b>ammonia</b> <b>water</b> mixture inside the distillation column. The model is applied to operating conditions of interest in real applications.
