40|$|Impaired route {{learning}} is a common consequence of acquired brain injury (ABI) but has received little attention in the research literature. Errorless learning may be a method of facilitating the learning of routes but this is unclear as previous studies of errorless learning have focused mainly on verbal skills and the only previous study involving route learning was based upon a pencil and paper task. In the present study we therefore use virtual reality to explore the benefits of errorless learning for routes in an ecologically valid task. Twenty people with acquired brain injury learned two routes, of equivalent difficulty, around a virtual town based upon the city of Nice. For one <b>route,</b> full <b>guidance</b> was provided throughout the learning trials in an errorless learning paradigm; the other route was learned using a procedure that allowed for trial and error.

40|$|In {{augmented}} reality, virtual {{objects are}} presented {{as if they were}} a part of the real world. In mobile audio augmented reality, sounds presented with headphones are perceived as if they originated from the surrounding environment. This thesis investigates potential applications of mobile audio augmented reality and different methods that are needed in these applications. The two main topics studied are distance presentation and spatial audio guidance. Reverberation is known to be an important factor affecting the perceived distance of sound sources. Here, a practical method for modifying the perceived distance of virtual sound sources is investigated, where the temporal envelopes of binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) are modified. In a listening test, speech sources were presented using these modified BRIRs. The results show that the perceived distance is controlled most effectively by modifying an early-to-late energy ratio with the first 50 – 100 ms of the BRIR included in the early energy. Presenting large distances in an audio augmented reality environment is difficult, since people underestimate the distances of distant sound sources and very distant sound sources cannot even be heard. In a user study, the presentation of points of interest (POIs) outdoors using auditory distance cues was compared with a voice saying the distance in meters. The results suggest that distances should be given in meters if fairly accurate distance estimates are needed without prior training. With training, however, the user study participants were able to estimate the distances of the POIs fairly accurately based on the provided auditory distance cues, performing the task faster than when the distances were presented in meters. In addition to the presentation of POIs, another type of spatial audio guidance is investigated: using spatialized music to guide pedestrians and cyclists to their destination. Two forms of <b>guidance,</b> <b>route</b> and beacon <b>guidance,</b> were tested in different environments. The user studies showed that music guidance is a pleasant and effective aid for navigation. Both <b>route</b> and beacon <b>guidance</b> were effective methods, but suitable for different environments and circumstances. This thesis also investigates a mobile teleconferencing scenario, where participants can move freely from one location to another. With hear-through headphones, co-located participants can hear each other naturally. To avoid transmitting the speech of the participants to other participants in the same room – as this would be perceived as an echo – acoustic co-location detection is applied. In a user study, utilization of acoustic co-location detection was shown to improve the clarity of communication. Together, the studies presented in this thesis provide methods and guidelines for the development of mobile audio augmented reality applications...|$|R

30|$|One {{randomized}} single-center study specifically {{compared the}} placement of dialysis catheters by the femoral <b>route</b> using ultrasound <b>guidance</b> or anatomical landmarks [58]. The success rate for placement of 110 double-lumen dialysis catheters was 98.2  % with ultrasound guidance and 80  % using anatomical landmarks (p =  0.002; odds ratio =  13.5, 95  % CI 1.7 – 108.7).

The rate of complications decreased from 18.2 to 5.5  % (p =  0.039) with ultrasound guidance. This study therefore shows that ultrasound guidance of femoral dialysis catheter placement reduces the failure rate, the number of attempts at femoral venous puncture and the incidence of complications related to catheter placement, in accordance with all data and recommendations concerning {{the placement of}} central venous catheters. However, the paucity of data and the small patient numbers prevent a strong recommendation.|$|R

5000|$|In 1985, Jack Loomis, a Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, came up {{with the}} idea of a GPS-based {{navigation}} system for the visually impaired. A short unpublished paper (Loomis, 1985) outlined the concept and detailed some ideas for implementation, including the idea of a virtual sound interface. Loomis directed the project for over 20 years, in collaboration with Reginald Golledge (1937-2009), Professor of Geography at UCSB, and Roberta Klatzky, Professor of Psychology (now at Carnegie Mellon University). Their combination of development and applied research was supported by three multi-year grants from the National Eye Institute (NEI) and another multi-year consortium grant from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), headed by Michael May of Sendero Group. In 1993, the UCSB group first publicly demonstrated the Personal Guidance System (PGS) using a bulky prototype carried in a backpack. Since then, they created several versions of the PGS, one of which was carried in a small pack worn at the waist. Their project mostly focused on the user interface and the resulting research has defined the legacy of the project. As indicated earlier in this entry, several wearable systems are now commercially available. These systems provide verbal guidance and environmental information via speech and Braille displays. But just as drivers and pilots want pictorial information from their navigation systems, survey research by the UCSB group has shown that visually impaired people often want direct perceptual information about the environment. Most of their R&D has dealt with several types of “spatial display”, with researchers Jim Marston and Nicholas Giudice contributing to the recent efforts. The first is a virtual acoustic display, which provides auditory information to the user via earphones (as proposed in the 1985 concept paper). With this display, the user hears important environmental locations, such as turn points along the route and points of interest. The labels of these locations are converted to synthetic speech and then displayed using auditory direction and distance cues, such that the spoken labels appear in the auditory space of the user. A second type of display, which the group calls a “haptic pointer interface”, was inspired by the hand-held receiver used in the Talking Signs© system of remote signage. The user holds a small wand, to which are attached an electronic compass and a small loudspeaker or vibrator. When the hand is pointing toward some location represented in the computer database, the user hears a tone or feels a vibration. Supplementary verbal information can be provided by synthetic speech. The user moves toward the desired location by aligning the body with the hand while maintaining the [...] "on-course" [...] auditory or vibratory signal. Other variants of the pointer interface involve putting the compass on the body or head and turning the body or head until the on-course signal is perceived. Six published route-guidance studies indicate that spatial displays provide effective <b>route</b> <b>guidance,</b> entail less cognitive load than speech interfaces, and are generally preferred by visually impaired users.|$|E
