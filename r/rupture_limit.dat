40|$|The {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} creep <b>rupture</b> <b>limit</b> {{is an important}} issue for industrial components under combined action of cyclic thermal and mechanical loading. This paper proposes a new creep rupture assessment method under the Linear Matching Method framework, where the creep <b>rupture</b> <b>limit</b> is evaluated through an extended shakedown analysis using the revised yield stress, which is determined by the minimum of the yield stress of the material and the individual creep rupture stress at each integration point. Various numerical strategies have been investigated to calculate these creep rupture stresses associated with given temperatures and allowable creep rupture time. Three distinct methods: a) linear interpolation method, b) logarithm based polynomial relationship and c) the Larson–Miller parameter, are introduced to interpolate and extrapolate an accurate creep rupture stress, on the basis of discrete experimental creep rupture data. Comparisons between these methods are carried out to determine the most appropriate approach leading to the accurate solution to the creep rupture stresses for the creep rupture analysis. Two numerical examples including a classical holed plate problem and a two-pipe structure are provided to verify the applicability and efficiency of this new approach. Detailed step-by-step analyses are also performed to further confirm the accuracy of the obtained creep rupture limits, and to investigate the interaction between the different failure mechanisms. All the results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of providing accurate but conservative solutions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Concrete is a {{construction}} material {{which is most}} widely used in the world. Its use has been so extensive because of ease of construction and its properties like compressive strength, flexural strength and durability. Plain concrete is very good in resisting compressive stresses but possesses a low modulus of <b>rupture,</b> <b>limited</b> ductility and little resistance to cracking.

In the recent past, behavior of reinforced concrete beams in shear has been studied extensively. An exact analysis of shear strength in reinforced concrete beam is quite complex.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluated}} {{experimental research}} {{on the influence of}} selected factors (species, thickness, density, number of stress cycles) on the specified material characteristics (modulus of elasticity, modulus of <b>rupture,</b> <b>limit</b> of proportionality, bendability coefficient). The measured values were statistically evaluated and expressed in tables and graphs. Beech (Fagus Sylvatica L.) was selected to represent hardwood and aspen (Populus Tremula L.) softwood. Tree species affects all observed characteristics. The results show that the modulus of elasticity increases with increasing densification of the material, but decreases with the increasing thickness of the material. A similar dependence is observed even with the modulus of rupture and limit of proportionality, which is also dependent on the number of cycles. The bendability coefficient is affected by material thickness. It is expected that based on the evaluation of the results {{it will be possible to}} design materials with tailored properties...|$|E

The ALOS interferograms reveal a sharp transition in fringe pattern at ~ 150 km from the trench axis that is diagnostic of the downdip <b>rupture</b> <b>limit</b> of the Maule earthquake. An elastic dislocation model based on ascending and descending ALOS interferograms and 13 near-field 3 -component GPS measurements reveals that the coseismic slip decreases more or less linearly from a maximum of 17 m (along-strike average of 6. 5 m) at 18 km depth to near zero at 43 – 48 km depth, quantitatively indicating the downdip limit of the seismogenic zone. The depth at which slip drops to near zero appears {{to be at the}} intersection of the subducting plate with the continental Moho.

The data are taken from Public Works Research Center (PWRC) product certification reports. The database comprises a total of 130 tensile tests performed on undamaged (reference) tests and 390 tensile tests performed on exhumed damaged geogrid specimens. A total of 78 installation damage factors were computed by the writers representing 26 different geogrid products from 12 different product lines in combination with three different aggregate types. The field tests were carried out using a standard PWRC protocol and the calculation of installation damage factors and spread in data was carried out in a consistent manner by the writers.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Earth and Planetary Science Letters [© Elsevier B. V. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] subduction earthquakes cause destructive surface deformation and ground shaking over hundreds of kilometres. Their <b>rupture</b> length is <b>limited</b> by the characteristic strength of the subduction plate interface, and by lateral variations in its mechanical properties. It has been proposed that subduction of topographic features such as ridges and seamounts can affect these properties and stop rupture propagation, but the required relief and physical mechanisms of topographic rupture limitation are not well understood. Here, we show that the <b>rupture</b> <b>limits</b> of thirteen historic great earthquakes along the South America–Nazca plate margin are strongly correlated with subducted topography with relief > 1000 m, including the Juan Fernandez Ridge. The northern <b>limit</b> of <b>rupture</b> in the Mw 8. 8 Maule, Chile earthquake of 27 February 2010 is located where this ridge subducts. Analysis of intermediate-magnitude earthquakes shows that in most places, the subduction of high seafloor relief creates weak, aseismic zones at the plate interface, which prevent rupture propagation, but that the Juan Fernandez Ridge is associated with a locally strong plate interface. The maximum rupture length, and thus magnitude, of great subduction earthquakes is therefore determined by the size and lateral spacing of topographic features where they are present on the subducting plate...|$|R
40|$|The Java margin is {{characterized}} by a distinct variation in lower to upper plate material transfer and recurring catastrophic tsunamogenic earthquakes. Both processes are closely linked to the subduction of oceanic basement relief resulting in varying degrees of fore-arc deformation. Tomographic models of refraction seismic profiles and reflection seismic lines in combination with high-resolution multibeam bathymetric data reveal the variability in the deep structure and deformation of the Java fore-arc. Shallow subduction processes are governed by the sediment supply in the trench {{as well as by the}} nature and fabric of the oceanic lithosphere. The deep structure of the fore-arc reveals a shallow upper plate crust–mantle transition, present along the entire Java margin section. The serpentinized fore-arc mantle wedge governs the depth extent of the seismogenic zone here, which is narrower compared to its Sumatran analogue. In addition, offshore central Java, high relief oceanic basement features potentially act as asperities as well as barriers to seismic <b>rupture,</b> <b>limiting</b> the possible magnitude of subduction thrust earthquakes. However, the potential for geohazards, in particular tsunamis, is high along the entire margin.

40|$|The great Chilean {{earthquake}} of 27 February 2010 occurred along a convergent margin previously surveyed {{with modern}} geophysical methods. Modern data resolve subducting ocean plate relief that probably arrested earthquake rupture. The northern limit of rupture {{was at the}} subducted extension of Juan Fernandez Ridge (JFR). JFR relief increases as the plate is faulted during bending into the trench thereby elevating the plate boundary 1 - 3 -km. At the intersection of relief with the trench axis turbidite transport from the south is impeded producing trench turbidite fill 2 - 3 -km thick. The southern <b>rupture</b> <b>limit</b> coincides with the subducted projection of Mocha Fracture Zone (MFZ), a 20 -km wide structure with thin fractured crust and seafloor relief to 1 - km. Seismically imaged beneath the frontal sediment prism is a plate interface between accreted and subducted sediments. Farther landward, where the 2010 earthquake rupture and aftershocks occurred, the upper plate is margin framework rock and the plate interface separates this metamorphic basement from subducted sediment. These observations show that subducted lower plate high-relief can affect the spatial organization of great earthquake rupture, as can the upper plate discontinuity between a frontal accreted sediment prism and the margin framework rock...|$|E

It is important that potential failure mechanisms of such components are extensively investigated {{in order to ensure}} sufficient confidence in their reliability. This paper presents shakedown and creep rupture analyses of a header branch pipe subjected to cyclic thermo-mechanical loading performed using the Linear Matching Method (LMM). The detailed investigation of failure mechanisms under the combined action of the internal pressure and the cyclic thermal load due to the temperature difference between the inner and outer pipe surfaces will be the primary focus of this paper. The header branch pipe considered here is composed of a single material with properties that are dependent upon both temperature and rupture life. A novel study investigating the effect that two geometric parameters – branch diameter and separation – have upon the failure mechanisms of the header branch pipe has also been carried out. The impact that these geometric parameters have upon the limit load, shakedown and creep rupture limits is one of the principal areas that is investigated in this work.

Wheat is commonly milled to wheat flour which could be further treated by other chemical methods depending on its utilisation. There are more than thousands bakery products using wheat flour as the main ingredient around the world. However, the most important use of wheat flour is for bread (Kokelaar, 1994). Due to its viscoelastic behaviour, which is not yet fully understood wheat flour doughs are complex systems that create great challenges in process engineering and product development research. Szczesniak (1988) gives the most striking definition of dough [...] 'it is alive' [...] referring to its condition of a dynamic system continually changing due to physical and chemical factors. Many scientists are interested in wheat flour dough rheology because wheat flour dough is unique and different from other flour doughs. Also, during breadmaking, dough undergoes different type of deformation in every phase of the conversion of wheat flour into baked products. During mixing, dough is subjected to extreme deformations that may exceed its <b>rupture</b> <b>limit.</b> During sheeting, fermentation, proofing, shaping and baking, the properties of wheat dough vary largely (Hoseney, 1986).

MethodsSixty patients aged 28 to 83 years were admitted to our institution with an acute rupture of the thoracic aorta (27 ruptured aneurysms, 15 perforated type B dissections, 18 traumatic ruptures). Twenty-eight patients were treated surgically with cardiopulmonary bypass, and 32 patients were acutely treated with an endovascular stent graft. Medical records were reviewed for prehospital and emergency department data, operative findings, and outcomes. Patients were followed up at yearly intervals with high-resolution multidetector computed tomographic angiography. ResultsPerioperatively, there were 1 death (3. 1 %) among the 32 patients in the endovascular group and 5 deaths (17. 8 %) among the 28 patients in the surgical group. There were 4 late deaths in the endovascular group and 1 in the surgical group. There were 2 access failures in the endovascular group. There were 1 stroke in the endovascular group and 1 case of paraplegia in the surgical group. Three patients in the endovascular group had endovascular leaks develop that required reintervention. Two patients in the endovascular group had late thrombosis of the left subclavian artery. ConclusionDespite encouraging early outcomes, midterm results suggest a trend toward increased reintervention and late complication rates in the endovascular group.

Hydrogels are characterized by water content volume and weight measure- ments, FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and reflecting index. Compressive uniaxial tests on equilibrated hydrogels individuate a hookean response within a 30 % strain range with Ec modulus of 12. 2 kPa, and a neo-hookean response within a 79 % strain range which upper limit corresponds to mate- rial rupture with Gc modulus of 3. 8 kPa. Tensile experiments performed for the first time on the pure material evidence a <b>rupture</b> <b>limit</b> for a strain around 30 % with hookean modulus Et of 24. 8 kPa and neo-hookean modulus Gt of 7. 3 kPa. Rheological studies, carried out in linear response regime around the hydrogel swelling–deswelling transition, report relaxation times of the kinetics towards the equilib- rium at different temperatures. The phase transition of pNIPAAM is monitored and the transition temper- ature is determined following the temperature dependence of the shear modulus. We apply different literature models to the rheological response and to the swelling–deswelling transition of the hydrogel.

40|$|Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM) is a manufacturing process whereby a desired shape is obtained using electrical discharges (sparks). WEDM involves high cutting rates and superior quality to improve machining performance in manufacturing hard materials. The machining performance of computer-controlled WEDM is directly dependent on spark energy (pulse on time, peak current, and gap voltage), pulse frequency (pulse off time and pulse on time), and wire electrode parameters (material, wire speed, and wire tension). In the field of wire {{electrical discharge machining}}, {{it is necessary to}} develop suitable WEDM technology to facilitate the production of high quality workpiece surfaces at high cutting rates. Surface roughness and white layer thickness are the most important factors in evaluating WEDM surface quality. In order to ensure good surface quality, the surface roughness must be low and the white layer must be as thin as possible, homogeneous, crack-free, and well-bonded to the substrate material. In this study, the effect of cutting parameters is investigated on the machining performance parameters including cutting speed, surface roughness, wire rupture, and white layer thickness. The adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) along with the Taguchi method is applied {{to determine the effects of}} the significant parameters on WEDM performance. Moreover, a new performance index is proposed to identify the effects of spark energy and pulse frequency simultaneously on machining performance and to identify the wire <b>rupture</b> <b>limit.</b> However, the performance index cannot be used to identify the most feasible wire electrode from ecological (energy and wire consumption) and economic (machining costs) perspectives. Therefore, a new performance criterion (production economic index) is developed to select the most feasible wire electrode considering the economic and ecological aspects along with the performance index to achieve superior machining performance at the lowest cost. This can be done by dividing the performance index by the total machining cost ((Es×DF) /Ct). In addition, a new coated-wire electrode iv design with higher strength for less wire rupture and high machining performance in WEDM is proposed. The results obtained represent a technological knowledge base for the selection of optimal machining conditions along with suitable types of wire electrodes for WEDM in terms of ecological and economic aspects. By applying the proposed performance criterion (Es×DF/Ct), it appears that using lower spark and higher pulse cycle settings with a brass wire electrode can decrease the surface roughness and white layer thickness, and facilitate more economical cutting speed. This could lead to faster cutting with good surface finish and less wire rupture...|$|E

It seems as if one were considered not having said enough, and the other having said too much. Criticism is embodied by those two very different figures of disobedience in a way to encourage the creation of new schemes of politicisation, new forms of culture, discourse and language indifferent to gender (Foucault). Bourdieu’s intentions are more pragmatic, his ethos much less aesthetic than Foucault’s. Foucault’s antiquity is Bourdieu’s Kabylia, the sign of the socialisation of the biological and the biologisation of the social.

Foucault once said that he always wrote only fiction. Literature may well be one way to outgrow these divisions, as the only potentially all-conquering language; not as its own mystification, nor as the pathos of a possible future, but as a fiction which disables the classification of doubles: fiction and non-fiction, truth and history, narrative and storytelling...|$|R

Furthermore there are no strong motion recordings of giant earthquakes. However, there is a growing set of high-quality broadband teleseismic recordings of large and giant earthquakes. In this thesis, we use recordings from the 2003 Tokachi-Oki (Mw 8. 3) earthquake as empirical Green’s functions to simulate the rock and soil ground motions from the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and a scenario Mw 9. 2 Cascadia subduction earthquake in the frequency band of interest to flexible and tall buildings (0. 075 to 1 Hz). The effect of amplification by the Seattle basin is considered by using a basin response transfer function, which is derived from deconvolving the teleseismic waves recorded at rock sites from basin sites at the SHIP 02 experiment. These strong ground motion time histories are used to simulate of the fully nonlinear response of 20 -story and 6 -story steel moment-frame buildings designed according to both the U. S. 1994 Uniform Building Code and the 1987 Japanese building code. We consider several realizations of the hypothetical subduction earthquake. The basin amplification and the down-dip <b>limit</b> of <b>rupture</b> are of particular importance to the simulated ground motions in Seattle. At rock sites, if slip is limited to offshore regions, the building model responses are mostly in the linear range. However, if rupture is extended beyond the Olympic Mountains, large deformations occur in the high-rise buildings models, especially those with brittle welds. At basin sites, our simulations indicate the collapse of all building models for a source model with rupture beyond the Olympic Mountains, whereas buildings with perfect welds avoid collapse for simulations based on a source model with <b>rupture</b> <b>limited</b> to offshore.

An emerging body of literature suggests a complex inflammatory cascade likely promotes aneurysm wall remodeling and progressive ballooning of the arterial wall, ultimately terminating in aneurysm rupture. These events likely begin with hemodynamic, flow-related endothelial injury; the injured endothelium stimulates inflammation, including the recruitment and transmigration of inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages. Various proteases are secreted by the inflammatory infiltrate, resulting in degradation of the extracellular matrix and the structural changes unique to IAs. Detailed understanding of these inflammatory processes may result in (1) early identification of patients {{at high risk for}} aneurysm rupture, perhaps via arterial wall imaging, and (2) targeted, noninvasive therapies to treat or even prevent cerebral aneurysms...|$|R
30|$|The April 25, 2015, Mw 7.8 {{earthquake}} {{followed by}} that of the May 12 Mw 7.3 event farther east, ruptured {{a segment of the}} Main Himalayan Thrust fault under the rim of the High Himalayas releasing decades of seismic slip accumulated at about 2  cm/year along the downdip end of the locked portion of the fault that extends southward {{from the front of the}} high range to the most frontal part of the Siwalik range (e.g., Ader et al., 2012; Grandin et al., 2012). Although the earthquake severely affected the valley, the corresponding rupture did not extended south of Kathmandu past the Mahabharat to the MFT, but stopped halfway instead (Avouac et al., 2015; Galetzka et al., 2015; Grandin et al., 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2015). Comparison of macroseismic data related to the Gorkha earthquake with data from previous events indicates that the <b>rupture</b> remained <b>limited</b> to an area roughly similar to the area shaken by the 1833 AD earthquake (Martin et al., 2015) and ended eastward in the area that was already broken during the 1934 AD earthquake (Adhikari et al., 2015).|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{wide-angle}} seismic data {{recorded on}} ocean bottom instruments of a combined onshore- offshore investigation on the tectonic framework of central Java {{are presented in}} this study. The joint inter- disciplinary project MERAMEX (Merapi Amphibious Experiment) was carried out to characterize the subduction of the Indo-Australian plate beneath Eurasia. Three marine wide-angle profiles are analyzed by combined forward- and inverse modeling of first and later arrival traveltimes and are integrated to- gether with gravity data. The {{results of this study}} are compared with former investigations off southern Sumatra, western Java and eastern Java to obtain a detailed image of the Java margin. The subduction of the oceanic Roo Rise plateau, located south of central Java, with its thickened and buoyant crust, strongly influences subduction dynamics. The trench is retreated about 60 km in a land- ward direction. Large scale forearc uplift is manifested in isolated forearc highs, reaching water depths of only 1000 m compared to 2000 m water depth off western Java, and results from oceanic basement relief subduction. The dip angle of the underthrusting oceanic lithosphere is 10 ◦ underneath the marine forearc and its crustal thickness increases eastward from 9 - 10 km over a distance of 100 km between both dip profiles off central Java, which is thicker than the global average of 7. 4 km. The incipient subduction of a broad band of seamounts off central Java causes frontal erosion of the margin here and leads to mass wasting due to oversteepening of the upper trench wall. The well-developed accretionary wedge off southern Sumatra and western Java diminishes into a small frontal prism with steep slope angles of the upper plate off central Java. This causes a persistent threat for generating tsunamis, which may also be triggered by smaller (Mw 8) earthquakes. The rough surface of the Indo-Australian plate with its volcanic edifices strongly influences the interplate coupling. A subducted and dismembered seamount is revealed on the eastern profile at the toe of the backstop in 15 km depth. This seamount and similar features present on the megathrust may potentially act as asperities or as barriers to seismic <b>rupture,</b> <b>limiting</b> lateral <b>rupture</b> propagation in the co-seismic phase. Subduction earthquakes with a magnitude ≥ 8 are not observed, while smaller earthquakes fre- quently occur. A remarkable clustering of earthquakes in the forearc mantle wedge below the shallow forearc Moho may be the seismic expression of seamount detachement...|$|R
40|$|As {{integrated}} circuit densities increase {{with each new}} technology generation, both the lateral and vertical dimensions shrink. Operating voltages, however, have not scaled as aggressively as feature size, with a resultant increase in the electric fields within advanced geometry devices. Oxide electric fields are in fact increasing to greater than 5 MV/cm as feature size approaches 0. 1 {micro}m. This trend raises the concern that single event gate <b>rupture</b> (SEGR) may <b>limit</b> the scaling of advanced {{integrated circuit}}s (ICs) for space applications. The dependence of single event gate rupture (SEGR) critical field on oxide thickness is examined for thin gate oxides. Critical field for SEGR increases with decreasing oxide thickness, consistent with an increasing intrinsic breakdown field...|$|R
40|$|Power {{transformer}} rupture {{and fire}} resulting from an arcing fault inside the tank usually leads to significant security risks and serious economic loss. In order {{to reveal the}} essence of tank deformation or explosion, this paper presents a 3 -D numerical computational tool to simulate the structural dynamic behavior due to overpressure inside transformer tank. To illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, a 17. 3 MJ and a 6. 3 MJ arcing fault were simulated on a real full-scale 360 MVA/ 220 kV oil-immersed transformer model, respectively. By employing the finite element method, the transformer internal overpressure distribution, wave propagation and von-Mises stress were solved. The numerical results indicate that the increase of pressure and mechanical stress distribution are non-uniform and the stress tends to concentrate on connecting parts of the tank as the fault time evolves. Given this feature, it becomes possible {{to reduce the risk of}} transformer tank <b>rupture</b> through <b>limiting</b> the fault energy and enhancing the mechanical strength of the local stress concentrative areas. The theoretical model and numerical simulation method proposed in this paper can be used as a substitute for risky and costly field tests in fault overpressure analysis and tank mitigation design of transformers...|$|R
40|$|Plant cell {{walls are}} a key {{determinant}} of the material properties of vegetable tissue following thermal processing. This study focussed upon the effects of heat on the material properties of model vegetable tissues (Chinese water chestnut and carrot), with particular emphasis on the rate of compression during mechanical testing. In a homogeneous system such as cooked Chinese water chestnut, low strain rate compression (0. 2 min(- 1)) produced buckling of the cell walls, steady fluid expression, low stiffness and fractures at high strains. However a high compressive strain rate (> 50 min(- 1)), produced a high stiffness and failure by a rapid, brittle fracture at low strain, which propagated by cell <b>rupture</b> causing <b>limited,</b> rapid fluid release. These differences in mechanical behaviour are ascribed {{to the ability of}} cellular fluid to flow through the tissue during the timescale of the compressive test. When carrot tissue was heated for short periods of time (20 min at 100 degreesC), weakening of the inter-cellular adhesion changed the failure mechanism from cell rupture to cell separation. These results show that the material properties of processed vegetable tissue depend upon, not only the previously known factor of inter-cellular adhesion and cell wall strength, but also the cell wall porosity and the ease of fluid flow.
