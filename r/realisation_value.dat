Current research establishes that investments in IT can create value, but gives limited guidance on the mechanics of how to manage the <b>realisation</b> of <b>value</b> related to IT. This paper draws on case studies and in-depth interviews to add the granularity needed to guide decision makers and project teams in planning and realizing value during EIS deployment. The framework proposes a holistic approach in which combined investments in EIS and organisation enables efficient and effective processes that in turn drive customer and financial performance...|$|R

Shrimp is the major seafood export item of India with a growth rate of 2. 89 % and 10. 47 % in terms of quantity and value of exports respectively, during 1991 - 2011. Share of Indian shrimp in the world market declined slightly from 7. 01 % in 1990 - 1992 to 6. 25 % in 2008 - 2010 while the shares of China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia increased owning to value addition and re-export of processed shrimp from these countries.

40|$|Service level {{agreements}} (SLAs) {{for complex}} IT-intensive business-to-business (CITI-B 2 B) services are high-level representations {{of services to}} be enacted, with predominantly quantifiable performance targets. Inevitably, there is a gap between this representation and the nuanced practices of enactment adapting to emergent conditions over time. Overarching terms in the master agreement anticipate this gap; however, {{the nature of the}} practices that manage that gap is not well understood. This study aims to develop a deeper understanding of these everyday practices to identify potential areas for improving <b>value</b> <b>realisation</b> in SLA enactment. We conducted a long-term ethnographic study of the enactment of an SLA by a global IT provider and global financial services company, framed by relational theory of contract. Our analysis showed the gap was bridged by a cycle of enactment in which emergent conditions triggered relational interactions among participants, culminating in decisions to adapt the terms of the SLA in pursuit of <b>value</b> <b>realisation.</b> Further, our analysis showed that this cycle is enabled by informal mechanisms of learning, negotiating, and adapting that we conceptualise as relational capability, which is amenable to representation, refinement, innovation, and capability development. Exploiting this capability and as well as the information produced during the cycle of enactment could inform SLA design and enable the transformation of SLAs as evolving learning instruments...|$|R
40|$|The world faces a twin {{threat from}} {{simultaneous}} {{economic and environmental}} crises. Human society, now heavily urbanised, will mostly encounter these threats in cities and large human settlements. The crisis of financial capital is a crisis of financial capitals, the urban hubs of neoliberal global order. In an era of globalised interdependency, {{the pain of the}} wealthy metropolitan centres will likely be the agonies of the world's poorer peripheries. David Harvey (2009) writes: My guess is that half of the financial crises over the last 30 years are urban property based. The origins of this crisis in the United States came from something called the sub prime mortgage crises. I call this not a sub prime mortgage crisis but an urban crisis. Australia and its cities remain on the margins of the crisis. We don't yet feel the searing pain that is so apparent in global pivots, like New York, or aspiring tigers like Dublin, where unemployment soars as public finances plummet. And yet our cities are already on the edge of social and environmental defaults that widened during the era of neoliberal rule (McManus, 2004). Australian author and social commentator, John Birmingham (2009) depicts 'The Coming Storm' whose advance clouds are already engulfing those in vulnerable employment sectors, like mining, business services and manufacturing, where retrenchment and reduced hours are the norm. The tempests of global warming and resource (especially oil) volatility threaten the fundamental circulation and health of an urban process that produced ever higher velocities. This process pushed continuously against the constraints of time. Time is the agent of delay, decay and debility which reminds us that we exist in nature not outside it. In doing so, as Harvey (1982) reminds us, the urban process in capitalism seeks ways of overcoming barriers to the <b>realisation</b> of <b>value</b> and profit. The city is a means for overcoming 'the limits to capital' presented by the time-space dimensions of nature. As capitalism has evolved - and suffered and survived crises - it has sought new pathways to the <b>realisation</b> of <b>value</b> in city processes. A key instance of this in the twentieth-century was the motorisation of urban mobility to reduce spatial frictions of the labour process.

The failure rate of {{mergers and acquisitions}} is alarmingly high (70 % plus failures). The people factor is seen {{as one of the}} main contributors to this failure. Research purpose: To develop and validate a comprehensive, holistic model for the people integration process during mergers and acquisitions. Motivation for the study: The literature on a comprehensive, holistic people integration process for mergers and acquisitions is sparse and fragmented. Research design, approach and method: A qualitative approach was adopted consisting of a three step process which solicited the views of seasoned M&A Practioners; these views were compared against the available literature. Finally, practioners were asked to critique the final model from a practice perspective. The utility of the final model was assessed against two mergers and acquisitions case studies. Main findings: A comprehensive, holistic people integration process model for mergers and acquisitions was developed and validated. However, this model will only significantly enhance mergers and acquisitions <b>value</b> <b>realisation</b> if it is applied from the appropriate vantage point. Practical/managerial implications: The proposed approach will increase the probability of a successful M&A people-wise and M&A <b>value</b> <b>realisation.</b> Contribution/value add: Theoretically, the development and validation of a M&A people process integration model; practically, guidelines for successful people integration; organisationally, significantly enhancing the chances of M&A success; and community wise, the reduction of the negative effects of M&A failure on communities. </p...|$|R

40|$|Coffee, {{although}} an important commodity in India agricultural exports, has faced fluctuating international prices and decreasing unit <b>value</b> <b>realisation,</b> {{especially in the}} post-reform period. Hence, domestic market for coffee cannot be neglected altogether. In fact, Coffee Board has proposed a promotional campaign to increase domestic demand for coffee. In this context, it becomes necessary to understand weather the emphasis should be on price incentives or nonprice factors. We estimate coffee demand for the Indian domestic market using the dynamic error-correction methodology (ECM). Results show that while demand for coffee is inelastic in the long-run, it is highly inelastic in the short-run. This suggests that Coffee Board may focus efforts on non-price factors rather than price incentives in their generic coffee promotional campaign. ...|$|R

30|$|Gamma {{distributions}} of the freshwater residence times were plotted versus the salinities of Pulicat and the BoB {{as well as}} the residual salinities at the boundary (Fig.  7 a, b). These provided 100 <b>realisations</b> (stochastic <b>values)</b> of the parameter sets from the uncertainty model. The computed uncertainties in the system salinities seem to be larger with higher standard errors (S.E.) compared to that of BoB indicating that a wide spectrum of changes is likely to have materialised during the period (Fig.  7 a). The range of fluctuations in the freshwater residence times seems to be higher with respect to modelled ranges of the system salinity (with higher S.E.) rather than those of BoB (lower S.E.). These observations suggest that the system salinities are likely to have undergone a higher range of variations between ~[*] 4.5 and 32  psu based on the changes in precipitation and riverine runoff. The model indicated the ranges of salinities of the sea could have varied between ~[*] 24.5 and 42.7  psu in response to the changes in the ranges of the system salinities. These results support our observations on the large decrease in the system salinities and corresponding export of low saline waters to the sea during the 2015 event.|$|R

Using a capabilities lens, this study assesses the impact of quality management capabilities in developing market-based organisational learning capability.

40|$|Although organisations {{continue}} to make substantial investments in information systems and information technology (IS/IT), the successful <b>realisation</b> of <b>value</b> (i. e. benefits) from such investments has consistently been reported as a major organisational challenge. From a project perspective, this paper examines whether benefits management (BM) practices {{can be considered a}} viable approach to achieve such anticipated value. Drawing on a field study conducted by investigating BM practices in 29 organisations as well as the BM literature, we derive a structural equation model that is tested using data collected from 456 individuals. Our data analysis, by means of partial least squares, finds that specific BM competencies positively impact benefits realisation success (BRS). Furthermore, the findings suggest that the development of effective BM competencies are facilitated by an alignment of business and IT processes reflected in the constructs a) business process knowledge, and b) business-IT communication. We also find that incentives negatively influence the positive effect of benefits review practices in realising project benefits. Collectively, the results have important theoretical and practical implications, as they provide quantitative evidence of how IS/IT investments should be managed to successfully realise benefits. We expect our research to spur organisations to instil a shared understanding of how IS/IT relates to the business and vice versa within their project teams, which will intensify BM’s positive effect on BRS...|$|R

The franchise being based on land ownership, the urban areas commanded a much smaller proportion of the votes than of the population: at the election in 1820 when Warwickshire recorded its highest turnout, only 399 of the 3,122 votes were cast in Birmingham, and a little under 300 in total from the other main towns (Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon and Nuneaton).|$|R
40|$|Part 6 : Process Selecting and Modelling TechniquesInternational audienceAssembly {{processes}} are undergoing frequent changes {{as a result}} of the current drive for agility and rapid product solutions. These changes induce complexities and dynamics in the survival of most Manufacturing Enterprises (MEs). To remain competitive, MEs have to continuously and flexibly adjust through the redesign and organisation of their manufacturing and assembly processes as well as resource elements, with the aim to improve ‘cost’ and ‘values’ generated. Cost and values are part of key performance indicators necessary for determining the economic viability of assembly processes. The paper therefore presents a methodology capable of capturing, modelling and using information related to cost and value generation for in-depth assembly process analysis. This form of analysis can help determine assembly process efficiency and therefore support the selection or redesign of assembly processes for maximum <b>value</b> <b>realisation</b> at minimal cost...|$|R

40|$|The National System of Innovation (NSI) is an {{important}} construct in South Africa’s policy discourse as illustrated in key national planning initiatives, such as the National Development Plan. The country’s capacity to innovate {{is linked to the}} prospects for industrial development leading to social and economic growth. Proper measurement of innovation activity is therefore crucial for policymaking. In this study, a constructive analytical critique of the innovation surveys that are conducted in South Africa is presented, the case for broadening current perspectives of innovation in the national policy discourse is reinforced, the significance of a broad perspective of innovation is demonstrated and new metrics for use in the measurement of the performance of the NSI are proposed. Current NSI survey instruments lack definition of non-technological innovation. They emphasise inputs rather than outputs, lack regional and sectoral analyses, give limited attention to innovation diffusion and are susceptible to respondent interpretation. Furthermore, there are gaps regarding the wider conditions of innovation and system linkages and learning.

There is only a limited amount of research on value destruction in the context of Service-Dominant logic and, to the best of our knowledge, no dyadic studies. From a business perspective, awareness of factors that have the potential to impede value creation will enable relationship partners to increase mutual <b>value</b> <b>realisation.</b> The paper examines the accuracy of the term ‘value co-destruction’ as a blanket description for interaction that results in value reduction, and proposes that, in many instances, ‘value diminution’ may be more appropriate. The study adopts an exploratory, qualitative approach. One-to-one interviews are conducted with clients and their creative agencies. The results suggest that diminished value outcomes are caused by resource deficiencies and resource misuse by both relational partners, separately and jointly. We propose a model of five higher-order antecedents of value diminution: absence of trust, inadequate communication, power/dependence imbalance, inadequate coordination, and inadequate human capital...|$|R
