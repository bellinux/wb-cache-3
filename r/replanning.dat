5|$|Foale's Increment {{proceeded}} fairly normally until June 25, when a resupply ship {{collided with}} solar arrays on the Spektr module {{during the second}} test of the Progress manual docking system, TORU. The module's outer shell was hit and holed, which caused the station to lose pressure. This was the first on-orbit depressurization {{in the history of}} spaceflight. The crew quickly cut cables leading to the module and closed Spektr's hatch in order to prevent the need to abandon the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilized the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. Fortunately, food, water and other vital supplies were stored in other modules, and salvage and <b>replanning</b> effort by Foale and the science community minimized the loss of research data and capability.|$|E

25|$|King had {{a long-standing}} concern with city {{planning}} {{and the development}} of the national capital, since he had been trained in the settlement house movement and envisioned town planning and garden cities as a component of his broader program of social reform. He drew on four broad traditions in early North American planning: social planning, the Parks Movement, the City Scientific, and the City Beautiful. King's greatest impact was as the political champion for the planning and development of Ottawa, Canada's national capital. His plans, much of which were completed in the two decades after his death, was part of a century of federal planning that repositioned Ottawa as a national space in the City Beautiful style. Confederation Square, for example, was initially planned to be a civic plaza to balance the nearby federal presence of Parliament Hill. The Great War monument was not installed until the 1939 royal visit, and King intended that the <b>replanning</b> of the capital would be the World War II memorial. However, the symbolic meaning of the World War II monument gradually expanded to become the place of remembrance for all Canadian war sacrifices.|$|E

25|$|Once {{again it}} was Giuseppe Permarini who {{was given the}} task of {{planning}} the gardens. They were initially intended to serve the new royal palace {{which was to be}} built in the area but when it was decided instead to renovate the existing palace, the development became part of the Public Gardens Plan. Now somewhat scaled down, the gardens were built in an area vacated by the removal of two convents and on land which had belonged to the Dugnani Elvetico family. A network of paths through the gardens and on to the adjacent streets included the Boschetti and the steps on the Via Vittorio Veneto which first led up to the ramparts and then into the park. Although the park's present appearance is mainly the result of <b>replanning</b> the park as an English garden {{at the end of the}} 19th century, Piermarini's Neoclassical influence is still in evidence on the path connecting the Boschetti to the steps down to the Via Vittorio Veneto. The site of one of the former convents was first redesigned as a venue for ball games and then used for city celebrations held by the governor Eugenio Beauharnais. It was finally demolished to provide space for the Milan's Natural History Museum (Museo di Storia Naturale).|$|E
500|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, as a result of decisions taken by the municipality, many of the city's half-timbered houses were torn down. They were replaced by hundreds of modern buildings, completely changing the look of the city. Factories with smoking chimneys became ever more prevalent in the outskirts. Among the most important were De Danske Spritfabrikker (spirits and liquors), De forenede Textilfabrikker (textiles), the East Asiatic Company (trading), Dansk Eternit (building materials) and C.W. Obel's tobacco factory (established in 1787). Aalborg Portland run by F.L. Smidth was one of several cement factories operating in 1913, together employing some 800 workers. By the 1930s, Aalborg was being promoted as [...] "Denmark's new centre for industry and workers". <b>Replanning</b> continued with additional thoroughfares cutting through the city. The port facilities were also improved {{with the help of a}} dredger and the opening of new docks. In 1933, Christian X inaugurated a new bridge over Limfjord to replace the fragile pontoon crossing.|$|E
500|$|This {{concept was}} still very new in the 1690s, and few new cities had had reason {{to be built in}} Europe [...] Christopher Wren's city plan after the Great Fire of London in 1666 having been turned down because of the {{complexities}} of land ownership there. There were some other examples such as Richelieu, and later Saint Petersburg. The prototype may well have been the new city of Terra del Sole, constructed in 1564. Another of the first towns to be planned using symmetry and order rather than an evolution of small alleys and streets was Alessandria in southern Piedmont. A little later, from 1711, this Baroque form of planning was favoured in the Hispanic colonies of South America, especially by the Portuguese in Brazil. In other parts of Europe, lack of finance, complex land ownership and divided public opinion made radical <b>replanning</b> after disaster too difficult: after 1666, London was rebuilt on its ancient plan, though new extensions to the west were partially on a grid system. In Sicily, public opinion (the public being anyone {{not a member of the}} ruling class) counted for nothing, and hence these seemingly revolutionary new concepts of town planning could be freely executed.|$|E

The environmental regulation is presented under an evolutionary approach, considering that technology develops along whith the socio-economic context, the environmental regulation is a related element which determines the search and selection of technologies able to comply whith regulation ensuring economic viability. Regulation is also a determinant factor for the adoption of innovations in the refining industry.

2500|$|The {{status of}} Londinium is uncertain. It {{seems to have}} been founded as a mere vicus and {{remained}} as such even after its recovery from Boudica's revolt.

[...] Starting as a small fort guarding the northern end of the new bridge across the River Thames, Londinium grew to become an important port for trade between Britain and the Roman provinces on the continent. The initial lack of private Roman villas (plentiful elsewhere) suggests military or even Imperial ownership. [...] Tacitus wrote that, {{at the time of the}} uprising of Boudica, [...] "Londinium... though undistinguished by the name of 'colony', was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels." [...] Depending on the time of its creation, the modesty of Londonium's first forum may have reflected its early elevation to city (...) status or may have reflected an administrative concession to a low-ranking but major Romano-British settlement.

60|$|As the Brissago council came {{to realise}} {{that what it}} had {{supposed}} to be temporary camps of refugees were rapidly developing into great towns of a new type, {{and that it was}} remoulding the world in spite of itself, it decided to place this work of redistributing the non-agricultural population {{in the hands of a}} compactor and better qualified special committee. That committee is now, far more than the council of any other of its delegated committees, the active government of the world. Developed from an almost invisible germ of 'town-planning' that came obscurely into existence in Europe or America (the question is still in dispute) somewhere in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, its work, the continual active planning and <b>replanning</b> of the world as a place of human habitation, is now so to speak the collective material activity of the race. The spontaneous, disorderly spreadings and recessions of populations, as aimless and mechanical as the trickling of spilt water, which was the substance of history for endless years, giving rise here to congestions, here to chronic devastating wars, and everywhere to a discomfort and disorderliness that was at its best only picturesque, is at an end. Men spread now, with the whole power of the race to aid them, into every available region of the earth. Their cities are no longer tethered to running water and the proximity of cultivation, their plans are no longer affected by strategic considerations or thoughts of social insecurity. The aeroplane and the nearly costless mobile car have abolished trade routes; a common language and a universal law have abolished a thousand restraining inconveniences, and so an astonishing dispersal of habitations has begun. One may live anywhere. And so it is that our cities now are true social gatherings, each with a character of its own and distinctive interests of its own, and most of them with a common occupation. They lie out in the former deserts, these long wasted sun-baths of the race, they tower amidst eternal snows, they hide in remote islands, and bask on broad lagoons. For a time the whole tendency of mankind was to desert the river valleys in which the race had been cradled for half a million years, but now that the War against Flies has been waged so successfully that this pestilential branch of life is nearly extinct, they are returning thither with a renewed appetite for gardens laced by watercourses, for pleasant living amidst islands and houseboats and bridges, and for nocturnal lanterns reflected by the sea.|$|E
