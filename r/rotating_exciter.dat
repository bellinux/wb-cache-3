Phase 1 Was completed in 2002 and involved updating equipment technology to have automated and remote operation capabilities. Phase 2 was completed in 2004-05 and focused on regulating waste that enters the dam and could damage the machines. This included adding [...] "trash-rack cleaning machine, sluice gate and trash racks" [...] to filter out trash that flows through the river into the dam. Phase 3 {{is scheduled to be}} finished in 2017 and includes a final restoration of the units including, [...] "new runner, rewinding the generator, stator restack, converting <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> to static excitation and refurbishment of wicket gates." [...] As part of the remodeling of the plant a computer model was created to determine the optimal size and shape of the turbines to ensure maximum productivity from the plant. This will allow the plant to operate at a wider distribution of water levels and increase the electric production to 101 MW.|$|E
40|$|Short circuit {{plants are}} used mainly for testing and R&D activities. These plants {{are faced with}} high {{maintenance}} and down time due to the excitation system. Motor driven rheostats, <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> failures, Commutator and carbon brushes deterioration, and disturbances in bearing location {{are just a few}} of the typical problems of these aged short circuit plants. The result is long down time of the generator system. The replacement of the <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> and associated equipment for static excitation systems provides the positive solutions to these problems.

A SMES system connected to an exciter rotating with a turbine-rotor shaft is proposed. The exciter is installed exclusively to supply current for the SMES. Since electrical power output from the SMES is converted into a mechanical torque of the generator directly by the exciter, it is expected that power swings of the generator will be damped efficiently. Several numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed control system is capable of stabilizing torsional oscillations as well as electromechanical oscillations in power systems significantl...|$|E

40|$|The Norwegian Network Code FIKS {{from the}} Norwegian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Statnett, states that {{synchronous}} generators â‰¥ 25 MVA {{must have a}} static excitation system. It also includes requirements on the step time response and the available field winding ceiling voltage of the excitation system. An improved brushless excitation system is in operation in some pilot power plants. A rotating thyristor bridge is controlled via Bluetooth. The step time response is as fast as conventional static excitation systems. However, a ceiling voltage factor of 2 requires the thyristor bridge to operate at firing angles about 60 degrees. High torque pulsations, low power factor and low utilization of the exciter is the end result. New power electronic interfaces on the shaft results in a betterutilization of the designed exciter and improves the mechanical performance {{as well as the}} controllability of the generator field winding. Permanent magnet <b>rotating</b> <b>exciters</b> increase the field forcing strength of the synchronous generator, yielding improved transient stability (Fault Ride-Through req.). Brushless exciters also reduces regular maintenance of the generator.

This was in turn converted by a <b>rotating</b> machine (<b>exciter)</b> to 5 megawatt (MW) level, the excitation power required by a typical 500 MW Power Plant Turbine Generator Unit. They proved durable and reliable. Many are recorded in service through the mid-1990s and some are still in use at older generating stations, notably in hydroelectric plants operating in northern California.|$|R
40|$|The {{thyristor}} bridge rectifier {{has proven to}} be a reliable solution regarding control of excitation equipment for synchronous generators. However, in rotating brushless exciters the diode rectifier is the dominant topology on the shaft.

40|$|Future {{electric}} vehicles requires electric motors with excellent torque-speed characteristics, high efficiency, and low costs. Equipped with controllable rotor flux, electrically excited synchronous motors {{are able to}} provide high torque at low speed and high efficiency at high speed. However, brushes and slip rings for field windings need maintenance and may influence reliability. In this paper a brushless power transferring approach through a high frequency <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> is presented. Compared with conventional rotating exciters, the high frequency exciter is much more compact and energy efficient due to high energy conversion frequency. This enables the exciter to be integrated in the rotor and provides opportunities for electrically excited synchronous motors to compete with other motors in vehicle applications. A prototype of the rotating exciters with SiC based converter, Litz wire, and shaft-end mounting structure has been built and measured in standalone tests and combined tests with a synchronous machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyse {{different}} design possibilities for a <b>rotating</b> permanent magnet <b>exciter</b> for a hydroelectric generator. This is done through development of design models for optimizing suitable solutions. By use of Matlab/Simulink, COMSOL Multiphysics and ACE, the dynamics {{and the performance of}} the design is investigated. The aim is to have a robust system with low torque ripple absorbed by the exciter. It is shown that the six phase rectification solution has lower torque ripple for normal delay angles of the thyristor bridge compared to the three phase solution. For further development to try to reduce the torque ripple even more, one should optimize (reduce) the self and mutual inductances of the exciter rotor windings. A reduction of the parasitic magnetic energy storage in the system will reduce the torque ripple drastically...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the London Underground {{were aware of}} the {{development}} of the metadyne equipment taking place at Metropolitan-Vickers, and the potential for regenerative braking which it provided. Before committing to an untried system, they therefore built a test train, by converting six cars originally built between 1904 and 1907 for the Metropolitan Railway. The work was carried out at Acton Works in 1934. Since a single metadyne unit could be used to control four motors, and each motor car had two motors, they were formed into two-car units, with a driving cab at the outer ends. By coupling the units together, trials of a two-car, four-car and six-car train could be carried out. The metadyne unit weighed about 3 tons, and consisted of three <b>rotating</b> machines, an <b>exciter,</b> a regulator and the actual metadyne machine, which were linked together mechanically. Electrically, the traction supply was fed into the machine, and the output fed the motors, without the need for starting resistances.|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} herein {{is a part}} of {{a comprehensive}} study of the dynamic response of full-scale structures being conducted under research grant GP- 934 of the National Science Foundation. Already reported under this program are dynamic measurements on a nine-story steel frame building and a five-story reinforced concrete building. As a part of this same investigation, static and dynamic tests are under way on a steel frame structure loaded far into the plastic range, so that direct experimental evidence of the behavior of strongly nonlinear hysteretic systems will be available. These experimental studies are all accompanied by complete theoretical investigations with the object of attaining a true understanding of the relationships between analytical calculations and the actual behavior of real structures. An investigation was made of the dynamic properties of an earth dam 200 feet high, by 1200 feet long on the crest, by 1300 feet thick at the base. The dam was excited into steady-state vibrations over the frequency range 1 - 1 / 2 to 8 cycles per second by four synchronized <b>rotating</b> eccentric-mass vibration <b>exciters</b> operating on the crest in the upstream -downstream direction. Accelerations were measured on the crest and on the downstream face to indicate the natural frequencies of the dam and to estimate the shapes of the four lowest modes of vibration.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the steady-state, dynamic and control aspects of new type of {{brushless}} configuration of a doubly-fed induction machine in which the slip rings and carbon brushes are replaced by rotating power electronics and a <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter.</b> The aim is to study the stability of this novel configuration of the generator under mechanical and grid disturbances for wind power applications. The derivation, development {{and analysis of the}} steady-state model of the brushless doubly-fed induction machine with a rotating excitor and the power electronic converters mounted on the shaft and rotating with it, is studied. The study is performed at rated power of the generator between Â± 20 % slip range. Moreover unity power factor operation between Â± 20 % speed range is also discussed. Furthermore dynamic modeling and control aspects of the generator are also analyzed. The controllers were designed using Internal Model Control principles and vector control methods were used in order to control the generator in a closed-loop system. It is shown that through the use of proper feedback control, the generator behaves in a stable state both at super-synchronous and sub-synchronous speeds. Moreover Low Voltage Ride Through of the generator during symmetrical and unsymmetrical voltage dips is also investigated. Passive Resistive Network strategy is employed for Low Voltage Ride Through of the generator during symmetrical voltage dips. On the other hand, Extended Vector Control is used in order to control the negative sequence currents during unsymmetrical voltage dips. Suppression of negative sequence currents is important as they cause extra heating in the windings and affects the lifetime of the mechanical and electrical components of the generator and system due to oscillations in power and torque. In addition to the above studies a steady-state model of a single-fed induction machine is also developed and investigated where the <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> is removed and the rotor windings are short-circuited through the two rotating power electronic converters. In this way the slip power circulates in the rotor {{and with the help of}} the two rotating electronic converters, rotor current is used to magnetize the induction machine thereby improving the power factor. The steady state model is verified through experimental results. 20120914 Brushless Wind Generator with Rotating Power Electronic Converter...|$|E
40|$|The {{field circuit}} of wound-rotor {{synchronous}} machines can be supplied in various ways, including brushed and brushless excitation systems. Regardless {{of whether the}} synchronous machine {{is equipped with a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> or not, the external excitation power source necessarily injects some high-frequency harmonics into the field circuit. The frequency of these harmonics can be particularly large if Pulse-Width-Modulated (PWM) converters are used as excitation voltage supply. This paper investigates the possibility that the excitation supply harmonics can produce electrical resonance phenomena resulting in possibly harmful overvoltages. The investigation is carried out through different approaches: by experiments on a low-voltage salient-pole 20 -kVA laboratory prototype; by experiments on a large (multi-MW) round-rotor synchronous motor; through an analytical model. The results obtained from the analytical model are shown to well match measurements provided that a resistive parameter (affected by eddy-current loss effects) is properly calibrated. Another important conclusion is that the possible overvoltages due to electrical resonance would occur between internal points of the field (not between its terminals) and would not be thereby damped by conventional field circuit protection devices...|$|E
30|$|The shaft {{system of}} the GEN 1 {{consists}} of six torsional masses: a high-pressure turbine section (HP), an intermediate-pressure turbine section (IP), two low-pressure turbine section (LPA and LPB), a rotor of generator (GEN) and a <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> (EXC). Since six masses are considered in the shaft system, there are six modes of oscillation, named from Mode 0 to Mode 5. The Mode 0 represents the oscillation of the entire six masses against the power system, and it is often considered in system stability studies [3]. The other five modes are the torsional oscillation modes, and their mode shapes {{can be found in}} [15]. The compensation level of the transmission line tuned to excite Mode 2. Mode 2 has a natural frequency of 21.21 Â Hz, and it includes two polarity reversals according to the mode shapes. One polarity reversal happens between the LPA and LPB section, and the other one happens between the GEN and EXC section. So, in the time domain simulation, the excited oscillation of Mode 2 can be observed through the torsional response of LPA-LPB and GEN-EXC. The shaft {{system of the}} generators in GEN 2 is modeled as a lumped mass.|$|E
40|$|Internal {{inspection}} of pipelines {{is an important}} tool for ensuring safe and reliable delivery of fossil energy products. Current inspection systems that are propelled through the pipeline by the product flow cannot be used to inspect all pipelines because of the various physical barriers they encounter. Recent development efforts include {{a new generation of}} powered inspection platforms that crawl slowly inside a pipeline and are able to maneuver past the physical barriers that can limit inspection. At Battelle, innovative electromagnetic sensors are being designed and tested for these new pipeline crawlers. The various sensor types can be used to assess a wide range of pipeline anomalies including corrosion, mechanical damage, and cracks. The Applied Energy Systems Group at Battelle is concluding the first year of work on a projected three-year development effort. In this first year, two innovative electromagnetic inspection technologies were designed and tested. Both were based on moving high-strength permanent magnets to generate inspection energy. One system involved translating permanent magnets towards the pipe. A pulse of electric current would be induced in the pipe to oppose the magnetization according to Lenz's Law. The decay of this pulse would indicate the presence of defects in the pipe wall. This inspection method is similar to pulsed eddy current inspection methods, with the fundamental difference being {{the manner in which the}} current is generated.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A complete mathematical model for a generator system consisting of an isolated laminated salient-pole alternator, exciter and prime mover is presented, with emphasis on the inherent electromagnetic nonlinearities in the alternator and its exciter. An equivalent circuit, representing the rotor circuits accurately, has been adopted to model the al ternator in the dqo reference frame. A computer program has been developed to calculate the unsaturated parameters of the model using the machine design data. A new approach has been developed {{to account for the}} electromagnetic saturation effects on the model reactances. Consequently new saturation factors, based on the machine design particulars have been deri ved. The advantages of these saturation factors, compared with conventional factors, are that both mutual saturation effects between the main and leakage fluxes, and between the direct- and quadratureaxis fluxes are considered. A mathematical nonlinear model, utilising the new saturation factors, is presented for a system containing an isolated laminated salientpole alternator and a direct thyristor static exciter. A digital computer program has been developed to simulate the system. The predicted results, for some steady state and dynamic candi tions, showgood agreement with test results and clear improvement over those obtained if saturation is either neglected or considered using the conventional saturation factors. At high saturation levels, the conventional method of calculating the machine transformer voltages, using static saturated reactances, gives unacceptable errors. A method for calculating these voltages correctly, in models utilising the currents as state space variables, is presented using new derived dynamic saturated reactances. This dynamic reactance concept is presented in a generalised form {{so that it can be}} applied to any machine with different saturation factors. The previous mathematical model of the alternator system has been modified according to the dynamic reactance concept, and the computer program has been developed accordingly. The predicted results confirm the need to apply this concept especially to dynamic conditions characterised by high saturation levels. To extend the analysis to a wider range of loading conditions, the alternator has been modelled in the abc reference frame. The unsaturated, static and dynamic saturated reactances of the machine in this reference frame have been obtained using conventional dqo-abc transformation techniques. Starting from the fundamental machine relations, a new set of equations, in the phase reference frame, has been derived employing the new dynamic reactance concept. A comprehensive system consisting of an isolated laminated salientpole alternator, brushless exciter, thyristor divert automatic voltage regulator and a diesel prime mover has been studied. Both the alternator and the exciter have been modelled in the abc frame to comply with the nature of rectifier loading associated with the exci ter. A complete steady state and dynamic mathematical model is presented where the t r technique has been applied to the dynamic variable topology of the system electrical circuits. The model presented covers all the possible modes of operation associated with the <b>exciter</b> <b>rotating</b> bridge rectifier circuit. A digital computer program has been developed to simUlate the system. The predicted results obtained using the new set of saturation factors in conjunction with the dynamic reactance concept show good agreement with the test results. The study presented confirms the validity of the mathematical models developed for the alternator systems. Also, it supports the metlxxi by which the electromagnetic nonlinearity has been accounted for...|$|R

The second semiannual report on this project reported on experimental and modeling results. The results showed that the rotating system was more adaptable to pipeline inspection and therefore only this system will be carried into the second year of the sensor development. In the third reporting period, the rotating system inspection was further developed. Since this is a new inspection modality without published fundamentals to build upon, basic analytical and experimental investigations were performed. A closed form equation for designing rotating exciters and positioning sensors was derived from fundamental principles. Also signal processing methods were investigated for detection and assessment of pipeline anomalies. A lock in amplifier approach was chosen as the method for detecting the signals. Finally, mechanical implementations for passing tight restrictions such as plug valves were investigated. This inspection concept is new and unique; a United States patent application has been submitted. In this fourth reporting period, the rotating system inspection was further developed. A multichannel real-time data recorder system was implemented and fundamental experiments were conducted to provide data to aid in the design of the rotating magnetizer system. An unexpected but beneficial result was achieved when examining the separation between the rotating magnet and the pipe wall; separations of over an inch could be tolerated. Essentially no change in signal from corrosion anomalies could be detected for separations up to 1. 35 inches. The results presented in this report will be used to achieve the next deliverable, designs of components of the rotating inspection system that will function with inspection crawlers in a pipeline environment...|$|E
40|$|January Progress [...] A {{kick-off}} meeting {{was held in}} San Diego with Alturdyne on January 21 st. The proposed hybrid gas/electric chiller/cogenerator design concept was discussed in detail. The requirements and functionality of the key component, a variable speed, constant frequency motor/generator was presented. Variations of the proposed design were also discussed based on their technical feasibility, cost and market potential. The discussion is documented in a Trip Report. February Progress [...] After significant GRI/Alturdyne discussion regarding alternative product design concepts, the team {{made a decision to}} continue with the proposed product design, a hybrid chiller capable of also providing emergency power. The primary benefits are: (a) the flexibility and operating cost savings associated with the product's dual fuel capability and (b) the emergency power feature. A variable speed, constant frequency motor/generator would significantly increase the cost of the product while providing marginal benefit. (The variable speed, constant frequency motor generator is estimated to cost $ 25, 000 versus $ 4, 000 for a constant speed version). In addition, the interconnection requirements to the electric grid would significantly limit market penetration of the product. We will proceed with a motor/generator design capable of serving as the electric prime mover for the compressor as well as the generator for emergency power needs. This component design is being discussed with two motor manufacturers. The first generation motor/generator will not be a variable speed, constant frequency design. The variable speed, constant frequency capability can be an advancement that is included at a later time. The induction motor/synchronous generator starts as a wound rotor motor with a brushless exciter and control electronics to switch between induction mode and synchronous mode. The exciter is a three-phase exciter with three phase rotating diode assembly. In the induction motor mode, the field windings are shorted out by SCRs located across the field. In the synchronous mode, a small ct on one of the exciter leads would power the <b>rotating</b> <b>exciter</b> electronics. Upon sensing exciter current, the electronics would automatically open the SCRs allowing synchronous operation. Quotes will be obtained from American Motor and Reuland, two motor/generator vendors. March Progress [...] A product layout was completed. The width is reduced significantly from the original hybrid design because the evaporator and condenser tube in shell heat exchangers are located below the engine/motor/compressor drive-line. Alturdyne is searching for a consultant to perform a drive-line torsional analysis. This analysis is necessary to ensure that the drive-line is not subject to undue vibrations operating through its entire speed range. Much effort was directed toward motor/generator selection. A decision was made to use Reuland Electric. A motor with double-end shafts will be purchased. The design effort which will be completed at Alturdyne will involve the modification of the wound rotor motor to also provide synchronous power. Work has been completed on developing the new controller which will be utilized for the original hybrid product as well as this advanced product. Work continues toward developing a manufacturing cost estimate. A detailed bill of material will be developed for the product.
