40|$|ABSTRACT. In a {{previous}} paper, in a geometrized {{framework for the}} description of sim-ple materials with internal variables, the specific example of ferroelastic crystals with anisotropy grain-tensors a ̀ la Maruszewski was considered and the relevant structure of the entropy 1 -form was derived. In this contribution the linear morphism defined on the fibre bundle {{of the process and}} the transformation induced by the process are obtained as new results within the geometrical model. Furthermore, Clausius-Duhem inequality for these media is exploited, and, using a Maugin technique (see also Colemann-Noll proce-dure), the laws of state, the extra entropy flux and the <b>residual</b> <b>dissipation</b> inequality are worked out. Finally, following Maugin, the heat equation in the first and the second form is derived. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{adiabatic}} response for open systems governed by Lindblad evolutions. The theory determines the dependence of the response coefficients on the dephasing rates and allows for <b>residual</b> <b>dissipation</b> even when the ground state is protected by a spectral gap. We give quantum response a geometric interpretation in terms of Hilbert space projections: For a two level system and, more generally, for systems with suitable functional form of the dephasing, the dissipative and non-dissipative parts of the response are linked to a metric and to a symplectic form. The metric is the Fubini-Study metric and the symplectic form is the adiabatic curvature. When the metric and symplectic structures are compatible the non-dissipative part of the inverse matrix of response coefficients {{turns out to be}} immune to dephasing. We give three examples of physical systems whose quantum states induce compatible metric and symplectic structures on control space: The qubit, coherent states and a model of the integer quantum Hall effect.

40|$|Whispering gallery modes in GaAs disk {{resonators}} reach half {{a million}} of optical quality factor. These high Qs remain still well below the ultimate design limit set by bending losses. Here we investigate the origin of <b>residual</b> optical <b>dissipation</b> in these devices. A Transmission Electron Microscope analysis is combined with an improved Volume Current Method to precisely quantify optical scattering losses by roughness and waviness of the structures, and gauge their importance relative to intrinsic material and radiation losses. The analysis also provides a qualitative description of the surface reconstruction layer, whose optical absorption is then revealed by comparing spectroscopy experiments in air and in different liquids. Other linear and nonlinear optical loss channels in the disks are evaluated likewise. Routes are given to further improve the performances of these miniature GaAs cavities. Comment: 18 page...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, linear {{vibrating}} systems, {{in which}} the inertia and stiffness matrices are symmetric positive definite and the damping matrix is symmetric positive semi-definite, are studied. Such a system may possess undamped modes, {{in which case the}} system is said to have residual motion. Several formulae for the number of independent undamped modes, associated with purely imaginary eigenvalues of the system, are derived. The main results formulated for symmetric systems are then generalized to asymmetric and symmetrizable systems. Several examples are used to illustrate the validity and application of the present results. Key words: linear system, <b>dissipation,</b> <b>residual</b> motion 1...|$|R
40|$|We present Direct Numerical Simulations of {{decaying}} Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at low magnetic Reynolds number. The domain considered is {{bounded by}} periodic boundary {{conditions in the}} two directions perpendicular to the magnetic field and by two plane Hartmann walls in the third direction. High magnetic fields (Hartmann number of up to 896) are considered thanks to a numerical method based on a spectral code using the eigenvectors of the dissipation operator. It is found that the decay proceeds through two phases: first, energy and integral lengthscales vary rapidly during a two-dimensionalisation phase extending over about one Hartmann friction time. During this phase, {{the evolution of the}} former appears significantly more impeded by the presence of walls than that of the latter. Once the large scales are close to quasi-two dimensional, the decay results from the competition of a two-dimensional dynamics driven by dissipation in the Hartmann boundary layers and the three-dimensional dynamics of smaller scales. In the later stages of the decay, three-dimensionality subsists under the form of barrel-shaped structures. A purely quasi-two dimensional decay dominated by friction in the Hartmann layers is not reached, because of <b>residual</b> <b>dissipation</b> in the bulk. However, this dissipation is not generated by the three-dimensionality that subsists, but by residual viscous friction due to horizontal velocity gradients. Also, the energy in the velocity component aligned with the magnetic field is found to be strongly suppressed, as is transport in this direction. This results reproduces the experimental findings of Kolesnikov & Tsinober (1974). Comment: submitted to JF...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene oxide (EO) {{is used to}} {{sterilize}} Oxygenator and Tubing applied to heart surgery. Residual levels of EO and its derivatives, ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) and ethylene glycol (EG), may be hazardous to the patients. Therefore, it must be removed by the aeration process. This study aimed to estimate the minimum aeration time for these devices to attain safe limits for use (avoiding excessive aeration time) and to evaluate the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a biosensor capable of best indicating the distribution and penetration of EO gas throughout the sterilization chamber. Sterilization cycles of 2, 4, and 8 h were monitored by Bacillus atrophaeus ATCC 9372 as a biological indicator (131) and by the GFP. Residual levels of EO, ECH, and EG were determined by gas chromatography (GC), and the <b>residual</b> <b>dissipation</b> was studied. Safe limits were reached right after the sterilization process for Oxygenator and after 204 h of aeration for Tubing. In the 2 h cycle, the GFP concentration decreased from 4. 8 (+/- 3. 2) % to 7. 5 (+/- 2. 5) %. For the 4 h cycle, the GFP concentration decreased from 17. 4 (+/- 3. 0) % to 21. 5 (+/- 6. 8) %, and in the 8 h cycle, it decreased from 22. 5 (+/- 3. 2) % to 23. 9 (+/- 3. 9) %.

40|$|Various {{difficulties}} can be eXpected {{in trying}} to eXtract from eXperimental data the distribution of singularities, the f(a) function, of the energy dissipation. One {{reason is that the}} multifractal model of turbulence implies a dependence of the viscous cutoff on the singularity eXponent. It is an open question if current hot-wire probes can resolve the scales implied by eXponents a significantly less than 1. Two eXactly soluble models are used to show how spurious scaling can occur, due to finite Reynolds number effects. In the Gaussian model the true velocity signal is replaced by independent Gaussian random variables. The dissipation, defined as the square of the difference of successive variables, has trivial scaling in so far as all the moments of spatial averages of the dissipation behave asymptotically as a uniform dissipation. Still, contamination by subdominant terms requires that scaling eXponents for high-order moments be identified over an increasingly large range ofb scales. If the available range is limited by the Reynolds number, scaling eXponents for high orders will be systematically underestimated and spurious intermittency will be inferred. Burgers’ model is used to highlight further problems. At finite Reynolds numbers, regions with no small-scale activity (away from shocks) have a <b>residual</b> <b>dissipation</b> which contributes a spurious point (a= l, f(a=) 1). In addition, when the f(a) function is obtained by Legendre transform techniques, conveX hull effects generate an entire spurious segment. Finally, Burgers’ model also indicates that the relation between eXponents of structure functions and eXponents of local dissipation moments, which goes back to Kolmogorov's (1962) work, leads to an inconsistency for structure functions of low positive order. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

40|$|P>Improvements of {{a global}} state-of-the art ocean tide model are {{identified}} and quantified by applying three independent approaches, namely (i) empirical ocean tide analysis of multimission altimeter data, (ii) evaluation of GRACE data and gravity field models and (iii) high resolution hydrodynamic modelling. Although these approaches have different capabilities to sense ocean tides they obtain results which are basically consistent one with each other. The analysis of altimeter data clearly identifies significant residual amplitudes over shallow water for all major diurnal and semidiurnal constituents and the non-linear tide M- 4. GRACE data and the time-series of monthly gravity field models exhibit-on a larger scale-residual ocean tide signals over much the same areas. The analysis of dynamic residuals of hydrodynamic modelling with data assimilation proves the validity of linear dynamics in the deep ocean and shows correlation of dynamic <b>residuals</b> with energy <b>dissipation</b> in these areas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Submitted for the DFD 14 Meeting of The American Physical Society Repeated {{bouncing}} of drops on wetting and non-wetting sur- faces {{mediated by}} a persisting thin air lm JOLET DE RUITER, RUDY LAGRAAUW, DIRK VAN DEN ENDE, FRIEDER MUGELE, MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente — Liquid drops impinging onto solid surfaces undergo {{a variety of}} impact scenarios such as splashing, sticking, and bouncing, depending on impact conditions and substrate properties. Bouncing requires efficient conversion of initial kinetic energy into surface energy and back into kinetic energy. This process {{is believed to be}} limited to non-wetting, in particular superhydrophobic surfaces, for which viscous dissipation during drop-substrate contact is minimal. Here, we report a novel bouncing mechanism that applies equally to non-wetting and wetting systems for flat surfaces with contact angles down to 10 degrees. For initial impact speeds up to about 0. 5 m/s we demonstrate using dual wavelength interferometry that aqueous and non-aqueous drops remain separated from the substrate by air films of (sub) micrometer thickness at all times throughout a series of up to 16 consecutive bouncing events. We show that the purely dissipative force arising from the viscous squeeze-out of air is responsible for both the momentum transfer and for a substantial part of the <b>residual</b> energy <b>dissipation.</b> Jolet de Ruiter MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente Date submitted: 31 Jul 2014 Electronic form version 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Polymer hydrogels with {{superior}} {{strength and toughness}} are potential candidate materials for the replacement or engineering of load-bearing tissues. This manuscript reports novel tough nanocomposite hydrogels with an unusual energy dissipation mechanism based on both covalent and physical interactions between clay nanorods and polymer chains. Attapulgite (ATP) nanorods grafted with vinyl groups on the surface served as macro-crosslinkers to copolymerize with 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropane-sulfonic acid (AMPS) to form an initial nanocomposite network, which subsequently hosted the polymerization of acrylamide (AAm) monomers to generate a novel nanocomposite double network (DN) hydrogel. The morphology, swelling behavior and compressive properties of the ATP-grafted DN hydrogels were investigated {{as a function of}} ATP content (C-ATP), in comparison with the ATP-filled DN gels. With a clay content between 0. 1 wt% and 1. 0 wt%, the nanocomposite hydrogels did not fracture up to a compressive strain of 98 %, exhibiting an initial modulus (E) up to 0. 36 MPa, a compressive strength higher than 65. 7 MPa, and a work to fracture (or fracture energy) higher than 2. 6 MJ m(- 3), in comparison to 0. 19 MPa, 18. 6 MPa, and 1. 1 MJ m(- 3) for the conventional DN gels. Cyclic loading-unloading tests showed abnormal <b>residual</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> even though the rigid PAMPS network had fractured. Such viscous energy dissipation decayed during cyclic loading, and could be restored depending on time and temperature. This is related to the reversible desorption-re-adsorption of polymer chains from the clay surface. Possible reinforcing and fracture mechanisms are discussed...|$|R

Singular current layers should exist inside neutron stars. <b>Residual</b> <b>dissipation</b> in the singular current layers {{might be the}} main mechanism for the magnetic field decay. The slow decay of the field might be the clock responsible for triggering the magnetar flares. 1. The magnetic equilibrium problem An equilibrium (no convection) star might still be a good conductor and contain magnetic fields – with the magnetic stress balanced by the fluid pressure and gravity. We want to describe the generic features of such equilibrium magnetic fields. This problem was clearly formulated many years ago by Chandrasekhar and Fermi, but it remains unsolved to this day. Recent progress came from numerical work (Braithwaite & Nordlund 2005). The recent numerical work does not point out an important generic feature of the equilibrium – singular current layers. Moreover, we propose that generic equilibrium carries infinitely many singular current layers. This proposition – Generic equilibrium carries a volume-filling set of singular current layers – is our main thesis. This is indeed just a proposition. It is based on very shaky arguments. A numerical proof or refutation is needed. The author tried {{to solve the problem}} numerically, but succeeded only in 2 D, where the singular current lines are isolated rather than area-filling. Still, it appears that modern computers, if handled by professionals, are powerful enough to also solve the 3 D problem (by the relaxation technique, § 2). Since it is believed that close to equilibrium magnetic fields do exist in neutron stars and in other non-convective stars, a careful numerical study of the singularities should be worthwhile. If singularities are indeed generic, they might be responsible for some of the observed phenomena – say, magnetic field decay and triggering the magnetar flares. The singular current layer is a local feature, it can be considered without gravity. To simplify the analysis, we will also assume an incompressible constant density fluid. Then the magnetic fields B will be in equilibrium if the magnetic j × B force is balanced by the pressure gardient...|$|E
40|$|Veterinary {{antibiotics}} {{introduced into}} the environment may change the composition and functioning of soil microbial communities and promote the spreading of antibiotic resistance. Actual risks depend on the antibiotic's persistence and (bio) accessibility, which may differ between laboratory and field conditions. We examined the dissipation and sequestration of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and its main metabolites in soil under field conditions {{and how it was}} influenced by temperature, soil moisture, plant roots, and soil aggregation compared to controlled laboratory experiments. A sequential extraction accounted for easily extractable (CaCl₂-extractable) and sequestered (microwave-extractable, <b>residual)</b> SDZ fractions. <b>Dissipation</b> from both fractions was largely temperature-dependent and could be well predicted from laboratory data recorded at different temperatures. Soil moisture additionally seemed to control sequestration, being accelerated in dry soil. Sequestration, as indicated by increasing apparent distribution coefficients and decreasing rates of kinetic release into CaCl₂, governed the antibiotic's long-term fate in soil. Besides, we observed spatial gradients of antibiotic concentrations across soil aggregates and in the vicinity of roots. The former were short-lived and equilibrated due to aggregate reorganization, while dissipation of the easily extractable fraction was accelerated near roots throughout the growth period. There was little if any impact of the plants on residual SDZ concentrations...|$|R

The present study was carried out to investigate the <b>residual</b> levels and <b>dissipation</b> behavior of four insecticides, namely abamectin, thiamethoxam, spinosad, and chlorpyrifos, in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruits under Egyptian field condition. The insecticide residues were determined after application of insecticides for three times at recommended rates. The extraction of insecticide residues was carried out by using QuEChERS method. The determination of residual levels was performed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Recoveries were between 85 % and 130 %, with relative standard deviations from 1. 8 % to 17. 0 % at two fortified levels. The dissipation rates of insecticides followed first-order kinetics (Ct = 0. 2627 e- 0. 17 t, Ct = 3. 7183 e- 0. 275 t, Ct = 0. 1778 e- 0. 407 t, Ct = 0. 6074 e- 0. 11 t for abamectin, chlorpyrifos, spinosad and thiamethoxam, respectively). The values of half-life of insecticides were 4. 1, 2. 5, 1. 7, and 6. 3 d for abamectin, chlorpyrifos, spinosad and thiamethoxam, respectively.

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have {{recently}} emerged as promising material candidates for structural seismic resisting purposes. Most {{of the existing}} SMA-based strategies, however, {{are based on the}} wire or rod form of SMAs, where issues such as gripping complexity and fracture may exist. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study on an innovative type of SMA-based self-centring system, namely, a superelastic SMA ring spring system. The proposed system includes a series of inner high-strength steel (HSS) rings and outer superelastic SMA rings stacked in alternation with mating taper faces, where the resisting load is provided by the wedging action which tends to expand the outer rings and concurrently to squeeze the inner rings. The superelastic effect of the SMA offers energy dissipation and a driving force for recentring, and the frictional effect over the taper face further contributes to the overall resisting load and energy dissipation. The feasibility of the new system is carefully examined via numerical studies considering the parameters of ring thickness, taper angle, and coefficient of friction. The key hysteretic responses, including resisting load, stiffness, stress distributions, source of <b>residual</b> deformation, energy <b>dissipation,</b> and equivalent viscous damping, are discussed in detail. The behaviour of the SMA ring springs is also studied via analytical models, and the analytical predictions are found to agree well with the numerical results. Finally, two practical applications of the new system, namely self-centring HS-SMA ring spring connections, and self-centring SMA ring spring dampers, are discussed via comprehensive numerical studies.
