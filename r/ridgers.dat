40|$|Utilization {{of animal}} {{traction}} (work-bulls) in farming is being promoted among small-scale farmers {{by the government}} especially {{in the northern part}} of the country where there are favourable climatic and soil conditions. In order to determine the profitability of ownership of work-bulls among the small scale farmers, this study was conducted in Giwa local government area of Kaduna State in northern Nigeria. Data on costs and benefit were generated from sixty purposively selected work-bull owners. Simple descriptive statistics and net profit model were the analytical tools used to analyse the data. It was found that the Benefit: Cost Ratios for respondents with ox-drawn <b>ridger</b> only, those with ox-drawn <b>ridger</b> plus cultivator, those with ox drawn <b>ridger</b> plus ox-cart and those with three implements (ox drawn <b>ridger,</b> cultivator and ox- cart) were 1. 92, 1. 54, 2. 10 and 1. 79, respectively. These imply that investment in work-bulls with various types of implements is profitable. Furthermore, the payback periods for the work bulls alongside the various implements were found to be 12, 14, 10, and 8 months, respectively. It was recommended that credit should be given to the resource poor farmers to invest in this energy saving technology in view of its profitability and usefulness. This could serve as one way of encouraging entrepreneurship amongst the rural people and as well promote increased agricultural production.

The Western Province Animal Draught Power Programme has been supporting the spread of animal-powered weeding in the district through training of extension staff and farmers, organising demonstrations of weeding technology and by stimulating trade in implements. After field tests/demonstrations and farmer acceptance tests the <b>ridger</b> was selected as a potential weeder in preference to a cultivator.

The use of weeders doubled to over 100 farmers in less than two years. These new adopters favoured weeding using animals for reasons other than the reduction in cost of weeding. During demonstrations farmers stressed the advantage of ‘speed’, and the ability of the weeder to combine weed control with fertiliser coverage. Weeding is a major constraint to the expansion of the cultivated area by farmers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate some ASABE standards under real working conditions for different soils, implements, and tractors and then to compare these values measured on the field with those calculated by using ASABE 497 equations. Many experiments were carried out in the Agricultural engineering department farm at Soba. Three types of implements (disc plow, <b>ridger,</b> rotovator) with different speeds and different operating depths were used. The values for draft were measured by using a draw bar dynamometer, and the slip was measured by using two tractors with different loading conditions. The values of field efficiency were measured by calculating the total time, the time loss during the operation, the real width, implement working width and the speed. The study showed that: • The measured draft and drawbar power values were found to be matching with the calculated values using ASABE equations and the error range from 22 to 66 % for Rotovator, 38 to 55 % for disc plow and 7. 5 to 30 % for the <b>ridger.</b> • The values of slip for two types of tractors on (tilled soil) was found within the range of ASABE standards values. • The field efficiencies measured in the field for three implements (19 % for <b>ridger,</b> 23. 6 % for disc plow, 51. 9 % for rotary hoe) were lower than the standard values(70 %- 85 %) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to conduct a field survey in order to find out the values of the factors affecting the agricultural machinery operation cost in farming processes, and then substitute these values in calculating the agricultural machinery operations costs using the equations developed by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) and compare the results with the actual costs of agricultural machinery operations collected from the field. A survey and data collection were conducted via visits to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry- Department of Agricultural Engineering, the Sudanese Harvesters Company, Central Trading Company, Alneelain Insurance Co., the Agricultural Bank (Sudan), Hilat Kuku Souk for second hand agricultural machinery and the Central Bank of Sudan, beside interviews with agricultural machinery users in both public and private sectors. The study covered the calculation of agricultural machinery cost of operation for three processes; primary tillage, secondary tillage and harvesting). In all three processes, a New Holland tractor model TT 75, 3 - bottom disc plough, Faza 4 rows <b>ridger</b> and Crop Tiger Wheel-TAF 28 harvester were used. Using the ASABE equations, the cost of operation for the primary tillage by the disc plough was found to be SDG 46. 60 per feddan, SDG 34. 83 per feddan for the secondary tillage operation using <b>ridger</b> and SDG 166. 73 per feddan for the cost of harvesting using harvester, while the actual values of the average cost of operation per feddan for the primary and secondary tillage operations using disc plough and <b>ridger</b> were found to be SDG 35 and SDG 20 per feddan respectively, and the average cost of operation for wheat harvesting process using harvester was SDG 40 per feddan. The study has revealed a considerable variation in the operation cost per feddan for agricultural machines when the equations of the ASABE were applied as compared to the actual cost per feddan for agricultural processes collected from the field in Sudan, a matter which calls for further field studies to recheck validity of findings stated in this research, aiming at setting standards for the calculations of agricultural machinery cost of operation in the Sudan...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a reversible animal-drawn plough and a <b>ridger</b> is presented. The plough was developed {{on the basis of}} laboratory experiments reported earlier to determine optimum parameters for acurved implement. The basic design principles of conventional mouldboard ploughs and an ard were taken into consideration. A safety mechanism was developed which was a shear bolt. Apart from the share point, all components of the plough were made from wood, and the total mass was about 10 kg. The orientational parameters of the developed implement such as the tail angle, rake angle and the side-rake angle can be varied to suit the required soil operations and the pulling capability of the draught animals. The developed plough can also be used as a <b>ridger</b> by mounting an extra wing on the plough. Comparative field experiments were conducted in cooperation with the International Livestock Research Institute. ILRI, using the developed and traditional ard-type plough in Ethiopia. Tests were carried out in fields under various soil conditions using oxen and cows. The results showed that the draught required by the developed plough was about 30 percent less than the draught of the traditional Ethiopian ard. A frequency analysis was made to determine the dominant frequencies of the reversible plough under working conditions. The identified frequencies were 0. 5, 1. 3 and 3. 3 Hz. Preliminary assessments were made to compare the performances of a pair of cows with a pair of oxen in relation to speed and forces when pulling the developed plough. A pair of cows moved faster (an average of 0. 84 m/s) than the pair of oxen (an average of 0. 63 m/s) and exerted proportionally greater pulling forces when operating in the same field. The difference in speed is explained by the greater body weight of the cows and the correspondingly greater pull that could be exerted...|$|R
40|$|The field {{performances}} of agricultural field machineries in South -East agricultural zone of Nigeria were assessed, to enable farmers and agriculturists select suitable farm machines/implements based on soil conditions/characteristics for their agricultural activities. The various implements studied include; disc plough, 2 -gang tandem disc harrow, <b>ridger,</b> rotovator and 6 -row combine seed planter. Three different makes and models of tractors namely: New Holland (model-NH 5610 SE and capacity- 55. 9 kw), Massey Ferguson (model-MF 430 E and capacity- 55. 2 kw) and Mahindra (model-NH 7570 E and capacity- 55. 9 kw) with 3 - point hitch systems and {{average age of}} 1. 3 years were used to study the field {{performances of}} each of the implements, in five different states that made up the study area. The field performances studied include; implements working speed, operation time, depth of cut, effective and theoretical field capacities, field efficiency, fuel consumption rate, implement power requirements, and wheel slippage, under different soil conditions. Results obtained revealed that the disc plough had field efficiency range of 85. 74 % to 88. 55 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 846 to 1. 164 ha/hr and 0. 961 to 1. 319 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (ploughing) efficiency was obtained in loamy-sandy soil when the plough was operated with the Massey Ferguson tractor. Harrow recorded field efficiency range of 80. 17 to 91. 38 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 931 to 1. 458 ha/hr and 1. 151 to 1. 667 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (harrowing) efficiency was obtained on sandy-clay soil by New Holland tractor. <b>Ridger</b> recorded 83. 65 to 88. 82 % field efficiency, 0. 932 to 1. 322 ha/hr effective capacity and 1. 073 to 1. 504 ha/hr theoretical field capacity; and sandy-clay gave the highest field (ridging) efficiency when operated with a New Holland tractor. The rotovator had field efficiency range of 81. 10 to 89. 81 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 759 to 0. 902 ha/hr and 0. 758 to 1. 039 ha/hr respectively; and the highest pulverizing efficiency was achieved on the clay-loam soil with a Massey Ferguson tractor. The planter recorded 80. 63 to 89. 37 field efficiency, 1. 012 to 1. 481 ha/hr effective field capacity and theoretical field capacity of 1. 22 to 1. 716 ha/hr. Ploughing gave the highest average fuel consumption rate of 22. 72 L/ha (8. 89 L/hr), followed by harrowing with average consumption of 19. 57 L/ha (8. 04 L/hr), ridging recorded 19. 42 L/ha (7. 97 L/hr), rotovator had 16. 79 L/ha (7. 19 L/hr) and least was planter with average consumption rate of 15. 10 L/ha (6. 26 L/hr). More so, all implements recorded highest tyre slippage in sandy-clay soil, followed by loamy-sandy and the least slippage was recorded in the clay-loam soil. Results finally revealed that the highest draft force (10. 8 kN/m) was obtained by the plough, followed by the harrow and <b>ridger</b> with equal draft force values of 10. 5 kN/m respectively and least draft was recorded by the rotovator (5. 1 kN/m) ...|$|R
