50|$|<b>Revospirone</b> (Bay Vq 7813) is an azapirone drug {{which was}} {{patented}} as a veterinary tranquilizer but was never marketed. It {{acts as a}} selective 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. Similarly to other azapirones such as buspirone, <b>revospirone</b> produces 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP) as an active metabolite. As a result, it also acts as an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist to an extent.|$|E
50|$|Metabolism of azapirones {{occurs in}} the liver and they are {{excreted}} in urine and feces. A common metabolite of several azapirones including buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, <b>revospirone,</b> and tandospirone is 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP). 1-PP possesses 5-HT1A partial agonist and α2-adrenergic antagonist actions and likely contributes overall mostly to side effects.|$|E
