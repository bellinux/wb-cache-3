50|$|A cheese {{takes the}} form of a {{flattened}} cylinder, with a diameter of 9 - 12 cm and a thickness of 3 - 4½ cm. It generally weighs 250 - 350 g. Chevrotin features a “fine croûte blanche rosée“ coating of soft reddish-brown, not unlike the rind of such better known cheeses as Munster. Chevrotin appears similar to <b>Reblochon</b> which is made in the same regions of Savoy, applying similar processes, but which is produced lower down the valleys using cow’s milk.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Reblochon</b> {{derives from}} the word [...] "reblocher" [...] which when {{literally}} translated means [...] "to pinch a cow's udder again". This refers {{to the practice of}} holding back some of the milk from the first milking. During the 14th century, the landowners would tax the mountain farmers according to the amount of milk their herds produced. The farmers would therefore not fully milk the cows until after the landowner had measured the yield. The milk that remains is much richer, and was traditionally used by the dairymaids to make their own cheese.|$|E

As proof of its being well-aged in an airy cellar, the rind of this cheese {{is covered with a}} fine white mould. The optimal period to savour this cheese is between May and September after it has been aged six to eight weeks. It is also excellent from March to December.|$|E
50|$|Lardons are {{frequently}} used in French cuisine to flavor salads, stews (such as beef bourguignon and Julia Child's coq au vin), quiches (quiche Lorraine), potatoes, omelettes and other dishes. A particular Parisian use of lardons {{is in the}} salade aux lardons, a wilted salad (often made with frisée (endive) lettuce) in which the lettuce leaves are wilted slightly {{by the addition of}} still-hot lardons and hot vinaigrette. A nineteenth-century recipe for a pie à la chasse calls for beef to be larded with lardons made of ham and bacon. A traditional dish from the Alsace region is the tarte flambée, a thin pizza-like bread covered with crème fraiche, onion, and lardons. A regional specialty from the Savoie is tartiflette, which is made with potatoes, <b>reblochon</b> cheese, cream, and lardons.|$|E
50|$|Geotrichum candidum {{can be used}} commercially to {{inoculate}} wash-rinds and bloomy rind cheeses. Cultures {{can be added to}} milk, brine or sprayed onto cheese surface. The optimum pH range for growth on cheese ranges from 4.4 to 6.7. The fungus colonizes nearly the entire surface of the cheese during the early stages of ripening. It is found on soft cheeses like Camembert cheese and semi-hard cheese Saint-Nectaire and <b>Reblochon.</b> For the Camembert cheese the fungi grows {{on the outside of the}} cheese forming a rind. The fungus is responsible for the uniform, white, velvety coat on Saint-Marcellin cheese. Lipases and proteases from G. candidum release fatty acids and peptides that provide the cheese with distinctive flavors. Geotrichum candidum reduces the bitterness in Camembert cheese through the activity of the aminopeptidases that hydrolyze low molecular weight hydrophobic peptides. Aminopeptidases also contributes an aroma in traditional Norman Camembert. The fungus also neutralize the curd by catabolizing lactic acid produced by bacteria. Geotrichum candidum prepares the cheese for colonization of other acid sensitive bacteria such as Brevibacterium. The fungus inhibits growth of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. Commercial strains of G. candidum are available for cheese ripening.|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{collaborative}} {{studies from}} our laboratories reveal the extensive biodiversity of the microflora of {{the surfaces of}} smear-ripened cheeses. Two thousand five hundred ninety-seven strains of bacteria and 2, 446 strains of yeasts {{from the surface of}} the smear-ripened cheeses Limburger, <b>Reblochon,</b> Livarot, Tilsit, and Gubbeen, isolated at three or four times during ripening, were identified; 55 species of bacteria and 30 species of yeast were found. The microfloras of the five cheeses showed many similarities but also many differences and interbatch variation. Very few of the commercial smear microorganisms, deliberately inoculated onto the cheese surface, were reisolated and then mainly from the initial stages of ripening, implying that smear cheese production units must have an adventitious "house" flora. Limburger cheese had the simplest microflora, containing two yeasts, Debaryomyces hansenii and Geotrichum candidum, and two bacteria, Arthrobacter arilaitensis and Brevibacterium aurantiacum. The microflora of Livarot was the most complicated, comprising 10 yeasts and 38 bacteria, including many gram-negative organisms. <b>Reblochon</b> also had a very diverse microflora containing 8 yeasts and 13 bacteria (excluding gram-negative organisms which were not identified), while Gubbeen had 7 yeasts and 18 bacteria and Tilsit had 5 yeasts and 9 bacteria. D. hansenii was by far the dominant yeast, followed in order by G. candidum, Candida catenulata, and Kluyveromyces lactis. B. aurantiacum was the dominant bacterium and was found in every batch of the 5 cheeses. The next most common bacteria, in order, were Staphylococcus saprophyticus, A. arilaitensis, Corynebacterium casei, Corynebacterium variabile, and Microbacterium gubbeenense. S. saprophyticus was mainly found in Gubbeen, and A. arilaitensis was found in all cheeses but not in every batch. C. casei was found in most batches of <b>Reblochon,</b> Livarot, Tilsit, and Gubbeen. C. variabile was found in all batches of Gubbeen and <b>Reblochon</b> but in only one batch of Tilsit and in no batch of Limburger or Livarot. Other bacteria were isolated in low numbers from each of the cheeses, suggesting that each of the 5 cheeses has a unique microflora. In Gubbeen cheese, several different strains of the dominant bacteria were present, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and many of the less common bacteria were present as single clones. The culture-independent method, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, resulted in identification of several bacteria which were not found by the culture-dependent (isolation and rep-PCR identification) method. It was thus a useful complementary technique to identify other bacteria in the cheeses. The gross composition, the rate of increase in pH, and the indices of proteolysis were different in most of the cheeses...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of French fungus-ripened cheeses is due partly to {{the succession of}} fungi that colonize the cheese during ripening. Geotrichum candidum appears {{in the early stages}} of ripening on soft cheeses such as Camembert and semihard cheeses such as St. Nectaire and <b>Reblochon.</b> Its lipases and proteases promote flavor development, and its aminopeptidases reduce bitterness imparted by low-molecular-weight peptides in cheese. We assessed the genetic {{diversity of}} G. candidum strains by using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR correlated with phenotypic tests for carbon assimilation and salt tolerance. Strains were isolated from milk, curd, and cheese collected in seven major cheesemaking regions of France. Sixty-four isolates were characterized. We found high genetic diversity of G. candidum even within the same cheesemaking regions. Strains did not group according to region. All of the strains from the Haute-Savoie were able to assimilate lactate as the sole source of carbon, while lactate assimilation varied among strains from the Auvergne. Strains varied in d-mannitol assimilation, and none used citrate as the sole source of carbon. Yeast-like colony morphology predominated in <b>Reblochon,</b> while all of the strains isolated from St. Nectaire were filamentous.

40|$|Over the centuries, cheesemakers have {{optimized}} {{production techniques}} {{in a manner}} that selected empirically for native strains of microorganisms that produced the best cheeses. The diversity of fungal-ripened cheeses is due partly to the fungi that colonize the cheese during ripening. We have documented the sequential appearance of microorganisms on the rind and in the curd of a St. Nectaire-type cheese over a 60 -day ripening period using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy of stained paraffin sections. Geotrichum candidum appears at the early stages of ripening on soft cheeses such as Camembert and semi-hard cheeses such as St. Nectaire and <b>Reblochon.</b> Its lipases and proteases promote flavor development, and its aminopeptidases reduce bitterness imparted by low molecular weight peptides in cheese. Native strains of G. candidum were isolated from milk, curd and cheese collected in seven major cheese-making regions of France. We used Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) to differentiate the isolates of G. candidum to the strain level. The genetic diversity study was correlated with phenotypic tests for carbon assimilation, salt tolerance, and aminopeptidase activity. We found high genetic diversity of G. candidum even within the same cheese-making regions. Strains did not group according to region. Aminopeptidase tests showed diversity between cheese types, with the strains from St. Nectaire having high activity and strains from <b>Reblochon</b> having little or no activity. The results of carbon assimilation and salt tolerance tests suggest that cheese-making technologies play a role in strain selection. Our study reveals an enormous diversity of G. candidum that has been empirically selected through the centuries by the cheese-makers of France. Native strains of G. candidum could provide a rich source of cheese ripening enzymes for developing aroma and texture. Since much of the flavor development associated with cheese ripening is due to microbial activity {{it seems likely that the}} diversity of G. candidum strains that we have found may contribute to the acknowledged diversity of flavor found in French cheeses. ...|$|E
