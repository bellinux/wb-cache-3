5|$|In 1341–1347 the Byzantine Empire was {{plunged into}} a {{protracted}} civil war between the regency for Emperor John V Palaiologos under Anna of Savoy and his intended guardian John VI Kantakouzenos. The neighbours of the Byzantines {{took advantage of the}} civil war, and while Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia sided with John VI Kantakouzenos, Ivan Alexander backed John V Palaiologos and his regency. Although the two Balkan rulers picked opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war, they maintained their alliance with each other. As the price for Ivan Alexander's support, the regency for John V Palaiologos ceded him the city of Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine important fortresses in the <b>Rhodope</b> <b>Mountains</b> in 1344. This peaceful turnover constituted the last major success of Ivan Alexander's foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the <b>Rhodope</b> <b>Mountains).</b> At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting {{that he would be}} a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E

5|$|In 1344, the regency {{concluded}} a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required {{the surrender of}} Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the <b>Rhodope</b> <b>mountains,</b> switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and {{the bulk of his}} army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000men.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian forces {{commanded}} by Ivan the Russian managed {{to withstand the}} four-month siege of Plovdiv undertaken by Andronikos III Palaiologos, claimant to the Byzantine throne, and his Bulgarian ally Voysil, despot of Kopsis. In their attempts to capture the city, the Byzantines employed German specialists to construct a siege machine, from which they fired with crossbows at the Bulgarian defenders. Despite the elaborate siege tactics, {{by the summer of}} 1323 the Bulgarians had not only retained the city, but also launched raids on nearby Byzantine-held fortresses in the <b>Rhodope</b> <b>Mountains,</b> such as Stenimachos (modern Asenovgrad) and Tsepina. Plovdiv was lost, however, to the Byzantines soon thereafter. As Ivan's forces were leaving the city to meet the Bulgarian garrison that was to replace them, the pro-Byzantine inhabitants of Plovdiv opened the city gates and let a covert Byzantine detachment in.|$|E
5|$|To enter Northern Greece, the German {{army had}} to cross the <b>Rhodope</b> <b>Mountains,</b> which offered few river valleys or {{mountain}} passes capable of accommodating the movement of large military units. Two invasion courses were located west of Kyustendil; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the Struma river valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain and a formidable defence system covered the few available roads. The Struma and Nestos rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, {{as part of the}} larger Metaxas Line. This system of concrete pillboxes and field fortifications, constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, was built on principles {{similar to those of the}} Maginot Line. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defence positions.|$|E

5|$|Ivan Shishman is {{the most}} {{prominent}} medieval ruler in Bulgarian folklore. His name is heard {{in a number of}} legends, myths, tales and songs. He is represented as a heroic ruler who fought and died for his country, facing overwhelming enemy forces. There are a number of places throughout Bulgaria named after the him, ranging from castles and ruins to rocks, caves and localities. That legendary “geography” is mainly concentrated in the region of Sofia, Ihtiman and Samokov, though it extends to the <b>Rhodope</b> <b>Mountains,</b> Sredna Gora, Vratsa, Pleven, Prilep, Varna, etc. Near Samokov are the ruins of “Shishman's Fortress” with the emperor's wells, which reputedly spouted from the ruler's seven wounds. Further north, along the cliffs and heights of the Iskar Gorge, are “Shishman's Holes”, the caves where he hid while fighting the Ottomans for seven years. Other related toponyms usually associated with the emperor's last stand are Kokalyane (derived from kokal, meaning “bone”), Cherepish (from cherep, “skull”) and Lyutibrod (“Fierce Ford”), all thought to be hinting at the fate of the perished Bulgarian troops.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Shishman was proclaimed emperor {{after the}} death of his father on 17 February 1371, when he was in his early 20s. Ivan Shishman {{inherited}} only parts of his father's realm: he ruled the lands between the Iskar River and Silistra, the valley of Sofia, parts of the <b>Rhodope</b> <b>mountains</b> and northern Thrace. To the west, the areas centred around Vidin recognised Ivan Sratsimir as emperor of Bulgaria, while to the east, the Principality of Karvuna, encompassing the coastal strip between the Danube Delta and Cape Emine and under the rule of despot Dobrotitsa, did not recognise the authority of the emperor of Tarnovo either. Contemporary chroniclers such as Johann Schiltberger speak of three regions, all of which were called Bulgaria. Thus, the country was divided on the eve of the Ottoman invasion, despite Ivan Shishman's claims in his royal charters. In these, he styled himself as a primary emperor in an attempt to emphasise the existence of a hierarchy among the rulers of the three Bulgarias. However, that hierarchy remained only in paper; to further assert their independence from Tarnovo, both Ivan Sratsimir and Dobrotitsa separated their dioceses from the Bulgarian Patriarchate in Tarnovo. According to Fine, immediately {{after the death}} of Ivan Alexander, Ivan Sratsimir tried to conquer the whole of Bulgaria. He was able to capture Sofia and managed to hold the city for one or two years. The rivalry between the two brothers for Sofia had a strong tradition in the Bulgarian historiography since the time of Konstantin Jireček, but it has been dismissed by many modern Bulgarian historians.|$|E

25|$|Considering its {{relatively}} small area, Bulgaria has variable and complex climate. The country occupies the southernmost {{part of the}} continental climatic zone, with small areas in the south falling within the Mediterranean climatic zone. The continental zone is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed Danubian Plain. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases {{during the second half}} of summer and produces hot and dry weather. Bulgaria is subdivided into five climatic zones: continental zone (Danubian Plain, Pre-Balkan and the higher valleys of the Transitional geomorphological region); transitional zone (Upper Thracian Plain, most of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the lower Sub-Balkan valleys); continental-Mediterranean zone (the southernmost areas of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the eastern <b>Rhodope</b> <b>Mountains,</b> Sakar and Strandzha); Black Sea zone along the coastline with an average length of 30–40km inland; and alpine zone in the mountains above 1000m altitude (central Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, western <b>Rhodope</b> <b>Mountains,</b> etc.).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the serpentine areas near the villages Parvenetz, Hrabrino, Markovo and Cherven in the Central <b>Rhodopes</b> <b>Mountains.</b> The study area is assigned to the transitional-mediterranean vegetation zone with dominance of mesophilous montane-balkan vegetation. The primary plant cover is highly disturbed, transformed into degraded “shibljak ” communities. The analysis of the serpentine flora of the Central <b>Rhodopes</b> <b>Mountains</b> revealed the presence of 14 taxa of conservation importance. Amongst them 12 are endemics: 9 Balkan and 3 Bulgarian endemics. The species Anthemis rumelica (DC) Ferdinand is included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants. The distribution of the Onosma thracica Velen. in the central Rhodopes Mts. was confirmed. The serpentine terrains are highly influenced by the anthropogenic impact – reforestation, tourism, ploughing of the fertile alluvial soils, cattle-breeding.
