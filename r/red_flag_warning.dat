50|$|A <b>Red</b> <b>Flag</b> <b>Warning</b> is a {{forecast}} warning {{issued by the}} United States National Weather Service to inform area firefighting and land management agencies that conditions are ideal for wildland fire combustion, and rapid spread. After drought conditions, when humidity is very low, and especially when there are high or erratic winds which may include lightning as a factor, the <b>Red</b> <b>Flag</b> <b>Warning</b> becomes a critical statement for firefighting agencies. These agencies often alter their staffing and equipment resources dramatically to accommodate the forecast risk. To the public, a <b>Red</b> <b>Flag</b> <b>Warning</b> means high fire danger with increased probability of a quickly spreading vegetation fire in the area within 24 hours.|$|E

Yellow and blue <b>flag</b> <b>warnings</b> of psychological factors should be noted. A psychological opinion of patients with substantial psychological distress could be sought. Advice may be offered on the benign nature of non-specific LBP. The person {{should be encouraged to}} be physically active and to continue with normal activities as far as possible. A structured exercise programme, that includes aerobic activity, movement instruction, muscle strengthening, postural control and stretching, should be devised. A combined exercise and psychological treatment programme that includes a cognitive behavioural approach can be considered in patients with significant disability or substantial psychological distress. A course of acupuncture may also be added. Manual therapy, including spinal manipulation, could be considered. Paracetamol should be the first medication option. If this is inadequate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or weak opioid, or both, can be added. Individual risks for side-effects and the patient's preference should be taken into account. Strong opioids should be considered in patients in severe pain, but for short-term use only. Antidepressants and gabapentine or pregabolin can be considered when there is a neurogenic component of the pain. Consider obtaining a surgical opinion on patients who have completed an optimal package of care and who still have persistent severe non-specific LBP. Progressive neurological fallout requires a surgical opinion. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{comprehensiveness}} {{of physical}} therapists' {{adherence to the}} guidelines for <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> documentation for patients with low back pain has not previously been described. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to describe that comprehensiveness. Red <b>flags</b> are <b>warning</b> signs that suggest that physician referral may be warranted. Clinic charts for 160 patients with low back pain seen at 6 outpatient physical therapy clinics were retrospectively reviewed, noting the presence or absence of 11 <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> items. Seven of the 11 <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> items were documented over 98 % of the time. Most charts (96. 3 %) had at least 64 % of the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> items documented. Documentation of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> was comprehensive in some areas but lacking in others. Red flags that were regularly documented included age over 50, bladder dysfunction, history of cancer, immune suppression, night pain, history of trauma, saddle anesthesia, and lower extremity neurological deficit. The <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> not regularly documented included weight loss, recent infection, and fever/chills. Factors influencing item documentation comprehensiveness are discussed, and suggestions are provided to enhance the completeness of recording patient examination data. The study results provide a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> documentation benchmark for clinicians working with patients with low back pain and they lay the groundwork for future research...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Our {{aim was to}} {{identify}} which clinical features have value in confirming or excluding the possibility of serious infection in children presenting to ambulatory care settings in developed countries. METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched electronic databases (Medline, Embase, DARE, CINAHL), reference lists of relevant studies, and contacted experts {{to identify}} articles assessing clinical features of serious infection in children. 1939 potentially relevant studies were identified. Studies were {{selected on the basis}} of six criteria: design (studies of diagnostic accuracy or prediction rules), participants (otherwise healthy children aged 1 month to 18 years), setting (ambulatory care), outcome (serious infection), features assessed (assessable in ambulatory care setting), and sufficient data reported. Quality assessment was based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria. We calculated likelihood ratios for the presence (positive likelihood ratio) or absence (negative likelihood ratio) of each clinical feature and pre-test and post-test probabilities of the outcome. Clinical features with a positive likelihood ratio of more than 5. 0 were deemed <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> (ie, <b>warning</b> signs for serious infection); features with a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0. 2 were deemed rule-out signs. FINDINGS: 30 studies were included in the analysis. Cyanosis (positive likelihood ratio range 2. 66 - 52. 20), rapid breathing (1. 26 - 9. 78), poor peripheral perfusion (2. 39 - 38. 80), and petechial rash (6. 18 - 83. 70) were identified as <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> in several studies. Parental concern (positive likelihood ratio 14. 40, 95 % CI 9. 30 - 22. 10) and clinician instinct (positive likelihood ratio 23. 50, 95 % CI 16. 80 - 32. 70) were identified as strong <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> in one primary care study. Temperature of 40 degrees C or more has value as a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> in settings with a low prevalence of serious infection. No single clinical feature has rule-out value but some combinations can be used to exclude the possibility of serious infection-for example, pneumonia is very unlikely (negative likelihood ratio 0. 07, 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 46) if the child is not short of breath and there is no parental concern. The Yale Observation Scale had little value in confirming (positive likelihood ratio range 1. 10 - 6. 70) or excluding (negative likelihood ratio range 0. 16 - 0. 97) the possibility of serious infection. INTERPRETATION: The <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for serious infection that we identified should be used routinely, but serious illness will still be missed without effective use of precautionary measures. We now need to identify the level of risk at which clinical action should be taken.

50|$|A {{separate}} but less imminent forecast may include a Fire Weather Watch, which is issued to alert fire and land management agencies {{to the possibility}} that Red Flag conditions may exist beyond the first forecast period (12 hours). The watch is issued generally 12 to 48 hours in advance of the expected conditions, but can be issued up to 72 hours in advance if the NWS agency is reasonably confident. The term “Fire Weather Watch” is headlined in the routine forecast and issued as a product. That watch then remains in effect until it expires, is canceled, or upgraded to a <b>Red</b> <b>Flag</b> <b>Warning.</b>|$|E
50|$|Record {{setting heat}} in the region, and a <b>Red</b> <b>Flag</b> <b>Warning</b> from the National Weather Service {{set the stage for}} an {{explosive}} fire situation. In the early afternoon hours of Tuesday, June 11, 2013, beginning before 2:00 p.m. MDT, reports of a wildfire in the Black Forest area reached 9-1-1 dispatchers. The initial 9-1-1 call came from Gregg Cawlfield, reporting a small structure fire. Cell phone video he captured shows the fire started as a small, localized event. The record heat and high winds quickly spread the flames to several hundred acres. As of June 20, the investigation into the cause and timeline of events continued.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of June 4, a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> <b>warning</b> was issued by the Anchorage Weather Service Forecast Office, due to high winds, high temperatures, and low humidity. The fire {{continued}} to rapidly spread through the canopy of the forest. The fire reached the northeast shore of Big Lake by the afternoon. The fire had burned 12000 acres. The initial command and control center was placed at Houston High School, about three miles southeast of the ignition point of the fire. As the fire and the response from local, state and federal authorities grew, a unified command structure was established at Creekside Plaza in Wasilla, Alaska, about 12 miles further east.

50|$|A {{forestry}} technician {{with the}} U.S. Forest Service, Terry Barton, set {{the fire in}} a campfire ring during a total burn ban triggered by a National Weather Service <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> <b>warning.</b> Barton's claim that she was attempting to burn a letter from her estranged husband was disputed by one of her teenage daughters who testified that a psychology teacher had told Ms. Barton to write her feelings in a letter and burn it. Many locals believe she set the fire on purpose so she could stay home and fight a local Colorado fire instead of being called to fight fires in other states, such as Arizona or California. This would enable her {{to be with her}} kids that summer. According to radio talk show host Glenn Sacks, investigators also speculated that Barton started the fire so she could be a hero for putting it out and saving the forest. The fire quickly spread out of the campfire ring and eventually torched over 138000 acre and burned across four different counties. A federal grand jury indicted Barton on four felony counts of arson.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and descriptively compare the <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> endorsed in guidelines for the detection of serious pathology in patients presenting with low back pain to primary care. Method: We searched databases, the World Wide Web and contacted experts aiming to find the multidisciplinary clinical guideline in low back pain in primary care, and selected the most recent one per country. We extracted data on the number and type of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for identifying patients with higher likelihood of serious pathology. Furthermore, we extracted data on whether or not accuracy data (sensitivity/specificity, predictive values, etc.) were presented to support the endorsement of specific <b>red</b> <b>flags.</b> Results: We found 21 discrete guidelines all published between 2000 and 2015. One guideline could not be retrieved and after selecting one guideline per country we included 16 guidelines in our analysis from 15 different countries and one for Europe as a whole. All guidelines focused on the management of patients with low back pain in a primary care or multidisciplinary care setting. Five guidelines presented <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> in general, i. e., not related to any specific disease. Overall, we found 46 discrete <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> related to the four main categories of serious pathology: malignancy, fracture, cauda equina syndrome and infection. The majority of guidelines presented two <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for fracture (‘major or significant trauma’ and ‘use of steroids or immunosuppressors’) and two for malignancy (‘history of cancer’ and ‘unintentional weight loss’). Most often pain at night or at rest was also considered as a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> for various underlying pathologies. Eight guidelines based their choice of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> on consensus or previous guidelines; five did not provide any reference to support the choice of <b>red</b> <b>flags,</b> three guidelines presented a reference in general, and data on diagnostic accuracy was rarely provided. Conclusion: A wide variety of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> was presented in guidelines for low back pain, with a lack of consensus between guidelines for which <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> to endorse. Evidence for the accuracy of recommended <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> was lacking. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Aims to {{determine}} whether <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> can be helpful for external auditors in detecting fraudulent financial reporting. The research explores whether external auditors demographic factors affect external auditors’ perception {{about the ability of}} <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> to detect fraudulent financial reporting in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach – Data was collected using a questionnaire that was pretested by a pilot study. A questionnaire was then distributed to a sample of 100 external auditors working in different audit firms in Egypt and having different years of experience. The sample of external auditors was randomly selected. Findings – According to external auditors’ opinion, <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are helpful in detecting fraud. Our research didn’t support the effect of external auditors’ experience and type of audit office on auditors’ perception about <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> ability to detect fraudulent financial reporting. Research Limitations – two external auditors from the big 4 international audit firms filled in the questionnaire, thus our results can’t be generalized to all audit firms in Egypt. There can also be other <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> in the literature that aren’t mentioned in the research study. Originality/value - Our research included a list of specific <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for fraudulent financial reporting that were highly accepted by the sample of external auditors in our study. These specific <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> can be used in conjunction with SAS 99 <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> to enhance external auditors’ ability in detecting fraudulent financial reporting. The research also ranked all <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for fraudulent financial reporting according to their relative importance based on external auditor opinion which can help auditors to focus their efforts more on high quality <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> during brainstorming sessions which will in turn facilitate fraud detection. Future research should be more directed toward listing other <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> for fraudulent financial reporting in the literature and should test them using other methods like experiments or interviews. The list of <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> presented in our research can for a good base for future researchers...|$|R
