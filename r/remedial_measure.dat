40|$|The <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> in the {{protection}} of the environment. This thesis focus on the <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> which belong to legal instruments and create {{an integral part of the}} public law. The public bodies, which are responsible for the enforcement of public interests, are in charge of enforcement of <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> to be done. As in the international law, the state is primarily responsible for remedying of damages arising from activities under its jurisdiction. Despite the <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> are incorporated into almost all legal enactments, the quality of the legislature is rather low and this legal tool has been beyond the academical interest. The <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> represent one of the most important instruments of the environment protection and are closely connected with the principles of the environment protection, i. e. the principle of the sustainable development, the polluter- pays principle, the preventive principle and the principle of the State responsibility. The <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> create a part of the measures within the environment protection, which primarily work as subsequent measures and partly as continuous and preventive ones. The <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> comprise different kinds of measures, the main goal of which is to remedy changes which are considered to be undesired from the legal and [...] ...|$|R

When to the noble opened heart, as to such heart they alone do, all noble things began to grow visible; and the {{difference}} between just and unjust, between true and false, between work and sham-work, between speech and jargon, was once more, what to our happier Fathers it used to be, infinite,--as between a Heavenly thing and an Infernal: the one a thing which you were not to do, which you were wise not to attempt doing; which it were better for you to have a millstone tied round your neck, and be cast into the sea, than concern yourself with doing!--Brothers, it will not be a Morrison's Pill, or <b>remedial</b> <b>measure,</b> that will bring all this about for us.|$|E

Unluckily we have none such; unluckily the Heavens themselves, in their rich pharmacopoeia, contain none such. There will no 'thing' be done that will cure you. There will a radical universal alteration of your regimen and way of life take place; there will a most agonising divorce between you and your chimeras, luxuries and falsities, take place; a most toilsome, all-but 'impossible' return to Nature, and her veracities and her integrities, take place: that so the inner fountains of life may again begin, like eternal Light-fountains, to irradiate and purify your bloated, swollen, foul existence, drawing nigh, as at present, to nameless death!

60|$|Whatever was done, {{during that}} period of time to which I have alluded, by the {{majority}} of the Council, Mr. Hastings considered himself as having nothing to do with, on the plea of his being a dissentient member: a principle which, like other principles, I shall take some notice of by-and-by. Colonel Monson and General Clavering died soon after, and Mr. Hastings obtained a majority in the Council, and was then, as he calls it, restored to his authority; so that any evil that could be done by evil men under that evil system could have lasted but for a very short time indeed. From that moment, Mr. Hastings, in my opinion, became responsible for every act done in Council, while he was there, which he did not resist, and for every engagement which he did not oppose. For your Lordships will not bear that miserable jargon which you have heard, shameful to office and to official authority, that a man, when, he happens not to find himself in a majority upon any measure, may think himself excusable for the total neglect of his duty; that in such a situation he is not bound to propose anything that it might be proper to propose, or to resist anything that it might be proper to resist. What would be the inference from such an assumption? That he can never act in a commission; that, unless a man has the supreme power, he is not responsible for anything he does or neglects to do. This is another principle which your Lordships will see constantly asserted and constantly referred to by Mr. Hastings. Now I do contend, that, notwithstanding his having been in a minority, if there was anything to be done that could prevent oppressive consequences, he was bound to do that thing; and that he was bound to propose every possible <b>remedial</b> <b>measure.</b> This proud, rebellious proposition against the law, that any one individual in the Council may say that he is responsible for nothing, because he is not the whole Council, calls for your Lordships' strongest reprobation.|$|E

50|$|The {{process begins}} by {{extending}} a formal invitation to an astrologer {{to perform an}} Ashtamangala Prasna. The astrologer then fixes a date for the Prasna based {{on the principles of}} electional astrology. The services of two astrologers are required for conducting the Prasna. On the day fixed for the Prasna, a priest would perform a puja of the zodiac. During that time the main astrologer would ask a girl or boy to keep the gold coin randomly in one of the twelve houses drawn on a wooden plank placed before the astrologer. Based on the house in which the coin was placed and on certain numbers computed during the process, the question-answer session begins. The full session may extend up to two days. After full diagnosis, <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> are finalized {{on the last day of}} Prasna. A person for performing the <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> is also finalized.
