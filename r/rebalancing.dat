40|$|In {{recent years}} much {{work has been}} carried out to design and analyse online {{investment}} strategies based on constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolios. A constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio is a sequential investment strategy that maintains fixed through time, trading period by trading period, the wealth distribution among a set of assets. In this framework, Cover proposed the universal portfolio, which is competitive with the best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio determined in hindsight, i. e. the constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio obtained by assuming perfect knowledge of future stock prices. However, the constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio is designed to deal with the portfolio selection problem in the case where no additional information concerning the stock market, is available. To overcome this limitation, Cover and Ordentlich proposed the state constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio, which is capable of appropriately exploiting the available side-information concerning the stock market. In this paper we study and analyse the topic introduced by Cover and Ordentlich and focus our attention on the interplay between constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolios and side-information. We introduce a mathematical framework to deal with the constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio in the case where side-information, concerning the stock market, is available. The mathematical framework defines and analyses the mixture best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio, which we propose as the investment benchmark to be considered in the case where side-information, concerning the stock market, is available. The mixture best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio outperforms the best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio by an exponential factor in terms of the achieved wealth and therefore offers an interesting opportunity for side-information specialized online investment algorithms. We describe a new online investment algorithm that exploits the definition of the mixture best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio and the available side-information. The performance of the proposed online investment algorithm is investigated through a set of numerical experiments concerning four major stock market data sets, namely DJIA, S&P 500, TSE and NYSE. The results emphasize the relevance of the proposed online investment strategy and underline the central role {{of the quality of the}} side-information in outperforming the best constant <b>rebalanced</b> portfolio.

25|$|The <b>rebalancing</b> and re-indexing of {{leveraged}} ETFs {{may have}} considerable costs when markets are volatile. The <b>rebalancing</b> {{problem is that}} the fund manager incurs trading losses because he needs to buy when the index goes up and sell when the index goes down in order to maintain a fixed leverage ratio. A 2.5% daily change in the index will for example reduce value of a -2x bear fund by about 0.18% per day, which means that {{about a third of the}} fund may be wasted in trading losses within a year (1-(1-0.18%)252=36.5%). Investors may however circumvent this problem by buying or writing futures directly, accepting a varying leverage ratio. A more reasonable estimate of daily market changes is 0.5%, which leads to a 2.6% yearly loss of principal in a 3x leveraged fund.|$|E

40|$|Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), Quisquater and Couvreur {{proposed}} an RSA variant, RSA-CRT, {{to speed up}} RSA decryption. Then, Wiener suggested another RSA variant, <b>Rebalanced</b> RSA-CRT, to further accelerate RSA-CRT decryption by shifting decryp-tion cost to encryption cost. However, such an approach makes RSA encryption very time-consuming because the public exponent e in <b>Rebalanced</b> RSA-CRT is of the same order of magnitude as φ(N). In this paper we study the following problem: does there exist any secure variant of <b>Rebalanced</b> RSA-CRT, whose public exponent e is much shorter than φ(N) ? We solve this problem by designing two variants of <b>Rebalanced</b> RSA-CRT, Scheme A and Scheme B. In Scheme A, we focus on designing a variant in which dp and dq are of 160 bits, and e = 2567 + 1. Thus the encryption time is reduced to about 12. 7 of the time required by the original <b>Rebalanced</b> RSA-CRT. Scheme B is a variant in which dp and dq are of 198 bits, and e = 2511 + 1. Thus its encryption is about 3 times faster than that of <b>Rebalanced</b> RSA-CRT, but the decryption is a little slower than that of <b>Rebalanced</b> RSA-CRT...|$|R

25|$|In {{a number}} of {{randomized}} clinical trials, probiotics have demonstrated {{the potential to be}} helpful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Specific types of probiotics such as Escherichia coli Nissle have been shown to induce remission in some patients for up to a year. Another type of probiotic that is said to have a similar effect is Lactobacillus acidophilus. The probiotics are said to work by calming some of the ongoing inflammation that causes the disease, which in turn allows the body to mobilize dendritic cells, otherwise known as messenger immune cells. These cells then are able to produce other T-cells that further aid in restoring balance in the intestines by <b>rebalancing</b> systematic inflammation.|$|E

The main point is to define a tolerable voltage range (no <b>rebalance</b> is needed in this range) with an upper limit Vup and a lower limit Vlow, and adjust the power flowing in and out to regulate its terminal voltage.|$|R

25|$|Leveraged {{exchange-traded}} funds (LETFs or leveraged ETFs) are {{a type of}} ETF {{that attempt}} to achieve returns that are more sensitive to market movements than non-leveraged ETFs. Leveraged index ETFs are often marketed as bull or bear funds. A leveraged bull ETF fund might for example attempt to achieve daily returns that are 2x or 3x more pronounced than the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S 500. A leveraged inverse (bear) ETF fund {{on the other hand}} may attempt to achieve returns that are -2x or -3x the daily index return, meaning that it will gain double or triple the loss of the market. Leveraged ETFs require the use of financial engineering techniques, including the use of equity swaps, derivatives and <b>rebalancing,</b> and re-indexing to achieve the desired return. The most common way to construct leveraged ETFs is by trading futures contracts.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the grand strategy behind U. S. President Barack Obama’s <b>rebalance</b> to Asia. Many scholars {{have argued that}} the <b>rebalance</b> does not constitute a grand strategy. This thesis argues that the <b>rebalance</b> is motivated by a grand strategy, one that combines cooperative security and primacy. The thesis explores what American actions have entailed in numerous military and non-military dimensions between 2009 and 2014. The central focus of America’s military, economic, and diplomatic initiatives in Asia is China and its potentially destabilizing role in the region. While there are a host of cooperative features in the <b>rebalance,</b> primacy is the primary motivator, as most of the military and non-military elements are aimed at the continuation of U. S. global leadership and the existing international order. The analysis reveals that the Obama administration’s policies in Asia have been relatively consistent throughout Obama’s presidency...|$|R

25|$|B-trees have {{substantial}} advantages over alternative implementations {{when the time}} to access the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data, because then the cost of accessing the node may be amortized over multiple operations within the node. This usually occurs when the node data are in secondary storage such as disk drives. By maximizing the number of keys within each internal node, {{the height of the}} tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, <b>rebalancing</b> of the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each child node and the size of a full disk block or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2-3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using secondary storage need a large number of child nodes to improve performance.|$|E

Bollinger is the fourth Australian to play for the Super Kings after Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and George Bailey.

This earned him an award for the best catch of the match. He delivered a spell of 2/15 from four overs dismissing Shane Watson who got 60 off just 25 balls in a match which the other Chennai bowlers averaged 13 runs per over in contrast to his 3.75.
