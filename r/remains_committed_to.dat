25|$|The spiritual {{vision of}} early Nazarenes {{was derived from}} the doctrinal core of John Wesley's preaching and the holiness {{movement}} of the 19th century.

The holiness movement arose in the 1830s to promote these doctrines, especially Entire Sanctification, but splintered by 1900. The Church of the Nazarene <b>remains</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> Christian holiness. The key emphasis of Wesley's theology relates to how Divine grace operates within the individual.

2500|$|Although PETA takes a gradualist {{approach}} to improving animal welfare, Newkirk <b>remains</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> ending animal {{use and the}} idea that, as PETA's slogan says, [...] "animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment". Some animal rights abolitionists, most notably Gary Francione, have criticized PETA, calling it and other groups [...] "the new welfarists". Some members of the animal advocacy movement have responded that Francione's position is unnecessarily divisive. Newkirk has also been criticized for her support of actions {{carried out in the}} name of the Animal Liberation Front. Newkirk's position is that the animal rights movement is a revolutionary one and that [...] "hinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out". PETA itself, however, [...] "maintains a creed of nonviolence and does not advocate actions in which anyone, human or nonhuman, is injured". Newkirk and PETA have also been criticized for euthanizing many of the animals taken into PETA's shelters, and PETA has responded to this line of criticism. PETA has been on the news in the southern part of India for Banning of Jallikattu sport which is a cultural symbol of Tamils for thousands of years. The state is witnessing one of the biggest leaderless agitation using social media as a tool to organize these massive protests.|$|E
2500|$|John – {{the illicit}} {{son of the}} Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation ("Malpais") after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John ("the Savage", as he is often called) is an {{outsider}} both on the Reservation—where the natives still practice marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and shallow happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works of William Shakespeare, which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the [...] "Brave New World" [...] (Miranda's words in The Tempest) takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code {{that he has been}} taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are the hypnopedic messages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot grasp that these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. However, he <b>remains</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing {{to live up to his}} Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother's death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then ostracizes himself from society and attempts to purify himself of [...] "sin" [...] (desire), but is finally unable to do so and hangs himself in despair.|$|E
