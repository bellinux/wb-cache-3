5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, {{he thought she was}} a <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
500|$|It was cool. It was a <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> session, she {{was really}} lovely. [...] And I guess as the song ('Hold Tight') came out, her fans seem to respond it really well, so yeah, awesome! And she's a legend, and it's an awesome {{opportunity}} to work with someone like Madonna who's literally shaped the careers of so many artists that I've wanted to work with and that I look up to. She's the queen!.|$|E

500|$|Hetrick {{thought that}} if she {{returned}} to DS9 as Vash, then something could be built around the Vash-Quark relationship: [...] "That would be a <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> pairing, because you have these two different backgrounds but they're both after the same thing." [...] Towards {{the end of the}} , the producers inquired about Hetrick's availability. The actress was ready to appear on another DS9 episode, but the writers changed direction and there were no further plans for the Vash character. [...] "Q-Less" [...] was the final Star Trek appearance for Hetrick, and the only appearance in DS9 for John de Lancie.|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the fantasy creatures found in Terabithia, Csupó {{wanted to make}} creatures that were [...] "little more artsy, imaginative, fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies", and drew inspiration from Terry Gilliam and Ridley Scott. Dima Malanitchev {{came up with the}} drawings for the creatures with Csupó's guidance. Csupó chose to have Weta Digital render the 3D animation because he [...] "was impressed with their artistic integrity, the teamwork, the [...] people were <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> and also they responded to our designs very positively". Weta modified some of the creature designs, but ultimately remained faithful to Csupó's original designs.|$|E
500|$|Over 2014, Maroon 5 {{continued}} their collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Max Martin {{and others to}} release their fifth studio album, entitled V. Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with Overexposed, saying: [...] "We developed a <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> system on the last record — we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them [...] this time we kept it going but looked for different types of songs." [...] Five singles were released from it. In support of the album, the band undertook the Maroon 5 World Tour 2015, which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015.|$|E

500|$|He {{was made}} club captain {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season, and {{continued}} to play regularly during {{the early months of}} the new campaign. He opened his goalscoring account courtesy of free-kick in a 3–3 home draw against Stockport County in October 2012. Shortly after, Nutter admitted that his family struggled relocating to Lincolnshire, and a move down south was a much more suitable location given his personal circumstances. He scored three times in 66 appearances for Lincoln. On his time at Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "Lincoln is a <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> friendly club with very patient and loyal supporters. But with my personal circumstances, {{it was time to move}} on – I wish them well".|$|E
500|$|In a DVD audio commentary, writer Mike Reiss said he {{felt that}} Michael Jackson is [...] "not a terrific actor [...] but he did fine. He was <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> {{he was a great}} sport." [...] In 2006, Jackson was named the fifth-best Simpsons guest star by IGN. Tom Ganjamie of Best Week Ever called Jackson's guest {{appearance}} the [...] "cleverest [...] ever on The Simpsons". Writing for IGN, Robert Canning said in a 2009 review that [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] is a [...] "solid, funny and touching episode" [...] and described Jackson's performance as [...] "heartfelt yet self-parodying". In a 2011 article, Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Michael Jackson his second favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant and that Mr. Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have him go to schools to talk to the children. The cast really liked Tom Jones as a guest star. They said he was fun to work with, and was <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> and even offered to perform a concert after he was done recording lines.|$|E

500|$|On September 27, American Pharoah {{was made}} the 1–2 {{favorite}} for the Grade I FrontRunner Stakes over {{eight and a}} half furlongs at Santa Anita Park. As in his previous race, he was immediately sent to the front by Espinoza and stayed there, pulling away from his rivals in the straight to win by three and a quarter lengths over Calculator, with Texas Red a length and a half away in third. After the race, Espinoza explained how the colt moved: [...] "All the way he was on a high cruising speed. He has such a long stride. He moves <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> and is light on his feet." [...] Baffert said, [...] "I can't believe his demeanor, how he has changed since his first out. He's so professional. He's really mentally there." ...|$|E
500|$|A sequel, , was {{released}} for the Game Boy in 1991 in North America, and in 1992 in Japan. It {{was the first}} game of the Metroid series whose North American release featured a save system, allowing the player to have three separate save files. Metroid II also established the current [...] "look" [...] of Samus Aran and her Power Suit, namely the bulky look of the Varia Suit upgrade and the visual difference between the [...] "Beam Mode" [...] and [...] "Missile Mode" [...] of Samus's arm cannon. Dan Owsen of Nintendo acknowledged in an interview that Nintendo R was involved in developing the Game Boy Color. He noted that Nintendo R included a special [...] "Metroid palette" [...] in the console's hardware, which [...] "makes Metroid II look really, <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> on Game Boy Color", remarking that this made the game's graphics comparable to the original Metroid.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was {{released}} November 26, 2002, with a January 2003 cover date. It premiered with five series: Dragon Ball Z, Sand Land, Yu-Gi-Oh!, YuYu Hakusho, and One Piece. With {{the launch of}} the magazine considered successful, Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha's editors, but declined, {{due to a lack of}} interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects. After six issues had been released, Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff. Reflecting back later, he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that [...] "I basically told Viz that I wanted to work part time or I'd quit. It probably wasn't a <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> thing to do." [...] He eventually stepped down as editor-in-chief, being replaced by his former boss Yumi Hoashi.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{advances}} and tests an interdependence-based {{model of the}} associations among commitment, pro-relationship behavior, and trust. Findings from two longitudinal studies revealed good support for model predictions. Commitment-inspired acts such as accommodation and willingness to sacrifice provide diagnostic information regarding a partner's pro-relationship motives. Individuals come to trust their partners when they perceive that their partners have enacted pro-relationship behaviors, departing from their direct self-interest {{for the good of}} the relationship. The results of mediation analyses are consistent with a model of mutual cyclical growth in which (a) dependence promotes strong commitment, (b) commitment promotes pro-relationship acts, (c) pro-relationship acts are perceived by the partner, (d) the perception of pro-relationship acts enhances the partner's trust, and (e) trust increases the partner's willingness to become dependent on the relationship. Auxiliary analyses revealed that self-reported attachment style does not account for substantial variance beyond the features of interde-pendence that form the basis for the present model.

500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Ayola {{has since}} {{explained}} that her {{change of heart}} stemmed from becoming a mother. In {{the early years of}} her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. [...] On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of Back to the Future was {{finished}} in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in turnaround. [...] "They {{thought it was a}} <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> cute, warm film, but not sexual enough," [...] Gale said. [...] "They suggested that we take it to Disney, but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us." [...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. [...] "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," [...] Gale said.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Beckinsale {{appeared}} in Winged Creatures, {{a film about}} how six different witnesses cope with {{the aftermath of a}} shooting. Beckinsale played a waitressing single mother in an ensemble cast which included Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, and Forest Whitaker. [...] "It was a really, <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> experience but it was quick," [...] said Beckinsale of the filming process. [...] "I just felt a bit like I was shot through a cannon." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she played the role [...] "with a white trash verve" [...] and found her character's [...] "raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable." [...] However, Dargis felt that Beckinsale and her cast mates have a [...] "tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clichés." [...] The film received a very limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles; it was released simultaneously on DVD.|$|E
500|$|Loretta {{has stated}} {{on-screen}} {{that she does}} not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries. Speaking of the character Walton stated, [...] "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her. She’s actually quite shy and reserved. She’s got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history! Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper. It’s like two different lives, and I think many real-life pole-dancers are like that. They’re <b>really</b> <b>nice,</b> normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses." [...] Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where Hollyoaks films scenes.|$|E
500|$|Summarizing the video, Jocelyn Vena MTV News said, [...] "Bieber is seen {{hanging out}} in the catacombs of Bahamian aquariums...In this new clip, Bieber is seen {{performing}} on the beach and frolicking with Hurd. Bieber is definitely growing up a lot in this video — sharing near-kisses, touching and nuzzling with her boyfriend. Shots of the pair in silhouette holding hands play into the video's plot of two young teens falling in love in a very exotic locale." [...] Vena also said that Bieber continues her [...] "knack for Michael Jackson-esque dance moves." [...] (read: bad mimicry and complete rip off of). Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "So romantic," [...] as [...] "they dance in an age-appropriate fashion." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV News reviewed the video positively, stating that it is, [...] "a <b>really</b> <b>nice</b> take on the innocence of young love, full of flirting, dancing and hair-touching." ...|$|E
