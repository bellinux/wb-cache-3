He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E

25|$|Unsurprisingly, {{security}} and fire protection were major concerns. Horrea were frequently built with very thick walls (as much as 1 m / 3ft thick) to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of fire, {{and the windows}} were always narrow and placed {{high up on the}} wall to deter theft. Doors were protected with elaborate systems of locks and bolts. Even the largest horrea usually only had two or three external doors, which were often quite narrow and would not have permitted the entrance of carts. The arduous task of moving goods into, out of and around horrea was most probably carried out by manual labour alone; the biggest horrea would thus have had an enormous staff of labourers.|$|E

500|$|In April 1977, Alyeska filed {{a notice}} that it {{intended}} to start filling the pipeline sometime between June 20 and July 1.

The second problem came when the pipeline needed to be purged of air in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of fire or explosion. Usually, a pipeline is filled with water first, and the oil pushes the water ahead of it, purging the pipeline as it goes. In Alaska, there was a fear that the water would freeze in the pipeline, damaging it. This problem was solved when pressurized nitrogen was used instead of water.|$|E

2500|$|Seismic {{communication}} is {{the exchange of}} information using self-generated vibrational signals transmitted via a substrate such as the soil, water, spider webs, plant stems, or a blade of grass.

[...] The use of seismic {{communication is}} found in many taxa, including frogs, kangaroo rats, mole rats, bees, nematode worms, and others. [...] Tetrapods usually make seismic waves by drumming {{on the ground with}} a body part, a signal that is sensed by the sacculus of the receiver.

On April 2, the flotilla, including both mortars and gunboats, concentrated its fire on the floating battery New Orleans. She was hit several times, and her mooring lines were parted. She drifted downstream, out of the war. On April 4, conditions for running past the remaining batteries were satisfactory. The night was moonless, and after dark a thunderstorm came up. Carondelet made her way downstream, and was not discovered until she was abreast of the Confederate Battery No. 2. She might have escaped detection completely had not her smokestacks blazed up; the buildup of soot, no longer dampened by escaping steam, caught fire and revealed her position. The batteries opened, but their fire was inaccurate, and Carondelet completed the run unscathed. Pope continued to press Foote for another gunboat, and two nights later [...] made a similar run.|$|E

After consultations between Joffre, General Ferdinand Foch and Haig, Rawlinson was instructed to plan for an advance of [...] on a [...] front, taking the German first position and advancing midway to the second position on the right at Montauban, taking the first position in the centre and the second position from Pozières to Grandcourt. An extra corps was allotted to the Fourth Army but the different concepts of step by step advances or a quicker advance, to force German withdrawals on the flanks, was not resolved. Further problems arose, when the French contribution to the offensive was reduced and in late May, there was doubt that the French could participate at all. On 29 May, Haig directed that the aims of the offensive, would be to wear down the German army and reach positions favourable for an offensive in 1917.|$|E

2500|$|When {{galleries}} came close, a camouflet (a small mine {{insufficient to}} disturb the surface) would be planted, to collapse the opponents' gallery and then the digging of the offensive gallery would resume.

The nearing of a German gallery, listening for clues, breaking into a rival gallery {{and waiting for the}} mine to explode, caused great strain to the miners and was nerve-racking for troops in front line positions on the surface, who knew that a mine could be sprung under them at any moment. To <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> to front-line troops, the area was held by posts rather than a continuous front line, with only the minimum number of troops. German mining had formed craters in no man's land, named craters [...] the British and which were held by each side, dug in on their respective near lips.

2500|$|Initially, {{the basic}} {{policies}} outlined by President Kennedy in {{a message to}} Congress on March 28, 1961, guided McNamara in the reorientation of the defense program. Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be [...] "designed to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of irrational or unpremeditated general war." [...] The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with allies, was [...] "to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than [...] "inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation", as the president put it. Out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. initiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation's [...] "limited warfare" [...] capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation {{in favor of a}} flexible response strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{directional}} {{patterns are}} produced by enclosing {{one side of the}} ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from [...] "figure-eight" [...] to [...] "unidirectional". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns, and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, i.e., those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.|$|E
