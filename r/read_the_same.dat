25|$|Palindromic {{numbers are}} numbers that <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> when their digits are reversed. A Lychrel number is a {{positive}} integer that never yields a palindromic number when subjected to the iterative process of being added to itself with digits reversed. The question of whether there are any Lychrel numbers in base10 is an open problem in recreational mathematics; the smallest candidate is 196.|$|E
25|$|The Waste Land {{is notable}} for its {{seemingly}} disjointed structure, {{indicative of the}} Modernist style of James Joyce's Ulysses (which Eliot cited as an influence and which he <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year that he was writing The Waste Land). In the Modernist style, Eliot jumps from one voice or image to another without clearly delineating these shifts for the reader. He also includes phrases from multiple foreign languages (Latin, Greek, Italian, German, French and Sanskrit), indicative of Pound's influence.|$|E
25|$|Finally, he {{suggested}} that {{the meaning of the}} Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should be <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way that Article IV's Privileges and Immunities Clause was interpreted. He cited Justice Bushrod Washington's interpretation of the latter clause in the famous case of Corfield v. Coryell and stated that this is what the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment had intended. Thomas made a case for the revival of the clause to protect fundamental rights of citizens.|$|E

25|$|Pervasive PSQL v11 was {{released}} in September 2010. One of the key drivers of the engineering effort behind Pervasive PSQL v11 was the redesign of the database engine to increase performance and scalability on multi-core CPU's. Pervasive PSQL v11 optimizes parallel threads performing similar activities, allowing the database to engage multiple cores during task execution. PSQL v11 also provides enhancements to the low-level synchronization mechanisms in the navigational interface. Multiple users can <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cached file pages simultaneously and their operations can proceed on independent cores. Non-user activity such as checkpoints and log management can run on separate cores and multiple users accessing independent files can proceed on different cores.|$|E
25|$|The Mayan {{script was}} a logosyllabic system. Individual glyphs (symbols) could {{represent}} either a word (actually a morpheme) or a syllable; indeed, the same glyph could often {{be used for}} both. For example, the calendaric glyph MANIK’ was also used to represent the syllable chi. (It is customary to write logographic readings in all capitals and phonetic readings in italics.) It is possible, but not certain, that these conflicting readings arose as the script was adapted to new languages, as also happened with Japanese kanji and with Assyro-Babylonian and Hittite cuneiform. There was polyvalence {{in the other direction}} as well: different glyphs could be <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way. For example, half a dozen apparently unrelated glyphs were used to write the very common third person pronoun u-.|$|E
25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} {{found that men}} receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor {{playing the role of}} an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E

Susanna, {{the first of}} their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.

500|$|Meiklejohn saw {{books as}} the main {{instrument}} of a liberal education, and chose a great books curriculum so as to model the human intellect he wished to impart and to connect the timeless philosophical questions that occupy all such works. He wanted his college to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> books and to debate the same questions simultaneously. Meiklejohn did not prefer one [...] "great book" [...] over another and saw them as interchangeable and {{in pursuit of the}} same essential questions about goodness, justice, and truth. Freshmen studied ancient Athens in the age of Pericles, reading authors such as Aeschylus, Herodotus, Homer, Plato, Thucydides, and Xenophon. Meiklejohn's curriculum accentuated the author's thoughts behind the work as related to general questions about society, and forewent emphasis on the texts themselves.|$|E

After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just people like me. [...] They <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in."

This will not be the case if paper is embossed from behind, where the matrix and impression <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way, and both matrix and impression are in relief.

50|$|Restriction enzymes {{recognize}} a specific sequence of nucleotides {{and produce a}} double-stranded cut in the DNA. The recognition sequences can also be classified {{by the number of}} bases in its recognition site, usually between 4 and 8 bases, and the amount of bases in the sequence will determine how often the site will appear by chance in any given genome, e.g., a 4-base pair sequence would theoretically occur once every 4^4 or 256bp, 6 bases, 4^6 or 4,096bp, and 8 bases would be 4^8 or 65,536bp. Many of them are palindromic, meaning <b>the</b> base sequence <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> backwards and forwards. In theory, {{there are two types of}} palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA. The mirror-like palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> forward and backward on a single strand of DNA, as in GTAATG. The inverted repeat palindrome is also a sequence that <b>reads</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> forward and backward, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., of double-stranded DNA), as in GTATAC (GTATAC being complementary to CATATG). Inverted repeat palindromes are more common and have greater biological importance than mirror-like palindromes.|$|R
