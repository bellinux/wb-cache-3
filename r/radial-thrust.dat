5000|$|There {{are four}} {{optional}} prefix characters, here defined as A321-XXXXXXX (where the X's {{are the main}} designation), which are separated from the main designation with a dash. The first character, A, is the bearing class, which is defined, in ascending order: C, B, A. The class defines extra requirements for vibration, deviations in shape, the rolling surface tolerances, and other parameters that are not defined by a designation character. The second character is the frictional moment (friction), which is defined, in ascending order, by a number 1-9. The third character is the radial clearance, which is normally defined by a number between 0 and 9 (inclusive), in ascending order, however for <b>radial-thrust</b> bearings it is defined by a number between 1 and 3, inclusive. The fourth character is the accuracy ratings, which normally are, in ascending order: 0 (normal), 6X, 6, 5, 4, T, and 2. Ratings 0 and 6 are the most common; ratings 5 and 4 are used in high-speed applications; and rating 2 is used in gyroscopes. For tapered bearings, the values are, in ascending order: 0, N, and X, where 0 is 0, N is [...] "normal", and X is 6X.|$|E
40|$|The working {{performance}} of the spindle system {{is the most important}} factor to embody the overall {{performance of}} the machine tool. To ensure the advanced capabilities, besides the high-precision manufacturing technologies, it is mainly depending on the bearing module and the forces on the spindle. In this paper, a new strategy of the vertical spindle supporting system is presented to meet the high stiffness requirement for the aerostatic bearing. Based on the computational fluid dynamics and finite volume method, a fluid dynamic model and structure model of the large diameter incorporate <b>radial-thrust</b> aerostatic bearing is developed and simulated to find out the pressure distribution laws of the spindle supporting system. The grid subdivision in the direction of film thickness is paid more attentions when establishing the grid of the whole gas film. Simulation results show that this special structure of bearing module can supply enough load capacity and stiffness for the machine tool. The results also indicate that the static characteristics of the bearing are improved as the supply pressure increases and as the supply orifice diameter decreases...|$|E
