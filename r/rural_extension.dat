50|$|According to Habermann and De Fontgalland, the {{difficulties}} in {{the adoption of a}} viable development communication policy have to be simultaneously analyzed horizontally and vertically. Horizontally government agencies, semi-governmental offices (e.g., <b>rural</b> <b>extension</b> service), independent development organizations and private media outlets must coordinate policy. Vertically, information must flow in both directions between the population base and decision-making bodies. This involves local and supra-local administrations that are active in handing out directives and reporting back to the government. Commonly, default policies do not encourage/require such institutions to feed information from the populace to policymakers, with the exception of government extension bureaus.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} design and {{implement}} public policies {{in the context of}} rural development, information tends to be gathered about family farming in different Latin American countries. In contrast, scarce attention has been given to the description of rural extensionists, who are the ones supporting family farming in the field. A cross-sectional investigation was conducted between 2010 and 2012 including surveys to <b>rural</b> <b>extensions</b> working in 10 different Latin American countries, this allowing for a preliminary description of the socio-demographic profile of the respondents. The samples were incidental ranging from 19 (Bolivia) to 220 (Argentina) subjects, this implying that they were not representative. Significant statistical differences were found with regards to the sex, age, experience, level of education and university degree of the samples pertaining to the different countries. In average, most extensionists are men (70. 1 %), age 40. 3 and have little more than 11 years of experience as extensionists. Brazilian practitioners surveyed are the oldest, most educated and experienced among the different samples. In general, most extensionists have a technical background and are agricultural engineers.

50|$|Agricultural science {{suffered}} from changes in policy and emphasis after the 1950s. The Cultural Revolution disrupted agricultural science training and research programs, {{but since the}} mid-1970s training and research programs have been restored. Government officials emphasized practical, production-oriented scientific work. The <b>rural</b> <b>extension</b> system popularized new techniques and new inputs, such as sprinkler irrigation systems. In 1987 eighty-four agricultural colleges and research institutes pursued research in seven broad fields: agriculture, forestry, aquatic production, land reclamation, mechanization, water conservation, and meteorology. In addition, almost 500 agricultural schools had a total staff of 29,000 teachers and 71,000 students. Since the early 1980s thousands of researchers and students were sent abroad. Research was being strengthened by the construction of sixteen regionally distributed agricultural experiment stations. New agricultural journals and societies were established to promote the dissemination of research results within the country. The Chinese sought technical information abroad as well through the import of technology and machinery and the international exchange of delegations.|$|E

The study of extension problems, innovation networks, social network analysis, partnership and knowledge sharing were identified as main <b>rural</b> <b>extension</b> research trends. These results led to the conclusion that a <b>rural</b> <b>extension</b> approach for development of self-management capabilities should include bottom-up participative planning, knowledge management, social capital development, considering territory specificities and consolidation of exchange networks of knowledge and innovations...|$|E
