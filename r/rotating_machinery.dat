25|$|Ramjet engines {{differ in}} many ways from {{traditional}} gas turbine engines, {{but most of the}} same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle. This allows ramjet combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many ramjet combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are dump combustors rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors). That said, many ramjet combustors are also similar to traditional gas turbine combustors, such as the combustor in the ramjet used by the RIM-8 Talos missile, which used a can-type combustor.|$|E

[...] A major {{aspect of the}} O contract will be continuous monitoring {{of the performance of}} the plant and all of its primary subsystems, which is normally undertaken remotely. [...] This enables performance to be compared with the anticipated output under the climatic conditions actually experienced. It also provides data to enable the scheduling of both rectification and preventive maintenance. A small number of large solar farms use a separate inverter or maximizer for each solar panel, which provide individual performance data that can be monitored. For other solar farms, thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non-performing panels for replacement.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>rotating</b> <b>machineries</b> are {{supported}} by bearings with clearance, which are further clamped in, compared to the bearing stiffness, weak pedestals. As {{have been reported in}} several studies, it is essential to choose a proper clearance in order to avoid unwanted vibrations. When <b>rotating</b> <b>machineries</b> supported by bearings with clearance are subjected to stationary loads (gravity, magnetic pull etc.), it may not loose contact between the shaft and the bearing (i. e. full contact).

500|$|De Marignac was {{the first}} to prepare the metal in 1864, when he reduced niobium {{chloride}} by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum-free niobium on a larger scale by 1866, {{it was not until the}} early 20th century that niobium was used in incandescent lamp filaments, the first commercial application. This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with tungsten, which has a higher melting point. That niobium improves the strength of steel was first discovered in the 1920s, and this application remains its predominant use. In 1961, the American physicist Eugene Kunzler and coworkers at Bell Labs discovered that niobium-tin continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields, making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high-power magnets and electrical power machinery. This discovery enabled — two decades later — the production of long multi-strand cables wound into coils to create large, powerful electromagnets for <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery,</b> particle accelerators, and particle detectors.Sn|author=Matthias, B.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the efficient numerical solution of damped and undamped free vibration problems of rotating structures. While structural discretization is achieved by the finite element method, the associated eigenproblem solution is effected by a combined Sturm sequence and inverse iteration technique that enables the computation of a few required roots only without having to compute any other. For structures of complex configurations, a modal synthesis technique is also presented, which is based on appropriate combinations of eigenproblem solution of various structural components. Such numerical procedures are general in nature, which fully exploit matrix sparsity inherent in finite element discretizations, and prove to be most efficient for the vibration analysis of any damped rotating structure, such as <b>rotating</b> <b>machineries,</b> helicopter and turbine blades, spinning space stations, among others...|$|R
