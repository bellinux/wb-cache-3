It is a composite of stable mineral phases of newberyite, luenebergite, and residual Mg oxide. Using this matrix, the authors developed superior waste forms for a surrogate ash waste stream. The final waste form is a low-permeability structural-quality ceramic, in which hazardous contaminants are chemically fixed and physically encapsulated. The compression strength of the waste form is {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the land disposal requirement, even at high waste loading. The high compression strength is attributed to stronger bonds in the waste form that result from participation of ash waste in the setting reactions. Long-term leaching studies show that the waste form is stable in an aqueous environment.

Experiments were conducted at two identical and highly instrumented houses. One house is modified with different oor coverings, while the other is kept unchanged and used for reference. Through experimentation and simulation, peak power (due to space heating) reduction strategies are investigated. Twelve equivalent RC thermal network models of varying model resolution are developed for a north zone of the houses. Modelling approximations including linearization of the heat transfer, spatial and/or temporal discretization and approximations for reduction in model complexity are implemented into the models and their effects are investigated. The focus is on simple and physically meaningful building thermal models suited for model-based control. The models are used to study the impact of set point ramping lengths and-optimal" transition curves between two temperatures on peak demand reductions for a very cold day. Alterations to walls and ceilings in the models were done to hypothetically modify their properties in the zone and the effects in combination with ramping profiles were analyzed. This work can inform the development of new building materials. A commercial building is also considered and two low order RC thermal network are compared. The first model excludes the mass of the interior partitions, while the second model incorporates them. An advantage of the model with interior partitions is it can be used for retrofit studies...|$|R
40|$|The single-electron {{transistor}} (SET) {{is one of}} the best candidates for future nano electronic circuits because of its ultralow power consumption and small size. SET devices operate on the principle of Coulomb blockade, which is more prominent at dimensions of a few nano meters. Typically, the SET device consists of two capacitively coupled ultra small tunnel junctions with a nano island between them. The electron tunneling through the tunnel junctions can be controlled by the gate voltage. The drain current and the impact of the gate voltage depends on the overall capacitance of the device. Single electron transistors can be fabricated using methods like AFM nano oxidation, e-beam lithography, or shadow mask evaporation. Focused Ion Beam (FIB) based fabrication of SET devices is a novel method to produce SETs. The present paper describes the effect of additional series capacitance on the source-drain characteristic of a multi-dot <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> operating <b>SET</b> device fabricated using FIB etch and deposition process. It also presents a novel method to minimize the gate leakage current and improve the threshold voltage in such multi-dot SET devices, operating at <b>room</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{electrically}} conductive elastomer was evaluated as a material {{candidate for a}} spacecraft seal. The elastomer used {{electrically conductive}} constituents {{as a means to}} reduce the resistance between mating interfaces of a sealed joint to meet spacecraft electrical bonding requirements. The compound's outgassing levels were compared against published NASA requirements. The compound was formed into a hollow O-ring seal and its compression set was measured. The O-ring seal was placed into an interface and the electrical resistance and leak rate were quantified. The amount of force required to fully compress the test article in the sealing interface and the force needed to separate the joint were also measured. The outgassing and resistance measurements were below the maximum allowable levels. The <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> compression <b>set</b> and leak rates were fairly high when compared against other typical spacecraft seal materials, but were not excessive. The compression and adhesion forces were desirably low. Overall, the performance of the elastomer compound was sufficient to be considered for future spacecraft seal applications...|$|R
