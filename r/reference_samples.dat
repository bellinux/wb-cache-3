40|$|Crystallographic {{reconstruction}} of parent austenite grain boundaries from the martensitic microstructure in a wear resistant steel {{was carried out}} using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The present study mainly aims to investigate the parent austenite grains from the martensitic structure in an as-rolled (<b>reference)</b> steel <b>sample</b> and samples obtained by quenching at different cooling rates with corresponding dilatometry. Subsequently, {{this study is to}} correlate the nearest cooling rate by the dilatometer which yields a similar orientation relationship and substructure as the <b>reference</b> <b>sample.</b> The Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship was used to reconstruct the parent austenite grain boundaries from the martensite boundaries in both <b>reference</b> and dilatometric <b>samples</b> using EBSD crystallographic data. The parent austenite grain boundaries were successfully evaluated from the EBSD data and the corresponding grain sizes were measured. The parent austenite grain boundaries of the <b>reference</b> <b>sample</b> match the sample quenched at 100 °C/s (CR 100). Also the martensite substructures and crystallographic textures are similar in these two samples.

50|$|The {{recovery}} and identification process may {{take years to}} complete. The average identification time by the JPAC CIL was eleven years after remains arrived in the laboratory.

All reports underwent a thorough peer review process that included an external review by independent experts. Additionally, if mtDNA {{was part of the}} process, the search for family <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> for mtDNA comparison added a significant amount of time to the identification process because building a DNA database was not a priority for JPAC.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of rapes are committed by persons known to the victim: only five percent of assaults are perpetrated by a stranger according to one survey. Therefore, {{the identity of the}} perpetrator is frequently reported. Biological evidence such as semen, blood, vaginal secretions, saliva, vaginal epithelial cells may be identified and genetically typed by a crime lab. The information derived from the analysis can often help determine whether sexual contact occurred, provide information regarding the circumstances of the incident, and be compared to <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> collected from patients and suspects.

50|$|Accidental {{transfer}} of biological material containing DNA can produce misleading results. This {{is a particularly}} important consideration in forensic and crime labs, where mistakes can cause an innocent person to be convicted of a crime. There {{was no way to}} detect if a reference sample was mislabeled as evidence or if a forensic sample is contaminated, but a nullomer barcode can be added to <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> to distinguish them from evidence on analysis. Tagging can be carried out during sample collection without affecting genotype or quantification results. Impregnated filter paper with various nullomers can be used to soak up and store DNA samples from a crime scene, making the technology simple and effective. Tagging with nullomers can be detected—even when diluted to a million-fold and spilled on evidence, these tags are still clearly detected. Tagging in this way supports National Research Council's recommendations on quality control to reduce fraud and mistakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} method is used to quantify nucleic acids by amplifying a nucleic acid molecule with the enzyme DNA polymerase. Conventional PCR {{is based on the}} theory that amplification is exponential. Therefore, nucleic acids may be quantified by comparing the number of amplification cycles and amount of PCR end-product to those of a reference sample. However, many factors complicate this calculation, creating uncertainties and inaccuracies. These factors include the following: initial amplification cycles may not be exponential; PCR amplification eventually plateaus after an uncertain number of cycles; and low initial concentrations of target nucleic acid molecules may not amplify to detectable levels. However, the most significant limitation of PCR is that PCR amplification efficiency in a sample of interest may be different from that of <b>reference</b> <b>samples.</b> Since PCR is an exponential process, only twofold differences in amplification can be observed, greatly impacting the validity and precision of the results.|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, {{publishers}} and researchers could use corpus samples to create language-learning references, syllabuses {{and other related}} tools or materials. For example, the BNC was used {{by a group of}} Japanese researchers as a tool in their creation of an English-language - learning website for learners of English for specific purposes (ESP). [...] The website enabled English-language learners to download frequently heard and used sentence patterns, and then base their own usage of the English language on these sentence patterns. The BNC served as the source from which the frequently used expressions were extracted. In using this website, users thus relied on <b>reference</b> <b>samples</b> from the BNC to guide them in their learning of the English language. Such creation of materials that facilitate language-learning typically involves the use of very large corpora (comparable {{to the size of the}} BNC), as well as advanced software and technology.
