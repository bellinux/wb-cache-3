2500|$|Stuart Rothenberg of the non-partisan Rothenberg {{political}} report, however, {{has stated}} that even though Democrats were able to win a competitive race {{to hold on to}} Murtha's former seat, [...] "But the road doesn't necessarily get easier for Democrats. Critz was pro-life, pro-gun, and opposed the health care reform bill that many vulnerable Democratic incumbents supported." [...] Rothenberg still predicts that <b>Republicans</b> <b>will</b> make substantial gains, which suggests that this could be a pyrrhic victory for Democrats comparable to the Republican win in 2006 special House election in California's 50th congressional district in which the ruling party managed to hold onto a district in a special election, but still lost control of Congress months later.|$|E

[...] "We shall get to Le Mans, but the <b>Republicans</b> <b>will</b> be on our heels, and one cannot doubt what the issue will be. Doubtless a small body will hang together, and still try to regain La Vendee; but we shall have done our duty. After our next defeat I will leave the army.|$|E
6000|$|So it is I {{conceive}} {{the elements}} of the New Republic taking shape and running together through the social mass, picking themselves out more and more clearly, from the shareholder, the parasitic speculator and the wretched multitudes of the Abyss. The New <b>Republicans</b> <b>will</b> constitute an informal and open freemasonry. In all sorts of ways they will be influencing and controlling the apparatus of the ostensible governments, they will be pruning irresponsible property, checking speculators and controlling the abyssward drift, but at that, at an indirect control, at any sort of fiction, the New Republic, from the very nature of its cardinal ideas, will not rest. The clearest and simplest statement, the clearest and simplest method, is inevitably associated with the conceptions of that science upon which the New Republic will arise. There will be a time, in peace it may be, or under the stresses of warfare, when the New Republic will find itself ready to arrive, when the theory will have been worked out and the details will be generally accepted, and the new order will be ripe to begin. And then, indeed, it will begin. What life or strength will be left in the old order to prevent this new order beginning? ...|$|E
6000|$|And having set {{themselves}} in these ways {{to raise the}} quality of human birth, the New <b>Republicans</b> <b>will</b> {{see to it that}} the children who do at last effectually get born come into a world of spacious opportunity. The half-educated, unskilled pretenders, professing impossible creeds and propounding ridiculous curricula, to whom the unhappy parents of to-day must needs entrust the intelligences of their children; these heavy-handed barber-surgeons of the mind, these schoolmasters, with their ragtag and bobtail of sweated and unqualified assistants, will be succeeded by capable, self-respecting men and women, constituting the most important profession of the world. The windy pretences of [...] "forming character," [...] supplying moral training, and so forth, under which the educationalist of to-day conceals {{the fact that he is}} incapable of his proper task of training, developing and equipping the mind, will no longer be made by the teacher. Nor will the teacher be permitted to subordinate his duties to the entirely irrelevant business of his pupils' sports. The teacher will teach, and confine his moral training, beyond enforcing truth and discipline, to the exhibition of a capable person doing his duty as well as it can be done. He will know that his utmost province is only a part of the educational process, that equally important educational influences are the home and the world of thought about the pupil and himself. The whole world will be thinking and learning; the old idea of [...] "completing" [...] one's education will have vanished with the fancy of a static universe; every school will be a preparatory school, every college. The school and college will probably give only the keys and apparatus of thought, a necessary language or so, thoroughly done, a sound mathematical training, drawing, a wide and reasoned view of philosophy, some good exercises in dialectics, a training in the use of those stores of fact that science has made. So equipped, the young man and young woman will go on to the technical school of their chosen profession, and to the criticism of contemporary practice for their special efficiency, and to the literature of contemporary thought for their general development....|$|E

50|$|Political {{scientists}} have noted how {{a prolonged period}} marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has affected partisanship.

50|$|The {{results in}} the California Assembly and California State Senate were {{shocking}} to the Republicans, as now more than 2/3 {{of the members of}} each house are Democrats.
