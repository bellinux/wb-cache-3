5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence.</b> Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E

30|$|Generally, Bayesian theory {{fundamentally}} {{conforms to}} the procedure of trust evaluation. Bayesian theory-based trust system attempts to discover the behavior patterns through historical actions [13]. In Bayesian theory, it first calculates the prior probability of an event, then applies the prior probability into the binomial distribution, and finally modifies or updates the probability by using a posterior inference according to the <b>relevant</b> <b>evidences.</b>|$|R
50|$|Taking an {{objective}} approach to an issue means having due {{regard for the}} known valid <b>evidence</b> (<b>relevant</b> facts, logical implications and viewpoints and human purposes) pertaining to that issue. If <b>relevant</b> valid <b>evidence</b> is denied, {{an objective}} approach is impossible. An objective approach is particularly important in science, and in decision-making processes which affect {{large numbers of people}} (e.g. politics).|$|R
30|$|A {{systematic}} {{literature study}} is a systematic and repeatable approach to identify and study all <b>relevant</b> <b>evidences,</b> i.e. primary studies, on a specific research question or phenomenon[10]. The method consists of literature search, study selection, data extraction and synthesis. Systematic literature studies can be roughly divided in two categories[10]: systematic literature review (SLR) focuses on finding existing evidence on a specific question, while systematic mapping study (SMS) categorizes existing studies on the topic {{in order to show}} the gaps of knowledge.|$|R

The mere fact that records need to be translated is not sufficient grounds to invoke FNC.|$|E

25|$|Appearing {{before some}} {{administrative}} tribunals may feel like appearing in court, but the tribunal's procedure is relatively less formal {{than that of}} a court, and more importantly, the rules of evidence are not as strictly observed, so that some evidence that would be inadmissible in a court hearing may be allowed in a tribunal hearing, if relevant to the proceeding. While <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> is admissible, evidence which the adjudicator determines to have questionable reliability, or is otherwise questionable, is most likely to be afforded little or no weight.|$|E

25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo is an {{administrative}} law case decided in 1991 by the High Court of Singapore concerning {{the legality of}} a demand by the Director-General of Customs and Excise ("DG") that the applicant's company pay S$130,241.30 in customs duty as it had not exported certain goods. The case was presided over by Justice Chan Sek Keong. The Court decided that the DG had failed {{to take into account}} <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> adduced by the applicant's company which could have been capable of rebutting the prima facie evidence of non-export, and had thus made an insufficient inquiry before arriving at his decision. Since the DG's demand had been based on an incorrect basis of fact and thus had been made contrary to law, the Court granted the applicant an order of prohibition that barred the DG from deducting the sum from certain bankers' guarantees that the applicant's company had lodged with Customs as security.|$|E
25|$|The {{report was}} {{considered}} to be of poor quality. It had a disjointed narrative and repeatedly failed to cite the <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence.</b> In it, Spicer concluded that the collision was primarily the fault of Voyagers bridge crew, in that they neglected to maintain an effective lookout and lost awareness of the carrier's location, although he did not blame individual officers. When reporting on the contribution of Melbourne and those aboard her to the collision, Spicer specifically indicated failures of Robertson and two other bridge officers, as they did not alert Voyager to the danger she was in, and appeared to not take measures to prevent Melbourne from colliding. Robertson was marked for transfer to , a training base in Sydney, and the admirals of the RAN decided to prevent Robertson from serving on Melbourne or any other seagoing vessel in the future. Robertson submitted his resignation from the Navy on 10 September 1964, two days after receiving official notice of his new posting, which he saw as a demotion. The media considered that Robertson had been made a scapegoat for the incident.|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 2010, I-play {{released}} a downloadable hidden object game based on 4:50 from Paddington (see the external links). Dialogue interspersed with the hidden object puzzles follows {{the plot of}} the original story. Items mentioned in the dialogue are among those hidden in each round. The player finds locations on the map by textual clues, which makes the map a hidden object scene, too. At three points during play the player is asked to hypothesize on the identity of the murderer, but as in the novel there is {{little in the way of}} <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence.</b> Unlike the games based on Evil Under the Sun, Murder on the Orient Express, and And Then There Were None, this does not include any actual detection and unlike the latter two does not add an additional character to represent the player. This is the 4th in a series of Oberon Games' hidden object games based on Agatha Christie's novels, the first three were based on Death on the Nile, Peril at End House, and Dead Man's Folly.|$|E

25|$|<b>Relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} that Eleanor was not fluent in English, but {{was accustomed to}} read, and so presumably to think and speak, in French, her mother's tongue, with which {{she would have been}} familiar from childhood despite spending her early years in Spain. In this she was luckier than many medieval European queens, who often arrived in their husband's realms to face the need to learn a new language; but the English court was still functionally bilingual, in large measure through the long succession of its queens, who were mostly from French-speaking lands. In 1275, on a visit to St Albans abbey in Hertfordshire, the people of the town begged her help in withstanding the abbot's exactions from them, but one of her courtiers had to act as translator before she could respond to the plea for assistance. All the literary works noted above are in French, as are the bulk of her surviving letters, and since Peckham wrote his letters and his angelic treatise for her in French, she was presumably well known to prefer that language.|$|E
25|$|The Public Inquiry {{opened on}} 23 January. Air Commodore Vernon Brown was in charge. He {{stated that the}} object of the inquiry was not to lay blame, but to {{discover}} facts. It was a normal Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry into an accident, with the exception that it was not being held in camera on the instructions of Lord Nathan. There would be no cross-examination of witnesses. The French authorities had co-operated by providing <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> and Max Hymans, head of the Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile represented the French Government along with other officials. The inquiry was closed on 27 January, concluding that mechanical failure was not the cause of the accident. Liaison between British and French authorities was an area of concern. On 29 January, Edward Smith MP asked in Parliament why the inquiry was taking place when not all the survivors were fit enough to give evidence. In a written answer, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Civil Aviation George Lindgren replied that statements had been taken from nearly all survivors and that it was felt to be in the public interest to proceed without delay.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The prosecution is under a common law duty to disclose all <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should be able to follow proceedings and {{they have a right to}} be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

500|$|Scott {{noted that}} {{it was easier to}} reach correct puzzle solutions, with clues being given out [...] "at a very {{reasonable}} rate". He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how <b>relevant</b> <b>evidence</b> sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a problem with it due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E
