5|$|After {{graduate}} school Ahn moved to Seattle {{and worked as}} a psychotherapist. In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home for at-risk youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of hugging her and holding her hand. In a 2013 retrospective he penned for news portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her allegations were false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter he left the social services and found work in <b>retail</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004 {{while working}} {{his day job}} in <b>retail</b> <b>management,</b> Ahn co-founded Technomancer Press, a game {{publishing}} company that produced books for role playing gamers. Two years later he was elected Executive Director of the Game Publisher's Association, a trade association for publishers of role playing games. Technomancer Press received media attention after launching TerraDrive Live, a live action MMORPG, which was debuted at PAX 2007 in Seattle. On June 1 Ahn began encouraging player generated content by launching a wiki to allow users to help flesh out the TerraDrive universe allowing the community to create factions, write backstory, and develop characters, which they could then role-play themselves during the live-action portion of the game at PAX.|$|E

2500|$|During this period, {{retailers}} {{worked to}} develop modern retail marketing practices. Pioneering merchants {{who contributed to}} modern retail marketing and management methods include: [...] A. T. Stewart, Potter Palmer, John Wanamaker, Montgomery Ward, Marshall Field, Richard Warren Sears, Rowland Macy, J.C. Penney, Fred Lazarus, brothers Edward and William Filene and Sam Walton. For example, Edward Filene, a proponent of the scientific approach to <b>retail</b> <b>management,</b> developed the concept of Automatic bargain Basement. Although Filene's Basement {{was not the first}} ‘bargain basement’ in the U.S., the principles of ‘automatic mark-downs’ generated excitement and proved very profitable. Under Filene's plan, merchandise had to be sold within 30 days or it was marked down; after a further 12 days, the merchandise was further reduced by 25% and if still unsold after another 18 days, a further markdown of 25% was applied. If the merchandise remained unsold after two months, it was given to charity. Filene was a pioneer in employee relations. He instituted a profit sharing program, a minimum wage for women, a 40-hour work week, health clinics and paid vacations. He also {{played an important role in}} encouraging the Filene Cooperative Association, [...] "perhaps the earliest American company union". Through this channel he engaged constructively with his employees in collective bargaining and arbitration processes. [...] Montgomery Ward is credited with developing catalog sales and mail-order systems. His first catalog which was issued in August 1872 consisted of an 8in × 12in (20cm × 30cm) single-sheet price list, listing 163 items for sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. He also devised the catch-phrase [...] "satisfaction guaranteed or your money back" [...] which was implemented in 1875.|$|E

40|$|Converging {{technology}} and disappearing income differences across countries will {{not lead to}} homogenization of consumer behavior. Rather, consumer behavior will become more heterogeneous because of cultural differences. As consumer incomes converge across countries, the manifestation of value differences will become stronger. This phenomenon makes it increasingly important to understand values of national cultures {{and their impact on}} consumer behavior. Retailing strategies for one country cannot be extended to other countries without adaptation. Hofstede’s model of national culture is applied to understand differences in consumer behavior across countries. Examples are provided of consumption differences, their relationships with culture discussed, and selected implications for international <b>retailing</b> <b>management</b> detailed. © 2002 by New York University.
