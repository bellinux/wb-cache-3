5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (<b>risk</b> <b>is</b> 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> about 13% and if both are affected the <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> nearly 50%.|$|E

For example: with respect to the first Basel II pillar, only one <b>risk,</b> credit <b>risk,</b> <b>was</b> dealt with in a simple manner while market <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> an afterthought; {{operational}} <b>risk</b> <b>was</b> not dealt with at all.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, if the MCL is {{sufficiently}} demanding, then a pooling equilibrium, where all insurers {{offer the same}} contract, is the only possible equilibrium. In this equilibrium all insurers make zero profits and the desired cross-subsidization from high to low <b>risks</b> <b>is</b> attained. Obviously, {{as compared to the}} laissez faire, low <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> worse off and high <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> better off.

5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
5|$|When {{taken with}} NSAIDS (non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} medications), warfarin {{increases the risk}} for gastrointestinal bleeding. This increased <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> due to the anti-platelet effect of NSAIDS {{as well as the}} possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.|$|E

5|$|About 8% of {{lung cancer}} is due to {{inherited}} factors. In relatives of people with lung cancer, the <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> doubled. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} genes. Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk {{of lung cancer}}.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
40|$|The Biomass Industry {{has many}} {{characteristics}} {{of an infant}} industry but unlike an infant industry its products are primarily energy commodities that {{can be obtained from}} many sources. These characteristics create a multitude of <b>risks.</b> <b>Risks</b> <b>are</b> in three main areas. The first set of <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> market <b>risks.</b> The second set of <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> technology <b>risks.</b> The third set of <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> public policy <b>risks.</b> Market risks include prices received, prices paid and price volatility. Technology risks include current densification technology costly. Most biomass technology was developed if the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Technology is changing with resent renewed interest in biomass. Therefore, there <b>is</b> the <b>risk</b> of stranded investment as new technologies displace current technologies. Public policy <b>risks</b> <b>are</b> in three areas. First is withdrawal of public funding for biomass. Second is policy changes effecting harvesting biomass on public lands. Third is changes in environmental policies including CO² regulation. <b>Risk</b> management <b>is</b> key to success in the biomass industry. Market <b>risks</b> can <b>be</b> reduced through forward contracting. Technology <b>risks</b> can <b>be</b> reduced by investing in technologies that have multiple uses and spreading costs over many shareholders on single use technologies.

5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E

5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities.

5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected blood products and through organ donation. In countries such as Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.|$|E

5|$|Depending {{upon the}} risk for DVT, {{different}} preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, which {{increases the risk of}} bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The risk of major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year, and the point where annual VTE <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> thought to warrant long-term anticoagulation is estimated to be between 3 and 9%. Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> long-term anticoagulation a common consideration. Antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, carries an annual risk of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long-term anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The <b>risk</b> <b>is</b> greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold.

40|$|The Gail {{model is}} widely used for the {{assessment}} of risk of invasive breast cancer based on recognized clinical risk factors. In recent years, a substantial number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer <b>risk</b> have <b>been</b> identified.
