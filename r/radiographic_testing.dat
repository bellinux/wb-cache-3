40|$|Trochlear notch {{sclerosis}} (TNS) as {{assessed by}} radiography {{has been shown}} to be increased in elbow dysplasia (ED) associated medial coronoid process disease (M(D). The aims of this study were to investigate whether two defined <b>radiographic</b> <b>tests</b> evaluating INS would increase the sensitivity of detecting osteoarthritis secondary to MCD, and to assess whether there was a of relation between increasing TNS with severity of MCD. Sixty-one dogs with MCD (121 elbows) were selected from the imaging database. The controls were nine cadavers (18 disease-free elbows). Standard International Elbow Working Group radiographs and CI scans were taken of each elbow, Plain radiographs were analysed using various assessments: osteophyte grade (0 - 3), coronoid grade (0 - 3), INS descriptive grade (0 - 3) and INS ratio, The INS ratio was calculated from the depth of ulnar sclerosis at the level of the disto-cranial margin of the humeral condyles divided by the cranio-caudal ulna depth. The INS descriptive assessment and ratio both increased the overall sensitivity of diagnosing osteoarthritis secondary to MCD above the other <b>radiographic</b> <b>tests.</b> The sensitivity of the TNS ratio or < 0. 3 mm was 91 %- 96 % and the INS descriptive assessment was 77 %- 96 %. Radiographic INS significantly increased with increasing severity of coronoid disease grade as evaluated by CT p < 0. 01. The finding that INS increases the sensitivity of diagnosing osteoarthritis secondary to MCD is valuable to those that have neither a CT scanner nor arthroscopy readily available.

50|$|TDO is {{a genetic}} based {{disorder}} it is diagnosed based on radiographic imaging, physical {{characteristics of the}} disease, and genetic testing if necessary. PCR amplification is used to check for normal and deletion allele, found in the 141 base pair allele. A four base pair deletion in exon 3 is also noted in patients with TDO; deletion in two transcription factor genes DLX-3 and DLX-7 gene (distal-less gene) that occurs by a frameshift mutation, makes this gene shorter than its normal length and non-functional. Radiographs such as cephalometric analysis or panoramic radiograph are used to detect skeletal abnormalities in TDO cases; these radiographs along with the phenotypic effects of the disease are often enough evidence for proper diagnosis. In normal cases, radiologic imaging shows no evidence of hardening of bone tissue (sclerosis), lesions on the bone structures surrounding the teeth due to decay or trauma, or hard tissue mass. In cases of TDO, these radiographic abnormalities are almost always present. The <b>radiographic</b> <b>testing</b> is non-invasive, and involves the patient {{to be able to}} sit or {{stand in front of the}} radiographic device with their mouth closed and lips relaxed for approximately one minute. Oral abnormalities are diagnosed by a visual dental examination. A normal oral evaluation would show no signs of broken or fractured teeth, attrition of tooth enamel, no spacing between teeth, no soft tissue mass or sign of dental abscess, and a bite relationship where the mandibular (bottom) teeth interdigitate within a normal plane of 1-2mm behind and underneath the maxillary (top) teeth.|$|E
