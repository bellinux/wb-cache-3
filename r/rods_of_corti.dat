40|$|The calbindin (CB) and the calretinin (CR) immunoreactivities {{were studied}} in the dog cochlea during its {{postnatal}} maturation from birth to the 33 rd postnatal day. At birth, CB was expressed in the Kolliker's organ, in the immature inner (IHC) and outer hair cells (OHC), in neurons of the spiral ganglion, and in nerve fibers running in the basilar membrane of the apical turn. During the cochlear maturation, non-sensorineuronal structures, such as the Kolliker's organ, the <b>rods</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti,</b> and the inner sulcus cells, displayed a transient CB-staining. In the adult-like dog cochlea, CB {{was found in the}} cytoplasm, the cuticular plate, and the stereocilia of the IHC and OHC. All the neurons of the spiral ganglion and some nerves fibers in the modulius were CB-positive. At birth, CR exhibited a neuronal distribution: about 75 % of the spiral ganglion neurons, some nerve fibers in the modulius and nerve fibers running in the basilar membrane were CR-labeled. During the postnatal maturation, a CR-immunostaining appeared around the IHC body and CR was expressed transiently in the OHC. In the adult-like dog cochlea, a CR-positive network surrounded the unlabeled IHC. The neuronal CR-labeling remained unchanged from birth. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> {{is highly}} ordered, {{with a single}} row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells. The number of hair cells {{produced}} {{was thought to be}} limited by the time of their terminal mitosis (i. e. E 14 in the mouse). However, exogenous application of retinoic acid has been shown to stimulate the formation of supernumerary hair cells in organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants from E 13 to E 16 mouse embryos. Using late embryonic and neonatal rat organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants, we investigated the potential for production of supernumerary hair cells in more mature auditory sensory epithelia. When newborn rat organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants were cultured under control conditions, an area of supernumerary hair cells was observed in a segment <b>of</b> organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> that was at the junction between the basal and middle turns. In these areas of supernumerary hair cells the number of hair cells increased per unit of length, but remained constant per surface unit, further demonstrating the supernumerary character of this phenomenon. Organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) showed a 50 % increase in the length of the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> segment containing supernumerary hair cells. Upregulation of supernumerary hair cell formation by EGF was found to start and be maximal at birth (P 0) and to disappear by 2 days after birth (P 2). Treatment of EGF stimulated P 0 explants with an antimitotic drug, cytosine arabinoside (ARAc), demonstrated that the production of supernumerary hair cells occurred independently of cell division.

50|$|The fluids {{in these}} two tubes, the {{endolymph}} and the perilymph are very different chemically, biochemically, and electrically. Therefore, they are kept strictly separated. This separation is the main function of Reissner's membrane (between scala vestibuli and scala media), {{and it is also}} the function of tissue held by the basilar membrane such as the inner and outer sulcus cells (shown in yellow) and the reticular lamina of the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> (shown in magenta). For the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> the basilar membrane is permeable to perilymph.

5000|$|The basilar {{membrane}} supports the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti,</b> which sits within the scala media. [...] The organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> comprises both outer and inner hair cells.

[...] Outer hair cells have stereocilia projecting towards the tectorial membrane, which sits above the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti.</b> Stereocilia respond to {{movement of the}} tectorial membrane when a sound causes vibration through the cochlea. When this occurs, the stereocilia separate and a channel is formed that allows chemical processes to take place. Eventually the signal reaches the eighth nerve, followed by processing in the brain.|$|R

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of age-related hearing loss is caused by loss or damage to outer hair cells in the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti.</b> The organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> is the mechanosensory transducing apparatus in the inner ear and is composed of inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and highly specialized supporting cells. The mechanisms that regulate differentiation of inner and outer hair cells are not known. Here we report that fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF 20) is required for differentiation of cells in the lateral cochlear compartment (outer hair and supporting cells) within the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> during a specific developmental time. In the absence of FGF 20, mice are deaf and lateral compartment cells remain undifferentiated, postmitotic, and unresponsive to Notch-dependent lateral inhibition.

40|$|SummaryThe {{auditory}} sensory epithelium (organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti),</b> where {{sound waves}} are converted to electrical signals, comprises a highly ordered array of sensory receptor (hair) cells and nonsensory supporting cells. Here, {{we report that}} Sprouty 2, which encodes a negative regulator of signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases, is required for normal hearing in mice, and that lack of SPRY 2 results in dramatic perturbations in organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> cytoarchitecture: instead <b>of</b> two pillar cells, there are three, resulting {{in the formation of}} an ectopic tunnel <b>of</b> <b>Corti.</b> We demonstrate that these effects are due to a postnatal cell fate transformation of a Deiters’ cell into a pillar cell. Both this cell fate change and hearing loss can be partially rescued by reducing Fgf 8 gene dosage in Spry 2 null mutant mice. Our results provide evidence that antagonism of FGF signaling by SPRY 2 is essential for establishing the cytoarchitecture of the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> and for hearing...|$|R

When fetal rat organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants are cultured, supernumerary OHCs and supernumerary Deiters' cells are produced, without any additional cell proliferation. Analysis of semi- and ultrathin sections revealed that supernumerary OHCs are produced at the distal edge of the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti.</b> Quantitative analysis <b>of</b> cell types present in the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> demonstrates that {{when the number of}} OHCs increases: (i) the total number of cells remains constant; (ii) the number of Deiters' cells increases; (iii) the number of tectal cells decreases and of Hensen's cells decreases. Using specific HC markers, i. e. jagged 2 (Jag 2) and Math 1, we showed that in addition to existing OHCs, supernumerary OHCs, tectal cells and Hensen's cells expressed these markers in embryonic day 19 organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants after 5 days in vitro. The {{results of this study suggest}} that Hensen's cells retain the capacity to differentiate into either tectal cells, which differentiate into OHCs, or into undertectal cells which differentiate into Deiters' cells.

50|$|The organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti,</b> or spiral organ, is the {{receptor}} organ for {{hearing and}} {{is located in}} the mammalian cochlea. This highly varied strip of epithelial cells allows for transduction of auditory signals into nerve impulses' action potential. Transduction occurs through vibrations of structures in the inner ear causing displacement of cochlear fluid and movement of hair cells at the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> to produce electrochemical signals.|$|R

OHCs are connected to the reticular laminar and the Deiters’ cells. There are roughly twelve thousand OHCs in each human ear, and these are arranged in up to five rows. Each OHC has small tufts of 'hairs', or cilia, on their upper surface known as stereocilia, and these are also arranged into rows which are graded in height. There are approximately 140 stereocilia on each OHC.|$|R

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) indicates that there is DNA damage in adult OHCs, within 8 h of explantation. Treatment of the adult organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants with either actinomycin D (10 (- 7) M) or cycloheximide (10 (- 6) M) prevents most OHC losses.

OHC losses in the adult guinea pig, organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> cultures can also be prevented by treatment with several of the growth factors tested. i. e. acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that bcl- 2 prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of auditory sensory cells in explants of the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> and dissociated cell cultures of the spiral ganglion. METHODS: Organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants and dissociated spiral ganglion cell cultures obtained from 3 -day-old (P 3) rats or adult spiral ganglion cell cultures from 28 -day-old (P 28) rats were transduced with vectors containing a human bcl- 2 gene. Cultures were then exposed to neomycin, cisplatin or subjected to withdrawal of neurotrophin supplementation. Outcome measures included hair cell and neuron counts, mitochondrial membrane potential and a histological measure of apoptosis. RESULTS: Expression of bcl- 2 in the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants and neuronal cell cultures provided a significant level of protection against cell death. Bcl- 2 expression in the organ <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> explants also protected mitochondria from loss of membrane potential and blocked an early step in the commitment of hair cells to apoptosis.
