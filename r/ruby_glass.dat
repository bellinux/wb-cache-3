25|$|Located near to Colmore Row, {{the site}} was once owned by the Colmore family who owned large areas of land {{to the north of}} the present city centre. The family began to {{establish}} road layouts and sell plots of land to builders in the 18th century. The site was one of these plots and it became the location of Oppenheim's Glassworks. This is the earliest documented glassworks in Birmingham. The glassworks were built in 1757 by Mayer Oppenheim, a London merchant who moved to Birmingham in the same year and who patented red (<b>ruby)</b> <b>glass</b> in 1755. The building ceased to be used as a glasshouse after 1780/81. The site was later cleared to make way for the new Birmingham Snow Hill station. In 1970, Snow Hill station was redeveloped and the site became a surface car park and remained as such until construction work commenced.|$|E

This unique electrical response is expected to introduce new functionality to this class of nanocomposites. Â© 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

It is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of Carpaccio's, one of his series of the Life of St. George. I could not get the curves of the leaves, and they are patched and spoiled; but the parrot's head, however badly done, is put down with no more touches than the Venetian gave it, and it will show you exactly his method. First, a thin, warm ground had been laid over the whole canvas, which Carpaccio wanted as an under-current through all the color, just as there is an under-current of gray in the Loire drawings. Then on this he strikes his parrot in vermilion, almost flat color; rounding a little only with a glaze of lake; but attending mainly to get the character of the bird by the pure outline of its form, as if it were cut out of a piece of <b>ruby</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
60|$|The dining-room {{into which}} they were shown was {{at the back of}} the house, and looked into {{agreeable}} gardens. The apartment was in some little confusion at this moment, for their host gave a dinner to-day, and his dinners were famous. The table was arranged for eight guests; its appointments indicated refined taste. A candelabrum of Dresden china was the centre piece; there was a whole service of the same material, even to the handles of the knives and forks; and the choice variety of glass attracted Ferdinand's notice. The room was lofty and spacious; it was simply and soberly furnished; not an object which could distract the taste or disturb the digestion. But the sideboard, which filled a recess at the end of the apartment, presented a crowded group of gold plate that might have become a palace; magnificent shields, tall vases, ancient tankards, goblets of carved ivory set in precious metal, and cups of old <b>ruby</b> <b>glass</b> mounted on pedestals, glittering with gems. This accidental display certainly offered an amusing contrast to the perpetual splendour of Mr. Levison's buffet; and Ferdinand was wondering whether it would turn out that there was as marked a difference between the two owners, when his companion and himself were summoned to the presence of Mr. Bond Sharpe.|$|E

40|$|Gold doped <b>ruby</b> <b>glasses</b> are {{classical}} {{examples of}} metal-glass nanocomposites {{that have been}} investigated for their striking optical properties. For their multifunctional applications, we have explored {{the nature of the}} electrical response of two oxide glasses containing a small amount (< 0. 1 mol) of gold. Gold-doped lithium borate (LBO) and lanthanum borogermanate (LBGO) glasses are studied using ac conductivity as a function of frequency and temperature in relation to their structure as determined by electron microscopy. For ionically conducting LBO, Au doping produces a noticeable increase of the electrical conductivity. For poorly conducting LBGO, gold doping introduces a dielectric loss peak indicative of dipolar relaxation. The heat treatment of both glasses introduces a new mechanism of dc conduction or dipolar loss, which has about one third the activation energy of the untreated samples. This unexpected behavior is attributed to an ionic-to-electronic conductivity transition in gold doped glasses. Â© by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag...|$|R

40|$|Three sets {{of glass}} samples from 18 th century leaded windows from the Girona Cathedral, Reus Priory Church and the Vitoria Cathedral (Spain) have been studied. Chemical {{analyses}} and archaeometry of these glasses are {{of special interest}} due to both the scarcity of 18 th century stained glass window production and to the particular orange colour of several glass pieces. Chemical degradation of glasses has been deduced from their composition and conservation state, directly observed using optical and electron microscopy. The chemical species responsible for colouring (chromophores) and other chromatic parameters have been investigated from optical spectroscopic data. The results indicated that glasses from Girona Cathedral are potash–lime–silica glasses, whereas those of the Reus Priory Church and Vitoria Cathedral are soda–lime–silica glasses. The durability of the glasses studied {{is directly related to}} their respective chemical composition: potash glasses from Girona show advanced chemical degradation, compared with the other sets of glasses analysed. In addition to the assignment of chromophores for blue, violet, green and red <b>ruby</b> <b>glasses,</b> the chromophores responsible for the orange colour of glasses from stained windows have been characterised for the first time.

50|$|Glass {{comprising}} multiple {{layers of}} clear and (usually) red glass was known {{to exist in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known. Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the cylinder blown sheet process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven. Red, or <b>ruby,</b> copper-based <b>glass,</b> is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.|$|R
