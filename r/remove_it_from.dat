Kloss apologized on her Twitter account for the outfit and expressed her support for the outfit's removal in the broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, {{computer}} store owner, {{was killed}} in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed {{in the parking lot}} of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together publicly about their relationship.|$|E

5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} Iron Age, grain was threshed to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the stalks by beating it with sticks or by oxen {{treading}} on it. This usually broke {{most of the}} grain kernels, which limited their storage time because broken kernels spoil more quickly than unbroken ones. The development of the threshing-board, which was pulled over the stalks by oxen, left most of the grain kernels intact and enhanced their storage time. Numerous threshing floors and threshing boards have been discovered at archaeological sites of ancient Israel.|$|E

Levi were threatening the country's safety.|$|E

In case the robot stopped moving because of malfunction the company was required to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time. A 2017 version of the Personal Delivery Device Act bill was under review as of March 2017.|$|E

25|$|The bailout valve (BOV) is an {{open circuit}} demand valve built into a rebreather {{mouthpiece}} or {{other part of the}} breathing loop. It can be isolated while the diver is using the rebreather to recycle breathing gas and opened {{while at the same time}} isolating the breathing loop when a problem causes the diver to bail out onto open circuit. The main distinguishing feature of the BOV is that the same mouthpiece is used for open and closed-circuit, and the diver does not have to shut the Dive/Surface valve, <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> their mouth, and find and insert the bailout demand valve in order to bail out onto open circuit. Although costly, this reduction in critical steps makes the integrated BOV a significant safety advantage.|$|E
25|$|Pickton was {{described}} as getting his manuscript out of prison by passing it to a former cellmate who then sent it to a retired construction worker from California named Michael Chilldres — who typed it up and is credited {{as the author of}} the 144-page book. Provincial Solicitor General Mike Morris and an online petition on Change.org each sought to remove the book from sale on Amazon.com. Premier Christy Clark expressed interest in introducing new legislation similar to laws in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Ontario to prevent criminal profits from such books. Colorado publisher Outskirts Press ceased publication of the book and asked Amazon to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> their site after finding out that although Chilldres had his name on the book cover, the author was actually an incarcerated criminal.|$|E
25|$|Removal of copyrighted {{content from}} the entire Usenet network is a nearly {{impossible}} task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server. Petitioning a Usenet provider for removal only removes it from that one server's retention cache, but not any others. It is possible for a special post cancellation message to be distributed to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> all servers, but many providers ignore cancel messages by standard policy, {{because they can be}} easily falsified and submitted by anyone. For a takedown petition to be most effective across the whole network, {{it would have to be}} issued to the origin server to which the content has been posted, before it has been propagated to other servers. Removal of the content at this early stage would prevent further propagation, but with modern high speed links, content can be propagated as fast as it arrives, allowing no time for content review and takedown issuance by copyright holders.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, di Grassi led Sarrazin, Rosenqvist, Evans, Vergne, Prost, Carroll, Turvey, Duval, Dillmann, Heidfeld, Abt, Félix da Costa, Frijns, Engel, Buemi, López, d'Ambrosio, Bird and Piquet. Di Grassi began to pull away from the rest of the field. Sarrazin was put under {{pressure}} by Rosenqvist but defended his position from him. Attention then switched to Buemi who was beginning his move up the field. He adopted the positioning of his left hand on his steering wheel against his bent steering arm. Heidfeld and Abt were able to enter the top-ten places and both battled for position. Abt passed Heidfeld for ninth place on the ninth lap. After ten laps Buemi had passed four drivers to run in 12th place. After Buemi had overtaken Duval for tenth position on the 14th lap, Heidfeld attempted to overtake Duval on the outside line, but Duval defended his position, leaving Heidfeld without any space on the dirty part of the track and the two made contact at turn six. Duval resumed but Heidfeld's front-right suspension was bent and drove to the side of the track at turn 12 to retire. Heidfeld's stricken car prompted the activation of the full course yellow procedure to enable marshals to <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the circuit and most drivers elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change into their second cars.|$|E
