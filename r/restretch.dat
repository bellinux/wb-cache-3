The fractions consisted largely of a heterogeneous mixture of acidic polysaccharides and in lesser amounts a polypeptide component (2 - 30 %), probably linked to the polysaccharides. The polysaccharides contained uronic acid (probably mostly glucuronic acid), D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose and L-rhamnose and lesser amounts of a number of pentoses.

Cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration, myosin light-chain phosphorylation, and maximum shortening velocity all declined from 20 s to 5 min of contraction. The time course of shortening following isotonic quick release was biexponential, with a fastest rate constant of approximately 80 s- 1 in both phasic and tonic contractions. Stiffness was identical in phasic and tonic contraction; however, after a release to slack length and unloaded shortening, stiffness during <b>restretch</b> was greater in tonic contraction (51 vs. 43 % of isometric stiffness after 16 ms of unloaded shortening).

40|$|Crossbridge {{models of}} muscle {{contraction}} based on biochemical studies predict {{that there may}} be a relationship between the rate-limiting step in the actomyosin ATPase cycle in vitro and the rate of force development in vivo. In the present study, we measured the rate of force redevelopment in skinned rabbit muscle fibers following unloaded isotonic shortening and a rapid <b>restretch.</b> For comparison, ATPase activity was measured under identical conditions, using myosin subfragment- 1 chemically crosslinked to actin. We found that the time course of force redevelopment is well fitted by a single exponential function, implying that force redevelopment is a first-order process, described by a single rate constant. The magnitude of this rate constant is in close agreement with the rate constant necessary to simulate the experimental force-velocity relation on the basis of a crossbridge model of the type proposed by A. F. Huxley in 1957. In addition, the observed close correlation between the rate constant for force redevelopment and the maximal actin-activated actomyosin ATPase rate under a variety of conditions suggests that the step that determines the rate of force generation in the crossbridge cycle may be the physiological equivalent of the rate-limiting step in the actomyosin ATPase cycle in solution...|$|E
40|$|The ATPase {{activity}} of single fibers of small fiber bundles (one to three fibers) of insect flight muscle was measured when fibers were repetitively released and restretched by 1. 5 % of their initial length. The ATPase activity increased with increasing duration of release-restretch pulses applied {{at a constant}} repetition frequency, reaching a maximum at a duration of ∼ 20 ms. For a given duration, the average ATPase activity also increased with increasing frequency of applied length changes and reached a maximum (200 % of the isometric ATPase) at a frequency of ∼ 50 Hz. The data could be fitted to a two-state model in which the apparent rate of crossbridge detachment is enhanced when the crossbridges are mechanically released. Estimates of the apparent rates of attachment and detachment in the isometrically contracting state and of the enhanced detachment rate of unloaded crossbridges were derived from fits to the two-state model. After short pulses of releasing and restretching the fiber the force was low and increased after the <b>restretch</b> in a roughly exponential manner to the initial level. The rate at which force increased after a release-restretch pulse {{was similar to the}} sum of the apparent attachment and detachment rates for the isometrically contracting muscle derived from the ATPase activity measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of Ca 2 + on isometric force kinetics was studied in skinned rat ventricular trabeculae {{by measuring the}} kinetics of force redevelopment after a transient decrease in force. Two protocols were employed to rapidly detach cycling myosin cross-bridges: a large-amplitude muscle length ramp followed by a <b>restretch</b> {{back to the original}} length or a 4 % segment length step. During the recovery of force, the length of the central region of the muscle was controlled by using a segment marker technique and software feedback control. Tension redevelopment was fit by a rising exponential governed by the rate constant ktr for the ramp/restretch protocol and kstep for the step protocol. ktr and kstep averaged 7. 06 s- 1 and 15. 7 s- 1, respectively, at 15 degrees C; neither ktr nor kstep increased with the level of Ca 2 + activation. Similar results were found at submaximum Ca 2 + levels when sarcomere length control by laser diffraction was used. The lack of activation dependence of ktr contrasts with results from fast skeletal fibers, in which ktr varies 10 -fold from low to high activation levels, and suggests that Ca 2 + does not modulate the kinetics of cross-bridge attachment or detachment in mammalian cardiac muscle...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn maximally {{activated}} skinned fibers, {{the rate}} of tension redevelopment (ktr) following a rapid release and <b>restretch</b> {{is determined by the}} maximal rate of cross-bridge cycling. During submaximal Ca 2 + activations, however, ktr regulation varies with thin filament dynamics. Thus, decreasing {{the rate of}} Ca 2 + dissociation from TnC produces a higher ktr value at a given tension level (P), especially in the [Ca 2 +] range that yields less than 50 % of maximal tension (Po). In this study, native rabbit TnC was replaced with chicken recombinant TnC, either wild-type (rTnC) or mutant (NHdel), with decreased Ca 2 + affinity and an increased Ca 2 + dissociation rate (koff). Despite marked differences in Ca 2 + sensitivity (> 0. 5 ΔpCa 50), fibers reconstituted with either of the recombinant proteins exhibited similar ktr versus tension profiles, with ktr low (1 – 2 s− 1) and constant up to ∼ 50 % Po, then rising sharply to a maximum (16 ± 0. 8 s− 1) in fully activated fibers. This behavior is predicted by a four-state model based on coupling between cross-bridge cycling and thin filament regulation, where Ca 2 + directly affects only individual thin filament regulatory units. These data and model simulations confirm that the range of ktr values obtained with varying Ca 2 + can be regulated by a rate-limiting thin filament process...|$|E

At that time, the paintings section was divided, rather arbitrarily, into: paintings pre- 1940, headed by Ilse King and; paintings post- 1940, headed by Allan Byrne. Because of the departure of the then senior curator of conservation Dr Nathan Stolow, Allan Byrne became acting senior curator. When Allan Byrne took up the position of lecturer in paintings conservation at C. C. A. E., Ilse King then became acting senior curator and my supervisor; the division within the painting section was then disbanded. Jac Macnaughtan departed temporarily from the department to undertake study and to work at the Tate Gallery and at the Courtauld Institute in London leaving me with the paintings section.

40|$|PURPOSE: Patients with overcorrected {{strabismus}} (and several {{patients with}} undercorrection after extraocular muscle resection) underwent exploration of previously operated muscles, {{with the intention}} of advancing their tendons to prevent the need for surgery on additional muscles. Unexpectedly, it was found that, in many cases, an elongated scar segment of variable length was interposed between the muscle and its insertion site on the sclera. Laboratory investigations were carried out to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) and to create an animal model of the disorder. METHODS: Lengthened scars were repaired on 198 muscles during 134 procedures performed on 123 patients. The scars consisted of amorphous connective tissue interposed between the globe and normal tendon. Repair was accomplished by excision of the scar and reattachment of the muscle to sclera, using absorbable sutures in 64 cases and nonabsorbable sutures in 70 cases. Histopathologic examination was performed on 82 clinical specimens, and tissue culture studies were performed on 7 specimens. To develop an animal model, 10 New Zealand white rabbits underwent bilateral superior rectus resection. Half of the eyes received sub-Tenon's injections of collagenase over the operative site during weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 postoperatively; the other half received saline solution injections on the same schedule. At 10 weeks, half the sites were studied histologically, and the other half underwent collagen creep analysis. In a second study, the use of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures was compared in the rabbit model. RESULTS: In the clinical cases, the mean length of the elongated scar segments was 4. 2 mm. A total of 105 of the 134 repair procedures were judged successful. Thirty-one procedures resulted in recurrence of the original overcorrection; 7 of these had documented <b>restretches.</b> Factors that distinguished patients with stretched scars from patients with classic slipped muscles included minimal or no limitation of versions, less separation of the tendons from sclera, and thicker appearance of the scar segments. The use of nonabsorbable sutures in the repair procedure reduced the recurrence rate. Histologic examination of the clinical stretched scar specimens showed dense connective tissue that was less well organized compared with normal tendon. In the tissue culture studies, cells cultured from the stretched scar specimens grew rapidly and were irregularly shaped. A high-molecular-weight protein was identified in the culture medium. By contrast, cells cultured from normal tendon (controls) grew more slowly and regularly, stopped growing at 4 days, and produced less total protein than cultured stretched scar specimens. In the animal model studies, the collagenase-treated sites showed elongated scars with increased collagen between the muscle and the sclera, as well as increased collagen creep rates, compared with the saline-treated controls. The use of nonabsorbable sutures in collagenase-treated animal model surgery sites was associated with shorter, thicker scars compared with similar sites sutured with absorbable sutures. CONCLUSIONS: A lengthened or stretched, remodeled scar between an operated muscle tendon and sclera is a common occurrence and is a factor contributing to the variability of outcome after strabismus repair, even years later. This abnormality may be revealed by careful exploration of previously operated muscles. Definitive repair requires firm reattachment of tendon to sclera with nonabsorbable suture support...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the nitric oxide (NO) donor spermine NONOate (Sp-NO, 1. 0 mM) on cross-bridge {{recruitment}} and cross-bridge cycling kinetics were studied in permeabilized rabbit psoas muscle fibers. Fibers were activated at various Ca 2 + concentrations (pCa, negative logarithm of Ca 2 + concentration), and the pCa at which force was maximal (pCa 4. 0) and approximately 50 % of maximal (pCa 50 5. 6) were determined. Fiber stiffness was determined using 1 -kHz sinusoidal length perturbations, and the fraction of cross bridges in the force-generating state was estimated by the ratio of stiffness during maximal (pCa 4. 0) and submaximal (pCa 5. 6) Ca 2 + activation to stiffness during rigor (at pCa 4. 0). Cross-bridge cycling kinetics were evaluated by measuring the rate constant for force redevelopment after quick release (by 15 % of optimal fiber length, L(o)) and <b>restretch</b> of the fiber to L(o). Exposing fibers to Sp-NO for 10 min reduced force and the fraction of cross bridges in the force-generating state at maximal and submaximal (pCa 50) Ca 2 + activation. However, the effects of Sp-NO were more pronounced during submaximal Ca 2 + activation. Sp-NO also reduced the rate constant for force redevelopment but only during submaximal Ca 2 + activation. We conclude that Sp-NO reduces Ca 2 + sensitivity by decreasing the number of cross bridges in the strongly bound state and also impairs cross-bridge cycling kinetics during submaximal activation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Ca 2 + upon the rate {{constant}} of force redevelopment following {{a period of}} isotonic shortening with immediate <b>restretch</b> to the starting sarcomere length was studied in rabbit psoas fibers at 5 degrees C. Control experiments support {{the assumption that the}} rate constant of force redevelopment represents isometric cross-bridge turnover kinetics (fapp + gapp), where fapp and gapp are the rate constants characterizing the transitions from the non-force-generating states to the force-generating states and back to the non-force-generating states, respectively. Parallel measurements of the rate constant of force redevelopment and of force, stiffness, and fiber ATPase during isometric contraction allow the effect of Ca 2 + upon fapp and gapp to be determined. Analysis reveals that Ca 2 + has a marked effect upon fapp, while gapp remains approximately unchanged. Furthermore, in the range above 25 - 30 % of maximum Ca 2 + activation, regulation of force, stiffness, and ATPase is mediated through changes in fapp. Below this range, however, it cannot be ruled out that, in addition, cross-bridges are also switched {{in and out of the}} turnover process ("recruitment"). As a consequence of regulation through turnover kinetics, both Ca 2 + sensitivity and the slope of force-pCa (-log[Ca 2 +]) relations are shown to be affected by the ratio fapp/gapp, which may represent an important mechanism of modulation of contractile function in addition to modulation through changes within the regulatory protein system...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the removal of fast {{skeletal}} troponin C (fsTnC) and its replacement by cardiac troponin C (cTnC) and the exchange of fast skeletal troponin (fsTn) for cardiac troponin (cTn) were measured in rabbit fast skeletal myofibrils. Electrophoretic analysis of myofibril suspensions indicated that replacement of fsTnC or exchange of fsTn with cTnC or cTn was about 90 % complete in the protocols used. Mechanical measurements in single myofibrils, which were maximally activated by fast solution switching, showed that replacement of fsTnC with cTnC reduced the isometric tension, the rate of tension rise following a step increase in Ca 2 + (kact), {{and the rate of}} tension redevelopment following a quick release and <b>restretch</b> (ktr), but had no effect on the kinetics of the fall in tension when the concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi) was abruptly increased (kPi(+)). These data suggest that the chimeric protein produced by cTnC replacement in fsTn alters those steps controlling the weak-to-strong crossbridge attachment transition. Inefficient signalling within the chimeric troponin may cause these changes. However, replacement of fsTn by cTn had no effect on maximal isometric tension, kact or ktr, suggesting that these mechanics are largely determined by the isoform of the myosin molecule. Replacement of fsTn by cTn, on the other hand, shifted the pCa 50 of the pCa-tension relationship from 5. 70 to 6. 44 and reduced the Hill coefficient from 3. 3 to 1. 4, suggesting that regulatory protein isoforms primarily alter Ca 2 + sensitivity and the cooperativity of the force-generating mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Reducing the {{activating}} calcium concentration with skinned fibres {{is known}} to decrease isometric force and maximal shortening velocity, both of which will reduce the peak power. However, power is also {{a function of the}} curvature of the force-velocity relationship, and there is limited information on how changes in activating calcium affect this important property of muscle fibres. Force-velocity relationships of permeabilized single type I fibres from rat soleus muscle were determined using isotonic contractions at 15 °C with both maximal (pCa 4. 5) and submaximal activation (pCa 5. 6). The rate of tension redevelopment (k(tr)), which provides a measure of sum of the apparent rate constants for cross-bridge attachment and detachment (f(app) + g(app)) following a rapid release and <b>restretch,</b> was also measured. Compared with pCa 4. 5, specific tension (P(o)) at pCa 5. 6 declined by 22 ± 8 % (mean ± s. d.) and the maximal velocity of shortening (V(max)) fell by 44 ± 7 %, but curvature of the force-velocity relationship (a/P(o)) rose by 47 ± 31 %, indicating a less concave relationship. The value of k(tr) declined by 23 ± 7 %. The change in a/P(o) reduced the impact of changes in P(o) and V(max) on peak power by approximately 25 %. Fitting the data to Huxley's model of cross-bridge action suggests that lower activating calcium decreased both the rate constant for cross-bridge attachment (f) and that for detachment of negatively strained cross-bridges (g(2)). The fact that V(max) (and thus g(2)) changed {{to a greater extent than}} k(tr) (f(app) + g(app)) is the reason that reduced activation results in a reduction in curvature of the force-velocity relationship...|$|E
40|$|Redevelopment of {{isometric}} force following shortening of {{skeletal muscle}} {{is thought to}} result from a redistribution of cross-bridge states. We varied the initial force and cross-bridge distribution by applying various length-change protocols to active skinned single fibres from rabbit psoas muscle, and observed {{the effect on the}} slowest phase of recovery (‘late recovery’) that follows transient changes. In response to step releases that reduced force to near zero (∼ 8 nm (half sarcomere) − 1) or prolonged shortening at high velocity, late recovery was well described by two exponentials of approximately equal amplitude and rate constants of ∼ 2 s− 1 and ∼ 9 s− 1 at 5 °C. When a large <b>restretch</b> was applied at the end of rapid shortening, recovery was accelerated by (1) the introduction of a slow falling component that truncated the rise in force, and (2) a relative increase in the contribution of the fast exponential component. The rate of the slow fall was similar to that observed after a small isometric step stretch, with a rate of 0. 4 – 0. 8 s− 1, and its effects could be reversed by reducing force to near zero immediately after the stretch. Force at the start of late recovery was varied in a series of shortening steps or ramps in order to probe the effect of cross-bridge strain on force redevelopment. The rate constants of the two components fell by 40 – 50 % as initial force was raised to 75 – 80 % of steady isometric force. As initial force increased, the relative contribution of the fast component decreased, and this was associated with a length constant of about 2 nm. The results are consistent with a two-state strain-dependent cross-bridge model. In the model there is a continuous distribution of recovery rate constants, but two-exponential fits show that the fast component results from cross-bridges initially at moderate positive strain and the slow component from cross-bridges at high positive strain...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of skinned single fibres from rabbit psoas muscle have been correlated with biochemical {{steps in the}} cross-bridge cycle using a series of metal–nucleotide (Me·NTP) substrates (Mn 2 + or Ni 2 + substituted for Mg 2 +; CTP or ITP for ATP) and inorganic phosphate. Measurements were made of the rate of force redevelopment following (1) slack tests in which force recovery followed a period of unloaded shortening, or (2) ramp shortening at low load terminated by a rapid <b>restretch.</b> The form and rate of force recovery were described as the sum of two exponential functions. Actomyosin-Subfragment 1 (acto-S 1) Me·NTPase activity and Me·NDP release were monitored under the same conditions as the fibre experiments. Mn·ATP and Mg·CTP both supported contraction well and maintained good striation order. Relative to Mg·ATP, they increased the rates and Me·NTPase activity of cross-linked acto-S 1 and the fast component of a double-exponential fit to force recovery by ∼ 50 % and 10 – 35 %, respectively, while shortening velocity was moderately reduced (by 20 – 30 %). Phosphate also increased {{the rate of the}} fast component of force recovery. In contrast to Mn 2 + and CTP, Ni·ATP and Mg·ITP did not support contraction well and caused striations to become disordered. The rates of force recovery and Me·NTPase activity were less than for Mg·ATP (by 40 – 80 % and 50 – 85 %, respectively), while shortening velocity was greatly reduced (by ∼ 80 %). Dissociation of ADP from acto-S 1 was little affected by Ni 2 +, suggesting that Ni·ADP dissociation does not account for the large reduction in shortening velocity. The different effects of Ni 2 + and Mn 2 + were also observed during brief activations elicited by photolytic release of ATP. These results confirm that at least one rate-limiting step is shared by acto-S 1 ATPase activity and force development. Our results are consistent with a dual rate-limitation model in which the rate of force recovery is limited by both NTP cleavage and phosphate release, with their relative contributions and apparent rate constants influenced by an intervening rapid force-generating transition...|$|E
40|$|In voltage-clamped {{barnacle}} single muscle fibers, muscle shortening {{during the}} declining {{phase of the}} calcium transient increases myoplasmic calcium. This extra calcium is probably released from the activating sites by a change in affinity when cross-bridges break (Gordon, A. M., and E. B. Ridgway, 1987. J. Gen. Physiol. 90 : 321 - 340). Stretching the muscle at similar times causes a more complex response, a rapid increase in intracellular calcium followed by a transient decrease. The amplitudes of both phases increase with the rate and amplitude of stretch. The rapid increase, however, appears only when the muscle is stretched more than approximately 0. 4 %. This is above the length change that produces the breakpoint in the force record during a ramp stretch. This positive phase in response to large stretches {{is similar to that}} seen on equivalent shortening at the same point in the contraction. For stretches at different times during the calcium transient, the peak amplitude of the positive phase has a time course that is delayed relative to the calcium transient, while the peak decrease during the negative phase has an earlier time course that is more similar to the calcium transient. The amplitudes of both phases increase with increasing strength of stimulation and consequent force. When the initial muscle the active force. A large decrease in length (which drops the active force to zero) decreases the extra calcium seen on a subsequent <b>restretch.</b> After such a shortening step, the extra calcium on stretch recovers (50 ms half time) toward the control level with the same time course as the redeveloped force. Conversely, stretching an active fiber decreases the extra calcium on a subsequent shortening step that is imposed shortly afterward. Enhanced calcium binding due to increased length alone cannot explain our data. We hypothesize that the calcium affinity of the activating sites increases with cross-bridge attachment and further with cross-bridge strain. This accounts for the biphasic response to stretch as follows: cross-bridges detached by stretch first decrease calcium affinity, then upon reattachment increase calcium affinity due to the strained configuration brought on by the stretch. The experiments suggest that cross-bridge attachment and strain can modify calcium binding to the activating sites in intact muscle...|$|E
