5|$|PHP 3.0 is the {{successor}} of PHP/FI 2.0. Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed {{the base of}} PHP 3, changing the language's name to the <b>recursive</b> <b>acronym</b> PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Stallman {{published}} the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation {{for creating a}} free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix. The name GNU is a <b>recursive</b> <b>acronym</b> for [...] "GNU's Not Unix". Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts. Stallman popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.|$|E

5000|$|Most <b>recursive</b> <b>acronyms</b> are <b>recursive</b> on {{the first}} letter, which is {{therefore}} an arbitrary choice, often selected for reasons of humour, ease of pronunciation, or consistency with an earlier acronym that used the same letters for different words, such as PHP, which now stands for [...] "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor", but was originally [...] "Personal Home Page". However YOPY, [...] "Your own personal YOPY" [...] is recursive on the last letter (hence the last letter of the acronym {{had to be the}} same as the first).|$|R

In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into [...] "Eptification for Particular Task".|$|E
