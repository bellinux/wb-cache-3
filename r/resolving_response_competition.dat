40|$|Initial {{exertion}} {{of self-control}} {{has been suggested}} to impair subsequent self-regulatory performance. The specific cognitive processes that underlie this ego depletion effect have rarely been examined. Drawing on the dual-process theory of executive control (Engle & Kane,; Kane & Engle,), the current meta-analysis revealed that initial self-control exertion impairs participants' capacities of maintaining the task goal but its effect on capacities of <b>resolving</b> <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> {{is in need of}} further investigation. Our results are more consistent with recent theoretical views that consider ego depletion as a switch cost and a result arising from reduced motivation to engage in further self-control...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} select an {{appropriate}} motor <b>response</b> by <b>resolving</b> <b>competition</b> among alternative <b>responses</b> {{plays a major}} role in cognitive performance. fMRI studies suggest that the development of this skill is related to the maturation of the frontal cortex that underlies the improvement of motor inhibition abilities. However, fMRI cannot characterize the temporal properties of motor <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> and motor activation in general. We studied the development of the time course of <b>resolving</b> motor <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> To this end, we used the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an ERP measure, for tracking correct and incorrect motor cortex activation in children in real time. Fourteen children and 14 adults took part in an animal-size Stroop task where they selected between two animals, presented simultaneously on the computer screen, which was larger in real life. In the incongruent condition, the LRP detected stronger and longer lasting incorrect response activation in children than in adults. LRP results could explain behavioral congruency effects, the generally longer RT in children than in adults and the larger congruency effect in children than in adults. In contrast, the peak latency of ERP waves, usually associated with stimulus processing speed, could explain neither of the above effects. We conclude that the development of <b>resolving</b> motor <b>response</b> <b>competition,</b> relying on motor inhibition skills, is a crucial factor in child development. Our study demonstrates that the LRP is an excellent tool for studying motor activation in children...|$|R
40|$|Disentangling the {{component}} processes {{that contribute to}} human executive control is a key challenge for cognitive neuroscience. Here, we employ Event-Related Potentials to provide electrophysiological evidence that action errors during a Go/No-go task can result either from sustained attention failures, or from failures of response inhibition, and that these two processes are temporally and physiologically dissociable, even though the behavioural error ? a non-intended response ? is the same. Thirteen right-handed participants performed a version of a Go/No-go task in which stimuli were presented in a fixed and predictable order thus encouraging attentional drift and a second version in which an identical set of stimuli were presented in a random order thus placing greater emphasis on response inhibition. Electro-cortical markers associated with goal maintenance (late positivity, alpha synchronisation) distinguished correct and incorrect performance in the fixed condition while errors in the random condition were linked to a diminished N 2 /P 3 inhibitory complex. In addition, the amplitude of the Error-Related Negativity did not differ between correct and incorrect responses in the fixed condition consistent with the view that errors in this condition do not arise from a failure to <b>resolve</b> <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> Our data provide an electrophysiological dissociation of sustained attention and response inhibition...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of event-related brain {{potential}} (ERP) and electromyography (EMG) studies [Sz?cs et al., 2007, Behav Brain Funct; Sz?cs & Soltész, 2007 Neuropsychologia; Sz?cs & Soltész, 2008, Brain Res; Sz?cs, Soltész & White, submitted] we investigated the role of perceptual and motor conflict in the Stroop effect. We used the numerical Stroop paradigm where participants had to judge {{which of the two}} simultaneously presented numbers was larger physically or numerically. The physical-size comparison task is analogous to the classical color-word Stroop paradigm in that the irrelevant numerical meaning of numbers affects physical magnitude judgments. The lateralized readiness potential (LRP) was used to guide the separation of perceptual and motor conflict. In the first three studies, there were two major findings. First, between 150 - 250 ms we found early ERP markers of perceptual conflict. Second, at around 400 ms, after the onset of the LRP, we found late conflict-related ERP amplitude effects. We hypothesized that these late effects may be related to <b>resolving</b> motor <b>response</b> <b>competition,</b> or to slow, context-related stimulus-conflict detection. In a fourth study we used EMG electrodes placed on response hands to directly investigate the presence of motor conflict at the level of effectors in the Stroop paradigm. Incorrect response activation detected by EMG was temporally contingent with late ERP effects identified by our previous studies. Hence, we conclude that late ERP effects in the Stroop paradigm are at least partially related to motor <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> Altogether our studies establish reliable ERP markers of perceptual and motor conflict in the Stroop effect...|$|R
40|$|Although lateral asymmetries in {{orienting}} {{behavior are}} evident across species {{and have been}} linked to interhemispheric asymmetries in dopamine signaling, the relative contribution of attentional versus motoric processes remains unclear. Here we took a cognitive genetic approach to adjudicate between roles for dopamine in attentional versus response selection. A sample of nonclinical adult humans (N = 518) performed three cognitive tasks (spatial attentional competition, spatial cueing, and flanker tasks) that varied in {{the degree to which they}} required participants to <b>resolve</b> attentional or <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> All participants were genotyped for two putatively functional tandem repeat polymorphisms of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT 1; SLC 6 A 3), which are argued to influence the level of available synaptic dopamine and confer risk to disorders of inattention. DAT 1 genotype modulated the task-specific effects of the various task-irrelevant stimuli across both the spatial competition and spatial cueing but not flanker tasks. Specifically, compared with individuals carrying one or two copies of the 10 -repeat DAT 1 allele, individuals without this allele demonstrated an immunity to distraction, such that response times were unaffected by increases in the number of distractor stimuli, particularly when these were presented predominantly in the left hemifield. All three genotype groups exhibited uniform costs of <b>resolving</b> leftward <b>response</b> selection in a standard flanker task. None of these significant effects could be explained by speed–accuracy trade-offs, suggesting that participants without the 10 -repeat allele of the DAT 1 tandem repeat polymorphism possess an enhanced attentional ability to suppress task-irrelevant stimuli in the left hemifield...|$|R
40|$|Competing visual stimuli lead to slower {{responses}} to targets. This <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> must be <b>resolved</b> before correct <b>responses</b> are executed. Neuroimaging suggests that <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> monitoring may be subserved by an integrated neural network including the {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (ACC). In this study, 1 patient with a parietal lesion (Patient J. S.) and 1 with an ACC lesion (Patient G. M.) were presented with 2 ranker tasks; 1 required verbal identification of color targets, and the other required an opposite response to targets (e. g., see red and say 'green'); a control group was also tested. For controls, perceptually incongruent rankers interfered {{with the ability to}} inhibit prepotent {{responses to}} targets. Patient J. S. performed in a similar manner, even when rankers appeared in the neglected field. Patient G. M. demonstrated reduced interference effects for contralesional rankers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{brain is}} {{frequently}} confronted with sensory information that elicits conflicting response choices. While much research has addressed {{the top down}} control mechanisms associated with detection and resolution of <b>response</b> <b>competition,</b> the effects of <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> on sensory processing in the primary visual cortex remain unclear. To address this question we modified a typical ‘flanker task’ (Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974) so {{that the effects of}} <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> on human early retinotopic visual cortex could be assessed. Healthy human participants were scanned using fMRI while making a speeded choice response that classified a target object image into one of two categories (e. g. fruits, animals). An irrelevant distractor image that was either congruent (same image as target), incongruent (image from opposite category as target), or neutral (image from task-irrelevant category, e. g. household items) was also present on each trial, but in a different quadrant of the visual field relative to the target. Retinotopic V 1 areas responding to the target stimuli showed increased response to targets in the presence of response-incongruent (compared to response-neutral) distractors. A negative correlation with behavioral <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> effects indicated that an increased primary visual cortical response to targets in the incongruent (vs. neutral) trials is associated with a reduced <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> effect on behavior. These results suggest a novel conflict resolution mechanism in the primary visual cortex...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetacognitive appraisals are {{essential}} for optimizing our information processing. In conflict tasks, metacognitive appraisals can result from different inter-related features (e. g. motor activity, visual awareness, response speed, etc.). Thanks to an original approach combining behavioral and electromyographic measures, the current study objectified the contribution of three features (reaction time, motor hesitation with and without <b>response</b> <b>competition,</b> and visual congruency) to the subjective experience of urge-to-err in a priming conflict task. Both reaction time and motor hesitation with <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> were major determinants of metacognitive appraisals. Importantly, motor hesitation in absence of <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> and visual congruency had limited effect. Because science aims to rely on objectivity, subjective experiences are often discarded from scientific inquiry. The current study shows that subjectivity can be objectified...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} process {{simultaneously}} presented auditory and visual information {{is a necessary}} component underlying many cognitive tasks. While this ability is often taken for granted, previous {{research has demonstrated that}} there are many occasions where infants and young children are better at discriminating a visual stimulus when it is presented in isolation than when paired with an auditory stimulus. The current study expands on this research by examining whether this attenuated discrimination stems from overshadowing (auditory stimulus disrupts encoding of visual stimulus) or from <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> (auditory input interferes with visual processing during the decision or response phase). While attenuated discrimination in the current study stemmed from <b>response</b> <b>competition,</b> we argue that both overshadowing and <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> underlie auditory dominance effects...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{monitoring}} can {{be implemented}} in the brain by two possible systems, one monitoring for <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> or one detecting errors. Two current models of performance monitoring have different views on these monitoring subsystems. While the error detection model proposes a specific error detection system, the <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> model denies {{the necessity of a}} specific error detector and favors a more general unitary system evaluating response conflict. Both models suggest that the frontomedian wall {{in the vicinity of the}} anterior cingulate sulcus plays an important role in performance monitoring. The present study investigates the hemodynamic and electrophysiological correlates of <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> and error processing. Twelve young healthy participants performed a speeded, modified flanker task, while fMRI signals and ERPs were measured in separate sessions. The event-related fMRI shows that networks involving the frontomedian wall are activated during both <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> and error processing. However, an anatomical dissociation was found: while error processing preferentially activates the human homologue of the cingulate motor area (CMA, BA 24 c′) in the depth of the anterior cingulate sulcus, <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> is accompanied by activation of the pre-SMA and mesial BA 8. The ERP waveforms for erroneous trials exhibit a large error-related negativity, which is most likely generated in the CMA. These results suggest that the CMA plays a major role in error processing. Further fMRI activations in the lateral prefrontal and primary motor cortex are discussed with respect to performance monitoring and its influence on task set reconfiguration...|$|R

No {{group differences in}} performance were evident on measures of interference control and/or <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> created by location and direction stimuli. However, the ADHD group demonstrated signif-icantly greater activation of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during interference control as well as greater activation of the left anterior cingulate cortex, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left basal ganglia during the dual task of interference control and <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> The magnitude of the prefrontal and basal ganglia activation {{was positively correlated with}} severity of ADHD. <b>Response</b> <b>competition</b> alone did not yield group differences in activation...|$|R
40|$|Neurophysiological {{studies in}} {{non-human}} primates have provided evidence for simultaneous activation of competing {{responses in the}} (pre) motor cortex. Human evidence, however, is limited, partly because experimental approaches have often mapped competing responses to paired effectors represented in opposite hemispheres, which restricts the analysis to between-hemisphere comparisons and allows simultaneous execution. A demonstration of competition between different movement plans in the motor cortex is more compelling when simultaneous execution of the alternative responses is ruled out and they are represented in one motor cortex. Therefore, in the current MEG study {{we have used a}} unimanual Eriksen flanker paradigm with alternative responses assigned to flexion and extension of the right index finger, activating different direction-sensitive neurons within the finger representation area of the same motor cortex. Results showed that for stimuli eliciting <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> the pre-response motor cortex beta-band (17 - 29 Hz) power decreased stronger than for stimuli that did not induce <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> Furthermore, <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> elicited an additional pre-response mid-frontal high-gamma band (60 - 90 Hz) power increase. Finally, larger gamma-band effect sizes correlated with greater behavioral response delay induced by <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> Taken together, our results provide evidence for co-activation of competing responses in the human brain, consistent with evidence from non-human primates...|$|R
40|$|The {{separate}} semantic and <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> {{interactions between}} colour and word processing in a manual Stroop task {{were evaluated by}} comparing three trial types. Identity trials are both semantically compatible and response compatible (e. g., BLUE in the colour blue), different response trials are both semantically incompatible and response incompatible (e. g., BLUE in the colour green, where blue and green have different response keys), and same response trials are semantically incompatible and response compatible (e. g., the word BLUE in the colour red, where blue and red have the same key press response). ink colours were embedded in two different word types, colour words, and colour associates. The results using colour words replicated the findings of De Houwer (2003) and demonstrated both a semantic effect (a difference between same response trials and identity trials) and <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> (a difference between same response trials and different response trials). in contrast, the results using colour associates provided evidence for only a semantic effect. These findings support interpretations of the colour associate Stroop effect that attribute the effect to semantics, but challenge Klein's (1964) <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> account and Sharma and McKenna's (1998) claim {{that the effect of}} colour associates is dependent on verbal responding. The results confirm that the Stroop colour-word task appears to involve at least two mechanisms, a semantic mechanism and a <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{evidence}} indicates that patients with schizophrenia exhibit reduced repetition priming in production tasks (in which each response cue engenders a <b>competition</b> between alternative <b>responses),</b> but not in identification tasks (in which each response cue allows a unique response). However, cross-Task comparisons may lead to inappropriate conclusions, because implicit tests vary on several dimensions {{in addition to the}} critical dimension of <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> The present study sought to isolate the role of <b>response</b> <b>competition,</b> by varying the number of solutions {{in the context of the}} same implicit tasks. Methods: Two experiments investigated the performance of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls in the high-competition and low-competition versions of word-stem completion (Exp. 1) and verb generation (Exp. 2). Results: <b>Response</b> <b>competition</b> affected both the proportions of stems completed (higher to few-solution than to many-solution stems) and the reaction times of verb generation (slower to nouns having no dominant verb associates than to nouns having one dominant verb associate). Patients with schizophrenia showed significant (non-zero) priming in both experiments: crucially, the magnitude of this facilitation was equivalent to that observed in healthy controls and was not reduced in the high-competition versions of the two tasks. Conclusions: These findings suggest that implicit memory is spared in schizophrenia, irrespective of the degree of <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> during the retrieval phase; in addition, they add to the ongoing debate regarding the validity of the identification/production hypothesis of repetition priming...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to utilize both behavioral (response times) and psychophysiological measures (ERPs–N 400 2 ̆ 6 Pre-response Positivity) to uncover the cognitive mechanism responsible for the evaluative priming effect (spreading activation vs. <b>response</b> <b>competition)</b> by controlling for semantic influences. This research project examined the evaluative incongruity effect by controlling for semantic influences in two separate studies. The first study kept semantic associations among word pairs completely random, while the second study controlled for semantic associations by either pairing words from the same semantic category (e. g., animal-animal) or from different semantic categories (e. g., animal-person). Participants completed an evaluative task by indicating if the second word in the word pair was good or bad. Although the results from study 1 did not show a significant behavioral evaluative effect, the <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> mechanism was supported by findings that showed a marginally significant response-monitoring ERP component (PRP). <b>Response</b> <b>competition</b> was further supported with both behavioral and psychophysiological findings in study 2. The results showed a behavioral evaluative effect, where participants responded faster to evaluatively congruent word pairs than to incongruent word pairs and also found a significant PRP. The N 400 was not found in either of the two studies and therefore did not lend support for spreading activation. The findings from both of these studies support <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> as the mechanism underlying the evaluative priming effect and question the possible role of spreading activation. Future studies should further explore the comparative approach by varying word pairs on both a semantic and evaluative dimension. ...|$|R

This is inconsistent with the widely held view that the ACC implements strategic processes to reduce cognitive conflicts, such as <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> Instead, it suggests that the ACC serves an evaluative function, detecting cognitive states such as <b>response</b> <b>competition,</b> which may lead to poor performance, and representing the knowledge that strategic processes need to be engaged...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of affective priming has caught scientific interest for over 30 years, yet {{the nature of}} the affective priming effect remains elusive. This study investigated the underlying mechanism of cross-modal affective priming and the influence of affective incongruence in music and speech on negativities in the N 400 time-window. In Experiment 1, participants judged the valence of affective targets (affective categorization). We found that music and speech targets were evaluated faster when preceded by affectively congruent visual word primes, and vice versa. This affective priming effect was accompanied by a significantly larger N 400 -like effect following incongruent targets. In this experiment, both spreading of activation and <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> could underlie the affective priming effect. In Experiment 2, participants categorized the same affective targets based on nonaffective characteristics. However, as prime valence was irrelevant to the response dimension, affective priming effects could no longer be attributable to <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> In Experiment 2, affective priming effects were observed neither at the behavioral nor electrophysiological level. The results {{of this study indicate that}} both affective music and speech prosody can prime the processing of visual words with emotional connotations, and vice versa. Affective incongruence seems to be associated with N 400 -like effects during evaluative categorization. The present data further suggest a role of <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> during the affective categorization of music, prosody, and words with emotional connotations...|$|R

First they did word reading task and then they did color naming task (the Stroopinterference task) in succession.

But there were no differences among three transformed conditions. In word reading task, the time to read the word was considerably slower under transformed word conditions than normal word condition. These results were compatible with the hypothesis of <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> in color-word Stroop interference.

40|$|Discussions of {{the source}} of the Stroop {{interference}} effect continue to pervade the literature. Semantic competition posits that interference results from competing semantic activation of word and color dimensions of the stimulus prior to <b>response</b> selection. <b>Response</b> <b>competition</b> posits that interference results from competing responses for articulating the word dimension versus the color dimension at the time of response selection. We embedded Stroop stimuli into a delayed match-to-sample task in an attempt to test semantic and <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> accounts of the interference effect. Participants viewed a sample color word in black or colored fonts that were congruent or incongruent with respect to the color word itself. After a 5 s delay, participants were presented with two targets (i. e., a match and a foil) and were instructed to select the correct match. We probed each dimension independently during target presentations via color targets (i. e., two colors) or word targets (i. e., two words) and manipulated whether the semantic content of the foil was related to the semantic content of the irrelevant sample dimension (e. g., word sample red in blue font with the word red as the match and the word blue as the foil). We provide evidence for Stroop interference such that response times increased for incongruent trials even {{in the presence of a}} response option with semantic content unrelated to the semantic content of the irrelevant sample dimension. Accuracy also deteriorated during the related foil trials. A follow-up experiment with a 10 s delay between sample and targets replicated the results.

Recent clinical and neuroimaging evidence has demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal, parietal, and premotor areas during behaviors that emphasize conflict and inhibition.

Here we probed the functional specialization of human prefrontal cortex by combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with integrated behavioral measures of response inhibition (stop-signal task) and <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> (flanker task). Participants undertook a combined stop-signal/flanker task after rTMS of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) or dorsal premotor cortex (dPM) in each hemisphere.

However, the association between expectancy subscale scores and drinking behavior is inconsistent and modest. Attitudinal information may vary in accessibility (i. e., the ease or speed with which attitudinal information is evaluated), and more accessible (i. e., faster) attitudinal evaluations may predict heavier alcohol consumption. An alternative hypothesis arising from <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> theory is that heavy drinkers will show slow attitudinal evaluations, given that heavy drinkers frequently show mixed, inconsistent, or opposing alcohol-related beliefs. In this study we examined the degree to which speed of processing of alcohol-related evaluative judgments longitudinally predicted alcohol consumption in university students. Methods: Response latencies for alcohol- and non-alcohol-related attitudinal inquiries and measures of alcohol use were administered at two intervals 4 months apart. Results: The key findings were that response times for tension reduction and cognitive impairment items at time 1 positively predicted alcohol consumption at time 2. These results held after we accounted for autocorrelation in drinking and individual variability in reactivity. Conclusion: For items relating to tension reduction, response times fit a <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> hypothesis better than the attitude accessibility hypothesis.

40|$|Collaborative {{inhibition}} {{refers to}} when people working together remember {{less than their}} predicted potential. The most common explanation for this effect is the retrieval-disruption hypothesis during collaborative recall. However, several recent studies have obtained conflicting results concerning this hypothesis. In the current study, item similarity was manipulated in Experiment 1 by requiring participants to study overlapping or non-overlapping unrelated wordlists. The unstructured instructions were then manipulated during a turn-taking recall task between conditions. The results showed that collaborative inhibition occurred for both overlapping and non-overlapping conditions. Subsequently, <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> during collaborative recall, in addition to item similarity, was manipulated in Experiment 2, and {{the results showed that}} when collaborative group members were instructed to recall in turn and monitor their partner&# 39;s recall (the medium-and high-response-competition conditions), collaborative inhibition occurred. However, no such effect was shown when collaborative group members were instructed not to communicate with each other, but to simply recall in turn while in a group (low-response-competition condition). Together, these results suggest that the conflicts between the findings of the aforementioned studies were probably caused by differing instructions, which induced <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> in collaborative settings. Aside from retrieval-disruption, other possible mechanisms underlying collaborative inhibition were also discussed. </p...|$|R

This case study incorpo-rated elements of HR (awareness training, self-monitoring, <b>response</b> <b>competition),</b> combined with relaxation, as an intervention for vocal and motor tics in a 10 -year-old boy with Tourette’s syndrome (TS). Therapy was provided on an outpatient basis at a pediatric clinic. In-home data collection by the boy’s mother documented decreased tic frequency {{during the course}} of treatment.

25|$|Moreover, the tit-for-tat {{strategy}} has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research has indicated that when individuals {{who have been in}} competition {{for a period of time}} no longer trust one another, the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching <b>response,</b> <b>competition</b> with competition and cooperation with cooperation.|$|R
40|$|In a speeded choice {{reaction}} time task, responses to centrally presented letter targets {{can be altered}} by the identity of surrounding task-irrelevant letters (flankers). In the standard flanker effect, flankers associated with the same response as the target lead to faster and more accurate responses, whereas flankers associated with a different response lead to slower and more error-prone responses. B. A. Eriksen and C. W. Eriksen (1974, pp. 143 – 149) have argued that these flanker effects occur through <b>response</b> <b>competition.</b> We present data from a novel version of the Eriksen task, in which some targets and flankers consist of letter forms that are morphed versions of target letters. In this paradigm, flankers induce classic flanker effects on well-formed targets. But flankers induce an opposite effect, termed a negative flanker effect on morphed letter targets. For example, targets that are morphs between the letters “A ” and “H ” {{are more likely to}} be identified as an “A ” when flanked by an “H. ” The interpretation advanced here is that there are two distinct kinds of flanker effects: contrast enhancement in perceptual processes and <b>response</b> <b>competition</b> in <b>response</b> selection processes. The Eriksen flanker paradigm (B. A. Eriksen & C. W. Eriksen, 1974) has been popular in the cognition and perception literature because it allows researchers to explor...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of decision making {{is the ability of}} responses to be controlled by different cues in different situations or contexts, especially when there is conflict between alternative responses or actions. Recently, a context-dependent biconditional task has been developed for rats that mimic some aspects of response conflict seen in human cognitive paradigms, such as the Stroop task. In this task, contextual cues are used to disambiguate conflicting response information provided by audiovisual compound stimuli. Here we review current findings that investigate some of the behavioral, neurobiological, and neurochemical mechanisms that underlie this use of contextual or task-setting information to <b>resolve</b> <b>response</b> conflict, and discuss future ways in which this research can be extended...|$|R
