40|$|This thesis gives a {{detailed}} description of Zlil Sela’s construction of Makanin-Razborov diagrams which describe Hom(G, T), the set of all homomorphisms from G to T, where G is a finitely generated group and T is a hyperbolic group. Moreover, while Sela’s construction requires T to be torsion-free, this thesis removes this condition and addresses the case of arbitrary hyperbolic groups. Sela’s shortening argument, which is the main tool {{in the construction of the}} Makanin- Razborov diagrams, relies on the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine,</b> a structure theorem for finitely generated groups acting stably on real trees. As homomorphisms from a f. g. group G to a hyperbolic group T give rise to stable actions of G on real trees, which appear topologically as limits of the G-actions on the Cayley graph of T, the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine</b> and the shortening argument allow us to explore the structure of Hom(G, T) and construct Makanin-Razborov diagrams which encode all homomorphisms from G to T. While Sela’s version of the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine</b> allows the formulation of the shortening argument only in the case where T is torsion-free, Guirardel has presented a generalized version of the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine,</b> which we exploit to generalize the shortening argument and the construction of Makanin-Razborov diagrams to the case of arbitrary hyperbolic groups.

40|$|We give a {{complete}} {{proof of the}} Bers-Sullivan-Thurston Density Conjecture. In {{the light of the}} Ending lamination theorem, it suffices to prove that any collection of possible ending invariants is realized by some algebraic limit of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds. The ending invariants are either Riemann surfaces or filling laminations supporting Masur domain measured laminations and satisfying some mild additional conditions. To any set of ending invariants we associate a sequence of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds and prove that this sequence has a convergent subsequence. We derive the necessary compactness theorem combining the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine</b> with non-existence results for certain small actions on real trees of free products of surface groups and free groups.

40|$|This work is {{the first}} step towards a {{description}} of the Gromov boundary of the free factor graph of a free product, with applications to subgroup classification for outer automorphisms. We extend the theory of algebraic laminations dual to trees, as developed by Coulbois, Hilion, Lustig and Reynolds, to the context of free products; this also gives us an opportunity to give a unified account of this theory. We first show that any R-tree with dense orbits in the boundary of the corresponding outer space can be reconstructed as a quotient of the boundary of the group by its dual lamination. We then describe the dual lamination in terms of a band complex on compact R-trees (generalizing Coulbois-Hilion-Lustig's compact heart), and we analyze this band complex using versions of the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine</b> and of the Rauzy-Veech induction. An important output of the theory is that the above map from the boundary of the group to the R-tree is 2 -to- 1 almost everywhere. A key point for our intended application is a unique duality result for arational trees. It says that if two trees have a leaf in common in their dual laminations, and if one of the trees is arational and relatively free, then they are equivariantly homeomorphic. This statement is an analogue of a result in the free group saying that if two trees are dual to a common current and one of the trees is free arational, then the two trees are equivariantly homeomorphic. However, we notice that in the setting of free products, the continuity of the pairing between trees and currents fails. For this reason, in all this paper, we work with laminations rather than with currents. Comment: 80 pages, 23 figure...|$|R
