50|$|The {{stock market}} crash made it evident that banking systems Americans were relying on were not dependable. Americans looked towards insubstantial banking units for their own {{liquidity}} supply. As the economy began to fail, these banks were {{no longer able to}} support those who depended on their assets - they did not hold as much power as the larger banks. During the depression, “three waves of bank failures shook the economy.” The first wave came just when the economy was heading in the direction of recovery at the end of 1930 and the beginning of 1931. The second wave of bank failures occurred “after the Federal Reserve System raised the <b>rediscount</b> <b>rate</b> to staunch an outflow of gold” around the end of 1931. The last wave, which began in the middle of 1932, was the worst and most devastating, continuing “almost to the point of a total breakdown of the banking system in the winter of 1932-1933.” The reserve banks led the United States into an even deeper depression between 1931 and 1933, due to their failure to appreciate and put to use the powers they withheld - capable of creating money - as well as the “inappropriate monetary policies pursued by them during these years”.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1927, Montagu Norman and other {{governors}} of European Banks asked the Federal Reserve to ease their monetary policy and they agreed, reducing the <b>rediscount</b> <b>rate</b> from 4 to 3.5%, a move that Lional Robbins described as resulting “in {{one of the most}} costly errors committed by it or any other banking system in the last 75 years”. The funds released by the Fed became available to invest in the stock market and “from that date, according to all the evidence, the situation got completely out of control.” [...] Galbraith disagreed with this simplistic analysis by arguing that the availability of money in the past was no sure recipe for a bubble in common stocks and that prices could still be regarded as a true valuation of the stock at the end of 1927. It is early in 1928 that the “escape into make believe” started in earnest, when the market began to rise by large vaulting leaps rather than steady increments. Prominent investors, such as Harrison Williams, the proponent of both the Shenandoah & Blue Ridge Trusts, were described by Professor Dice as “having vision for the future and boundless hope and optimism” and not “hampered by the heavy armour of tradition”.|$|E

Data were collected from the CBN statistical bulletin covering the period of 21 years. Unit root test, co integration, VAR model and graph were some of the econometrics techniques used for data estimation. Phillip-perron test statistic revealed that the time series properties of the variables attained stationarity at first order. The variables were co integrated at at most 1 with at least 2 co integrating equations. The individual variable: Minimum <b>Rediscount</b> <b>Rate</b> (LNMRR), Interest Rate (LNIR), Liquidity Rate (LNLR), Cooperate Income Tax (CIT) and Federal budget were not statistically significant to Gross Domestic Product (LNGDP) in the previous and current year.

The ordinary least square regression (OLS) was run using five monetary policy variables including minimum re-discount rate, treasury bill rate, interest rate, exchange rate and consumer price index (proxy for inflation) on the equity prices (proxied by all share price index). The first investigation {{of this study is}} that minimum <b>rediscount</b> <b>rates</b> and Treasury bill rates are highly correlated and cannot be applied simultaneously in monetary policy management. As a consequence, the Treasury bill rates were dropped in the course of further analysis. The general result of the analysis showed a weak correlation between monetary policy and equity prices. This reflected in the explanatory variables which accounted only 15. 6 % in the changes of equity prices in Nigeria. All the explanatory variables are negatively and insignificantly related to equity prices, except the consumer price index that has insignificant positive relationship with equity prices.

40|$|Purpose – Many {{developing}} countries {{embarked on a}} program of financial liberalization {{in order to maximize}} the benefits associated with a free market system. The preponderance of the evidence in the financial economics literature is that market-determined interest rates become volatile subsequent to financial liberalization. This paper aims to examine the liberalization program in Nigeria with a view to finding out whether the level of banking competition is increased after financial liberalization. Design/methodology/approach -The test of banking competition is premised on the argument by Hannan and Berger that retail interest rate rigidity results from either market concentration or the size of the customer base. The cointegration and error correction models are applied to quarterly wholesale and retail interest rates from 1987 through 2001, in order to analyze their long-run as well as short-run dynamics. Findings - The retail lending and deposit rates possess a long-run equilibrium relationship. Moreover, the minimum <b>rediscount</b> (wholesale) <b>rate</b> (MRR) and the deposit rate also exhibit a long-run equilibrium relationship. If the lending and deposit rates diverge from their long-run equilibrium relationship, 37 per cent of the disequilibrium is corrected each quarter by changes in the lending rate. On the other hand, any disequilibrium in the long-run relationship between the deposit and MRRs can be corrected by changes in the MRR at about 58 per cent per quarter. Originality/value - The results imply that the financial liberalization in Nigeria failed to achieve its key objective of a market-driven interest rate system.

40|$|In the posl-Keynesian {{approach}} to money, endogeneity has its {{origin in the}} demand for Ioans which in turn arises from frms' requirementsfor worhng capital whenever the cost and/or volume of planned output increases. Banl<s meet all creditworthy demand for loans and the central bank supplies lhe necessary reserves. Thus, bank lending (and the supply of new deposits) depen & critically upon the 'state of trade'. However a number of institutional changes have recently taken ploce. in the UK which call this sequence into question- Household demand has taken over from corporate demand as the major component in the aggrcgate demand for bank credit. Furthermore, we bzow that total transactions (including those on assets, intermediale and secondhand goods) have grown much more rapidly than GDP during the 1980 s. If credit is required {{for all types of}} transactions, we might therefore acpect the demand for loans to depend more directly on tolal transactions than on those rclated to outpul alone. This paper docwnents those institutional changes and considers some of lhe implicafions. I. hrboduaion The endogeneity of credit and money is central to the Post Keynesian view of the macroeconomy. Until now, dre source ofthe endogen€ity has alwals been identified as the costs and the volume of production. The behaviour of nominal output determines the demand for credit. The central bant sets the <b>rediscount</b> <b>rate</b> and commercial banks meet the whole of the creditworthy demand for loans at the <b>rediscount</b> <b>rate</b> plus a risk-related mark-up. The new loans create new deposits. The importance of nominal output as the origin of the demand for loans is ofien summarised by salng that loan demand is created by the 'state of trade'. We may take the following as typical. The single most important demand for credit is fron business firms. Companies bonow frmds short-ierm from banks primarily to meet their needs for increased working capital. This need arises because companies must pay their factors of production, in particular labor, before they receive the sales receipts from the goods and services produced, which take time to manufacture and sell.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate empirically the impact of monetary policy on Nigeria's macroeconomic stability between 1970 and 2009. The study differs from others by viewing macroeconomic stability in terms of price stability. In order to reduce the problem of stationarity usually associated with time series data, we adopted the Co-integration and Error Correction Modeling (ECM) techniques. The results revealed that only 47 percent of the total variations in the model are caused by the monetary policy variables-Money Supply (MOS), Minimum <b>Rediscount</b> <b>Rate</b> (MRR) and Treasury Bills (TRB) at the long-run. The coefficient of the ECM is rightly signed and impacts on inflation in Nigeria while the current and past (lag 2) MOS is wrongly signed as well as not impacting inflation. Again, Past (lag 2) MRR impacts on inflation while current and past (lag 1) TRB do not. The policy implication arising from the findings is that the monetary policy tools showed a mix result in terms of their impact on inflation in Nigeria. Therefore, it is suggested that Nigeria should adopt macroeconomic mix of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies in managing inflation thereby promoting price stability which ultimately leads to macroeconomic stability...|$|E

It has been decided to measure the influence of these instruments on the three core inflation measures (15 % trimmed mean, core inflation excluding most volatile prices and core inflation excluding most volatile prices and fuel prices) and on CPI. According to our results, shifts in interest rates levels are generally reflected in the inflation level after 3 or 4 quarters. Reserve requirements ratios influence CPI to a much lesser degree and do not influence measures of underlying inflation at all. Open market operations have no impact on inflation either. As far as monetary aggregates are concerned, it is visible that only the widest measures of money supply affect inflation...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates and {{measures}} {{the long and}} short run relationship of monetary and fiscal policies on economic growth in Nigeria. A Vector Error Correction (VEC) models technique was employed to analyse and draw policy inferences. Through the VEC model, the relationships then have been investigated by the long-run relationships in the cointegrating vector and the short-run effects from the VEC model. From the cointegration analysis, the long-run relationships give some possible indications of growth in Nigerian economy. We find that the Nigerian economy is determined mostly by money supply. It is clear also from the findings those monetary policy variables: money supply and minimum <b>rediscount</b> <b>rate</b> have dominant long-run effects on the economy. From these results {{it is clear that}} monetary policy exacted greater impact on the economic growth but the effects of fiscal policy had lower magnitude more specifically when there is decrease in the inflation rate. Additionally, the 35 % speed of adjustment to the short run disequilibrium shows an improvement in the Nigeria economic growth. Although, both monetary and fiscal policy variables may contribute to economic growth in the short and long term, but based on these findings monetary policy will exact more impact if it facilitates the supply side of the economy through money supply...|$|E
40|$|This paper applies cointegration {{analysis}} and error-correction modeling {{to investigate the}} behavior of broad money demand in Cameroon over 1963 / 64 - 1993 / 94. The cointegrated VAR analysis first describes an open-economy model of money, prices, income, and a vector of rates of return, within which three steady state relations are identified: a stable money demand function, an excess aggregate demand relationship, and the uncovered interest rate relation under fixed exchange rates and perfect capital mobility. Empirical support is thereafter provided for both PPP and the international Fisher parity between Cameroon and France, and {{the stability of the}} short-run dynamics of the broad money demand function is confirmed.

40|$|Interest {{rate policy}} {{is one of}} the oldest and at the same time most {{controversial}} tools with which central bank affects the economy. In fact, it comes down to the central bank initiated changes in the levels of the so-called official interest rates (discount rate, <b>rediscount</b> <b>rate,</b> lombard rate, and others) or influencing the market interest rates through open market operations. A frequent paradox which appears in the historical approach to interest rates is questioning of the causative role of interest rate changes introduced by central banks with reference to dynamics of the so-called real sphere as well as frequent use of this stabilization instrument. In the last few decades, several turnabouts occurred in economic policies (especially, monetary policies) of the industrialized countries. Each time, a new interpretation of interest rate policy was responsible for that [Bednarczyk, 1990, Hubbard, 2002]. One of the trends which appeared in the discussion was an attempt to return to classical roots of the interest rate theory. The concept of the natural rate of interest became the focus of attention. This paper refers to this concept and is an attempt to present the author’s own interpretation of it. The final part of the paper presents a study case of the natural interest rate policy of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in the years 1999 - 2003. It shows that finding an optimum rate of interest in the transforming economy can be even more difficult than it appears from purely theoretical discussions...|$|E
40|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis, central banks in Pacific island countries eased monetary policy to stimulate economic activity. Judging by the ensuing movements in commercial bank interest rates and private sector credit, monetary policy transmission appears to be weak. This is confirmed by an empirical examination of interest rate pass-through and credit growth. Weak credit demand and underdeveloped financial markets seem to have limited the effectiveness of monetary policy, but the inflexibility of exchange rates and rising real interest rates have also served to frustrate the central banks’ efforts despite a supporting fiscal policy. While highlighting the importance of developing domestic financial markets in the long run, this experience also {{points to the need}} to coordinate macroeconomic policies and to use all macroeconomic tools available in conducting countercyclical policies, including exchange rate flexibility.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{experience}} of five developing countries in reforming their financial systems illustrates the benefits and risks, and provides lessons on the factors which contribute to successful financial sector reforms. Financial sector reforms need to be supported by active monetary policy, and the adoption of new monetary control procedures early in the reform program; reforms should be sequenced consistently with the broader program of macroeconomic adjustment. The pace of liberalization of interest rates and credit should also take account of the solvency of financial and nonfinancial firms. A minimal system of prudential regulation is an essential element of successful financial sector reform.
