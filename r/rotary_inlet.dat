50|$|The B8M was {{the first}} racing {{motorcycle}} by Kawasaki, created from the Kawasaki B8. The Red-Tank Furore had a two-stroke 123 cc Kawasaki <b>rotary</b> <b>inlet</b> valve cast iron engine. It was equipped with a four-speed transmission.|$|E
50|$|Scott {{started making}} boat engines in 1900. He {{patented}} his first engine in 1904 (Patent GB 3367 of 1904) and started motorcycle production in 1908 with a vertical two-stroke 450 cc twin, with patented triangulated frame, chain drive, neutral-finder, kick starter (Patent GB 27667 of 1908), and two-speed gearbox. His patented two-stroke engine designs {{are still the}} basis of modern two-stroke engines and features such as the first kick start, monoshock suspension, efficient radiators, <b>rotary</b> <b>inlet</b> valves, drip-feed lubricators and centrestands continue to this day.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power station}} was {{commissioned}} between 1953 and 1956 by the Hydro Electric Corporation (TAS) and the station has five Boving Francis turbines, {{with a total}} generating capacity of [...] of electricity. Within the station building, each turbine has a semi-embedded spiral casing and water flow is controlled via a spherical <b>rotary</b> <b>inlet</b> valve and a relief valve designed to prevent spiral casing over pressure. The station output, estimated to be [...] annually, is fed to Tasetworks' transmission grid via five 11 kV/110 kV three-phase GEC generator transformer to the outdoor switchyard.|$|E
25|$|The 618 {{features}} liquid-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders with a <b>rotary</b> valve <b>inlet</b> and an exhaust valve. Cooling is via {{one or two}} externally mounted radiators. Lubrication is by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil at 50:1 or oil injection. The 618 has dual Ducati capacitor discharge ignition systems and is equipped with two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.|$|R
50|$|The 532 {{features}} liquid-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders with a <b>rotary</b> valve <b>inlet.</b> Cooling is via {{one or two}} externally mounted radiators. Lubrication is by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil at 50:1. The 532 has a single Bosch flywheel magneto ignition system. It can be equipped with either one or two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.|$|R

5000|$|Power was {{provided}} by a British Anzani twin-cylinder 322 cc two-stroke engine producing [...] and mounted transversely, driving the front wheels via a chain and three-speed gearbox. The engine was already used by various motorcycle manufacturers such as Cotton and Greeves, but in the Berkeley was fitted with a Siba Dynastart to provide both battery charging and electric starting. It was a very advanced two-stroke engine which incorporated a <b>rotary</b> <b>inlet</b> valve mechanism in {{the centre of the}} crankshaft. The gearbox was a three-speed Albion HJR5, utilising a steering column-mounted gearchange.|$|E
50|$|Another form of <b>rotary</b> <b>inlet</b> valve used on {{two-stroke}} engines employs two cylindrical {{members with}} suitable cutouts arranged to rotate one within the other - the inlet pipe having {{passage to the}} crankcase only when the two cutouts coincide. The crankshaft itself may form one of the members, as in most glow plug model engines. In another embodiment, the crank disc is arranged to be a close-clearance fit in the crankcase, and is provided with a cutout which lines up with an inlet passage in the crankcase wall at the appropriate time, as in Vespa motor scooters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power station}} was {{commissioned}} in 1992 by the Hydro Electric Corporation (TAS), {{one of the}} last power stations constructed before its disaggregation and transformation to Hydro Tasmania. The station has one Fuji Francis turbines with a generating capacity of [...] of electricity. Within the station building, the turbine has a half embedded spiral casing controlled via a spherical <b>rotary</b> <b>inlet</b> valve and a vertical lift, gravity closed intake gate designed to cut off full flow. The station output, estimated to be [...] annually, is fed to TasNetworks' transmission grid via a 13.8 kV/220 kV three-phase Fuji generator transformer to the outdoor switchyard.|$|E
50|$|Although ingenious, {{the system}} had several drawbacks. The {{cylinder}} heads {{had to be}} removed to perform maintenance of the intake valves, to adjust the timing correctly, and fuel economy suffered in comparison to other <b>rotaries</b> because the <b>inlet</b> valves could not be opened and closed at the ideal times.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power station}} was {{commissioned}} in 1960 by the Hydro Electric Corporation (TAS) and the station has three [...] English Electric Francis turbines, {{with a combined}} generating capacity of [...] of electricity. [...] Within the station building, each turbine has a fully embedded spiral casing and water flow is controlled by a spherical <b>rotary</b> main <b>inlet</b> valve and a turbine relief valve designed to prevent spiral casing overpressure. The station output, estimated to be [...] annually, is fed to TasNetworks' transmission grid via three banks of 11 kV/220 kV three-phase English Electric generator transformers to the outdoor switchyard.|$|R
50|$|This article {{refers to}} the two-valve Gnome <b>rotary</b> engine (automatic <b>inlet</b> valve in the piston crown and pushrod {{operated}} exhaust valve). For the 100 hp Monosoupape engine go to Gnome Monosoupape 9 Type B-2, (Monosoupape engines had a single pushrod operated exhaust valve and inlet ports exposed by the piston near bottom dead centre).|$|R
5000|$|Derry Preston-Cobb {{was made}} Sales Manager for the {{motorcycle}} business {{and they started}} with three models, a scrambler, a three speed road bike and a four-speed version. At the 1954 Earls Court Show, they also launched the 'Fleetwing', a two-cylinder two-stroke with a 242 cc British Anzani engine developed from those used for motor boats and featuring a crankshaft with a hollow midsection that acted as a <b>rotary</b> <b>inlet</b> valve. With {{a top speed of}} just 61 mph, the Fleetwing continued in production until 1956 when the stock of British Anzani engines was finally exhausted. The Fleetwing name was brought back in 1957, however, for the Villiers engined [...] model. This was more powerful than the earlier Fleetwing and now had a more respectable top speed of 70 mph. [...] Gearboxes were supplied by Albion Engineering Co. of Birmingham, later replaced by their own designs from 1964 forward. The lightweight high powered package made them successful in the trials market place against Triumph and BSA models.|$|E

An 11 kV indoor switchgear system also supplies a distribution yard that supplies power to the local area from Wayatinah village to and includes the power stations of Liapootah, Wayatinah, Catagunya, Repulse and Cluny.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed for}} predicting the drying kinetics of spherical particles in a rotary dryer. Drying experiments were carried out by drying fermented ground cassava particles in a bench scale <b>rotary</b> dryer at <b>inlet</b> air temperatures of 115 – 230 °C, air velocities of 0. 83 [*]m/s– 1. 55 [*]m/s, feed mass of 50 – 500 [*]g, drum drive speed of 8 [*]rpm, and feed drive speed of 100 [*]rpm to validate the model. The data obtained from the experiments were {{used to calculate the}} experimental moisture ratio which compared well with the theoretical moisture ratio calculated from the newly developed Abowei-Ademiluyi model. The comparisons and correlations of the results indicate that validation and performance of the established model are rather reasonable...|$|R
5000|$|Most <b>rotaries</b> had normal <b>inlet</b> valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine. Although a conventional carburetor, {{with the ability to}} keep the fuel/air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings, was precluded by the spinning crankcase; it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or [...] "bloctube". The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual choke control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle, the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|R
