25|$|Plasma arc {{loudspeakers}} use electrical plasma as a <b>radiating</b> <b>element.</b> Since plasma has minimal mass, but {{is charged}} {{and therefore can}} be manipulated by an electric field, {{the result is a}} very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the Plasmatronics Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from helium gas. This avoided the ozone and nitrous oxide produced by RF decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.|$|E

In this band, antenna arrays must employ {{large number of}} elements with appropriate beamforming techniques to combat the severe path loss. The goal {{of this paper is}} to analyze massive antenna arrays under realistic considerations for the use in terrestrial backhaul links. This analysis addresses practical issues from the implementation point of view such as 3 D array geometry, the minimum number of <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> needed to fulfill link budget requirements in backhaul links, distribution of <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> in a 3 D array geometry and influence of realistic antenna patterns on beamforming capabilities of such arrays.

50|$|It also clearly {{illustrates}} {{that the impact}} of the rectangular slot <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> is negligible on the radiation pattern of the lower frequency monopole. This is due to the previously mentioned rule of thumb stating it is wise to keep the slot smaller than one-tenth the frequency of operation of the blade.

The array is a fully-filled aperture consisting of a core region surrounded by several layers of <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> which increase in size. By proper selection of the core region {{and the number of}} layers, one can form a beam with specified beamwidth over a five to one frequency range. The proposed concept considerably reduces the cost and complexity by decreasing the effective number of <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> and the corresponding receive or transmit modules. Numerical simulation results, ignoring the mutual coupling effects, are presented for array patterns at several frequencies to prove the concept. A possible beamforming concept is also included.

By applying these techniques, {{the size of the}} EBG mushroom is reduced by 30 %; however, the bandwidth operation maintains its value, and these structures can be integrated between <b>radiating</b> <b>elements</b> in broad bandwidth antennas...|$|R

50|$|When the {{transmitter}} has a waveguide interface, typically rectangular {{in order to}} be in single-mode regione at the operating frequency, a dual-polarized antenna with a circular (or square) waveguide port is the <b>radiating</b> <b>element</b> chosen for modern communication systems. The circular or square waveguide port is needed so that at least two degenerate modes are supported.

40|$|A superstrate of an EBG {{material}} (or equivalently a Fabry-Perot cavity) is used {{to design}} array antennas with large distance between the <b>radiating</b> <b>elements.</b> This configuration provides some advantages: (i) a reduction {{of the number of}} array elements to achieve high directivity; (ii) large space between contiguous elements decreases their coupling and permits an easy arrangement for a complicated feeding network (as needed for dual polarization), also on the same plane of the <b>radiating</b> <b>elements.</b> These possibilities are clearly shown in a few examples treated here and in the design of dual polarized antennas with two interleaved arrays. Furthermore, we indicate that in these designs there are optimum distances between elements that either maximize the directivity or minimize the sidelobe level.

50|$|A retrodirective antenna is {{an antenna}} that transmits the signal {{back in the}} same {{direction}} it came from.

5000|$|Since the {{vertical}} wire {{is the actual}} <b>radiating</b> <b>element,</b> the antenna radiates vertically polarized radio waves in an omnidirectional radiation pattern, with equal power in all azimuthal directions. [...] The axis of the horizontal wire makes little difference. The power is maximum in a horizontal direction or at a shallow elevation angle, decreasing to zero at the zenith. This makes it a good antenna at LF or MF frequencies, which propagate as ground waves with vertical polarization, but it also radiates enough power at higher elevation angles to be useful for sky wave ("skip") communication. The effect of poor ground conductivity is generally to tilt the pattern up, with the maximum signal strength at a higher elevation angle.|$|E
