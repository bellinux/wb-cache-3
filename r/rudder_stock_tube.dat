50|$|A tiller or till is a lever {{attached}} to a rudder post (American terminology) or <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> (English terminology) of a boat that provides leverage {{in the form of}} torque for the helmsman to turn the rudder. The tiller can be used by the helmsman directly pulling or pushing it, but it may also be moved remotely using tiller lines or a ship's wheel.|$|R

5000|$|Length between perpendiculars (often {{abbreviated}} as p/p, p.p., pp, LPP, LBP or Length BPP) is {{the length}} of a ship along the waterline from the forward surface of the stem, or main bow perpendicular member, to the after surface of the sternpost, or main stern perpendicular member. When there is no sternpost, the centerline axis of the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> is used as the aft end of the length between perpendiculars.|$|R

50|$|The 1938 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> is a London Underground <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> design. A {{total of}} 1,121 cars were built by Metro-Cammell and Birmingham RC&W. An {{additional}} 173 cars {{were added to}} the fleet by the end of 1953, comprising 91 new builds (the 1949 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock),</b> 76 conversions from Pre-1938 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> or 1935 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock,</b> and six unconverted cars of 1935 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock,</b> and the stock was used on the London Underground until 1988. During their long lives they worked on the Bakerloo, Northern, Piccadilly, East London and Central lines. Some examples are still at work on the Isle of Wight as Class 483, making them the oldest passenger rolling stock operating timetabled services on the National Rail network.|$|R
50|$|Measuring to {{the stern}} post or <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> was {{believed}} to give a reasonable idea of the ship's carrying capacity, as it excluded the small, often unusable volume contained in her overhanging ends. On some types of vessels this is, for all practical purposes, a waterline measurement. In a ship with raked stems, naturally that length changes as the draught of the ship changes, therefore it is measured from a defined loaded condition.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 11 November 1966, Isle of Gigha was en route from Gigha to Port Ellen, loaded with {{commercial}} vehicles. Rolling in a moderate sea, a <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> cracked making steering difficult.

50|$|Before the 16th century most sailing vessels were {{sufficiently}} {{small that}} they could be steered by a single individual working the handle of the tiller which was directly connected to the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> and therefore the rudder. However, as ships became taller and broader there came a need for a steering device which could stretch from the top deck of the stern down to the tiller which was sometimes located more than a deck below. The whipstaff became the temporary solution.|$|R
5000|$|The 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>stock</b> owed {{much to the}} sub-surface D Stock in design. Like D <b>Stock,</b> the 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> had {{single leaf}} doors, a similar orange {{interior}} and cab design. Unlike the D Stock however, the 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> proved to be unreliable. Electrical generators for lighting the carriages failed often, as did the motors. Boarding of passengers was slow because of the single leaf doors.|$|R
50|$|The Wayfarer World was {{introduced}} in 1997 and {{was designed as a}} collaboration between Ian Proctor and his son Keith. Made in GRP with no woodwork it has a removable aft storage tank, a self draining cockpit, and a spinnaker chute. The <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> is of aluminium alloy. Until the MkIV this was the only version with an asymmetric spinnaker, although it can not be used in class races in the UK. It has proved successful in both racing and cruising, including a North Sea crossing 1998.|$|R

25|$|Hainault - Woodford {{shuttle service}} saw {{a variety of}} stock from the early 1960s in {{conjunction}} with experimental Automatic Train Operation (ATO), such as 1960 <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> and trials of both 1967 <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> and modified 1973 <b>tube</b> <b>stock,</b> prior to introduction of the 1992 trains.|$|R
5000|$|The 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> {{could be}} {{considered}} the last train to be designed by London Underground; it was the last conventional Tube train in the long line of evolving design since the 1938 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock.</b> The stock was built by Metro Cammell to replace the 1972 Mark II <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> operating on the Jubilee line; in turn this was intended to enable those trains to replace the ageing 1938 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> on the Bakerloo line.|$|R
50|$|On 29 June 2008 she was {{involved}} in a grounding incident at Warrenpoint after an electrical failure put the controllable pitch propellers into full astern, which was a default setting.

With the arrival of , Moondance was redeployed to the newly opened Fredericia, Denmark to Moss Norway route. This route began operation on 2 February 2009.|$|R
50|$|Before mass {{production}} of the 1959 <b>tube</b> <b>stock,</b> three 1956 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> units were built as prototypes. These units were tested on the Piccadilly line and remained in service after production trains were introduced. Later they were transferred to the Northern line, but in 1995 they were replaced as non-standard by 1962 Stock cascaded from the Central line.|$|R
5000|$|With the Jubilee Line Extension in mind, it {{was planned}} the 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> would be {{refurbished}} {{to run with}} the newer 1996 Stock that entered Jubilee line service in 1997. The 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>stock</b> was to be given similar interiors. This was abandoned in favour of re-equipping the line entirely with the 1996 Stock. Then it was proposed for the 1983 Stock {{to be added to}} the refurbished 1973 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> on the Piccadilly line; the plans included replacing the single leaf doors on the 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> with double doors to speed up passenger boarding. This was abandoned on the grounds of cost. The last 1983 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> train ran on the Jubilee line on 9 July 1998.|$|R
50|$|The 6505 is {{the base}} {{model of the}} series, and is {{identical}} to the 5150, with exception of the <b>stock</b> <b>tubes</b> and its name. It has five 12AX7 tubes in the preamp, and four 6L6GC tubes in the power section. It has 120 watts RMS output power, into 16, 8 or 4 Ohms. The effects loop can be bypassed with a footswitch. It features separate input for both high and low gain.|$|R
50|$|The 1972 <b>Tube</b> <b>stock</b> {{was ordered}} in a hurry, {{so there was}} no time to create a new design; the trains were based on the 1967 <b>Tube</b> <b>stock</b> on the Victoria line. Although almost {{identical}} looking, the 1972 trains had a guard and door controls in the rear car, and were not compatible with 1967 <b>Tube</b> <b>stock</b> (though in later years some 1972 cars were adapted to run with the 1967 trains on the Victoria line).|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} method is presented that models fluid structural interaction problems for three-dimensional marine structures. Flow can be modelled with either potential or viscous incompressible flow. The structure deformation is modelled by a shell finite element formulation. The two fields are coupled by a domain decomposition approach that uses virtual surfaces to transfer information. A typical spade rudder has been modelled for steady-state three-dimensional {{problems in a}} free stream and in way of a propeller race. These computational models have been tested for mesh dependancy in both the fluid and structural domains {{as well as the}} virtual surface definition. The results show increased correlation to experimental data from uncoupled hydrodynamic modelling as well as detailed structural deformation. Of note is the variation in <b>rudder</b> <b>stock</b> bending moment from that utilised by classification society scantling rules...|$|R
50|$|Auk {{accordingly}} altered {{course at}} 0905 and plunged through the rough seas and a veritable curtain of fog, while her foghorn blared its warning. She anchored that afternoon, but waves breaking over the after deck foiled attempts to rig the heavy-duty wrecking pumps into the after hold (into which {{the water was}} coming, through the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock)</b> since {{it was impossible to}} remove the hatch without allowing more water to get below in the process. Then just as the fog began to lift to the northward and the ship prepared to weigh anchor and get underway, the anchor engine jammed. Quick repairs enabled Auk's men {{to begin the process of}} hoisting up the hook, and the minesweeper got underway and eventually reached safe haven in the lee of Montauk Point.|$|R
5000|$|Of note, in the 1960s, the 6BK11 Triple Triode Compactron tube {{was used}} by the Ampeg {{amplifier}} company in some of their guitar amps. Ampeg is the only guitar amp manufacturer that used this tube in their amps. The 6BK11 is in increasingly short supply today as an NOS replacement for <b>stock</b> <b>tubes.</b> NOS tubes are very important in guitar amps because they keep the amp performing as it was designed, which means it will produce the desired tone. There is a whole [...] "cottage industry" [...] that exists in producing vacuum tubes that are replacements for <b>stock</b> guitar amp <b>tubes.</b> The cottage industry exists because class A, open-ended, hand-wired, tube-driven guitar amps have a warm sound that is preferred by many musicians. The warmer sound of older amps means they command a premium resale value on the open market, and so in turn, any parts in the amp that may wear out over time or with use (including the vacuum tubes), also command similar values. The 6BK11 {{is a good example of}} this.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1903, when {{entering}} Tillamook Bay, Elmore struck {{ground on}} the bar several times, splintering the keel towards {{the stern of the}} vessel, losing the <b>rudder</b> <b>stock,</b> and causing the ship to leak around the stern. [...] When Elmore returned to Astoria, the ship was beached for a partial inspection by the Lloyd's agent. This was not sufficient to determine {{the full extent of the}} damage, so the ship was ordered to proceed to Portland. [...] The ship was fully insured. [...] The underwriters were M.C. Harrison & Co. It was initially thought that the damage would cost about $3,000 to repair. The ship was taken to the Supple yard in Portland for extensive repairs. [...] The work was scheduled to be completed by Monday, November 2, 1903, and consisted of a new keel, a new propeller, new planking, and a thorough painting.|$|R

40|$|The ships {{have long}} been an easy play-ground for {{hydraulic}} technologies. When high torques and low speeds are demanded on board ship, both technical and traditional reasons usually lead to hydraulic solutions. In fact, the conventional electrical machines are better suited for low-torque, high-speed applications, and coupling gears must be used to reduce the speed. However, oil-free direct-drive alternatives can be conceived, by new concepts of low-speed permanent-magnet actuators fed by low-frequency inverters. This paper shows the experimental results obtained with a linear permanent-magnet motor designed for direct coupling to <b>rudder</b> <b>stocks</b> or stabilizing fins. The prototype weights 700 kg and features a thrust-to-weight ratio of 5. Even better results {{can be obtained by}} using composite materials for the machine frame. The machine features a full structural redundancy and inherent fault tolerance, thanks to the modular construction. The present research has been carried out in the framework of the Italian Defence's Research National Program...|$|R
