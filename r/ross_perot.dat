5|$|The <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> presidential {{campaign}} of 1992 began when Texas industrialist <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> opened {{the possibility of}} running for President of the United States in the election of 1992 as an independent candidate on the February 20, 1992 edition of Larry King Live. Though he had never served as a public official, Perot had experience {{as the head of}} several successful corporations and had been involved in public affairs for the previous three decades. Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, grassroots organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement. James Stockdale, a retired United States Navy vice admiral, was Perot's vice presidential running mate.|$|E
5|$|Buckles did {{not meet}} the {{criteria}} for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as he had never been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008.

5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, although {{he could not get}} federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Jobs {{recruited}} {{the famous}} graphic designer Paul Rand {{to create a}} brand identity costing $100,000. Rand created a 20-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28°) and a new company name, NeXT. The first major outside investment was from <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot,</b> who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on The Entrepreneurs. In 1987, he invested $20million in exchange for 16percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined {{the board of directors}} in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, {{receiving}} 49.2percent of {{the popular}} vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7percent {{of the popular}} vote) and Reform candidate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> (8.4percent {{of the popular vote}}), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once. The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.|$|E

5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout {{his first year}} in office, Clinton {{consistently}} supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot.</b> The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
5|$|Clinton won the 1992 presidential {{election}} (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> (0 electoral votes), who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith {{had prior}} {{political}} experience, having been elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in France {{as part of}} the Eurosceptic Movement for France coalition in June 1994. Although his father had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain's Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by Margaret Thatcher, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it could draw on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party's formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of £800 million, and promised to put £20 million into the party. He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to the same extent as the country's larger political parties. Goldsmith's intervention in British politics has been compared to that of the multi-millionaires <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> in the United States and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy.|$|E
