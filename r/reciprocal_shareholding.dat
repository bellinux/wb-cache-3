For all entities with the absolute value of the reputation risk greater than the entityâ€™s materiality the reputation risk management system should be in place.

40|$|One of {{the secrets}} {{of the success of the}} Japanese economy lies in the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>shareholdings,</b> which could be seen {{typically}} in the structure of the horizontal corporate groups. Free from the pressures of the shareholders, the managers could pursue the long term interests of the companies. Today, however, this organisational strength has turned into a disadvantage, which leads eventually to the potential danger of over-borrowing. Therefore the Japanese corporation is now engaged in a process of re-structuring and deregulation to adjust to new realities...|$|R

In this paper, we address the causes and effects of the dramatic change in the {{ownership structure}}, focusing on cross-shareholdings among listed firms and the increasing role of foreign investors. First, we show that a resurgence of cross-shareholdings in the middle 2000 s was not a recurrence of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>shareholdings</b> between banks and business corporations, but was a new trend of reinforcing the ties among business corporations, based on an entrenchment motive. We also demonstrate that the scale of these <b>reciprocal</b> <b>shareholdings</b> is limited, so the ownership structure is unlikely to return back to the previously seen insider-dominated structure. Second, we show that portfolio selection made by foreign investors was {{closely related to the}} home bias and was also affected by corporate governance factors. We also illustrate that the growing presence of foreign investors has had a positive effect on corporate performance, even considering the aforementioned portfolio selection. Finally, we emphasize that this difference in the ownership structure brought in a dynamic process, namely, that differences in size, reputations in overseas markets, and corporate performance in the early 1990 s led to a difference in the ownership structure through the portfolio preferences of institutional investors and the self-selection of corporations, and that this difference in the ownership structure enlarged the gaps in performance among corporations through the new structure's effect of promoting discipline and management organization reform. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed light on the role of legislators and lawyers in {{establishing}} accounting regulations concerning corporate groups in France during the 1930 s and the Occupation (1940 - 1944). A review of bills proposing accounting regulation shows that no significant progress was to be achieved. Furthermore, while some lawyers called for a comprehensive regulation of corporate groups, no such progress was made during the inter-war period. Ultimately it's the Vichy government which introduced the first regulations on accounting subsidiaries in the French Plan Comptable and limited the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>shareholdings</b> in the Act of March 4, 1943.
