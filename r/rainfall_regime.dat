25|$|Changes in {{the amount}} of river flow will {{correlate}} with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water {{that can be used for}} hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change. One study from the Colorado River in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%. Brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the <b>rainfall</b> <b>regime,</b> could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.|$|E
25|$|The annual <b>rainfall</b> <b>regime</b> is {{generated}} by two factors: general atmospheric circulation, physical and geographical conditions, respectively. Advection of temperate oceanic air from west and north-west direction, especially during the summer, as well as frequent ingress of cold air masses from the north or those temperate continental from north-east and east, during the winter, plus advection of maritime tropical air from the south-west and south, explain all influences of atmospheric action centres which are felt in this area. Taking into account these elements, plus relief influences, atmospheric rainfall are unevenly spread across the county. The average amount of precipitation is 600–700mm, in Zalău being 634.2mm (calculated for the period 1961–1990). The most abundant precipitation falls in summer, when besides frontal processes occurs the intense thermal convection, causing showers, rich in terms of quantity. During the winter, rainfall is less quantitatively, {{although the number of}} days with precipitation is not smaller. By and large, the pluviometric maximum overlaps the months of May–June, and the pluviometric minimum is registered in January–February.|$|E

40|$|Comparing biosphere???atmosphere carbon {{exchange}} across monsoon (warm-season rainfall) and Mediterranean (cool-season <b>rainfall)</b> <b>regimes</b> {{can yield}} {{information about the}} interaction between energy and water limitation. Using data collected from eddy covariance towers over grass and shrub ecosystems in Arizona, USA and Almeria, Spain, we used net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE), gross ecosystem production (GEP), and other meteorological variables {{to examine the effects}} of the different precipitation seasonality. Considerable crossover behavior occurred between the two <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes.</b> As expected in these usually water-limited ecosystems, precipitation magnitude and timing were the dominant drivers of carbon exchange, but temperature and/or light also played an important role in regulating GEP and NEE at all sites. If significant rainfall occurred in the winter at the Arizona sites, their behavior was characteristically Mediterranean whereby the carbon flux responses were delayed till springtime. Likewise, the Spanish Mediterranean sites showed immediate pulse-like responses to rainfall events in non-winter periods. The observed site differences were likely due to differences in vegetation, soils, and climatology. Together, these results support a more unified conceptual model for which processes governing carbon cycling in semiarid ecosystems need not differ between warm-season and cool-season <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes...</b>|$|R

Simulations of these two diurnal <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes</b> by 18 CMIP 5 models were evaluated from the historical experiment of 1981 – 2005. The evaluation led to the identification of one model, the CMCC-CM that replicated the key {{characteristics of}} diurnal <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes</b> including the propagation of moisture convergence. Using the CMCC-CM to assess the future (2076 – 2100) change of diurnal evolution and propagation projected by the RCP 4. 5 experiment, {{it was found that}} propagating diurnal rainfall will enhance and expand southward into the non-propagating regime in southeast China. This change in diurnal rainfall is attributed to the intensification of diurnal land–sea thermal contrast over eastern China and the southward shift of the upper-level jet stream over 20 °– 30 °N. Similar projected changes in diurnal rainfall and associated large-scale dynamical mechanisms were also depicted by four other models (GFDL-ESM 2 G, GFDL-ESM 2 M, MRI-CGCM 3, and MRI-ESM 1) showing a higher skill in representing the diurnal <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes</b> over East Asia.

40|$|Mangrove {{forests are}} highly {{productive}} tidal saline wetland ecosystems found along sheltered tropical and subtropical coasts. Ecologists have long assumed that climatic drivers (i. e., temperature and <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes)</b> govern the global distribution, structure, {{and function of}} mangrove forests. However, data constraints have hindered the quantification of direct climate-mangrove linkages {{in many parts of}} the world. Recently, the quality and availability of global-scale climate and mangrove data have been improving. Here, we used these data to better understand the influence of air temperature and <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes</b> upon the distribution, abundance, and species richness of mangrove forests. Although our analyses identify global-scale relationships and thresholds, we show that the influence of climatic drivers is best characterized via regional range-limit-specific analyses. We quantified climatic controls across targeted gradients in temperature and/or rainfall within 14 mangrove distributional range limits. Climatic thresholds for mangrove presence, abundance, and species richness differed among the 14 studied range limits. We identified minimum temperature-based thresholds for range limits in eastern North America, eastern Australia, New Zealand, eastern Asia, eastern South America, and southeast Africa. We identified rainfall-based thresholds for range limits in western North America, western Gulf of Mexico, western South America, western Australia, Middle East, northwest Africa, east central Africa, and west-central Africa. Our results show that in certain range limits (e. g., eastern North America, western Gulf of Mexico, eastern Asia), winter air temperature extremes play an especially important role. We conclude that <b>rainfall</b> and temperature <b>regimes</b> are both important in western North America, western Gulf of Mexico, and western Australia. With climate change, alterations in temperature and <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes</b> will affect the global distribution, abundance, and diversity of mangrove forests. In general, warmer winter temperatures are expected to allow mangroves to expand poleward at the expense of salt marshes. However, dispersal and habitat availability constraints may hinder expansion near certain range limits. Along arid and semiarid coasts, decreases or increases in rainfall are expected to lead to mangrove contraction or expansion, respectively. Collectively, our analyses quantify climate-mangrove linkages and improve our understanding of the expected global- and regional-scale effects of climate change upon mangrove forests...|$|R

Nevertheless, despite the presence of these transient disturbances, it is shown that the horizontal distributions of climatological rainfall patterns for different <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes</b> are strongly dependent on the direction of the low-level prevailing flow with much higher rainfall on the windward side.

We created a rainfall manipulation experiment to investigate the effects of extreme changes in <b>rainfall</b> <b>regimes</b> on ecosystem functioning in a grassland system. We applied two rainfall regimes; a prolonged drought treatment (30 % reduction over spring and summer) and drought/downpour treatment (long periods of no rainfall interspersed with downpours), with an ambient control. Both rainfall manipulations included increased winter rainfall. We measured plant community composition, CO 2 fluxes and soil nutrient availability. Plant species richness and cover were lower in the drought/downpour treatment, and showed little recovery after the treatment ceased. Ecosystem processes were less affected, possibly due to winter rainfall additions buffering reduced summer rainfall, which saw relatively small soil moisture changes. However, soil extractable P and ecosystem respiration were significantly higher in rainfall change treatments than in the control. This grassland appears fairly resistant, in the short term, to even the more extreme rainfall changes that are predicted for the region, although prolonged study is needed to measure longer-term impacts. Differences in ecosystem responses between the two treatments emphasise the variety of ecosystem responses to changes in both the size and frequency of rainfall events. Given that model predictions are inconsistent there is therefore a need to assess ecosystem function under a range of potential climate change scenarios...|$|R
