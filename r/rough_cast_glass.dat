40|$|A new Baha’i Mother Temple for South America, {{designed}} by Canadian Architect, Siamak Hariri of Hariri Pontarini Architects, {{will be built}} in Chile close to its capitol city Santiago. The authors of the paper {{are part of the}} design team and are responsible for the design of its inner and outer facades. Nine identical leaves connected at the top by a glass dome form the shape of the 30 m high and 30 m wide structure. The vertical space between the leaves is filled with glazed curtain wall. The leaves are clad on the outside with 32 mm thick <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> and on the inside with Spanish alabaster. The exterior <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> cladding is a four-sided structural silicone system and a “rain screen ” design. Both the <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> and the alabaster are supported by the main supporting structure, which is an irregular tubular steel space frame, which through the translucent façade resembles the veins of a leaf. The steel structure is supported on concrete foundations. The paper describes some interesting aspects and challenges of the design process which deals with a number of complex issues such as evaluation of the uncommon architectural use of <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> and alabaster materials; the design and development of a complex <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> “rain screen” system; relatively severe loading conditions – Santiago is an earthquake prone area with temperatures fluctuating from below zero to plus thirty to forty degrees Celsius within 24 hours, complicated structural shape and the choice of uncommon cladding materials with unfavorable material properties...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to contribute}} on {{the scientific and}} applicable research in Structural glass in the Built environment. Specifically the use of <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> in a dry-assembled arched bridge application in which <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> blocks are used to form the span of the structure. The research consists of three important phases. By following a project specific design question first steps {{in the direction of}} solution and therefore design criteria for <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> structures are explored and described in the first phase. The second phase describes the aims and boundaries of the research and the proposed goals. The third phase follows the practical research of the thesis in which certain steps of the design of geometry are the anchor of research. Further steps in geometry are taken by the research in structural sense and by research on the production, leading themes are the structural integrity and quality, production setup and quality, deformations and residual stress. The research is finalized with an advice on the geometry of the bricks and the gained insight on the relationships between the structural and production aspects in the design for structural <b>cast</b> <b>glass</b> and the influence of geometry.

Both connected layers of plaster are identical as to their material; the only difference consists in the ratio of admixtures added to the basic raw material. While making replicas of the buildings construction using the rammed-earth technique, the below-described procedure seems to be effective. The <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> (commonly called as špric) is a connecting bridge between the masonry and the plaster.

50|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>glass</b> {{can be done}} at the furnace, at {{the torch}} or in a kiln. Generally the artist makes a mold out of refractory, sand, or plaster and silica which can be filled with either clear glass or colored or {{patterned}} glass, depending on the techniques and effects desired. Large scale sculpture is usually created this way. Slumped glass and fused glass is similar to <b>cast</b> <b>glass,</b> but it is not done at as high of a temperature. Usually the glass is only heated enough to impress a shape or a texture onto the piece, or to stick several pieces of glass together without a glue.|$|R
