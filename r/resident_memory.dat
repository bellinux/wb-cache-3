A good parallel programming environment encourages the development of parallel applications that have source code compatibility so that they can be used, tested, or developed on various machine architectures and ported easily between them.

Shared memory parallel programs can support a high degree of compatibility and transparency and can be coded easily to conform to support this programming philosophy.

Here we show that <b>resident</b> <b>memory</b> CD 4 + T cells mediate the delayed-hypersensitivity response observed in immune mice and provide protection without circulating T cells. This protection occurs rapidly after challenge, and requires the recruitment and activation of inflammatory monocytes, which limit parasites by production of both reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide.

Forced S 1 PR 1 expression prevented establishment of TRM. Cytokines inducing TRM phenotype (including TGF-β, IL- 33 and TNF) provoked KLF 2 downregulation in a phosphatidylinositol- 3 -OH kinase (PI(3) K) –Akt-dependent pathway, suggesting environmental regulation.

40|$|Disruption of T cell memory during severe immune {{suppression}} results in reactivation of chronic viral infections, such as Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). How different subsets of memory T cells {{contribute to the}} protective immunity against these viruses remains poorly defined. In this study we examined the compartmentalization of virus-specific, tissue <b>resident</b> <b>memory</b> CD 8 + T cells in human lymphoid organs. This revealed two distinct populations of memory CD 8 + T cells, that were CD 69 +CD 103 + and CD 69 +CD 103 -, and were retained within the spleen and tonsils {{in the absence of}} recent T cell stimulation. These two types of memory cells were distinct not only in their phenotype and transcriptional profile, but also in their anatomical localization within tonsils and spleen. The EBV-specific, but not CMV-specific, CD 8 + memory T cells preferentially accumulated in the tonsils and acquired a phenotype that ensured their retention at the epithelial sites where EBV replicates. In vitro studies revealed that the cytokine IL- 15 can potentiate the retention of circulating effector memory CD 8 + T cells by down-regulating the expression of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor, required for T cell exit from tissues, and its transcriptional activator, Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF 2). Within the tonsils the expression of IL- 15 was detected in regions where CD 8 + T cells localized, further supporting a role for this cytokine in T cell retention. Together this study provides evidence for the compartmentalization of distinct types of <b>resident</b> <b>memory</b> T cells that could contribute to the long-term protection against persisting viral infections...|$|E
