5|$|In 2009, Kilgour and Matas {{published}} {{an updated version}} of the <b>report</b> <b>as</b> a book, titled Bloody Harvest, The killing of Falun Gong for their organs. It contains new material and interviews, and is in two parts. The first section sets out the evidence; the second section details the reactions the final report received and the advocacy Matas and Kilgour undertook to end the abuse that they conclusively identified. That year, Kilgour and Matas also received the 2009 Human Rights Award by the German-based International Society for Human Rights; and were nominated for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

Its findings concurred with those of the Field Foundation.|$|E

5|$|The only item of note {{to emerge}} from No Sirree! was Robert Benchley's contribution, The Treasurer's Report. Benchley's disjointed parody so delighted those in {{attendance}} that Irving Berlin hired Benchley in 1923 to deliver the <b>Report</b> <b>as</b> part of Berlin's Music Box Revue for $500 a week. In 1928, Report was later made into a short sound film in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system by Fox Film Corporation.

5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske Ceste. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through an analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Jankomir - Zaprešić, {{is not included in}} this <b>report,</b> <b>as</b> it is not tolled. However, since the section is a part of Zagreb bypass, it is considered to carry heavier traffic than any other section of the A2 motorway. In 2006, it carried more than 22,000 vehicles per day, and its traffic volume grew considerably since the completion of the motorway in 2007.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} athletes may {{have served as}} {{alternates}} for the various teams in the bobsleigh events, although there is disagreement among sources {{as to whether they}} should be considered medal winners. They are listed in the International Olympic Committee's medalist database as having won medals for teams on which they were alternates. However, while they do appear in the Official Report of the 1932 Olympic Games on pages which list members of the teams, their names are not mentioned in the pages that list winners of the events. This list only includes those athletes who were listed in the Official <b>Report</b> <b>as</b> winners of the events.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the Commission's {{proposal}} {{to a wider}} audience and described what the graves would look like. The article entitled War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, Graves of the Fallen. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's <b>report</b> <b>as</b> it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following {{the publication of the}} reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the Commission's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Murray had no {{experience}} in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues {{with some of the}} male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site <b>report</b> <b>as</b> The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.|$|E

About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness <b>Report</b> <b>as</b> well.

5|$|During {{operations}} Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Soriano {{served as}} {{the chief of the}} liaison team to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. After the conflict ended, Soriano contributed to the Secretary of Defense's Gulf War <b>Report</b> <b>as</b> the chief of the army section while serving in the Office of the Chief of Staff. In 1992, Soriano received his first assignment at Fort Carson, Colorado, as the commander of the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. Following this command, Soriano returned to Germany to serve with the 3d and 1st Infantry Divisions, which included deployments to Bosnia for peacekeeping during Operation Joint Endeavor. Returning to the United States, he undertook various positions in Virginia and The Pentagon, including service as Director, Officer Personnel Management, within the Total Army Personnel Command. From 1999 to 2001, Soriano commanded the 7th Infantry Division and Fort Carson. Soriano served as Director of Homeland Security for United States Joint Forces Command from October 2001 to August 2002, which laid the foundations for what has become the Northern Command.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime and perceptions of crime. In 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. News and World <b>Report</b> <b>as</b> the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was one-fifth of the city rate.|$|E

5|$|In 1849, the North British Railway {{opened a}} line from Edinburgh through Midlothian as far as Hawick in the Scottish Borders; a further {{extension}} in 1862 brought the line to Carlisle in England. The line, known as the Waverley Route after the novels {{of the same name}} by Sir Walter Scott whose stories were set in the surrounding countryside, was controversially closed in January 1969 following the recommendation for its closure in the 1963 Beeching <b>Report</b> <b>as</b> an unremunerative line. According to information released by the Ministry of Transport, the potential savings to British Railways from the line's closure were at least £536,000. In addition, an estimated grant of £700,000 would have been required to maintain a full service on the line. The last passenger train over the Waverley Route was the Edinburgh- sleeper on 5 January 1969 worked by Class 45 D60 Lytham St Anne's which arrived two hours late into Carlisle due to anti-closure protesters blocking the line.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, a U.S. Border Patrol {{checkpoint}} {{was opened}} near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR94, {{as well as}} fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR188 to address {{the high rate of}} accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of the environmental impact <b>report</b> <b>as</b> well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents pushed for a ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, as well as to pay $20,000 for the attorneys. In March1999, Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact. During the early 2000s, the interchange with SR125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR54, which was finished in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard <b>report</b> <b>as</b> the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to reduce the number.|$|E
