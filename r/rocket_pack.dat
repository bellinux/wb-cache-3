5|$|In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal a <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> from Howard Hughes. During their escape, {{they find}} {{themselves}} on an airfield, where they hide the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack,</b> ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord's Gee Bee racer is totaled during the accident; he and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> hidden in a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack,</b> and he sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> is at the airfield.|$|E
5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack.</b> Hughes explains that his <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack,</b> Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|Hughes later {{presents}} Cliff with {{a brand-new}} Gee Bee air racer {{and a fresh}} pack of chewing gum. As Hughes leaves, Jenny returns Peevy's <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> blueprints, which she found in Sinclair's home; Peevy decides that, with some modifications, he can build an even better one.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to {{find the}} <b>rocket</b> <b>pack.</b> The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its {{detailed}} schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement {{in the hunt for}} the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack.</b> The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée.|$|E
5|$|Cliff {{flies to}} the rendezvous, where Sinclair demands that Cliff {{give him the}} <b>rocket</b> <b>pack.</b> Cliff divulges to the mobsters that the actor is a Nazi; Valentine's gang turn their weapons on Sinclair and Lothar, but Sinclair summons sixty heavily armed Nazi S.A. commandos hidden at the observatory. The Nazi rigid airship Luxembourg appears {{overhead}} to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; they and the mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the airship.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> scenes.|$|E
25|$|Jet <b>packs</b> and <b>rocket</b> <b>packs</b> {{have much}} better flight {{time on a}} tankful of fuel if they have wings like an aeroplane's.|$|R
25|$|These {{circumstances}} {{limit the}} sphere of the application of <b>rocket</b> <b>packs</b> to very spectacular public demonstration flights, i.e., stunts; for example, a flight was arranged {{in the course of}} the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, USA.|$|R
5000|$|Justin Peters of Slate watched all the Super Bowls over {{a two-month}} period in 2015 before Super Bowl 50. He {{mentioned}} {{about the first}} Super Bowl having [...] "two dudes in <b>rocket</b> <b>packs</b> who flew around the stadium. I can forgive {{a lot of bad}} football as long as the game features two dudes in honest-to-God rocket packs." ...|$|R

Generations into the future, the kingdom has {{been subject to}} attack by {{neighboring}} countries which want control of The Pig Star. To protect the kingdom of Zebulos, an elite group of warriors known as the Rocket Knights had been formed. These Warriors wore armor with <b>Rocket</b> <b>Packs,</b> wielded mystical swords, and harnessed awesome combat skills.|$|R

25|$|A <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> flight famously {{occurred}} on {{the opening of the}} summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1984, piloted by Bill Suitor, who landed opposite the presidential platform, where Ronald Reagan sat.|$|E
25|$|In 1959 Aerojet General Corporation won a U.S. Army {{contract}} {{to devise a}} jet pack or <b>rocket</b> <b>pack.</b> At the start of 1960 Richard Peoples made his first tethered flight with his Aeropack.|$|E
25|$|Further {{development}} {{equipped with}} Svod long-range navigation receiver and armed with 3 30mm NR-30 cannons. Had provisions for an unguided <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> or a FAB-250 bomb under each wing; entered service in 1956.|$|E
50|$|Packs with a {{turbojet}} engine are fueled with traditional kerosene-based jet fuel. They have higher efficiency, greater height and a duration of flight of many minutes, {{but they are}} complex in construction and very expensive. Only one working model of this pack was made; it underwent flight tests in the 1960s and at present it no longer flies.Jet <b>packs</b> and <b>rocket</b> <b>packs</b> have much better flight time on a tankful of fuel if they have wings like an aeroplane's.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1967, 25 A-37As {{were sent}} to Vietnam under the [...] "Combat Dragon" [...] {{evaluation}} program, and flew from Bien Hoa Air Base on USAF [...] "air commando" [...] missions, including close air support, helicopter escort, FAC, and night interdiction. Combat loads included high-explosive bombs, cluster munition dispensers, unguided <b>rocket</b> <b>packs,</b> napalm tanks, and the SUU-11/A Minigun pod. For most missions, the aircraft also carried two additional external fuel tanks on the inner stores pylons.|$|R
25|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>packs</b> can {{be useful}} for spacewalks. While near Earth a jet pack has to produce a g-force of at least 1g (a smaller g-force, {{providing}} only some deviation from free fall is of little use here), for excursions outside a free falling spaceship, a small g-force providing a small deviation from free fall is quite useful. Hence much less delta-v is consumed per unit time, and not during the whole EVA. With only small amounts of thrust needed, safety and temperature are much more manageable than in the atmosphere in Earth's gravity field.|$|R
25|$|This is {{the oldest}} known type of jet pack or <b>rocket</b> <b>pack.</b> One Bell Rocket Belt is {{on display at the}} Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, located near Dulles Airport.|$|E
25|$|F8U-2N (F-8D) – {{all-weather}} version, unguided <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> {{replaced with}} an additional fuel tank, J57-P-20 engine with 18,000lbf (80kN) of afterburning thrust, landing system which automatically maintained present airspeed during approach, incorporation of AN/APQ-83 radar. First flight: 16 February 1960, 152 built.|$|E
25|$|The Mk.6 {{seat was}} {{developed}} from the earlier Mk.4 design {{by the addition of}} a <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> to enable zero-zero capability. A variant of the Mk.6 was fitted with a compressed air cylinder crew breathing system to provide underwater ejection capability for the carrier-borne Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft.|$|E
50|$|No origin {{was ever}} given for Stratos {{in either of}} the two cartoons, but a comic {{produced}} by MV Creations to accompany the 2002 series revealed that his entire race was flightless until a magical staff gave them wings and the power of flight. The people of Avion use <b>rocket</b> <b>packs</b> for increased speed and navigation. During battle, they also carry rocket launchers and bombs. In the 1980s series, Stratos sported just a few feathers on his arms and flew Superman style, with his arms straight ahead. In the 2002 series, Stratos was redrawn to have full wings and a little more heft to his frame.|$|R
5000|$|The Jaguar wore a simple, skintight scarlet {{bodysuit}} with a flared black {{collar and}} the stylized {{suggestion of a}} feline face (just the eyes, whiskers, and open mouth) on the chest and jaguar pelt-patterned boots and nucleon belt. The latter had two small <b>rocket</b> <b>packs</b> on either side which gave him the power of supersonic flight. He wore no mask and looked exactly like Ralph Hardy, except that Hardy had a mustache, while The Jaguar did not. (Post-Silver Age comics artists tend to give the latter pointed ears and a more cat-like hairstyle, making him vaguely resemble a cross between the Sub-Mariner and the movie version of Wolverine.) ...|$|R
50|$|The pilot {{can control}} his <b>rocket</b> <b>pack's</b> flight differently, by {{changing}} {{the center of gravity}} of his body. For example, if we bend the legs and raise them to the stomach, the center of gravity will move forwards, and pack will be inclined and it will also fly forward. Such a control of pack, with the aid of the body, is considered incorrect and is characteristic of novices. Most experienced pilot Bill Suitor asserts that during the flight it is necessary to hold legs together and straight, and to control flight by the pack's levers and handles. This {{is the only way to}} learn to competently pilot the pack and to confidently carry out complex aerial maneuvers.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to, for example, turbojet engines which mainly expel {{atmospheric air}} to produce thrust, rocket packs are far simpler to build than devices using turbojets. The classical <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> construction of Wendell Moore {{can be made}} under workshop conditions, given good engineering training and {{a high level of}} tool-making craftsmanship.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, the <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> {{has become}} popular among enthusiasts, {{and some have}} built them for themselves. The pack's basic {{construction}} is rather simple, but its flying capability depends on two key parts: the gas generator, and the thrust control valve. The rocket packs being built today are largely based on the research and inventions of Wendell Moore at Bell Helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Version {{equipped}} with RP-1 Izumrud radar {{in the nose}} and armed with 2 23mm NR-23 (later 2 30 mm NR-30) cannons in the wings. Had provision for an unguided <b>rocket</b> <b>pack</b> under each wing, elongated tailfin fillet, all-moving tailplane, third airbrake added behind the ventral fin. Vympel K-13 (AA-2 'Atoll') air-to-air missile (AAM) capability was added late in its service life; entered production in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Though this broadside-attack tactic was effective, it {{came too}} late {{to have a real}} effect on the war, and only small numbers of Me 262s were {{equipped}} with the <b>rocket</b> <b>packs.</b> Most of those so equipped were Me 262A-1as, members of Jagdgeschwader 7. This method of attacking bombers became the standard, and mass deployment of Ruhrstahl X-4 guided missiles was cancelled. Some nicknamed this tactic the Luftwaffe's Wolf Pack, as the fighters often made runs in groups of two or three, fired their rockets, then returned to base. On 1 September 1944, USAAF General Carl Spaatz expressed the fear that if greater numbers of German jets appeared, they could inflict losses heavy enough to force cancellation of the Allied bombing offensive by daylight.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{each level}} is to steal {{one of the}} sheep from Sam Sheepdog's flock without him noticing and escort it to a marked area. Ralph is able to jump, tiptoe as to not make noise, and dash in case he needs to escape from danger. To aid Ralph in obtaining the sheep, Ralph can mail order various gadgets from Acme, such as <b>rocket</b> <b>packs</b> and dynamite. Certain items can be combined; for example, a fan {{can be used on}} a bottle of perfume to have its scent attract one of the sheep from afar. Ralph can also collect {{lettuces}} to lure the sheep towards places where Ralph is unable to carry them, such as on a weak bridge.|$|R
