5|$|Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were {{assembled}} using armoured plates <b>riveted</b> to a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, {{produced in}} 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the hull bottom between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a <b>riveted</b> and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a <b>riveted</b> hull could have <b>riveted</b> and welded turrets).|$|E

5|$|The {{stainless}} steel cladding is ribbed and <b>riveted</b> {{in the shape of}} sunbeams, with many triangular windows. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of <b>riveting</b> machines. Each type of machine has unique features and benefits. The orbital <b>riveting</b> process is different from impact <b>riveting</b> and spiralform <b>riveting.</b> Orbital <b>riveting</b> requires less downward force than impact or spiral <b>riveting.</b> Also, orbital <b>riveting</b> tooling typically lasts longer.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSelf-piercing <b>riveting</b> is a {{high-speed}} mechanical fastening technique for joining sheet-material components. In recent years, {{the development of}} the self-piercing <b>riveting</b> technology has broadened the application of the technology in the automobile industry. In this paper, a new method of joining metal sheets using a short pipe <b>rivet</b> with inner flange is proposed. Self-pierce <b>riveting</b> with inner flange pipe <b>rivet</b> is used to joint Al 6063 aluminum alloy sheets. <b>Riveting</b> process is presented. Different parameters of <b>rivet</b> height, <b>rivet</b> diameter, <b>rivet</b> end angle and <b>rivet</b> wall thickness are combined to obtain forming laws and static mechanical performance. Tensile tests of the lap joints, coach peel joints and cross joints of self-piercing <b>riveting</b> with inner flange pipe <b>rivet</b> are carried out. The effects of <b>rivet</b> heights, diameters, end angle and <b>rivet</b> wall thickness on tensile strength are explored...|$|R
30|$|After {{preprocessing}} {{the images}} {{obtained by the}} image acquisition equipment, a high-quality <b>rivet</b> image is obtained. In order to complete the measurement of the <b>rivets,</b> <b>rivets</b> must be recognized from the obtained images. Then, the exact coordinate set of <b>rivet</b> contour is obtained by region contour tracking, which lays a good foundation for <b>rivet</b> measurement in the next step. In this chapter, the acquisition process of <b>rivet</b> contour coordinate set is described in detail, which {{is divided into three}} parts: <b>rivet</b> image segmentation, <b>rivet</b> image analysis, and <b>rivet</b> image contour tracking.|$|R

He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he <b>riveted</b> a claim to {{a place on the}} team that went to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Comet's thin metal {{skin was}} {{composed}} of advanced new alloys and was both <b>riveted</b> and chemically bonded, which saved weight and reduced the risk of fatigue cracks spreading from the rivets. The chemical bonding process was accomplished using a new adhesive, Redux, which was liberally used {{in the construction of}} the wings and the fuselage of the Comet; it also had the advantage of simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|U-15 was {{constructed}} at AG Weser in Bremen for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and then shipped by rail in sections to Pola, where the sections were <b>riveted</b> together. Though {{there is no}} specific mention of {{how long it took}} for U-15s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine UB-3, shipped to Pola from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. U-15 was launched in April.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{methods can}} be used to {{assemble}} large mechanical structures. Using <b>rivets</b> is one of these methods. <b>Rivets</b> are lighter than bolts and allows for efficient assembly. The cylindrical structure has a discontinuous <b>rivet</b> assembled region. So concentration load operates in the edge of discontinuous assembled region. This paper evaluates the force placed upon <b>rivets</b> used to assemble cylindrical structures and strength of structures assembled with <b>rivets.</b> Plastic deformation of <b>rivets</b> occurs at 4 kN and <b>rivets</b> are destroyed at 7 kN. However, <b>rivets</b> are designed to transfer load to neighboring <b>rivets</b> when they are overloaded. Structural test were accomplished using tension and bending load condition. The structural tests showed that plastic deformation first occurs in the fastening where the <b>rivet</b> meets the outside of the cylinder and a number of <b>rivets</b> exhibited this type of deformation. The secondary phase of deformation occurs in the fastening where the <b>rivet</b> meets the inside of the cylinder. Despite the plastic deformation, the structural tests showed that the <b>rivets</b> succeeded in redistributing load to neighboring <b>rivets</b> and as a result, no <b>rivets</b> were destroyed...|$|R
50|$|A <b>rivet</b> gun, {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a type of tool used to drive <b>rivets.</b> The <b>rivet</b> gun is used on the manufactured head side of the <b>rivet</b> and a bucking bar is used on the buck-tail side of the <b>rivet.</b> The energy from the hammer in the <b>rivet</b> gun drives the work and the <b>rivet</b> against the inertia of the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the <b>rivet</b> is deformed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the <b>rivet</b> head and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all <b>rivet</b> guns are pneumatically powered. Those <b>rivet</b> guns used to drive <b>rivets</b> in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A <b>rivet</b> gun differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force.|$|R
50|$|Radial <b>riveting</b> is subtly {{different}} from orbital forming. Radial <b>riveting</b> lightly peens (hammers) the <b>rivet</b> {{head into the}} desired shape whereas orbital forming spreads the <b>rivet</b> head in one, continuous contact, motion. While orbital forming is the superior process in most applications, spiralform <b>riveting</b> can produce better results when very small <b>rivets</b> are involved.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was <b>riveted.</b> Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
5|$|Curiously, {{the legend}} {{has not been}} {{reported}} by any Byzantine author. However, {{an investigation of the}} surviving holes wherein the metal letters were <b>riveted</b> verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), and which was only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.|$|E
5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, {{while some of}} them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} stitched or <b>riveted</b> to the helmet, as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|E

50|$|Self-pierce <b>riveting</b> (SPR) is {{a process}} of joining two or more {{materials}} using an engineered <b>rivet.</b> Unlike solid, blind and semi-tubular <b>rivets,</b> self-pierce <b>rivets</b> do not require a drilled or punched hole.|$|R
50|$|Solid <b>rivets</b> {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. Solid <b>rivets</b> consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or <b>rivet</b> gun. A <b>rivet</b> compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of <b>rivet.</b> This tool is mainly used on <b>rivets</b> close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A <b>rivet</b> compression tool does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install solid <b>rivets.</b>|$|R
5|$|On May 19, 1865, Davis {{was imprisoned}} in a casemate at Fortress Monroe {{on the coast}} of Virginia. Irons were <b>riveted</b> to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles {{who was in charge of}} the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the {{attending}} physician warned that his life was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.|$|E

His family subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where Schwimmer had his first experiences of acting {{at the age of}} 10 when he was cast as the fairy godmother in a Jewish version of Cinderella. In 1979, Schwimmer went to a Shakespeare workshop given by English actor Ian McKellen in Los Angeles. He recalls that he was <b>riveted</b> by the experience. Schwimmer then entered a contest in the Southern California Shakespeare Festival three years in a row, winning two first prizes.|$|E
5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): this tank is {{described}} in many sources as early version of the T-26 mod. 1933. But in reality this is the Finnish war-time modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps163–16) of a hull from KhT-26 flame-throwing tank (which can be identified by rivets for mounting of a burning mixture tank, rivets for hinges of a filling hatch {{on the left side}} and a welded drain port on the right side behind a front track bogie) with a mounted <b>riveted</b> turret with a small rear niche from the early BT-5 light tank.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-piercing}} <b>riveting</b> (SPR) method {{which uses a}} flange pipe <b>rivet.</b> This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique <b>rivet</b> and incorrect <b>rivet</b> position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe <b>rivet.</b> The lap shear strength of the joint with a flange pipe <b>rivet</b> is higher than that of a joint with a conventional <b>rivet.</b> In this research, a flange pipe <b>rivet</b> was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch <b>riveting</b> machine. The flange pipe <b>rivet</b> moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a flange pipe <b>rivet</b> was done by DEFORM software. The simulated joint cross-section shapes were observed, and the influence of the flange pipe <b>rivet</b> parameters on joint quality was analyzed. Simultaneously, some <b>riveting</b> experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different <b>rivet</b> heights and chamfer angles. The results show that the joining surface is smooth and the simulated joint cross-section shapes are in good agreement with the experimental results. The joining property with a chamfer angle of 45 ° and a <b>rivet</b> height of 5 mm is found to be the best in joining the Al 6063 aluminum alloy sheets with a thickness of 2. 4 mm by using the SPR with a flange pipe <b>rivet...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{simulation}} {{and experiment}} of self-piercing <b>riveting</b> with solid <b>rivet</b> joining multi-layer aluminum sheets {{are carried out}} in this paper. The forming process of the <b>riveting</b> {{and the distribution of}} stress are analyzed, the results show that the simulation is consistent with the experiment. The results of experiment prove that the transition point of the cone-shaped head of the solid <b>rivet,</b> the size and position of groove affect directly the quality of <b>riveting.</b> The fillet at the transition point of the cone-shaped head of the solid <b>rivet</b> can decline the maximum stress of the <b>rivet.</b> When the distance between the center of groove and bottom of <b>rivet</b> is about three quarters of the bottom sheet thickness, the bottom sheet of self-piercing does not fall off.

30|$|The {{standard}} 2 D <b>rivet</b> {{image is}} an axisymmetric figure. In {{the case of}} horizontal placement of the <b>rivets,</b> {{the length of the}} external rectangle is the full length of the <b>rivets,</b> and the environment of the industrial automation production site is very complex, which may result in the <b>rivets</b> being slanted. Therefore, this paper uses the method of finding the minimum external rectangle of <b>rivets</b> to locate the spindle. This method can directly obtain the full length of <b>rivets,</b> and it can solve the influence of <b>rivet</b> orientation on the detection process.|$|R
5|$|T-26 model 1931: twin-turreted version {{armed with}} two DT tank machine guns. The first {{series-produced}} {{variant of the}} T-26 that was equipped with turrets differing from the initial Vickers design (Soviet turrets were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a <b>riveted</b> hull and turrets, a silencer affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the air outlet window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks armed with machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.|$|E
5|$|The König-class {{ships were}} 174.7m long at the waterline, and 175.4m long overall. With {{a beam of}} 29.5m, a forward draft of 9.19m and a rear draft of 9.0m, the Königs were {{designed}} to displace 25,796metric tons normally, but at full combat load, they displaced 28,600tons. The hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were <b>riveted.</b> The ships' hulls each contained 18 watertight compartments, each equipped with a double bottom that ran for 88% {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} quickly {{caught on}} in Chicago. In 1889 the Tacoma Building replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger <b>riveted</b> approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the structural design of skyscrapers. The 1890 Rand McNally Building became {{in the first}} entirely self-supporting, steel-framed skyscraper. Some buildings, such as The Rookery and the Monadnock Building, combined elements of both the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings. Structural engineers specializing in the steel frame design began to establish practices in Chicago.|$|E
