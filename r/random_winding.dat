40|$|Standard {{induction}} motors {{are exposed}} to steep-fronted, non-sinusoidal voltages when fed from frequency converters. These wave patterns can be destructive to the insulation. The aim of the present work is to develop methods of predicting the magnitude and distribution of fast voltage within the stator winding of an electric machine fed from a frequency converter. Three methods of predicting the magnitude and distribution of fast voltages within form windings commonly used in medium and high voltage machines are described. These methods utilise some aspects of previously published works on the surge propagation studies to achieve simplification of the solution without loss of accuracy. Two of these methods are applied to the voltage calculation in <b>random</b> <b>winding</b> commonly used in low voltage machines. Multi-conductor transmission line theory forms {{the basis of the}} methods described in this work. Computation of the voltage distribution using either of these methods requires the calculation of the parameters for the slot and the end (over-hang) part of the winding. The parallel plate capacitor method, the indirect boundary integral equation method and the finite element method are the three possible methods of calculating the capacitance also described in this work. Duality existing between the magnetic and the electric field has been used for th...|$|E
40|$|In Permanent Magnet (PM) machines, a turn-turn Short-Circuit (SC) {{fault is}} the most {{critical}} fault to eradicate. The fault introduces high SC current in the shorted turn which may consequently lead to secondary faults unless the fault is appropriately controlled. This paper proposes feasible conductors’ placement in a slot of PM machine to minimize such turn-turn fault current. In order to minimize the fault current, the conductor arrangement in a slot is optimized using multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) incorporating with both analytical and Finite Element (FE) numerical tool. The possible combinations of conductors’ placement are set as variables and optimized for a given machine which is designed for safety critical applications. It is shown that the fault current associated to a single turn fault can be significant for the <b>random</b> <b>winding</b> placement even though the remedial strategies are put in place. It is also shown that the fault current can be limited significantly by rearranging the winding placement {{in a way to}} share slot-leakage fluxes. This is confirmed via experiment on E-core. Influences of the winding arrangement on both frequency dependent resistances and windings capacitances are experimented. It is demonstrated that adopting the winding arrangement that shares the slot-leakage flux effectively benefits to minimize the AC losses in addition to improved fault tolerance. But it increases the turn-turn capacitances whose effect however can be neglected as the resonance frequency occurs beyond the operational frequency range of the machines of interes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>winding</b> {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|E

The 4 -D dynamic attack zone after being launched is inside traditional maximum dynamic envelope, but its forane boundary is usually not inside traditional no-escape dynamic envelope; Traditional dynamic attack zone can just be reliably used at launch time, while dynamic envelope after being launched can be reliably and accurately used during any flight antagonism time.

To {{solve the problem of}} pounding occurs between the mega-frame and substructures, as well as the large span of the mega beams of mega-sub structure (MSS), in this paper a new kind of structural configuration, named mega-sub controlled structure (MSCS), is presented, which is constructed by applying the structural control principle into structural configuration itself, to form a new structure with obvious response self-control ability, instead of employing the conventional method. Dynamic equation and method to assembling parameter matrixes for the meg-sub-controlled structure subjected to <b>random</b> <b>wind</b> loads are presented based on a realistic analytical model of the complete mega-structural system. According to the peculiarity and deformation of the systems, a more realistic analytical model of this structure subjected to <b>random</b> <b>wind</b> loads is presented, in which the substructures are treated as multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system, the dominant vibration mode for the mega-frame is controlled by bending deformation; shear deformation is the governing mode for the less slender substructures. The displacement, acceleration responses and response spectrum are then determined for both the MSCS and its conventional structure counterpart. Moreover, the additional damping ratio ρ c, additional columns stiffness ratio Rk are defined and the influence of the two parameters is discussed. The study illustrates that the improved MSCS can effectively reduce the displacement and acceleration responses, as well as ameliorates the control effectiveness of tall/super-tall mega-systems. This lay a foundation for further studying seismic performance and design of steel mega-frame structures.
