30|$|The STCW Convention {{provides}} required {{components for}} seafarer training, which use the <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> {{as a tool}} of training and assessment. These highlights include (Ali 2006; Organization 2006; Teel et al. 2009): factors affecting performance and accuracy; detection of misrepresentation of information, including false echoes and sea returns; setting up and maintaining displays; range and bearing; plotting techniques and relative motion concepts; identification of critical echoes; course and speed of other ships; time and distance of the closest approach to crossing, meeting or overtaking ships; detecting course and speed changes of other ships; effects on the changes of the own ship’s course or speed or both; and application of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. To fulfill all of these training requirements, a high performance marine <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> is needed. In the current marine <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> market, the major developing teams include Nautical Software (2016), Bridge Command (2016), Kongsberg Maritime (2016), Landfall (2016), and Dalian Maritime University Institute of Navigational Technology (2016). In addition, some previous research investigates methods to improve the marine <b>radar</b> <b>simulator.</b> For example, Arnold-Bos et al. developed a versatile bistatic and polarimetric marine <b>radar</b> <b>simulator.</b> In their simulator, realistic sea surfaces are generated using the two-scale model on a semi-deterministic basis, so as to incorporate the presence of ship wakes in the simulation (Arnold-Bos et al. 2006). Yin et al. designed a <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> using a PC to generate radar echoes and a radar interface board to generate radar signals. Their simulator has a more flexible and realistic operation interface than other simulators (Yin et al. 2007). Zhang et al. put forward a coastline echo intensity algorithm based on RGB and HIS color models and applied this algorithm on the marine <b>radar</b> <b>simulator.</b> The simulation results from this model are consistent with the electronic chart (Zhang et al. 2010).|$|E

40|$|International audienceA full <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> for {{high-resolution}} (1 – 5 km) nonhydrostatic models {{has been}} developed within the research nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric (Meso-NH) model. This simulator {{is made up of}} building blocks, each of which describes a particular physical process (scattering, beam bending, etc.). For each of these blocks, several formulations have been implemented. For instance, the <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> offers the possibility to choose among Rayleigh, Rayleigh–Gans, Mie, or T-matrix scattering methods, and beam bending can be derived from an effective earth radius or can depend on the vertical gradient of the refractive index of air. Moreover, the <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> is fully consistent with the microphysical parameterizations used by the atmospheric numerical model. Sensitivity experiments were carried out using different configurations for the simulator. They permitted the specification of an observation operator for assimilation of radar reflectivities by high-resolution nonhydrostatic numerical weather prediction systems, as well as for their validation.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades the use of <b>Radar</b> <b>Simulators</b> and, latterly Radar/Navigational Simulators, has been widely adopted by all the leading {{maritime}} nations as a training aid. The aim of this investigation was to compare and contrast the use of similar installations at two colleges of higher education within the E. E. C. The two colleges chosen were Hochschule fur Nautik, Bremen and the Faculty of Maritime Studies, Plymouth Polytechnic, as both these establishments employed identical simulators. The historical development of <b>Radar</b> <b>Simulators</b> in the United Kingdom and West Germany was examined, together with the effect on officer training. Using qualitative methodology an analysis was made of course structure, teaching methods and the perceptions of staff and students at the two institutions with particular reference to the effectiveness and relevance of the respective courses to the students' professional roles. As a result of this analysis, changes were made in the course design at Plymouth, without deviating from the guidelines contained in the Department of Transport's Regulations and Guide for the Navigation Control Course 1981 / 85. Such a revised course is fully described in the text, together with appropriate examples. The Bremen Simulator Course is similarly described, with examples. Although the philosophy behind the construction of the simulator exercises remains the same in both colleges, the course design differs. The change in emphasis in certain sections is explained by investigating the differences in the distribution of simulator training within the total marine training programmes of West Germany and the United Kingdom. Data collected revealed a requirement for more 'realism' in simulation, and a greater versatility in its use for disciplines other than marine officer training. This has resulted in a new simulator conceptual design for Plymouth, which is outlined in this study. Hochschule fur Nautik, Bremen, West German...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design and implementation of a <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> called Sarsim 2. The <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> was originally developed to produce synthetic range profiles (SRPs) of complex aircraft models. It was then expanded and upgraded to generate simulated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Over {{the last few years}} a substantial amount of work has been carried out by the Radar Remote Sensing Group (RRSG) at the University of Cape Town (UCT) to produce SRPs of aircraft targets using an 1 -Band search radar of Reutech Systems. The high range resolution that can be obtained from SRP processing makes it feasible to extract characteristic features from a profile obtained from an aircraft. The ultimate aim of producing SRPs is to use these extracted features for non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR), i. e. to be able to identify an aircraft type from the echo signal received by the radar. The <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> was written to produce SRPs of aircraft models, which could then be used to investigate the feasibility of various aircraft-identification algorithms. The stepped-frequency processing required to obtain SRPs of aircraft targets has initiated further research in the RRSG into more efficient stepped-frequency processing techniques, and the <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> has been used extensively to generate simulated data. The RRSG group is also actively involved with SAR processing techniques, and the <b>radar</b> <b>simulator</b> has been invaluable in providing necessary simulation data to test various processing algorithms. One of the main objectives of this simulator was to have an easy-to-use graph ical interface, which can show results in real-time. This requirement makes it necessary to find some way of reducing the required computation. The solution implemented may be called VYSIWIC (what you see is what is calculated). This means that the data is only calculated to a resolution depending on the screen resolution. Only when the data is saved to disk will it be calculated and written with the required sampling rate...|$|E
