50|$|Eventually, Red Star {{was put on}} the run between Sicamous, British Columbia and Enderby, British Columbia. However, {{she drew}} too much water, so R. P. Rithet had a flat-bottomed, scow-shaped {{stern-wheeler}} of light draft built, where he placed Red Star's machinery. The machinery was not suitable for a stern-wheeler, so the paddle wheel had to be driven with a chain and <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel.</b> and to overcome the difficulty the paddle wheel was driven with a chain and <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel.</b> This vessel became known as Red Star No. 2 and thus, the original Red Star's long and varied career ended.|$|R

50|$|During {{continuous}} contact printing, the {{raw stock}} {{and the negative}} are placed next to one another around the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> of the printer. The negative, which is the closer of the two to the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> (thus creating a slightly shorter path), must have a marginally shorter pitch between perforations (0.1866 in pitch); the raw stock has a long pitch (0.1870 in). While cellulose nitrate and cellulose diacetate stocks used to shrink during processing slightly enough to have this difference naturally occur, modern safety stocks do not shrink at the same rate, and therefore negative (and some intermediate) stocks are perforated at a pitch of 0.2% shorter than print stock.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "bedstead" [...] was {{a system}} of pulleys around which two {{continuous}} loops of tape were driven in synchrony. Initially this was {{by means of a}} pair of <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> on a common axle. This was changed to drive by friction pulleys with the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> maintaining the synchrony when it was found that this caused less damage to the tapes. Speeds of up to 2000 characters per second were achieved for shorter tapes, but only 1000 for longer tapes. The tapes were guided past an array of photo-electric cells where the characters and other signals were read. Possible tape lengths on the bedstead were from 2000 to 11,000 characters.|$|R

5000|$|Roberts, {{from this}} {{experience}} of the War Office competition, had the vision to design a vehicle for the British Army which {{would be able to}} traverse unstable ground. Vehicles such as Hornsby's 12-ton tractor would quickly be hindered by waterlogged surfaces with wheels sinking in mud. On 23 July 1904, his patent (No. 16,345) obviated this problem, with a vehicle where [...] two pitched chains of links and pins with cross bars and blocks of metal and wood to make contact with the ground are passed around the front and rear <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels,</b> one {{on each side of the}} vehicle and form a track. The weight of the vehicle body (and engine) is taken by side brackets provided with curved pathways or bearing surfaces resting on rollers which, in turn, are supported on the chains, or on rollers of large diameter revolving on fixed pins. With this arrangement, when the vehicle is running the body is, so to say, rolled forward on the chains. Steering may be accomplished by varying the speed of the driving <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> on either side of the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Two-axis solar {{tracking}} system {{operated by the}} discharge of water from a bottom hole of a tank filled with water was designed, constructed and tested. The water tank is hanged by a chain passing over a non-circular <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> which is fixed to the rotating shaft along the first solar tracking axis. A counterweight is also hanged by another chain passing over a regular circular sprocket. In the morning, the tank is full and the water tank and the counterweight {{on either side of}} the shaft balance in such a way that the solar panel is facing the East as required. This study shows that the contour of the non-circular <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> can be designed taking into consideration the reduction of weight of water tank with time and the required rotation for solar tracking. In addition to the hourly tracking by the above mechanism, provision has been made to tilt the second tracking axis of the solar panel manually on a weekly basis to compensate for the seasonal variation of the Sun's declination. Results show that the additional cost involved in making this mechanism is justifiable when considering the increase of about 30 % of more solar power obtainable by two-axis tracking.

The line had not as yet been formally accepted from the Daft and Company firm which had been involved in its construction, and engineers from that company laid the incident at failure to lower the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> to the rack system when the motor failed. Additionally, the route's terrain made its operation fragile: Snow was known to put it out of operation.|$|R
50|$|William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, a Scottish {{inventor}} {{and employee}} of Thomas Edison, designed the Kinetographic Camera in 1891. The camera was powered by {{an electric motor}} and was capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement {{that would be the}} foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|R

[...] The original scenario was rooted in scenes of Soviet life, of which Yakulov had experience (but the émigrés Prokofiev and Diaghilev did not), involving speculators, sailors and workers, and with scenes in a station, a market and a factory, centered on life in the early Soviet Union.

500|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19mm (3/4inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel,</b> was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that [...] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|R
5000|$|A pair of {{propellers}} at {{the rear}} provided propulsion.

DD Tanks could swim at up to [...] Both the commander and the driver could steer in the water, although with different methods.

The Dunlop Grand Prix permitted variable gears but prohibited butterfly or wing nuts and singles. The riders were required to repair their own bikes during the stage, were not able to change bicycles unless it was bona fide damaged [...] and no spare parts or other assistance were permitted.

50|$|At the time, John Blenkinsop {{was engaged}} in {{developing}} the rack and pinion system for locomotives, {{as a means of}} overcoming the problem of limited adhesion force of locomotives of the time. As the rack was cast with the edge rails in use, this cannot have been an attractive adaptation. It may have been for that reason that it was not until 1817 that Bentinck arranged to acquire a steam locomotive from George Stephenson. It was a six-wheel design of Killingworth type; the first and last axles were driven by pistons in two vertical cylinders set in the boiler top, and a chain drive working on central <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheels</b> connected all three axles.
