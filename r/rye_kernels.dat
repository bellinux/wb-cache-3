The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and appetite regulation the next day when ingesting <b>rye</b> <b>kernel</b> bread rich in DF as an evening meal. Whole grain <b>rye</b> <b>kernel</b> test bread (RKB) or a white wheat flour based bread (reference product, WWB) was provided as late evening meals to healthy young adults in a randomized cross-over design. The test products RKB and WWB were provided in two priming settings: as a single evening meal or as three consecutive evening meals prior to the experimental days. Test variables were measured in the morning, 10. 5 - 13. 5 hours after ingestion of RKB or WWB. The postprandial phase was analyzed for measures of glucose metabolism, inflammatory markers, appetite regulating hormones and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in blood, hydrogen excretion in breath and subjective appetite ratings. With the exception of serum CRP, no significant differences in test variables were observed depending on length of priming (P> 0. 05). The RKB evening meal increased plasma concentrations of PYY (0 - 120 min, P< 0. 001), GLP- 1 (0 - 90 min, P< 0. 05) and fasting SCFA (acetate and butyrate, P< 0. 05, propionate, P = 0. 05), compared to WWB. Moreover, RKB decreased blood glucose (0 - 120 min, P = 0. 001), serum insulin response (0 - 120 min, P< 0. 05) and fasting FFA concentrations (P< 0. 05). Additionally, RKB improved subjective appetite ratings during the whole experimental period (P< 0. 05), and increased breath hydrogen excretion (P< 0. 001), indicating increased colonic fermentation activity. The results indicate that RKB evening meal has an anti-diabetic potential and that the increased release of satiety hormones and improvements of appetite sensation could be beneficial in preventing obesity. These effects could possibly be mediated through colonic fermentation. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 02093481...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Frequent {{hyperglycemic}} episodes {{are increasingly}} being {{associated with an increased}} risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: We studied the extent to which acute glycemia and glycemia after subsequent meals can be modulated by the characteristics of cereal foods, such as glycemic index (GI) and content of indigestible carbohydrates. DESIGN: Twelve healthy subjects consumed test meals in a random order. In series 1, the test meals were consumed at breakfast, and postprandial blood glucose incremental areas under the curve (IAUCs) were calculated after the test breakfast, standardized lunch, and standardized dinner. In series 2, the subjects consumed test evening meals and IAUCs were calculated after a subsequent standardized breakfast. Breath hydrogen was measured as an indicator of colonic fermentation. RESULTS: Barley or <b>rye</b> <b>kernel</b> breakfasts lowered the blood glucose IAUC (0 - 120 min) at breakfast, at a subsequent lunch, and the cumulative IAUCs (breakfast+lunch+dinner) when compared with white-wheat bread (P < 0. 05). The lunch blood glucose IAUCs were positively correlated with breakfast IAUCs (r = 0. 30, P < 0. 05). Breath hydrogen excretion was negatively correlated with blood glucose IAUCs after lunch (r = - 0. 33, P < 0. 05) and dinner (r = - 0. 22, P < 0. 05). A barley kernel evening meal resulted in lower IAUCs (P < 0. 05) and higher breath hydrogen (P < 0. 001) after a subsequent breakfast compared with white-wheat bread. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose tolerance at subsequent meals can be notably improved {{during the course of a}} whole day or overnight by choosing specific low-GI, whole-grain cereal products. A low GI may be sufficient to achieve a second-meal effect from breakfast to lunch. A specific indigestible carbohydrate mixture appears to be required to show benefits on glucose tolerance in a longer time frame (9. 5 h), most likely mediated through colonic fermentation...|$|R
5000|$|A simple, all-rye bread can be {{made using}} a sourdough starter and rye meal; it will not rise {{as high as a}} wheat bread, but will be more moist with a {{substantially}} longer keeping time. Such bread is often known as [...] "black bread" [...] (Schwarzbrot in German, chyorniy khleb in Russian) from their darker color than wheat breads (enhanced by long baking times, creating Maillard reactions in the crumb). The German Vollkornbrot (whole-grain bread) is something of an archetypical example, containing both rye meal and cracked whole rye grains (which are generally soaked overnight before incorporating into the dough). It is used both as an appetizer substrate for such things as smoked fish and caviar and as a sandwich bread. A very similar, but darker, bread, German-style pumpernickel, has an even darker color derived from toasted leftover bread and other agents. Due to the density of the bread, the yeast in the starter is used at least as much for the fermentation character in the bread itself as it is for leavening. Danish rugbrød (rye bread), another archetypical example, is typically made with sour dough, with either straight rye flour or mixed with whole and/or cracked <b>rye</b> <b>kernels.</b> Any breads containing wheat flour are not considered rugbrød, but white bread. A variety of seeds, such as pumpkin, poppy and caraway, may be added for taste. Rugbrød is a staple lunch food, typically eaten topped with cold or warm fish and meats, cheese or any other cold cut.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{structure}} of whole grain cereals is maintained {{to varying degrees}} during processing and preparation of foods. Food structure can influence metabolism, including perceived hunger and satiety. A diet that enhances satiety per calorie may help to prevent excessive calorie intake. The objective of this work was to compare subjective appetite ratings after consumption of intact and milled <b>rye</b> <b>kernels.</b> Methods Two studies were performed using a randomized, cross-over design. Ratings for appetite (hunger, satiety and desire to eat) were registered during an 8 -h period after consumption of whole and milled <b>rye</b> <b>kernels</b> prepared as breads (study 1, n = 24) and porridges (study 2, n = 20). Sifted wheat bread was used as reference in both study parts and the products were eaten in iso-caloric portions with standardized additional breakfast foods. Breads and porridges were analyzed to determine whether structure (whole vs. milled kernels) effected dietary fibre content and composition after preparation of the products. Statistical evaluation of the appetite ratings after intake of the different breakfasts was done by paired t-tests for morning and afternoon ratings separately, with subjects as random effect and type of breakfast and time points as fixed effects. Results All rye breakfasts resulted in higher satiety ratings {{in the morning and}} afternoon compared with the iso-caloric reference breakfast with sifted wheat bread. Rye bread with milled or whole kernels affected appetite equally, so no effect of structure was observed. In contrast, after consumption of the rye kernel breakfast, satiety was increased and hunger suppressed in the afternoon compared with the milled rye kernel porridge breakfast. This effect could be related to structural differences alone, because the products were equal in nutritional content including dietary fibre content and composition. Conclusions The study demonstrates that small changes in diet composition such as cereal grain structure have the potential to effect feelings of hunger and satiety.

When the kernel moisture was 16 % and higher, the rapture point during compression test was not observed.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and the {{insulin resistance syndrome}} (IRS) are increasing worldwide. However, disturbances in the metabolic status can be prevented by changing the daily diet towards more whole grains, vegetables, legumes and dairy products. Also the dietary glycaemic- and insulinaemic indices of foods may play a role. Rye products are interesting in this context as they are usually consumed in wholegrain form and have been demonstrated to induce low insulin responses, {{with or without a}} simultaneous lowering of the glycaemic index (GI). The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the possible cause of low postprandial insulin response to rye, and to elucidate potential effects of processing condition, extraction rate and rye variety. Insulin response as well as glycaemic response and course of glycaemia were evaluated in the postprandial phase. Additionally a marker of colonic fermentation was analysed in the postprandial phase (breath hydrogen) and appetite regulating properties were investigated using subjective ratings, analysis of plasma ghrelin, and quantification of voluntary food intake at a subsequent meal. Wholegrain rye products, ingested as boiled kernels and breads as well as endosperm rye (sifted rye) bread and porridge, induced low insulin responses and also a well regulated course of glycaemia, noted as blood glucose curves with lower incremental peaks, remaining above fasting for a longer time. However, some rye varieties were devoid of benefits on course of glycaemia and insulin economy. Two measurements of the course of glycaemia were introduced, the GP and GP 2, defined as the duration for incremental postprandial glycaemic response divided by the glucose incremental peak or squared glucose incremental peak, respectively. The GP and GP 2 of the products were correlated to the insulin response, as well as to late subjective satiety, suggesting that they are good predictors of postprandial events. Suggested mechanism for the lowered glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were a high content of viscous fibres, bioactive components, e. g. phenolic acids and a dense food structure, contributing to a lowered digestion and uptake of carbohydrates in the small intestines. Furthermore, rye products induced early colonic fermentation, already in the postprandial phase, possibly explained by the presence of arabinoxylans, fructans, and other dietary fibre compounds of low molecular weight. The increase in colonic fermentation, measured as increase in breath H 2, correlated with lower late postprandial concentration of FFA and the GP and GP 2 of the products, suggesting increased glucose tolerance already in the postprandial phase after rye products. Rye products, in particular boiled <b>rye</b> <b>kernels</b> induced high postprandial subjective satiety and promoted satiety also at a subsequent voluntary meal. The rye kernel breakfast lowered the voluntary energy intake at a second meal with 16 %. The mechanism behind this satiating effect of rye was suggested to be the high content of dietary fibres (DF) and high water content introducing a bulking effect. Also, high content of viscous and fermentable DF can lower gastric emptying rate. The low postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia seen with several rye products appears to contribute to a lowered rebound of the hunger peptide ghrelin prior to the second meal. Rye products made from whole kernels and wholegrain- and endosperm rye bread induced lower postprandial insulinaemia and glycaemia than wholegrain- and endosperm rye porridges, while porridges and whole kernels induced higher subjective satiety. Boiled <b>rye</b> <b>kernels</b> also supressed the desire to eat {{to a greater extent than}} boiled wheat kernels in the later postprandial phase (tAUC 210 – 270 min). Several components are suggested to contribute to the observed lowered insulinaemia, well regulated glycaemia and improved satiating effects of certain rye products...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of obesity is increasing worldwide and prevention is needed. Whole grain has shown potential to {{lower the risk of}} obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. One possible mechanism behind the benefits of whole grain is the gut fermentation of dietary fiber (DF), e. g. non-starch polysaccharides and resistant starch (RS), in whole grain. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of whole grain rye-based products on glucose- and appetite regulation. Method: Twenty-one healthy subjects were provided four rye-based evening test meals in a crossover overnight study design. The test evening meals consisted of either whole grain rye flour bread (RFB) or a 1 : 1 ratio of whole grain rye flour and <b>rye</b> <b>kernels</b> bread (RFB/RKB), with or without added resistant starch (+RS). White wheat flour bread (WWB) was used as reference evening meal. Blood glucose, insulin, PYY, FFA, IL- 6 as well as breath H 2 and subjective rating of appetite were measured the following morning at fasting and repeatedly up to 3. 5 h after a standardized breakfast consisting of WWB. Ad libitum energy intake was determined at lunch, 14. 5 h after evening test and reference meals, respectively. Results: The evening meal with RFB/RKB + RS decreased postprandial glucose- and insulin responses (iAUC) (P < 0. 05) and increased the gut hormone PYY in plasma the following morning 0 - 120 min after the standardized breakfast, compared to WWB (P = 0. 01). Moreover, RFB increased subjective satiety and decreased desire to eat, and both RFB and RFB/RKB decreased feeling of hunger (AUC 0 - 210 min). All rye-based evening meals decreased or tended to decrease fasting FFA (P < 0. 05, RFB/RKB: P = 0. 057) and increased breath hydrogen concentration (0 - 120 min, P < 0. 001). No effects were noted on energy intake at lunch or inflammatory marker IL- 6 (0 + 180 min) after the rye-based evening meals, compared to WWB. Conclusion: Whole grain rye bread has the potential to improve cardiometabolic variables in an 11 - 14. 5 h perspective in healthy humans. The combination RFB/RKB + RS positively affected biomarkers of glucose- and appetite regulation in a semi-acute perspective. Meanwhile, RFB and RFB/RKB improved subjective appetite ratings.

40|$|The satiating {{capacity}} of foods and meals {{is affected by}} caloric content, but also varies with several aspects of food composition (e. g. macronutrient composition, energy density, fibre content and food structure). Rye is a cereal that possesses interesting characteristics {{with the potential to}} increase satiety. There are currently public health threats related to overweight and obesity, conditions that result from energy intake exceeding energy output. Excessive energy intake can be avoided by diets based on foods that prolong the feeling of fullness per calorie. This work aimed to study the effects of rye foods on subjective appetite. Ratings of satiety, hunger and desire to eat were recorded during 8 h after intake of wellcharacterised rye foods, compared with iso-caloric refined wheat bread, served as parts of breakfast meals in cross-over design studies. The effect of rye processing (sifting and milling) on perceived appetite was investigated by comparing <b>rye</b> <b>kernels</b> and whole-grain rye flour in breads and porridges. The effect of regular consumption of whole-grain rye porridge compared with refined wheat bread was investigated during three weeks, along with self-reported food intake and oro-caecal transit-time. Apparent small intestine absorption of macronutrients in response to diets supplemented with high-fibre rye or with low fibre wheat bread was studied in an ileostomy model. All rye products (whole-grain porridges made from flour, flakes or kernels and breads including whole-grain flour, kernels or milling fractions) improved satiety and decreased hunger for up to 8 h after intake, in contrast to refined wheat bread. Rye bran as bread ingredient resulted in improved satiety compared with other rye fractions. The effect of milling was demonstrated as rye kernel intake resulted in higher satiety ratings appearing 4 h after intake and remained at a higher level during the following 4 h, compared with bread with the same material milled to flour. At regular consumption of whole-grain rye porridge for three weeks, the post-meal satiety was constant and remained at a higher level compared with refined wheat bread. Replacement of low-fibre wheat bread with high-fibre rye bread in a standardised diet resulted in higher amounts of all macronutrients being excreted from the terminal ileum in ileostomy subjects, showing lowered small intestine absorption of the high-fibre diet. A range of rye products was shown to improve satiety up to 8 h after intake and inclusion of rye foods into a healthy diet may thereby potentially prevent body weight gain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Rye {{products}} {{have been demonstrated}} to lower the acute insulin demand, induce a low and prolonged blood glucose response (high Glycemic Profile, GP) and reduce subclinical inflammation. These products may therefore contribute to a lowered risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardio vascular disease. The objective of the present paper was to evaluate the mechanism for a reduced postprandial insulin demand with rye products, and to explore possible appetite regulating properties. Methods 10 healthy subjects were served breakfast meals (50 g of available starch) with endosperm- or whole grain rye breads, with and without lactic acid, boiled whole grain rye- (RK) or wheat (WK) kernels, or white wheat bread reference (WWB) in random order in a cross-over design. Plasma concentrations of glucose, ghrelin, serum insulin, free fatty acids, adiponectin, breath hydrogen excretion (H 2), and subjective satiety was evaluated during the postprandial phase. 270 min after the breakfast, an ad lib lunch buffet was served and the voluntary energy intake (EI) was registered. Results All rye products and WK induced lower insulinemic indices (II) than WWB. A lower incremental insulin peak following breakfast correlated with a lower EI at lunch (r = 0. 38). A low II was related to improved satiety in the early postprandial phase (fullness AUC 0 - 60 min, r = - 0. 36). RK induced a higher GP compared to WWB and WK. A higher GP was related to a lowered desire to eat before lunch (AUC 210 - 270) and to a lower concentration of ghrelin in the late postprandial phase after breakfast (270 min), r = - 0. 29 and - 0. 29), which in turn was related to a lower voluntary EI (r = 0. 43 and 0. 33). The RK breakfast improved satiety in the early postprandial phase (0 - 60 min) compared to WWB, and induced a lower EI at lunch (- 16 %). A high content of indigestible carbohydrates in the breakfast products was related to improved satiety (0 - 60 min, r = 0. 68 for fullness), and a higher breath H 2 in the late postprandial phase (120 - 270 and 270 - 390 min, r = 0. 46 and 0. 70). High H 2 (AUC 120 - 270 min) also correlated with lower EI (r = - 0. 34). Conclusions Rye products, rich in indigestible carbohydrates, induce colonic fermentation already post the breakfast meal, and lowers acute insulin responses. A high excretion of breath H 2 also correlated with a higher GP. Especially, <b>rye</b> <b>kernels</b> induced a high GP which {{was associated with a}} 16 % lowering of energy intake at a subsequent lunch meal. The bulking effect of rye fiber, colonically derived fermentation metabolites, a high GP and a low insulin response possibly all contributes to the benefits on glucose- and appetite regulation seen in an acute and semi-acute perspective. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome includes {{a cluster of}} dysfunctions that identifies subjects {{at high risk of}} developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of the {{metabolic syndrome}} has increased markedly over the last two decades. Central to this syndrome is insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, but also other manifestations, e. g. central obesity, dyslipidaemia, elevated blood pressure, imbalance in lipoproteins and pro-thrombotic factors, or sub-clinical inflammation, are involved. Diets with a low glycaemic index (GI) have proven beneficial in prevention and treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, a whole grain diet has shown similar benefits adjunct to these diseases. Less is known regarding the effect of GI or other food characteristics on cognitive function. However, due to the significant differences in postprandial blood glucose profiles after a high- compared with a low-GI meal, cognitive functions during the postprandial phase could be expected to differ depending on the choice of carbohydrate food and time point in the postprandial phase. The purpose of the present thesis was to evaluate the importance of GI features and/or contents of indigestible carbohydrates of cereal products on glycaemic regulation, metabolic risk markers, and cognitive function in healthy subjects. The test products were either evaluated in the acute postprandial phase, or following one or two subsequent standardised meals. The results of the present thesis show that certain cereal products, with low GI and/or with a specific mixture of resistant starch (RS) and dietary fibre (DF) have the capacity to reduce glucose response not only in the acute phase, but also the incremental blood glucose responses following two consecutive meals {{during the course of a}} whole day, and in the perspective from a late evening meal to a subsequent breakfast. Boiled barley- and <b>rye</b> <b>kernels,</b> or a white wheat bread (WWB) added with RS and barley DF in an amount similar to that in barley kernels, possessed such properties. It was concluded that the GI features of the cereal based breakfast was the major determinant of glycaemia at the subsequent standardised lunch. Instead, improved glycaemic regulation within a 10. 5 ? 12. 5 h perspective post the cereal test meal was associated with increased levels of colonically derived metabolites (e. g. plasma short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)), suggesting the involvement of colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates present in the test meal. A lowering of circulating FFAs was identified as a major factor for the improvements seen in glucose tolerance in the perspective from an evening test meal to breakfast. In addition, serum IL- 6 was reduced and plasma adiponectin increased at breakfast following a barley kernel based evening meal, compared with an evening with white wheat bread (WWB). The barley kernel evening meal thus improved glucose tolerance and improved markers of inflammation and insulin sensitivity. Following the evening test meals, markers of colonic fermentation (breath H 2) at breakfast were negatively correlated to the gastric emptying rate (GER) and positively correlated to satiety. A negative correlation was seen between GER and satiety post the breakfast. Further, the concentrations of SCFAs and GLP- 1 were negatively correlated to the blood glucose response at breakfast. It is suggested that cereal products which promote colonic fermentation and GLP- 1 release improve glucose tolerance and satiety in an overnight perspective. The findings in the thesis provide evidence for a link between the gut microbial metabolism and key factors associated with improved insulin sensitivity. Further, the data obtained indicates that impaired cognitive function may be an early manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, since a significant decline in cognitive performance was displayed in middle-aged subjects with lower glucose tolerance, albeit still within a normal range. In addition, it was shown than a breakfast with low-GI features i. e. avoidance of a rapid decline in glycaemia (at 90 min), and maintenance of a net blood glucose increment in the late postprandial phase (at 170 min), was associated with improvements in measures of cognitive function (working memory and selective attention, respectively) at these time points. The results in the thesis provide information to be used for tailoring of low-GI whole grain products, which facilitate glycaemic regulation and related parameters over the course of several meals, with beneficial implications on metabolic risk factors, weight control, and cognitive function...|$|E
