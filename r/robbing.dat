40|$|Robertsonian translocations (<b>ROBs)</b> have an {{estimated}} incidence rate of 1 / 1000 births, making {{this type of}} rearrangement the most common structural chromosomal abnormalities seen in the general population. In this study, we reports 872 cases of <b>ROBs</b> from 205, 001 specimens karyotyped postnatally in a single accredited laboratory in China, including 583 balanced <b>ROBs,</b> 264 unbalanced <b>ROBs,</b> 9 mosaic <b>ROBs,</b> and 18 complex <b>ROBs.</b> Ninety-three percent of the balanced <b>ROBs</b> observed were adults with infertility, miscarriage, or offspring(s) with known chromosomal abnormalities. Significant excess of females {{were found to be}} carriers of balanced <b>ROBs</b> with an adjusted male/female ratio of 0. 77. Ninety-eight percent of the unbalanced <b>ROBs</b> observed were children with variable referral reasons. Almost all of the unbalanced <b>ROBs</b> involved chromosome 21 except a single <b>ROB</b> with [46,XX,der(13; 14),+ 13] identified in a newborn girl with multiple congenital anomalies. Multiple novel <b>ROB</b> karyotypes were reported in this report. This study represents the largest collections of <b>ROBs</b> in Chinese population...|$|R
5|$|The {{player can}} {{fight with a}} knife {{received}} {{early in the game}} and later with firearms that feature auto-aim. There are also sequences where the player can snipe enemies with a sniper rifle. Enemies do not hide {{due to a lack of}} a cover system. The player can earn money by finishing missions and <b>robbing</b> pedestrians, which can then be used to buy food, weaponry, spray paint, and accessories for the character's home. The mobile game features minigames for <b>robbing</b> pedestrians, stealing, and hijacking vehicles. While <b>robbing,</b> the player taps happy and angry face icons to terrorize the victim into giving more money. When stealing, a Tetris clone lets the player fit more items into the truck, and the carjacking minigame lets the player earn more money for scaring the captive passenger by driving at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|Abbott avoided capture until 1995, {{committing}} various robberies as {{he moved}} across Australia. He also escaped from a Queensland prison after two years and returned to Western Australia, allegedly <b>robbing</b> the Commonwealth Bank's Mirrabooka branch.

5|$|Anderson {{and his men}} {{rested in}} Texas for several months before {{returning}} to Missouri. Although he learned that Union General Egbert B. Brown had devoted significant attention to the border area, Anderson led raids in Cooper and Johnson County, Missouri, <b>robbing</b> local residents. On June 12, Anderson and 50 of his men engaged 15 members of the Missouri State Militia, killing and <b>robbing</b> 12. After the attack, one of Anderson's guerrillas scalped a dead militiaman. The next day, in Southeast Jackson County, Anderson's group ambushed a wagon train carrying members of the Union 1st Northeast Missouri Cavalry, killing nine. The attacks prompted the Kansas City Daily Journal of Commerce to declare that rebels {{had taken over the}} area. Anderson and his men dressed as Union soldiers, wearing uniforms taken from those they killed. In response, Union militias developed hand signals to verify that approaching men in Union uniforms were not guerrillas. The guerrillas, however, quickly learned the signals, and local citizens became wary of Union troops, fearing that they were disguised guerrillas.|$|E
50|$|Despite that, <b>Rob</b> {{still wanted}} to be with Lucy and Lucy gave him one last chance. Dermot told <b>Rob</b> that he had money {{problems}} and <b>Rob</b> planned to <b>rob</b> a drug dealer's lock up. <b>Rob</b> had taken Lucy and Carol Groves as alibis and the robbery was going according to plan, but the dealer caught them. <b>Rob,</b> Dermot, Carol, and Lucy all managed to escape, but they were chased by the dealer. Despite Lucy and Carol's protests to stop the car, <b>Rob</b> continued and lost control. The car ended up in the River Dee, but they survived, apart from Dermot. Lucy then confessed all to the police, but the police had little to arrest <b>Rob</b> on. <b>Rob's</b> problems went from bad to worse when Kurt, Jambo Bolton, Lucy, and Carol Groves followed <b>Rob</b> on a night's 'work' in the hope that he might incriminate himself. When they finally caught up with him, they personally delivered <b>Rob</b> to the drug dealers from whom <b>Rob</b> had stolen money. The dealers ended up throwing <b>Rob</b> off the roof of a car park, injuring one of <b>Rob’s</b> legs. <b>Rob</b> blamed Kurt for this and vowed to get revenge. <b>Rob</b> became homeless, but Susi Harrison felt sorry for him and allowed him to stay at her house.|$|R

His father (named Robert), and <b>Rob</b> have {{recently}} moved to Lister, Florida, {{after the death of}} <b>Rob’s</b> mother, Caroline. <b>Rob</b> is quiet and often is bullied at school. Things begin to change when <b>Rob</b> discovers a tiger in the forest (locked up in a cage) while wandering the woods. He then meets a girl named Sistine Bailey who has recently moved nearby. <b>Rob</b> shows Sistine the tiger. <b>Rob,</b> who usually keeps his feelings locked away begins to involuntarily open up emotionally to Sistine. Though Sistine insists on letting the tiger go, <b>Rob</b> is wary of what will happen to it if he does. <b>Rob</b> finally relents and releases the tiger, letting it run into the woods. However, just moments later, <b>Rob's</b> father shoots the tiger dead. At the tiger's funeral, Sistine recites a part of William Blake's The Tyger. <b>Rob</b> and his father confront their unresolved feelings about <b>Rob's</b> mother and <b>Rob</b> begins looking forward to going to school with Sistine.|$|R
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark <b>robbing</b> an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him <b>robbing</b> multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the ruins of a small {{satellite}} pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both have been heavily affected by stone <b>robbing,</b> which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the Saite (664–525 BCE) and Persian (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.|$|E

5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew.

He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an armed {{rebellion}}. The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. As word of the rebellion spread across the frontier, {{a whole series of}} loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including <b>robbing</b> the mail, stopping court proceedings, and the threat of an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised as women assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with tar and feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend of George Washington.|$|E

5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar <b>robbing</b> kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E
