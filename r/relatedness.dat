5|$|According to {{inclusive}} fitness theory, organisms {{can gain}} fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, {{but also that}} of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when Cost < <b>Relatedness</b> * Benefit. The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual <b>relatedness</b> structure.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average <b>relatedness</b> between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker <b>relatedness</b> and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The <b>relatedness</b> among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon for them to have a degree of <b>relatedness.</b> In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system of E. coli, but {{not based on}} evolutionary <b>relatedness,</b> is by serotype, {{which is based on}} major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common laboratory strain has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.|$|E
5|$|A third popular iteration-based method called MUSCLE (multiple {{sequence}} alignment by log-expectation) improves on progressive methods with a {{more accurate}} distance measure to assess the <b>relatedness</b> of two sequences. The distance measure is updated between iteration stages (although, in its original form, MUSCLE contained only 2-3 iterations depending on whether refinement was enabled).|$|E
5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of <b>relatedness</b> to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of DNA sequences suggests that V.surrecta {{belongs to the}} Volvariella pusilla group—a grouping of related Volvariella species that produce small, white fruit bodies. In this analysis, V.surrecta formed a subclade with V.hypopithys. Almost 90 years earlier, Paul Konrad and André Maublanc recognized the <b>relatedness</b> of these species, and proposed that V.surrecta {{should be considered a}} subspecies of V.hypopithys.|$|E
5|$|The common wasp, Vespula vulgaris, {{engages in}} worker policing, {{and it is}} known that a {{significant}} number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that <b>relatedness</b> may not be the key factor in the development of worker policing. Rather, it is hypothesized that worker policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the <b>relatedness</b> of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent <b>relatedness</b> but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{the worker}} shares {{half of her}} genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a {{conflict}} where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable <b>relatedness</b> to nephews.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans are haplodiploid insects, as {{are other}} Polistes species {{including}} Polistes metricus, Polistes dominula, and Polistes annularis. This means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm, and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis. This has consequences for genetic <b>relatedness</b> within colonies, since sisters receive identical sperm if {{they share a}} father, and the normal half identical contribution from the mother. This results in sex-biased conflicts between the queen and the workers {{with respect to the}} sex ratio, with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio, and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{populations of}} horses in {{isolated}} areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally {{have been proven}} to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic {{studies have shown that}} the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of <b>relatedness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of <b>relatedness</b> of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
5|$|The {{species in}} Calostoma have been {{collected}} in regions of deciduous, temperate, tropical or subtropical forests, containing tree species from the families Fagaceae, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae, and Dipterocarpaceae. The type species C.cinnabarinum was shown to form ectomycorrhizae with Quercus species, using isotopic labeling, molecular and morphological analyses. Southeast Asian Calostoma have also been described as ectomycorrhizal. Calostoma sarasinii forms ectomycorrhizae with species of Lithocarpus (Fagaceae) while Calostoma retisporum forms ectomycorrhizae with species from the Myrtaceae. The ectomycorrhizal mode of nutrition is predominant in the Sclerodermatineae suborder. Historically, it had been assumed to be saprobic, due to its taxonomic uncertainly, and presumed <b>relatedness</b> to other saprobic fungi like the stalked puffballs and the earthstars.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of <b>relatedness</b> between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E
5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of <b>relatedness</b> of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, host specificity decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social <b>relatedness.</b> The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{earliest}} primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades (groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the <b>relatedness</b> between primate lineages {{and the amount of}} time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90mya, nearly 40million years before the first examples of which appear in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle, Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the soil surface) genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their <b>relatedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the most}} basic level, the {{presence}} of geographic population structure can be revealed by comparing the genetic <b>relatedness</b> of viral isolates to geographic <b>relatedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In D. maculata, queens {{mate with}} only one male which results in a worker <b>relatedness</b> of 0.75, whereas the <b>relatedness</b> between the queen and worker is only 0.5.|$|E
25|$|Since P. exigua colonies {{consist of}} many queens, wasps {{within a given}} colony should be {{expected}} to have low <b>relatedness</b> among one another. However, cyclical oligogyny seems to help colonies maintain a higher level of <b>relatedness.</b> In cyclical oligogyny, new queens are only conceived after most of the colony’s queens have died. This late production of new queens guarantees that only a few queens from the previous generation participate. The <b>relatedness</b> among workers in P. exigua is 0.39, which is sufficient for wasps to exhibit worker behavior. Among queens from the same colony, 0.82 are genetically related. Therefore, queens demonstrate a significantly greater genetic <b>relatedness</b> than do workers from their same colony. Thus far, every epinonine species studied exhibits high <b>relatedness</b> among queens. This outcome of relation seems to {{play a crucial role in}} the wasp’s social behavior and in the colony’s success.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{effective}} mating frequency of D. norwegica queens is low, worker- worker <b>relatedness</b> {{is higher than}} worker-queen <b>relatedness.</b> Genetically speaking, this means that each worker is more related to other workers’ sons that the queen’s sons, creating worker queen conflict over reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Female workers forage to feed {{themselves}} and non-foragers, {{such as the}} queen, larvae, and males. They help to build the nest {{and care for the}} larvae. Workers may mate with males and remain inseminated even if they are never able to attain queenship and produce offspring. Worker-worker <b>relatedness</b> is not asymmetrically higher than <b>relatedness</b> between workers and males or workers and the queen. This is because of overlapping matrilines and patrilines within the colony which decreases <b>relatedness</b> overall between individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Relatedness</b> : Relationships with others, care, respect, knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Most Dolichovespula species {{including}} D. media mate {{only once}} or fertilize most eggs with sperm {{from a single}} male. In addition, there are only 1-2 queens per colony. These specific characteristics result in {{a high level of}} worker-worker <b>relatedness</b> within the colony. One study estimated this <b>relatedness</b> to be as high as 0.71. This was determined by analyzing 20 workers from each of 10 nests at 3 DNA microsatellite loci. The DNA analysis allowed the researchers to determine if males were queen’s or workers’ sons and from there calculate an estimated <b>relatedness.</b> There is evidence that workers in this species attempt to reproduce with about 4 reproducing workers per colony that sometimes lay eggs, however, only 7.4% of the male population are produced by the workers. It has been observed that the median wasp participates in worker policing where the queen or other workers throw worker laid eggs out of the nest or otherwise destroy them. All of this information helps to explain the high level of <b>relatedness</b> in the colony and that <b>relatedness</b> helps to explain the eusocial behavior of these wasps.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{originally}} {{suggested that}} high <b>relatedness</b> could arise in two ways: direct kin recognition between individuals or limited dispersal, or population viscosity, which can keep relatives together. The {{easiest way to}} generate <b>relatedness</b> between social partners is limited dispersal, a mechanism in which genetic similarity correlates with spatial proximity. If individuals do not move far, then kin usually surrounds them. Hence, any act of altruism would be directed primarily towards kin. This mechanism {{has been shown in}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, where cooperation is disfavored when populations are well mixed, but favored when there is high local <b>relatedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Self-determination theory relates {{intrinsic}} motivation to three needs: competence, autonomy, and <b>relatedness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Collect DNA {{samples from}} western bongos to {{calculate}} the <b>relatedness</b> of the two subspecies.|$|E
25|$|The median wasp, as in {{all other}} Hymenoptera species, {{produces}} females from fertilized diploid eggs, but males are produced from unfertilized haploid eggs. This means that although workers are unable to mate they can still produce male offspring. This type of sex determination is known as haplodiploidy. The result is that brothers have a <b>relatedness</b> of 0.5 as expected of full siblings, but sisters have a higher <b>relatedness</b> of 0.75. Sisters receive half of their mother’s genes {{as well as all}} their father’s genes because all of the sperm he produces are identical. Mothers have a <b>relatedness</b> of 0.5 to both their sons and daughters.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>relatedness</b> differs in haplodiploid species, {{the effects}} of kin {{selection}} are predicted to differ {{from that of a}} diploid species. V. pensylvanica is a haplodiploid species. Thus, female offspring have a 0.75 <b>relatedness</b> to their sisters, but only a 0.25 <b>relatedness</b> to their brothers. As a result, kin selection posits that workers will be more inclined to show altruistic behavior toward sisters than brothers. Further, this implies that a conflict over sex ratio may result, with workers preferring their mothers to have daughters. Because the mother is related equally to sons and daughters, kin selection predicts the mother will not show a preference toward either sex.|$|E
25|$|P. carolina, {{like many}} eusocial insects, follows a haplodiploidy sex {{determination}} system, meaning males are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs, while females are diploid and develop from fertilized eggs. Daughters share one identical allele from their haploid father and receive the other allele from their diploid mother's two alleles. This knowledge allows {{determination of the}} <b>relatedness</b> among individuals via algorithms and computer programs such as <b>Relatedness</b> 4.2 and Kinship 1.1.2. Due to this system of reproduction, genetic <b>relatedness</b> among nestmate foundresses is about 0.75. Mating males, however, {{are not related to}} other males, nor are they related to the females with which they mated.|$|E
25|$|Colonies of P. gallicus {{have one}} queen that mates and {{produces}} offspring. All females, both workers and queens, {{are capable of}} producing male offspring, and have a genetic incentive to do so; mother-to-son <b>relatedness</b> is 1/2, while the <b>relatedness</b> of a worker to her brothers is 1/4. If the queen has only been mated once, then worker's <b>relatedness</b> to the male offspring of other workers is 3/8, meaning workers should favor male production by themselves and their sisters over production by the queen. However, in {{the case that the}} queen mates more than once, workers are actually more related to their brothers than compared to the offspring of other workers (a mixture of full and half sisters).|$|E
25|$|Because swarm-founding colonies {{can contain}} {{more than one}} {{egg-laying}} queen, they tend to challenge the kin selection theory and typically do not meet Hamilton’s rule of haplodiploid species mentioned in the introduction. In comparison to other swarm-founding species, these theories are challenged further in R. romandi. R. romandi colonies are extremely large, and can have an average of up to 400 queens at any one time. The average for other swarm-founding species is only around 20 queens. Having such {{a large number of}} queens decreases the genetic <b>relatedness</b> within the nest. Workers in R. romandi have a genetic <b>relatedness</b> of only 0.16, and queens have a genetic <b>relatedness</b> of only 0.34. The next lowest genetic <b>relatedness</b> among a swarm founding species is found in Polybia emaciata 's 0.24 among workers and 0.55 among queens. These numbers indicate a large deviation from Hamilton’s ¾ rule. Independent-founding species, with fewer queens, {{are much more likely to}} be more genetically related.|$|E
25|$|For sexually {{reproducing}} populations, {{studies have}} shown that single-celled bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. Passaging a population through a single-celled bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a single-celled bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals. Further studies using Dictyostelium discoideum suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high <b>relatedness.</b> Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low <b>relatedness</b> may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to kin selection. The studies with D. discoideum showed that conditions of high <b>relatedness</b> resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low <b>relatedness,</b> suggesting the importance of high <b>relatedness</b> to resist mutations from proliferating.|$|E
