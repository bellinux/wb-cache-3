40|$|We applied AFM {{to study}} biomolecular wires, both out of {{interest}} in thei r biological functions and {{in the framework of}} nanotechnology based fabr ication. We have focused on two different kinds of protein wires: Insuli n fibrils and microtubules. Microtubules are an important constituent of the cytoskeleton and fulfill multiple vital functions in the cell. Insu lin fibrils on the other hand are amyloid fibrils without a clear biolog ical role, but with intriguing polymerization properties that make them an interesting model system for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Both p rotein wires are formed by a self-assembly process and have robust struc tural properties, which make them interesting candidates to act as a tem plate for the formation of metal wires. A first part of this thesis deals with the characterization of the compl ex substructure of insulin fibrils. The multipathway polymerization proc ess of insulin results in fibrils that can be divided into two groups, e ach characterized by a different structural motif: Helical fibrils compo sed of protofilaments, and chains of rod-like segments. We observed both types of structures with AFM in great detail. The helical fibrils exist with a large variety of periodicities and heights, indicating that they can be formed by different numbers of protofilaments. These protofilame nts cannot directly be distinguished in the fibrils and their number has to be inferred from the height of the fibril. By studying defective hel ical fibrils that have frayed into their individual protofilaments, we w ere able to distinguish the individual protofilaments, confirming the fi bril substructure. This led to the observation that the protofilaments t hat constitute a helical fibril exhibit a periodicity themselves, which is not observed in protofilaments that are not involved in the formation of a helical fibril. The assembly of the fibrils was observed to occur in a hierarchical way: Two protofilaments twist around each other to for m a pair, and two pairs then twist around each other to form a 4 -filamen t fibril. Another important assembly pathway leads to insulin fibrils consisting o f rod-like segments that are associated in a head to tail fashion. We we re able to elucidate this polymerization pathway with high-resolution AF M. Strikingly, all of the rod-like segments are uniform in size within o ne fibril, but differ greatly in size between different fibrils. This in dicates the importance of lateral interactions in the nucleation of cons ecutive segments: A once formed segment is involved in the formation of more segments that have similar shapes and dimensions. Some of the segme nts reveal a substructure that consists of a narrow lateral protrusion t owards one side {{along the length of the}} segment. Remarkably, this protru sion was observed on segments in different fibrils, independent of their size, implying that the substructure of the segments is a characteristi c of this insulin polymerization pathway. The fibrils that are polymerized from B-chain insulin are quite differen t from the complex polymorphism of fibrils polymerized from native insul in. Our measurements revealed two types of fibrils: Small, simple filame nts with a height around 2. 2 nm and thick, helical fibrils with heights between 5. 5 and 8. 0 nm. These two fibril types do not seem to interact w ith each other and we could not observe any substructure in the larger f ibrils. This indicates that, in contrast to the case of native insulin f ibrils, the thick helical fibrils are not composed of the thin filaments. Instead, both fibril types may result from different polymerization pa thways, whose occurrence depends on insulin concentration and the presen ce of a denaturating agent. Microtubules and their interaction with MAPs were the subject of a fruit ful collaboration with the Laboratory of Experimental Genetics and Trans genesis, the Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and the Laboratory of Biomolecular Dynamics. In the framework of this collaboration, we succe eded in direct visualization with AFM of microtubules conjugated with no rmal and mutated forms of the protein tau in different phosphorylation s tates. These different tau forms were made available and their binding t o microtubules was tested. Subsequently, the microtubule-tau complexes w ere deposited on substrates that are suitable for AFM, and then imaged t o observe directly how the tau is attached to the microtubule walls. The effect of hyperphosphorylation of tau was evident, as the massive detac hment of tau from the microtubules resulted in unfolding of the microtub ules and damage to their structure. Our AFM images also elucidate the me chanism behind the good binding of the mutant tau-P 301 L to microtubules. This binding was rather unexpected because the P 301 L-mutation is known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We observed that the mutat ed tau appears to bind to the microtubule walls in the form of large, so lid tau aggregates. Our direct visualization with AFM of individual micr otubule-tau complexes thus proved to be complementary to more standard b iochemical characterization techniques and provided new insights in the interactions of microtubules with the protein tau. Another important part of this thesis was related to the metallization o f protein wires. Our approach to metallization essentially consisted of two steps: First, metal particles with sizes of a few nanometers were at tached to the walls of the protein template. In a second step these smal l particles were enlarged by silver enhancement. We explored several way s to attach the initial metal particles to the protein template, includi ng direct attachment of preformed gold colloids and electroless plating by reduction of silver or palladium ions. Gold colloids with sizes of 10 nm were found to readily attach to insulin fibrils and microtubules. Go ld particles do, however, not bind to the substrates. We observed that i nsulin fibrils or microtubules which are densely covered with gold collo ids adhere badly to the substrate. Uncovered stretches of the biomolecul e are required to anchor the metal-biomolecule complex to the substrate, limiting the density of gold colloids on the template that can be achie ved. The best results were obtained by incubating insulin fibrils with A g+ ions, followed by their immobilization on a substrate and subsequent application of a NaBH 4 <b>reduction</b> <b>bath.</b> After optimalization of the param eters of the reaction, this procedure resulted in fibrils that are dense ly covered with silver particles with sizes of a few nanometers. Our met allization technique proved very efficient in comparison with other appr oaches reported in literature. The stabilization provided by the substra te during the reduction process ensures a high yield of densely covered, individual fibrils. High resolution TEM images, provided by the EMAT gr oup, University of Antwerp, revealed that the silver particles are organ ized in a helical way. This indicates that the metal particles bind to t he insulin fibrils at specific binding sites and adopt the helical struc ture of the template. The arrangement of the silver particles was verifi ed with circular dichroism, an optical technique that is sensitive to ch iral structures. Upon irradiation with UV light, the metallized insulin fibrils displayed a circular dichroism band at wavelengths just below 40 0 ~nm. This wavelength region is characteristic for the light absorption by small silver particles in optical experiments. The presence of the ci rcular dichroism band nicely confirms the helical arrangement of the sil ver particles. Next, the insulin fibrils that were densely covered with small silver pa rticles were enlarged further by application of silver enhancer. This re sulted in fibrils that are coated with a silver layer that is about 50 n m thick, which is continuous as far as can be judged from AFM images. Ho wever, our electrical conductance measurements only reveal a very poor c onductivity of the metallized fibrils. Two typical results were obtained with the conductance measurements: Next to fibrils that exhibited a lin ear behavior with resistance values of several GOhm at low voltages, als o fibrils with asymmetric I-V characteristics and a zero current plateau around zero bias were observed. These results indicate that the silver enhancement is not sufficient to enlarge the particles to form continuous wires. Charging effects of the silver particles may explain the nonlinear shape of the I-V curves. Also, contamination and oxidation effects at the intergrain boundaries may c omplicate the conductivity of the chains of silver particles. The metall ized fibrils proved to be very sensitive to changes caused by currents t hat can flow at high voltages and to voltage peaks during the connection of the sample to large contact pads by ultrasonic wire-bonding. Thermal ly induced displacement of the silver particles could be observed with A FM after the conductance measurements. Increasing the silver enhancement time might solve these problems, but will lead to considerably thicker and more irregular wires. Reports in literature suggest that a better so lution may be provided by the application of gold enhancement to the sil ver particles, which covers them with a gold layer that is insensitive t o oxidation effects. Another interesting possibility to probe the electrical properties of th e metallized fibrils is to the study the response of the wires to voltag es applied at different frequencies (10 kHz < f < 10 MHz). A pplying an oscillating voltage to the wires induces displacement current s, which are much less hampered by a finite distance between the Ag nano particles or by oxidation of the interfaces between adjacent particles. First results indicate that the capacitance of the wires can be determin ed as a function of frequency. A typical value for the capacitance C is 3. 8 pF. Using the frequency dependent capacitance, the dielectric consta nt of the material separating the particles can be determined, providing new interesting insights in the electrical properties of the biotemplat ed nanowires. Outlook Several obstacles complicate the use of metal-biomolecule hybrid structu res for nanotechnological applications. Insulin fibril fit the requireme nt of a thin self-assembling template as they have a diameter of a few n anometers and are formed through a simple polymerization process. We dem onstrated that the fibrils can be very densely covered with metal partic les by electroless plating, while the fibrils stay intact and can be ret rieved in large numbers. The limiting factor seems to be the further tre atment that is needed to turn the wires, which essentially consist of a chain of silver nanoparticles, into a continuous wire with a good conduc tance. Extensive silver enhancement and gold toning will be needed to ob tain wires with a low resistance, resulting in a considerable increase o f the wire diameter. The dimensions of the nanostructures that can be produced with this biot emplating methods are in the same range as the dimensions that can be ac hieved with state-of-the-art lithographic techniques. Another valuable n on-biological approach to the production of nanoscale electronic compone nts is offered by carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes possess unique elec trical and structural properties that potentially make them usefull in n anotechnology and nanoelectronics. Depending on subtle variations in the ir structure, they can be metallic or semiconducting. Therefore, the use of biomolecules as a template to grow continuous meta l wires that can be used as interconnects between functional components may be less favorable. Instead, the main benefit of using biomolecules l ies in the creation of nanodevices by exploiting the self-assembly and n atural functions of proteins. Biomolecules do show great promise because of their ability to assemble small yet regularly sized and spaced structures that can act as a templa te to build up structures from inorganic materials, which cannot self as semble themselves. They may also be applied for the production of device s that consist of many nanosize components that have to be precisely ord ered and connected, something which has proven difficult so far with top -down approaches, but which Nature may achieve with ease. An example is the use of protein cages: Three-dimensional protein structures with a ce ntral, enclosed hollow space (See review by J. Heddle). Inside these pro tein cages, a metal or semiconductor particles can be formed, which can function as a quantum dot and allow to fabricate extremely small electro nic components. Protein cages have been used to control the deposition o f inorganic particles on a surface. On the other hand, protein rings hav e been used to arrange metal particles in a well-ordered 2 D array on a s urface by exploiting the natural interactions between the rings. The con struction of a prototype MOS capacitor was demonstrated by arranging pro tein rings filled with gold nanoparticles on a surface. In this respect, the helical organization of the silver particles on the insulin templat e that we observed may as well offer interesting possibilities. The application of high resolution TEM and electron tomography, in combi nation with AFM and optical techniques, offers excellent opportunities t o study the three-dimensional morphology of metal-protein hybrid structu res with unprecedented resolution. When combining these experimental tec hniques with simulations and ab initio calculations of the affinity for metallization of the different functional groups at the biomolecule surf ace, we may achieve a thorough understanding relevant to the mechanisms that govern the growth of such systems. This knowledge can be used to op timize the metallization process so that the properties of the metallic nanostructures may become controllable. In this framework, also biomolec ules different from insulin fibrils, such as peptide nanotubes, may be u sed as a template for metallization with different inorganic materials, including Pd, Pb and Au. This will allow us to select the metal-biomolec ule hybrid system with the most potential for further study, in order to eventually obtain a system that is ready for application in nanoelectro nics. status: publishe...|$|E

In all cases, electrical uncoupling could be blocked completely by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor polymyxin B.

The target of this work is to compare works on the effect of twisted nozzle, flow and lance height in the jet penetration by visual inspection and by energy balance that consider number of nozzles, vertical and twist angles. In the present work, lances with twisted nozzle angles, normal lances and special nozzle shape were used to describe the effects of jet on bath. Jet penetration and level of splashing were also available. For the four nozzles, the best result to reduce spitting was obtained at the twist angle, hard blow and high flow.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{roles of}} apical and basolateral {{transport}} mechanisms {{in the regulation}} of cell volume and the hydraulic water permeabilities (Lp) of the individual cell membranes of the Amphiuma early distal tubule (diluting segment) were evaluated using video and optical techniques as well as conventional and Cl-sensitive microelectrodes. TheLP of the apical cell membrane calculated per square centimeter of tubule is < 3 % that of the basolateral cell membrane. Calculated per square centimeter of membrane, the LP of the apical cell membrane is < 40 % that of the basolateral cell membrane. Thus, two factors {{are responsible for the}} asymmetry in theLP of the early distal tubule: an intrinsic difference in the LP per square centimeter of membrane area, and a difference in the surface areas of the apical and basolateral cell membranes. Early distal tubule cells do not regulate volume after a <b>reduction</b> in <b>bath</b> osmolality. Instead, they swell to an extent predicted from the change in osmolality.

40|$|The role of K+ {{channels}} in cell osmoregulation was investigated {{by using the}} patch-clamp technique. In cell-attached patches from Necturus proximal tubule, the short-open-time K+ channel at the basolateral membrane could be stretch-activated by pipette suction, where a negative pressure of 6 cm H 2 O (588. 6 Pa) was sufficient to increase the open probability of the channel {{by a factor of}} 4. 0 +/- 0. 8 (n = 7 tubules). A 50 % <b>reduction</b> in <b>bath</b> osmolarity increased cell volume by 66 +/- 10 % and increased the K+-channel open probability by a factor of 5. 8 +/- 1. 4 (n = 7) in the same cell-attached patches that were activated by pipette suction. A kinetic analysis indicates one open state and at least two closed states for this epithelial K+ channel. Both suction and swelling shorten the longest time constant of the closed-time distribution by a factor of 3, without significant effect on either the mean open time or the shorter closed-state time constant. The similar effect of suction and swelling is consistent with the hypothesis that stretch-activated K+ channels mediate the increase in macroscopic K+ conductance that occurs during osmoregulation of amphibian proximal tubules. Calculations based on a simple model indicate that small increments in cell volume could produce statistically significant increases in K+-channel activity...|$|R
40|$|Background and Problem discussion: In 2005 {{it became}} {{mandatory}} for all companies listed on stock exchanges within the EU to follow IFRS in their consolidated financial statements. This study examines whether companies better adopt the same accounting rules {{when it is}} presented in another context, i. e. when the standard is emitted by the IASB and enforced by the EU instead of the previous Swedish standard setting body. According to previous research mandatory adoption of IFRS has decreased earnings management level for French companies. Purpose: Our aim is to see if Swedish companies have changed their reporting of provisions after the mandatory adoption of IFRS in 2005, even though {{the content of the}} standard has not been changed. We want to establish whether mandatory adoption of IFRS contribute to a <b>reduction</b> of big <b>bath</b> accounting in terms of larger negative provisions in the year of an Executive change, negative results or extra large gains. Methodology: The thesis is based on a quantitative study and includes 223 companies. The data is collected from annual reports and the years tested are 2002 - 2010. Analysis and conclusion: Our result presents the existence of big bath accounting regarding provisions in Swedish companies. The study concludes that the mandatory adoption of IFRS by Swedish companies in 2005 contributes to the <b>reduction</b> of big <b>bath</b> accounting when it comes to larger negative provisions in the year of a CEO change, a negative result and an extra large gain. An important aspect {{is the fact that the}} content of the standard for provisions has not been changed during 2002 - 2010. However, the application of the standard has changed. One main reason might be that the accounting procedures came into greater focus when the EU decided to implement IFRS. Another reason might be the enforcement factor, both in regards to stronger legal enforcement in 2005 and the awareness of an evolving enforcement organization within the EU. According to our study, the big bath phenomenon has decreased in Sweden after the mandatory adoption of IFRS, which implies higher accounting quality...|$|R

Although LPC is a pro arrhythmic ischemic metabolite, {{the effect of}} LPLC on cardiac electrophysiology is unknown. At the lowest doses investigated, LPLC induced spontaneous contractions in otherwise quiescent rabbit ventricular myocytes significantly faster than LPC. Spontaneous contractions developed with median times of 16. 4 (n = 64), 27. 4 (n = 36), and 3 ̆e 60 min (n = 25) during exposure to 5, 2. 5, and 1 JlM LPLC compared with 38. 0 (n = 48) and 3 ̆e 60 min (n = 29) for 5 and 2. 5 JlM LPC, respectively.

In contrast, reducing the osmolality of the basolateral solution in the presence of luminal furosemide diminishes the magnitude of the increase in cell volume to a value below that predicted from the change in osmolality. This osmotic swelling is associated with a reduction in the intracellular Cl content. Hence, early distal tubule cells can lose solute in response to osmotic swelling, but only after the apical Na/K/Cl transporter is blocked. Inhibition of basolateral Na/K ATPase with ouabain results in severe cell swelling. This swelling in response to ouabain can be inhibited by the prior application of furosemide, which suggests that the swelling is due to the continued entry of solutes, primarily through the apical cotransport pathway...|$|R

The control solution contained only 80 % of the normal NaCl concentration, the remainder of the osmolality was made up by mannitol, a condition that did not significantly decrease the fluid absorption rate in gallbladder sac preparations. The osmotic gradient ranged from 11. 5 to 41 mosmol and was achieved by the addition or removal of mannitol from the perfusion solutions. The Lp of the apical membrane {{of the cell}} was 1. 0 X 10 (- 3) cm/s. osmol (Posm = 0. 055 cm/s) and that of the basolateral membrane was 2. 2 X 10 (- 3) cm/s. osmol (Posm = 0. 12 cm/s).

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{determined}} the current-voltage (I-V) {{relations of the}} apical and basolateral barriers of frog skins by impaling the cells with an intracellular microelectrode and assuming that the current across the cellular pathway was equal to the amiloride-inhibitable current. We found that: (a) The responses in transepithelial current and intracellular potential to square pulses of transepithelial potential (VT) varied markedly with time. (b) As a consequence of these transient responses, the basolateral I-V relation was markedly dependent {{on the time of}} sampling after the beginning of each pulse. The apical 1 -V plot was much less sensitive to the time of sampling within the pulse. (c) The I-V data for the apical barrier approximated the I-V relations calculated from the Goldman constant field equation over a relatively wide range of membrane potentials (± 100 mV). (d) A sudden <b>reduction</b> in apical <b>bath</b> [Na'] resulted in an increase in apical permeability and a shift in the apical barrier zero-current potential (Ea) toward less positive values. The shift in Ea was equivalent to a change of 45 mV for a 10 -fold change in apical [Na'].

40|$|The excitability of {{developing}} rat optic nerves {{has been studied}} under conditions in which extracellular Cl- was replaced with other anions. In nerves younger than 3 days old, replacing Cl- with propionate or SO 4 (2 -) usually led to spontaneous and repetitive cycling of extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o). [K+]o reached peaks of 8 - 12 mM and then fell transiently below the base-line level of 5 mM before increasing again. This cycling behaviour continued, with a wave-length of 1 - 2 min, {{for as long as}} 2 h. Nerves older than 5 days either did not cycle or did so only transiently. Substitution of ten different anions for Cl- indicated that a minimum hydrated radius, between that of BrO 3 - and HCO 3 -, was necessary to induce cycling behaviour. Cycling behaviour was abolished by the Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin. <b>Reduction</b> of the <b>bath</b> [K+] to 2. 5 mM slowed the frequency of spontaneous cycles; a bath [K+] of 1 mM abolished them. When the temperature was lowered, cycle frequency slowed. Substitution of large anions for Cl- enhanced axonal excitability. This was inferred from the prevalence of spontaneous action potentials during cycling behaviour, and from the generation of relatively large evoked increases of [K+]o. Cycling behaviour is hypothesized to result from a repetition of the following three processes: (i) spontaneous axonal firing elicits a gradual increase in [K+]o which increases axonal excitability and facilitates further K+ release, (ii) axonal firing and K+ release are eventually halted by a combination of depolarization block, intracellular Na+ accumulation and hyperpolarization from electrogenic pumping, (iii) recovery of [K+]o to its minimal value depends on active K+ reuptake mediated by a highly stimulated axonal Na+-K+-ATPase. We conclude that {{a large proportion of the}} resting membrane conductance of optic nerve fibres is Cl- specific. A high Cl- conductance may stabilize fine central axons against the depolarizing effects of [K+]o increases...|$|R
40|$|We {{used the}} patch-clamp {{technique}} {{to study the}} effects of ATP on the small-conductance potassium channel in the apical membrane of rat cortical collecting duct (CCD). This channel has a high open probability (0. 96) in the cell-attached mode but activity frequently disappeared progressively within 1 - 10 min after channel excision (channel "run-down"). Two effects of ATP were observed. Using inside- out patches, low concentrations of ATP (0. 05 - 0. 1 mM) restored channel activity in the presence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). In contrast, high concentrations (1 mM) of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reduced the open probability (Po) of the channel in inside-out patches from 0. 96 to 0. 1. 2 mM adenosine diphosphate (ADP) also blocked channel activity completely, but 2 mM adenosine 5 '-[beta,gamma- imido]triphosphate (AMP-PNP), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, reduced Po only from 0. 96 to 0. 87. The half-maximal inhibition (Ki) of ATP and ADP was 0. 5 and 0. 6 mM, respectively, and the Hill coefficient of both ATP and ADP was close to 3. Addition of 0. 2 or 0. 4 mM ADP shifted the Ki of ATP to 1. 0 and 2. 0 mM, respectively. ADP did not alter the Hill coefficient. <b>Reduction</b> of the <b>bath</b> pH from 7. 4 to 7. 2 reduced the Ki of ATP to 0. 3 mM. In contrast, a decrease of the free Mg 2 + concentration from 1. 6 mM to 20 microM increased the Ki of ATP to 1. 6 mM without changing the Hill coefficient; ADP was still able to relieve the ATP- induced inhibition of channel activity over this low range of free Mg 2 + concentrations. The blocking effect of ATP on channel activity in inside-out patches could be attenuated by adding exogenous PKA catalytic subunit to the bath. The dual effects of ATP on the potassium channel can be explained by assuming that (a) ATP is a substrate for PKA that phosphorylates the potassium channel to maintain normal function. (b) High concentrations of ATP inhibit the channel activity; we propose that the ATP-induced blockade results from inhibition of PKA- induced channel phosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{quantify}} spontaneous fluid transport {{across the}} isolated porcine ciliary epithelium and determine its {{sensitivity to the}} electrolyte transport inhibitors ouabain and bumetanide, as well as bath Cl- and HCO 3 - levels. METHODS. A complete annulus of ciliary body was mounted in a custom-designed chamber appropriate for quantifying net fluid movement, {{as well as the}} transepithelial potential difference (PD) across the in vitro ciliary epithelium. RESULTS. A spontaneous and stable fluid flow (FF) in the blood-to-aqueous direction was measured over a 4 -hour period. This flux solely reflected the secretory activity of the isolated ciliary epithelium (CE), given the absence of externally applied osmotic or pressure gradients. In contrast to FF, the PD declined during the 4 hours in vitro, suggesting that the integrity of the tight junctions may have been compromised during this time so that an increased movement of counter ions via the paracellular pathway could have shunted the PD, {{while at the same time}} transcellular fluid transport remained unaffected. The FF in the blood-to-aqueous direction (2. 3 ± 0. 2 μL/hr; n = 7) was eliminated by a unilateral <b>reduction</b> in the <b>bath</b> CP levels on the blood side of the preparation and restored on reintroducing the anion to the bathing medium. This linkage between FF and blood side [Cl-] is consistent with the existence of a net Cl- flux across the porcine CE in the same direction as the fluid transport. Addition of bumetanide to the blood-side bath inhibited FF by ≈ 40 %, whereas the removal of CO 2 /HCO 3 - from the blood-side bathing solution elicited a ≈ 50 % reduction in FF. Ouabain inhibited the FF from either side of the preparation, although the effects were more rapid when the glycoside was applied to the blood side of the tissue. Overall, these findings indicate the dependence of FF on active ionic transport by the isolated CE. CONCLUSIONS. Isolated porcine ciliary epithelial preparations transport fluid in the blood-to-aqueous direction, indicating that measurements of volumetric fluid flow across this preparation may serve as a suitable model for future studies directed toward the pharmacological control of secretion.
