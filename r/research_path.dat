A comparison of RJVs and licensing by non-cooperative firms shows that the latter {{may be unable to}} co-ordinate on complementary <b>research</b> <b>paths</b> whereas RJVs are always able to do this. This happens when the acquisition of absorptive capacity is costly. It is shown that the policies of promoting RJVs and subsidizing R&D are complementary, whereas either policy by itself may reduce welfare. Finally it is shown that costly absorptive capacity gives rise to a welfare loss that is very difficult to address. ...|$|R

Motivated by the assumptions that different nodes may move according to different mobility models and that the mobility behavior of a node may vary during time because of changes of its environment, we propose to let the nodes of a network move according to mobility models that are determined by the roles played by the nodes themselves. These roles, in turn, are determined by computing ecological role assignments of the graph induced by the communication network, in which, intuitively, the roles of the nodes in a particular node’s neighborhood ten...|$|R

The beginning of his scientific production was under Grioli’s scientific influence: Galletto worked {{on the topic of}} his laurea thesis, i.e. on the theory of continua having asymmetric stress characteristics.

In this theory, among other things, the stress tensor considered is no longer the Cauchy tensor or any similar, double symmetric tensor, but an asymmetric tensor that generalizes it: and this gives to the theory many further important structural peculiarities.|$|E
