50|$|The project aims {{to produce}} a model for {{standardised}} land registry output, connected to explanatory material in different languages, and to provide training to improve understanding of the different legal systems involved. The European Land Registry Association (ELRA) will work closely with other associations and networks working in this area. It will use the resources of ELRA’s European Land Registry Network(ELRN) and build on the experience gained from EULIS’s Project LINE (a project which aims to facilitate compliance {{with the requirements of}} the e-Justice programme in the area of land registration).The objective is to increase the accessibility and transparency of land registry information and to facilitate the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> cross-border <b>documents.</b> Varied legislation and practices of Land Registries hamper the exchange of information between them and the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> cross border <b>documents.</b> Any standard model has to take into account fundamental differences in national organisation. However, common points offer the possibility of defining a structure of key information shared by the majority of Land Registry systems.|$|R

40|$|Land {{administration}} {{is the process}} of determining, recording, and disseminating information on ownership, value and use of land when implementing land management, as stated by the UN ECE Guidelines on Land Administration. Focusing on these processes, one observes a growing importance of datacommunication as a supporting tool. On the determination side of the land administration process (input), strategic objectives such as faster services to the fast moving property market and to the public administration (tax offices, planning authorities) become possible by offering facilities for electronic conveyancing and easy map updating. Electronic conveyancing techniques such as electronic signatures, encryption, hash values, measures against bit-loss, are applied increasingly.

40|$|The recent {{economic}} and financial crisis has highlighted the propensity of markets to assess more the reliability of individual countries than their actual economy; in this perspective, {{the role of the}} notary in countries characterized by a system of legal security is crucial, because it is able to guarantee as much as possible the security of commercial transactions and to minimize litigation. Not only do individuals gain from this, including the most vulnerable, but the entire country also benefits. This is what inspired the present work, in which has been explored the issue, usually neglected by manuals, of the function performed by the notary, also concerning the reinforcing of the role through the use of new technologies, and all the problems that arise from such use, especially concerning security. In addition, a specific question was analysed, the answer to which is closely linked to the approach chosen to adhere to the more general issue of the legal form of notarial functions, namely the question of the nature of notarial tax liability in respect of obligation to pay the registry tax. This is particularly relevant in view of the consequences of the adoption of the various doctrinal and jurisprudential guidelines produced in relation to the proposability of any requests or legal actions for reimbursement by the notary in case the payment of registry tax exceeds the amount of tax actually due and, given the introduction of legislation in our legal system concerning the computerized <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> there is also the problem of identifying what impact such an introduction may have had on the nature of notarial tax liability in such situations...|$|R
40|$|Formation {{of joint}} ventures between {{construction}} companies {{is one of}} the recent efforts in combating contractors problems in Tanzania and addresses one of the key challenges facing the construction industry today in the country especially when large and complex projects are involved. The main objective of the research is to examine the formation of joint ventures in Tanzania, specifically to: study joint ventures formation procedures; identify criteria in selection of joint venture partner; and identify risks associated with and challenges facing joint venture undertakings in Tanzania. The study adopted a descriptive research design and purposive sampling. Multiple sources of evidence was used to collect information mainly literature review, questionnaires and interviews. Key findings reveal that legal and statutory requirements in the formation of joint ventures include registration by Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA), Contractors Registration Board (CRB) and under <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Documents</b> Act (RDA). All JV respondents were registered by BRELA and CRB which are mandatory but only 7 were registered by RDA. Most important factors considered during formation of JVs are: contract agreement, financial stability and commitment while key risks associated with JVs are cultural and social differences, delays in approvals and financial risks. In addition, main challenges facing joint ventures are: identification of possible risks and joint venture agreement interpretation. The study concludes that formation of JVs have been addressing some of emerging challenges facing local construction organizations despite the risks and challenges that exist. The study recommends that firms entering joint ventures should explore the benefits of registering with RDA and ensure risks associated with their JV are properly assessed. The study also recommends introduction of an incentive scheme through Tanzania Investment Centre to grant tax relief for foreign contractors going into joint venture with local construction firms...|$|R
