We propose a new mechanism for motivating participation in interest-based online communities, which engages non-contributing members (lurkers) by modeling and visualizing the asymmetrical relations formed when reading, evaluating, or commenting other community member’s contributions. The mechanism is based on ideas from open user modeling, a new concept of “community energy, ” with a mechanism of rating contributions and visualizing the rank of contributions in the <b>community</b> <b>interface.</b> ...|$|R

This paper takes a critical look at issues plaguing the continent’s state of underdevelopment and argues that only the people can fashion their development path taking into cognisance the advantages of being a late-comer to the development process. These advantages can best be exploited with visionary leaders, respon-sive civil society and a cooperative international community working in tandem with progressive governments. Africa needs an enabling democratic environment, an environment where governments puts the interest of the poor first, pushing forward the virtues of democratic governance, partnership, participation and benefit-sharing among the key stakeholders: state–civil society–private sector and international <b>community</b> <b>interface.</b> It must at the same time avoid corrosive effects of corporate cronyism that promotes corruption and cynicism, which {{is at the heart of}} most governments in the continent.

Therefore, the state, people and international community must come together to address the problems of overdevelopment, underdevelopment, environmental destruction and poverty.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Much of the {{research}} on improving patient handovers has focused on enhancing communication within the hospital system, but there have been relatively few efforts aimed at addressing the challenges at the interface between the hospital and the primary care setting. METHODS: A qualitative thematic analysis using a clinical microsystems lens applied to 28 semi-structured key stakeholder interviews in the Netherlands. Data were organised into seven 'virtual' clinical microsystem datasets composed of patients, hospital-based physicians, hospital-based nurses and community-based general practitioners. RESULTS: Five themes that contributed to effective or ineffective handovers emerged from our analysis: (1) lack of adequate information; (2) healthcare professionals' availability and opportunity for personal contact; (3) feedback, teaching and protocols related to handovers; (4) information technology facilitated communication solutions; and (5) the role and responsibility of patients. Our analysis suggests that each healthcare professional attempted to provide the best care possible, but did this largely in isolation, and without the benefit of the knowledge and expertise of {{the other members of the}} microsystem. CONCLUSIONS: The microsystem approach offers an innovative organisational construct and approach to assess the gaps in 'hospital to community' patient handovers, by viewing the hospital to the <b>community</b> <b>interface</b> as a clinical microsystem continuum. Our application of the microsystem approach confirms and extends earlier findings about the impact of barriers on the continuity and safety of patient transitions and their impact on the quality of patient care...|$|R

40|$|Aims of {{the study}} The aim of this thesis was to improve {{medication}} safety at the hospital <b>community</b> <b>interface</b> by generating a framework to identify the potential hazards in the current medication use process and devising a strategy to reduce them. Methods Mixed methods research was used. Healthcare record review was used to survey the potential hazards in the medication use process; interviews were used to obtain a broad perspective of the pharmacy workforce and services delivered at points around transfer of care and to explore the error vulnerabilities {{in the system and}} the attributes of the safety culture. The findings from all studies were integrated and triangulated to develop a framework to improve medication safety at points around transfer of care. Results Medication non-reconciliation on discharge from acute and public hospital care was common (50 % of inpatient episodes, 16 % of medications) and had the potential to cause moderate to severe harm (65 %) and medium to high potential to result in unplanned readmission to hospital (38 %). Primary care practitioners perceived that the deficits in communication and reconciliation limited their ability to ensure the appropriate use of medication. Delivery of evidence based clinical pharmacy services on admission and discharge was identified in the survey of chief hospital pharmacists as rare (Conclusions Medication non-reconciliation is common and has the potential to cause patient harm.

40|$|There is a {{pressing}} need for modeling of the symbiotic {{and at times}} dysbiotic relationship established between bacterial microbiomes and human mucosal surfaces. In particular clinical {{studies have indicated that}} the complex vaginal microbiome (VMB) contributes to the protection against sexually-transmitted pathogens including the life-threatening human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1). The human microbiome project has substantially increased our understanding of the complex bacterial communities in the vagina however, as is the case for most microbiomes, very few of the community member species have been successfully cultivated in the laboratory limiting the types of studies that can be completed. A genetically controlled ex vivo model system is critically needed to study the complex interactions and associated molecular dialog. We present the first vaginal mucosal culture model that supports colonization by both healthy and dysbiotic VMB from vaginal swabs collected from routine gynecological patients. The immortalized vaginal epithelial cells used in the model and VMB cryopreservation methods provide the opportunity to reproducibly create replicates for lab-based evaluations of this important mucosal/bacterial <b>community</b> <b>interface.</b> The culture system also contains HIV- 1 susceptible cells allowing us to study the impact of representative microbiomes on replication.

Further, we show the utility of the system to predict unwanted alterations in efficacy or bacterial community profiles following topical application of a front line antiretroviral...|$|R
