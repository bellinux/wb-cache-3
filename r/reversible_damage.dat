40|$|Dogs with {{naturally}} occurring aerobic or anaerobic bacterial overgrowth {{have been examined}} before and after antibiotic therapy {{in order to assess}} reversibility of damage to the jejunal mucosa. Histological changes in peroral jejunal biopsies were relatively minor before and after treatment, but sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed specific biochemical abnormalities that responded to antibiotic therapy. Aerobic overgrowth was initially associated with a marked loss of the main brush border component of alkaline phosphatase activity; this recovered following treatment, suggesting that aerobic bacteria may cause <b>reversible</b> <b>damage</b> to the hydrophobic region of the brush border membrane. In contrast, anaerobic overgrowth was initially associated with a marked reduction in brush border density, indicative of a considerable fall in the glycoprotein-to-lipid ratio of the membrane. Density increased from 1. 17 to 1. 21 g/ml after antibiotic therapy, consistent with recovery from this relatively severe damage to the brush border caused by anaerobic bacteria. Reductions in soluble and peroxisomal catalase activities which could compromise mucosal protection against free radicals in dogs with aerobic overgrowth, and a loss of particulate malate dehydrogenase activity indicative of mitochondrial disruption in dogs with anaerobic overgrowth, were also reversed after treatment. These findings indicate that aerobic and anaerobic bacterial overgrowth can result in contrasting but potentially <b>reversible</b> <b>damage</b> to the jejunal mucosa which would not be detected by conventional investigative procedures...|$|E

If the dementia can be diagnosed at its early stage, {{it is still possible}} to repair some <b>reversible</b> <b>damages</b> and thus slow down the process of irreversible damages, since evidences showed that the currently available medications for dementia, which can help people to maintain daily function and quality of life as well as stabilize cognitive decline, may be more beneficial if given early in the disease process. For instance, about 10 – 30  % of people with the mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is usually thought to be the incubation of AD in clinical practice, develop to AD every year, whereas the conversion rate of normal aging group is just 1 – 3  % [16].

40|$|Summary. A {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} germinal epithelium cells in rat testes rendered ischaemic {{for a period of}} 100 min was performed. This period of ischaemia produces a <b>reversible</b> <b>damage</b> to the process of spermatogenesis. Analysis of the testes at 2 -, 7 -, 14 - and 28 -day intervals after ischaemia, revealed damage to type A spermatogonia in stages XII and XIV, intermediate type A spermatogonia, type B spermatogonia and resting primary spermatocytes. The decrease in numbers, or absence of other cell types at the various time intervals after ischaemia was shown to be due to a maturation depletion process. In {{view of the fact that}} only cells undergoing mitosis or in the DNA-synthesizing period of meiosis were affected, it is suggested that germinal epithelium cells are most suscep-tible to ischaemia during this DNA-synthesis period...|$|E
40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{a methodology}} used {{to implement a}} data-driven strategy for Structural Health Monitoring. First, the instrumentation of the equipment is detailed by describing the main components to be installed in the test structure {{in order to produce}} guide d waves. Specifically, an active piezo active system is used for this purpose, which consists of piezoelectric devices attached to the test structure surface and an ac quisition system. Then, the programming procedure to embed the damage detection algorithm is defined. In particular, the mathematical foundations and software requirements for impleme nting the preprocessing stage, baseline model building, and statistical index computation are specified. As a result, the Odroid-U 3 computational core has the capability t o perform online damage assessment. Finally, some validation tests are presented through videos and short real time demonstration. Experimental data are recorded from two test specimens: i.) a lab carbon steel pipe loop built to emulate leak scenarios, and ii.) an aluminum plate, where mass adding is used to emulate <b>reversible</b> <b>damages.</b> The results reported i n this work show the high feasibility of the proposal methodology for obtaining an online embedded monitoring system with several advantages such as low cost, easy configuration, expandability and few computational resourcesPostprint (published version...|$|R

DOTC localized selectively within the mitochondria, as shown by colocalized fluorescence with rhodamine 123 (R 123). Photosensitization at 1 J/sq cm caused striking swelling of the mitochondrial matrix and disruption of the cristae, accompanied by loss of the ability of mitochondria to concentrate R 123. These changes progressed during the first hour after irradiation, and then were followed by partial recovery of mitochondrial ultrastructure and function. At no time were other organelles seen to be affected.

40|$|Abstract – The {{anterior}} {{approach to}} the spine offers several unique solution to problems posed by patients with thoracolumbar injuries. The major weight-bearing elements of the spine are anterior {{and this is the}} area where injured elements impinging on the spinal cord can cause significant but <b>reversible</b> <b>damage.</b> The two primary areas of concern for surgeons treating these patients are restoration of mechanical stability of the spinal column and restoration or preservation of neurologic function. Indications for anterior decompression, 1) a large retropulsed fragment with significant(> 50 %) canal compromise, 2) anterior col-umn comminution and marked kyphosis, and a time lapse of greater than 10 days from the time of injury. Anterior approaches are also recommended for the late treatment of symptomatic post-traumatic kyphosis that causes pain or neurologic deficit. The flexion-compression injuries addressed with anterior decompression and strut graft fusion require additional stability for satisfactory healing with maintenance of position assured during bone graft incorporation. Anterior instrumentation is most effective when balanced by an intact posterior ligamentous tension band...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound-guided ethanol {{injection}} (PEI) is {{an effective}} treatment of autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN) but {{little is known about}} the tissue lesions induced by alcohol. We report morphological changes of an AFTN which was removed after successful PEI treatment. At histological evaluation, the adenoma showed multiple areas of coagulative necrosis with eosinophilic ghost follicles, hemorrhages, small Vessel thrombosis and a wedge-shaped hemorrhagic infarction. The peripheral adenomatous tissue and the surrounding thyroid parenchyma were free of regressive changes and/or lympho-monocytic inflammatory reactions. Enzyme histochemistry confirmed the hyperfunctioning character of the lesion and showed reduction of succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c-oxydase activity in the viable tissue surrounding the central necrotic areas. By electron microscopy, the hyperfunctioning follicular epithelium showed submicroscopical alterations of the adenomatous cells surrounding the areas of coagulative necrosis. These results suggest that control of hyperthyroidism, after PEI, is due to: a) directly induced, irreversible damage (coagulative necrosis and vascular thrombosis with hemorrhagic infarction) in the central areas of the lesion; b) potentially <b>reversible</b> <b>damage</b> (reduction of intracellular enzyme activity and ultrastructural changes) in the peripheral areas...|$|E

Consecutive application of cisplatin alone appeared to be disadvantageous because it resulted in progressive body weight loss and higher mortality compared to the combined regimen, which used a smaller cisplatin dose. The combined regimen resulted in comparable hearing loss and hair cell loss but a markedly lower mortality. However, their coadministration failed to cause similar damage to spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), as seen in animals that received cisplatin alone. This difference suggests that the combined regimen did not mimic the damage to cochlear neuronal innervation caused by the clinical application of cisplatin.
