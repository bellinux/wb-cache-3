5|$|At the Corporatie, Vandersteen met a {{colleague}} whose wife worked at Bravo, a weekly Flemish comics magazine that appeared since 1936 {{and had a}} French-language version since 1940. Due to the war conditions, they were desperately in need of local artists to replace the American comics they used to publish. Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean Dratz, a young team was gathered, with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Laudy. Vandersteen joined in 1943, and here his comics career <b>really</b> <b>took</b> off. First he created Tori, a reprise of the prehistoric Tor, and {{a few weeks later}} his new comic Simbat de Zeerover (Simbat the Sailor) was published on the cover and in colour, a first for Vandersteen.|$|E
5|$|Ceasefire {{negotiations}} {{began in}} 1285, {{and ended with}} Narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in June 1286. The Burmese embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in January 1287, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty or the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government {{in exchange for the}} evacuation of Mongol troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never <b>really</b> <b>took</b> effect as Narathihapate was assassinated in July 1287, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung.|$|E
25|$|The post-war boom in filmmaking <b>really</b> <b>took</b> off, however, {{with the}} use of 16-mm colour-reversal film, which was easy to obtain and make films with. The vividly {{coloured}} films were popular with audiences as well, prompting dozens of new filmmakers to enter the business.|$|E

25|$|The third game on {{tour was}} against another provincial side, this time Auckland. Having won the toss, Bangladesh chose to bat; {{apart from a}} century from opener Tamim Iqbal none of the batsmen <b>really</b> <b>took</b> {{the chance to get}} in some batting practice. In response, Auckland {{overhauled}} the Bangladeshis total of 242 with ease, with Richard Jones top-scoring with 85 not out and each of the batsmen hitting at least one six in their innings.|$|E
25|$|It {{was with}} Barcelona that Figo's career <b>really</b> <b>took</b> off, winning the 199697 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, {{starring}} alongside Ronaldo, followed by successive Primera División titles {{where he was}} part of a formidable attack which included Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert. In total, Figo appeared 172 times in the league for Barcelona, scoring 30 goals. He was revered in Barcelona because his presence in a Barcelona shirt had given to Catalonia a sense of external approval.|$|E

25|$|The final scene's snowy {{landscape}} was filmed in New Zealand. The ending is deliberately ambiguous, {{and the audience}} is left with several questions: specifically, how much time has passed, if Dae-Su's meeting with the hypnotist <b>really</b> <b>took</b> place, whether he successfully lost the knowledge of Mi-do's identity, and whether he will continue his relationship with Mi-do. In an interview with Park (included with the European release of the film), {{he says that the}} ambiguous ending was deliberate and intended to generate discussion; it is completely up to each individual viewer to interpret what isn't shown.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, Yardley played {{regularly}} in that county's second eleven {{for two years}} before making his first-class debut against Nottinghamshire in August 1967; he made 3 and 4. Despite one further appearance that season, his first-class career only <b>really</b> <b>took</b> off in 1968, when he was a fixture in the first team from late July onwards, despite a modest top score of 43 not out from his 17 innings. 1969 was another mediocre season, but in 1970 Yardley really came good, making 762 first-class runs and averaging over 40.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many forms}} of {{football}} had been played across the world, it was only {{during the second half}} of the 19th century that these games began to be codified. In 1871, English clubs playing the version of football played at Rugby School which involved much more handling of the ball than in association football, met to form the Rugby Football Union. Many new rugby clubs were formed, and it was in the Northern English counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire that the game <b>really</b> <b>took</b> hold. Here rugby was largely a working class game, whilst the south eastern clubs were largely middle class.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 18th century, the {{production}} of sugar became increasingly mechanized. The steam engine first powered a sugar mill in Jamaica in 1768, and, soon after, steam replaced direct firing {{as the source of}} process heat. During the same century, Europeans began experimenting with sugar production from other crops. Andreas Marggraf identified sucrose in beet root and his student Franz Achard built a sugar beet processing factory in Silesia (Poland). However, the beet-sugar industry <b>really</b> <b>took</b> off during the Napoleonic Wars, when France and the continent were cut off from Caribbean sugar. In 2010, about 20 percent of the world's sugar was produced from beets.|$|E
25|$|When Edward the Confessor finally {{returned}} from his father's refuge in 1041, {{at the invitation of}} his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never <b>really</b> <b>took</b> root, but it is a typical example of Edward's attitude. He appointed Robert of Jumièges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event that resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.|$|E
25|$|Sales of {{fair trade}} {{products}} only <b>really</b> <b>took</b> {{off with the}} arrival of the first Fairtrade certification initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels. The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.|$|E

25|$|It was in São Paulo, however, {{where the}} sport <b>really</b> <b>took</b> hold, and the São Paulo Athletic Club (SPAC) remains the country's centre of cricket to this day. In 1894, Charles Miller, the Brazilian-born son of British parents, {{returned}} from his studies in England with a football and some cricket equipment, which he immediately used to introduce these sports to the locals. In 1888, the São Paulo Athletic Club was formed, and Charles was a key member, organizing São Paulo's first football and cricket matches at the club's ground in the Consolação district. Football soon caught on, and Charles is known throughout the country {{as the father of}} Brazilian football. From 1928 to 1947 the club's cricket matches were held at a ground in Pirituba, before moving to the current site in Veleiros (Santo Amaro), which also houses a collection of Brazilian cricket memorabilia.|$|E
25|$|Like {{his great}} uncle Ivo Peters, Beath's main passion {{in life was}} photography. His {{photographic}} subjects included {{a wide range of}} insects (especially beetles, butterflies and moths), amphibians and birds as well as the flora of tropical rainforests, which were the subject of his thesis. He was completely self-taught, and it was when studying for his PhD at The University of Aberdeen that his passion <b>really</b> <b>took</b> off. He joined the university's camera club and started to refine his photographic technique and also developed an interest in photographing Scottish landscapes. In the last decade he had focused photographing the natural landscapes in and around his hometown of Shrewsbury. He was a keen member of the Shropshire Photographic Society and was the club's competition secretary for several years. During 2010 he was commissioned to write a monthly feature about Shropshire photography through the seasons in Shropshire Life magazine.|$|E
25|$|Jointly with Meitner and his pupil and {{assistant}} Fritz Strassmann (1902–1980), Otto Hahn furthered the research begun by Enrico Fermi {{and his team}} in 1934 when they bombarded uranium with neutrons. Until 1938, {{it was believed that}} the elements with atomic numbers greater than 92 (known as transuranium elements) arose when uranium atoms were bombarded with neutrons. The German chemist Ida Noddack proposed an exception. She anticipated the paradigm shift of 1938/39 in her article published in the journal Angewandte Chemie, Nr. 47, 1934, in which she speculated:It is conceivable that when heavy nuclei are bombarded with neutrons these nuclei could break down into several fairly large fragments, which are certainly isotopes of known elements, but not neighbors of the irradiated elements.But no physicist or chemist <b>really</b> <b>took</b> Noddack's speculation seriously or tested it, not even Ida Noddack herself. The idea that heavy atomic nuclei could break down into lighter elements was regarded as totally inadmissible.|$|E

25|$|According to AL's claims, {{it carried}} out about 900 operations, killing 20,000 Germans, derailing 350 trains, and {{destroying}} 79 bridges. However, GL/AL exploits were significantly exaggerated by the communist propaganda in the People's Republic of Poland. Polish historian Piotr Gontarczyk estimates {{that only about}} 5–10% of officially recorded GL/AL action <b>really</b> <b>took</b> place, {{and that in the}} majority instances when GL/AL fought the German military it was when GL/AL was defending itself from German anti-partisan operations, with instances of GL/AL attacking Germans on its own initiative being very rare. Rather than engaging military targets, GL/AL preferred softer targets, such as German administration offices. That changed in 1944, when GL/AL grew stronger, and began engaging the German military more actively. According to Polish-American historian Mieczysław B. Biskupski, AL was less concerned with fighting the Germans than with fighting the Home Army. According to Gontarczyk and Janusz Marszal, however, this was relatively uncommon, at least with regards to direct actions; however GL/AL would often pass anonymous tips about AK to the Gestapo.|$|E
25|$|By 1978, {{there were}} 45 Crips gangs, called sets, {{operating}} in Los Angeles. They were {{heavily involved in}} the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Stanley Tookie Williams, a member of Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and then on August 8, 1979, Raymond Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips leadership was dismantled prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips which began causing nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Gangster Crips or Neighborhood Crips waging an all out war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980 the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The growth and power of the gang <b>really</b> <b>took</b> off in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets. In the early 1980s Crips sets began distributing crack cocaine in Los Angeles. The huge profits from distribution of crack cocaine induced many Crips to establish new markets in other cities and states. As a result, Crip membership grew steadily and by late 1980s {{it was one of the}} largest street gangs in the country. In 1999, there were at least 600 Crips sets with more than 30,000 members transporting drugs in the United States.|$|E
