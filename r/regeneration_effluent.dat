40|$|Excess Fluoride in {{drinking}} water is {{a cause for concern}} in several countries in the world. Various techniques have been developed to mitigate the harmful effects of fluoride. In the present work, a combined alum and activated alumina (AA) process has been investigated. Tap water with sodium fluoride dissolved in it to produce a solution having a fluoride concentration of 5 mg/L was used as the feed. It was found that pretreatment with alum extends the time required for the regeneration of the AA column. The volume of water treated increased by 89 % compared to AA process alone. Though the regeneration of the AA column has been well documented, subtle issues have ot been reported. The disposal of <b>regeneration</b> <b>effluent</b> is a concern in adsorption-based processes. This study aims to examine some of the issues involved in the regeneration of the AA column such as disposal of effluent, and the quantity of acid and alkali required. The <b>regeneration</b> <b>effluent</b> from the combined process, which had a fluoride concentration of 10 - 16 mg/L was treated in a solar still. The distillate from the still had a fluoride concentration of 2 - 3 mg/L, which is much lower than the concentration of the <b>regeneration</b> <b>effluent.</b> The cost of treatment decreased with each regeneration cycle and after four regenerations the cost was Rs 0. 5 /L of treated water. The volume of water treated after four regenerations was 307 L/Kg of AA. Studies were also done using field water from Banavara, Hassan district, Karnataka, which had a fluoride concentration of 3, 0 - 3. 5 mg/L. The combined process successfully produced treated water having an acceptable fluoride concentration. After one regeneration cycle, the operating cost was Rs. 1 /L of treated water. Studies have also been conducted on a point-of-use water filter containing a bed of AA pellets. The filter was provided by an organization called TIDE. The present results appear to suggest that a column with a smaller diameter than the TIDE filter has a better removal capacity. Ceramic candles are widely used for water filtration as they are readily available and inexpensive. Hence they are suitable for household water treatment purposes. In the present work, ceramic candles have been impregnated with nano-size alumina and nano-size magnesium oxide and tested for their defluoridation capacity. The nanoparticles were generated in situ in the pores of the candle by solution combustion synthesis. It has been found the candle impregnated with nano-size magnesium oxide has a higher defluoridation capacity than nano-size alumina. Estimation of the particle size in the samples of treated water did not give conclusive evidence for {{the presence or absence of}} nanoparticles. The volume of water treated was low and the cost of treatment was high (Rs. 12 /L for the candle impregnated with MgO). Hence such candles are unsuitable for defluoridation. Batch adsorption has been employed to measure the adsorption capacity of adsorbents. A model to capture the overall picture of the batch adsorption process, obtaining the kinetic and transport parameters involved has been developed. The mathematical model takes into account external mass transfer resistance, intraparticle diffusion, adsorption, and desorption. The equilibrium adsorption data was fitted using the Langmuir isotherm. The governing equations were solved using a finite difference technique known as the Laasonen method. The parameters were estimated by fitting two sets of data using a MATLAB function. The values estimated suggest that the adsorption process may not be diffusion-limited, in contrast to the assumption commonly used in the literature. The estimated parameter values were used to predict the concentration profiles for the other data sets. It was found that predicted and measured profiles agreed reasonably well...|$|E
40|$|Excess {{fluoride}} (F-) {{in drinking}} water poses a health threat {{to millions of people}} around the world. In the present work, activated alumina (AA) has been used as an adsorbent. Data obtained from batch experiments were fitted to the (i) pseudo-first order, (ii) pseudo-second order, and (iii) Langmuir kinetic model. Model (ii) performed better than model (i), and fitted the data well. However, the rate constant for adsorption ka had to be varied as a function of the initial concentration of F- in the liquid phase c 0. A more satisfactory approach is provided by Langmuir model, which fitted the data reasonably even though ka was independent of c 0. Shreyas (2008) developed a model for the batch adsorption of F- onto porous pellets of AA. Some errors were detected in his computer program were corrected. The parameters of the model were estimated by fitting predictions to data. The parameter values suggest that the adsorption process is likely to be diffusion limited. Column experiments were conducted as follows. The pellets were soaked in deionized water for a time ts before they were loaded into columns. A feed solution having a fluoride concentration cf = 3 mg/L was fed to column and the concentration of F- in the exit stream ce was measured at regular intervals. Breakthrough was deemed to have occurred when ce exceeded the permissible limit (= 1 mg/L). Constant values of the bed height H, and the empty bed contact time tc were used in the experiments. The volume of treated water V, scaled by the volume of the bed Vb, varied strongly with the soaking time ts, with a maximum at ts = 24 h. To understand the possible reasons for this behaviour, XRD, FESEM, and FTIR were used to characterize the surface of AA. Though the concentrations of the surface hydroxyl groups may influence the adsorption of F-, FTIR studies show there is no direct correlation between V/Vb and the concentrations of these groups. The FESEM and XRD studies indicate that fresh AA consists mainly of boehmite, which gradually converted to gibbsite during soaking. For fixed values of H and tc, the dimensionless volume of treated water V/Vb was a maximum at D = 45 mm. This behaviour may be caused by wall effects for small values of D and by occurrence of quasi-static regions near the wall for large values of D. The cost of treated of water was Rs. 0. 42 /L. It decreased slightly to Rs. 0. 37 /L after one regeneration cycle, but increased to Rs. 0. 41 /L after two cycles. The volume of treated water after two regeneration cycles was 595 L/kg. The concentration of Al 3 + ions ca in the treated water increased and exceeded the permissible limit of 0. 2 mg/L as the number of regeneration cycles increased. The concentration of F- in <b>regeneration</b> <b>effluent</b> cre was in the range 32 - 70 mg/L. The effluent was subjected to solar distillation, leading to a distillate whose fluoride concentration F- was in the range 9 - 12 mg/L. The distillate can be discharged into the public sewers, as the permissible limit is 15 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|Komati Power Station has {{installed}} a membrane plant consisting of ultrafiltration, double pass reverse osmosis and continuous electro-deionisation to treat cooling tower blowdowns {{in order to}} produce demineralised water and to conduct sidestream chemistry control of the cooling water circuit. This plant has replaced the existing ion-exchange plant that was used for the production of demineralised water and thus serves to reduce the loading of mobile salts in the ash dam (90 % reduction) by eliminating <b>regeneration</b> <b>effluent</b> from the ion-exchange plant. Due to oil contamination in the cooling water circuit (when oil from oil coolers leaks into the cooling water), the membrane plant was also designed to operate on raw water from either the Nooigdedacht or the Vygeboom Dam or a blend of both dams. This is considered to be an emergency intervention under abnormal conditions to prevent possible irreversible fouling of the membranes due to oil in the cooling water. The Nooigtedach Dam water contains high concentrations of organic matter and is also enriched with nutrients due to raw sewage influent into the Dam water. This poses a challenge with regard to treatment of the high fouling feed water on the membrane plant. Natural organic matter in water has the ability to foul reverse osmosis membranes. This adversely affects the operation of the reverse osmosis process. However, very little information is available regarding the fouling characteristics of natural organic material in the raw and cooling water at Komati Power Station for the reverse osmosis membranes. Therefore, a pilot study was undertaken to determine the influence of natural organic matter on membrane fouling, to optimise the process for the removal of natural organic matter and to assess the ability of two different reverse osmosis membranes to effectively treat the high fouling feed water at Komati Power Station. The ability of a polyethersulphone hollow-fibre ultrafiltration membrane system was first evaluated to remove natural organic matter in the feedwater, by conducting pilot tests, initially without coagulation of the raw water and thereafter with in-line coagulation for organics removal. Jar tests were conducted in the laboratory to determine the most suitable coagulant and dosage for turbidity and natural organic matter removal. Various coagulants were tested and, {{based on the results of}} the jar tests, a coagulant (U 3000) was identified based on optimal removal of both total organic carbon and turbidity at a dosing level of 20 mg/L. During the operation of the ultrafiltration pilot plant, permeate flow; feed pressure and feed temperature were monitored. Performance of the ultrafiltration membrane was monitored in terms of flux versus time for operation with and without a coagulation process. The results indicated that there was very little total organic carbon removal (maximum removal of 4 %) without coagulation and a slight decrease in flux. The flux declined as a result of fouling but could be recovered by performing hydraulic backwashes and CEB procedures. Permeate flux, however, could be maintained at about 90 Lmh (from 642 hours of operation). Since most of the organics passed through the ultrafiltration membrane, it was concluded that the loss in flux was due to colloidal fouling of the membrane. This was observed when the operation was carried out using raw water as feed as well as when cooling water was used. The total organic carbon removal increased to 30 % when the plant was operated with inline coagulation. The flux remained relatively stable during the first 600 hours of operation and only decreased significantly during the last 200 hours of operation as a result of fouling. The reduction in flux prior to cleaning was less than the 15 % (maximum flux decline of 9. 9 % during the test period) which is acceptable according to the industry norm of 15 %. It appeared that flux could be maintained at around 90 Lmh which was about the same as when no coagulant was applied. The 30 % total organic carbon reduction that was obtained was not sufficient to reduce the organics to the level of 6 mg/L dissolved organic carbon that was specified by the membrane manufacturer for the standard brackish water reverse osmosis membrane. Two reverse osmosis membranes – the standard brackish water reverse osmosis membrane (BW 30 - 2540) and the extra-low-fouling membrane (BW 30 XFR- 2540) – were assessed in terms of their ability to remove dissolved organic carbon, ease of cleaning of the membrane and the ability to recover flux after cleaning. This was done to establish which membrane is more suited to Komati’s high-fouling feedwater. The evaluation of the performance of the two reverse osmosis membranes was conducted using pre-treated water (filtered water after in-line coagulation, anti-scalant and biocide dosing) as well as using water that was not pre-treated. During operation (under both conditions), the normalised permeate flux, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon and organics absorbing at UV 254 were monitored. It was established that in terms of flux decline that the extra low-fouling membrane gave slightly superior performance to that of the standard membrane, achieving longer production runs (up to 5 days compared with 3 days achieved by the standard brackish water membrane) without requiring chemical cleaning. The low fouling membrane achieved better CWF recovery after the cleaning cycles (81. 26 % Lmh of the virgin membrane on the occasions when there was flux loss) compared to the standard membrane (restored to 77. 35 % of CWF of the virgin membrane) when using untreated feed water. This performance improved when pre-treated feed water was used and the low fouling membrane’s CWF regained after the CIP was 95. 89 % which was within the industry norm of a flux recovery of 95 %, indicating that the CIP had been effective. It was determined that the TOC rejection of the low-fouling membrane was higher (average TOC rejection of 97 %, maximum TOC rejection of 99 %) than that of the standard membrane (average TOC rejection of 95. 3 %, maximum TOC rejection of 97 %). Preliminary efforts to optimize the pre-treatment for organics removal in order to reduce organic loading for the RO membranes confirmed that the use of granular activated carbon and use of an organic scavenger resin might not be economically feasible due to the relatively quick TOC breakthrough (8910 BV, approximately 18000 BV and less than 18000 BV for the Filtrasorb 300, Filtrasorb 400 and organic scavenger resin, respectively). Although further investigations should still be conducted, the preliminary results indicate that it would be beneficial to also identify other options that can be further investigated for optimization of organics removal at Komati Power Station. Decline in the normalised flux as well as the evidence of biofouling were witnessed during the pilot operation suggesting that the membranes were fouled. Autopsies were performed on both membranes to identify foulants responsible for the decline in flux that was observed during the pilot study. The results did not indicate an organic foulant on the membrane surface. Biofouling should however, be monitored in the main plant as this was suspected to have resulted in the flux decline during the pilot study. The low fouling membrane demonstrated a better capability to treat the Komati raw and cooling water and would be expected to achieve lower operating costs for the plant (CIP costs and membrane replacement costs) while achieving better organics removal and it is therefore recommended that the low-fouling membranes be used at Komati Power Station as they are superior to the standard membrane and the cost of the low-fouling membranes is comparable to that of the standard membrane. While this would provide somewhat better performance than that obtained with the standard brackish water membranes, it is proposed that further investigation into pre-treatment optimization for organics removal as well as more efficient cleaning solutions be investigated to improve the performance and economics of the main water treatment plant at Komati power Station.

The fungus was able to decolorise melanoidin, caramel and HADP (hexose alkaline degradation product) solutions by 74 %, 87 % and 80 %,. respectively, and to reduce levels of phenolic compounds by 72 %. Gel permeation chromatography studies showed that decolorisation was accompanied by effective degradation of the colorants. As well as transformation of the visible chromophores, minor degrees of polymerisation of phenolic compounds and depolymerisation of melanoidin occurred during the incubation. No significant adsorption of colorants,onto the biomass was observed, indicating that colorants were biochemically degraded and not physically adsorbed. EUREKA. EUROAGRI 1974 Resinas.

The HDTMA loading level, feed flow rate of HA, solution pH and optimum elution were investigated. The SMZ- 75 %, the flow rate of 2 BV/h and pH 10 {{were found to}} be optimum for the removal of HA. The elution using ethanol solution could regenerate SMZ effectively. It was found that the ethanol solution of 25 % volume with the feed flow rate of 2 BV/h is sufficient to reduce HA concentration in the <b>regeneration</b> solution <b>effluent</b> to lower than 0.5  mg/L. The results of characterizations demonstrated that the most suitable orientation of the HDTMA adsorption on the zeolite surface is the formation of a hydrophobic organic monolayer. It is proposed that the hydrophobic nature of a HDTMA monolayer interacts favorably with the organic parts of HA, whereby the HA adsorption on SMZ surfaces is mainly due to the hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding and partitioning mechanism.|$|R

Before <b>regeneration,</b> the <b>effluent</b> As(tot) {{was reduced to}} less than 10 mu g= L with no residual As(III). FMBO-diatomite exhibited elevated adsorptive capability of As after in situ regenerations with breakthrough bed volumes increasing from 550 to 760 bed volumes after three cycles of operation. The residual concentrations of As(III) and As(V) at different layers along the adsorption column indicated the oxidation of As(III) and the As transportation during the filter layer. Additionally, FMBO-diatomite could efficiently remove the turbidity, Fe and Mn in influents, without causing secondary pollution. Acid dilution analysis showed more Fe content and less Mn content after three cycles through the FMBO-diatomite upper layer. This was attributable to the oxidation of As(III) and Fe(II) by manganese dioxide (MnO(2)) within FMBO and the transportation of Mn(II) thereafter. The backwashing procedure led to a size classification of adsorbents. However, the FMBO-diatomite also showed increased size diameter after three cycles of operation because of the in situ regeneration. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) EE. 1943 - 7870. 0000432.

One {{of the biggest}} problems of megalopolises is the human organic waste disposal. Under current technology, waste utilization requires enormous extent of sewer networks and large areas of treatment plants, which deform the natural landscapes and is expensive to operate. Organization of local recycling of organic waste is crucially important at creation of new urban objects satisfying the principle of biosphere compatibility. In addition, it should be noted, that with the rising of building tallness in modern cities the use of centralized water systems leads to excessive overruns of electricity by pumping equipment, therefore the local <b>effluent</b> <b>regeneration</b> systems is the optimal solution for skyscrapers. Making a start from successful design experience of closed ecological life support systems, which were initially created for long-duration space flights, our research implements the idea to realize closed circle for flows of substances and energy for utilization of human waste and improving air quality within residential building. We focus on small volume treatment facilities designed for 20 - 30 people. The main difference of our system is the high degree of closure of flows. Thus, the hardest part is to balance all technological processes. To solve this problem we suggest using rather complicated and accurate modelling founded on non-stationary partial differential equations describing the laws of matter conservation as a basis of an automatic control system. In this article, we present a mathematical model to simulate and control processes of transport phenomena in the system microalgae-mineralization-human.

40|$|Reactive dyeing {{of cotton}} generates {{a great deal}} of {{coloring}} wastewater containing residual dyes, electrolyte, alkali, and other auxiliaries. Especially for the effluent from the first/initial spent dyeing bath, it may be comprised of as high as 60 % of the initial dye dosed, 30 - 90 g/L of sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, and plenty of sodium carbonate, making it to be the most contaminative effluent among the entire reactive dyeing process. This paper presents a new alternative to regenerate the waste effluent from the first spent dyeing bath through catalytic ozonation with novel catalysts for reuse of the effluent in successive dyeing. Two novel ozonation catalysts, mesoporous carbon aerogel and its supported cobalt oxide nanoparticles, were successfully prepared and used in catalytic degradation of residual dyes in waste effluents with ozone. Degradation efficiency was determined by both decolorization and chemical oxygen demand removal. The result showed novel catalysts could improve both of these two targets. For chemical oxygen demand removal, carbon aerogel supported cobalt oxide strikingly enhanced the efficiency by 30 % on the whole comparing to ozonation alone (approximately 50 %) without the catalyst. Waste effluents after catalytic ozonation were thereafter reused in successive dyeing in the same process. It has been validated that the waste efflueni was successfully regenerated and can be additionally reused twice without sacrificing fabric quality, which cannot be realized in ozonation alone. Color difference of the fabric dyed with the regenerated effluent was within the acceptable tolerance, and excellent levelness and equal colorfastness had also been achieved. This is probably the first study to investigate the feasibility of regenerating highly polluting dyeing effluents for reuse by catalytic ozonation with carbon aerogel materials. With novel catalysts, it could be speculated that catalytic ozonation is a promising technology for in-situ <b>regeneration</b> of waste <b>effluents</b> in textile dyeing plant for reuse.
