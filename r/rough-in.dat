50|$|In North America, {{terms such}} as {{roughing}} in and finishing or <b>rough-in</b> and finish work are often heard, referring to similar concepts. Another related set of terms is outside work and inside work (the building is closed to the weather when the latter occurs). Carpenters speak of rough work and trim work (or framing versus trimming), and other fields have analogues, such as machining (roughing versus finishing cuts) and communications (rough draft versus revised draft).|$|E

40|$|Space {{conditioning}} {{energy use}} can be significantly reduced by addressing uncontrolled infiltration and exfiltration through the envelope of a building. A process {{for improving the}} air tightness of a building envelope by sealing shell leaks with an aerosol sealing technology is presented. Both retrofit and new construction applications are possible through applying this process either in attics and crawlspaces or during <b>rough-in</b> stage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a safety {{analysis of a}} transfer process for high-level radioactive and toxic waste. The analysis began with a hazard assessment that used elements of What If, Checklist, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, and Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) techniques to identify and <b>rough-in</b> accident sequences. Based on this preliminary analysis, the most significant accident sequences were developed further using event trees. Quantitative frequency estimates for the accident sequences were based on operational data taken from the historical record of {{the site where the}} process is performed. Several modeling challenges were encountered {{in the course of the}} study. These included linked initiating and accident progression events, fire propagation modeling, accounting for administrative control violations, and handling mission-phase effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the construction process {{of an additional}} 192 SF storage area for an existing Nature Center, along with a new 1000 SF deck around the entire structure. The scope of work included the excavation and pouring of concrete piers and stem walls, framing of the subfloor, shear walls, roof, and deck, electrical <b>rough-in</b> and finish, roofing system, windows, doors, insulation, drywall, and decking. All work on this project was managed by the author, and construction {{was done by the}} author, subcontractors, local hires, and volunteers. Construction of the project took place between December 2016 and June 2017, and cost approximately $ 40, 000. This paper will focus on means and methods, deliverables, knowledge and lessons learned, and how this knowledge will be brought into the construction industry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a manufactured residential utility wall system referred to as ResCore. ResCore is a self contained, manufactured, residential utility wall that provides complete <b>rough-in</b> of utilities (power, gas, water, and phone) and other functions (exhaust, combustion make-up air, refrigerant lines, etc.) to serve the kitchen, bath, utility, and laundry rooms. Auburn University, Department of Industrial Design faculty, students, supported {{by a team of}} graduate student researchers and the project`s advisory team, developed the ResCore. The project was accomplished through a research subcontract from the U. S. Department of Energy administered by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The ResCore wall system features a layered manufacturing technique that allows each major component group: structural, cold water, hot water, drain, gas, electric, etc. to be built as a separate subassembly and easily brought together for final assembly. The two structural layers are reinforced with bridging that adds strength and also permits firm attachment of plumbing pipes and other systems to the wall frame...|$|E

40|$|A. UCB Standards are not {{intended}} and shall {{not be used as}} guide specifications. While it is expected that this information will be of assistance to architect and engineer, in developing plans, specifications, and contract documents on particular projects, no portion of this standard may be produced by photographic or other means in any specification intended {{to become a part of}} contract documents without explicit written prior approval of the University of Colorado. Architects and engineers shall refer to Page 1 of Notice to UCB Standards for additional information. B. The design professional is responsible for complying with all of the requirements of applicable codes unless specifically waived, in writing, by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). C. The design professional shall review shop drawings for compliance with Contract Documents and conduct necessary inspections including <b>rough-in</b> inspections and punch list preparation. The design professional shall provide written Field Report of all inspections and punch lists to the AHJ and the project manager. D. For projects that do not retain the services of a consultant, the design may be completed by the standing-order contractor. In such cases, contractor shall implement UCB Standards in place of specifications. For such projects, the term "engineer " in this section of UCB Standards shall also mean "contractor". 1. 1 SUMMARY A.
