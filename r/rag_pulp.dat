That ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from <b>rag</b> <b>pulp.</b> Paper was a Chinese invention {{and it did}} not reach the western world until the ninth century A.D. The only book materials were parchment and strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge. These strips were kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very inconvenient for reference. It was these things that prevented the development of paged and printed books. Printing itself was known in the world it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals in ancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been resisted by trades unionism {{on the part of the}} copyists employed. Alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it never spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the level of a wealthy and influential class.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} fine art inkjet papers {{meet the needs of}} {{professional}} photographers and artists. These papers share many characteristics with traditional watercolor, printmaking, and photographic papers. Fine art inkjet papers are designed to meet similar standards for longevity as traditional fine art papers: they should have a neutral pH, be lignin-free, and not include optical brighteners. Fine art inkjet papers differ from traditional fine art papers, in that they include coatings engineered to receive and hold ink. Fine art papers are usually made of <b>rag</b> <b>pulp</b> (100% cotton being the most common) but may also be have an alpha-cellulose base. Some descriptions and comparisons {{of fine art}} inkjet papers are here, here, here, and here. Some fine art papers are mold made, while others are machine made, and may vary considerably in surface texture. Many fine art papers are available in pre-cut sheets or in rolls.|$|E

50|$|Bond {{paper is}} a high quality durable writing paper similar to bank paper but having a weight greater than 50 g/m2. The most common weights are 60 g/m2 (16 lb), 75 g/m2 (20 lb) and 90 g/m2 (24 lb). The name comes from its having {{originally}} been made for documents such as government bonds. It is now used for letterheads, other stationery and as paper for electronic printers. Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil, pen and felt-tip marker, bond paper can sometimes contain <b>rag</b> fibre <b>pulp,</b> which produces a stronger, though rougher, sheet of paper.|$|R

50|$|Arab {{prisoners who}} settled {{in a town}} called Borgo Saraceno in the Italian Province of Ferrara {{introduced}} Fabriano artisans in the Province of Ancona the technique of making paper by hand. At {{the time they were}} renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth. Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time. They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce <b>rags</b> to <b>pulp</b> for making paper, sizing paper by means of animal glue, and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue, obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local tanneries. The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper.|$|R

By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the western world were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.|$|R

5000|$|Heinrich Voelter {{remained}} the sole patent holder, leaving Keller unemployed and penniless. The wood-grinding machine was a success, though.

5000|$|... 1933: William Barrow {{introduces}} {{the field of}} conservation to paper deacidification when he publishes a paper on the acid paper problem. In later studies, Barrow tested paper from American books made between 1900 and 1949 and learned that after forty years the books had lost on average 96 percent of their original strength; after less than ten years, they had already lost 64 percent. Barrow determined that this rapid deterioration was not {{the direct result of}} using wood-pulp fibers, since rag papers of this period were also aging rapidly, but rather due to the residual sulfuric acid produced in both <b>rag</b> and wood <b>pulp</b> papers. Manufacturing methods used after 1870 employed sulfuric acid for sizing and bleaching the paper. Earlier papermaking methods left the final product only mildly alkaline or even neutral. Such paper has maintained its strength for 300 to 800 years, despite sulfur dioxide and other air pollutants. [...] Barrow's 1933 article on the fragile state of wood pulp paper predicted the life expectancy, or [...] "LE," [...] of this paper was approximately 40-50 years. At that point the paper would begin to show signs of natural decay, and he concluded that research for a new media on which to write and print was needed.|$|R
50|$|In {{those days}} paper {{was made from}} <b>pulped</b> <b>rags.</b> It was a {{technique}} used for nearly 2000 years. And suddenly demands reached their peak, while rag supplies reached its all-time low. Charles was very curious of how paper was made, and often stopped at these paper mills. There were many similarities between paper mills and lumber mills; something young Fenerty saw and experimented with. Demand for paper was so high that eventually Europe starting cutting down their shipments of cotton to North America. After seeing how paper is made and comparing it to the saw mills, {{it is not difficult}} to imagine how Fenerty got the idea (since the process is very much the same: fibres are extracted from the cotton and used to make paper). And Charles knew very well that trees have fibres too (from his relationship with the naturalist Titus Smith. At the age of 17 (in c.1838) he began his experiments of making paper from wood. But 1844 he had perfected the process (including bleaching the pulp to a white colour). In a letter written by a family member circa 1915 it is mentioned that Charles Fenerty had shown a crude sample of his paper to a friend named Charles Hamilton in 1840 (a relative of his future wife), though the family member in question would have been around 8 at the time.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{involved}} testing common proprietary deacidification sprays on vernacular wallpaper in situ. Inexpensive, mass-produced wallpaper {{is commonly}} overlooked by many conservators, whose efforts {{are more often}} directed toward the higher quality wallpapers that hang {{in the homes of}} historic luminaries. Cheaper wallpaper is just as relevant as these upscale counterparts, yet its materiality makes it more ephemeral and, therefore, in need of preservation efforts. Vernacular wallpaper was first produced {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century, when wood pulp was introduced to the manufacturing process. A cheap alternative to cotton <b>rags,</b> wood <b>pulp</b> drove down the cost of production, making a traditionally expensive product available to nearly all Americans. The presence of wood pulp, however, also causes the wallpaper to deteriorate more quickly as the result of a higher acid content. Deacidification is a conservation method that was developed during the mid- 20 th century to preserve deteriorating library collections. By neutralizing the acids present in paper and providing an alkaline reserve to protect against future acids, deacidification is believed to prolong the lifespan of wood pulp paper. Although paper conservators usually treat wallpaper in a laboratory setting, there are cases in which its removal from the wall may be deemed inappropriate. Professional laboratory conservation may also be prohibitively expensive for smaller, low budget house museums that often include vernacular wallpaper. Proprietary deacidification products were therefore chosen for testing. Vernacular wallpaper was provided by The Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City, where thousands of working class immigrants lived and worked between the 1860 s and 1930 s. The museum founders discovered the building in the 1980 s with its residential floors exactly as they had been left when the building was condemned in 1935. The multiple layers of deteriorating wallpaper that remained in situ have become a defining feature of the museum and are preserved as integral architectural finishes. For this reason, and because most of the wallpaper is extremely brittle, in situ treatment is preferred. Three spray products were tested on the wallpaper at the Tenement Museum. In order to be considered successful, these products were required to neutralize wallpaper samples without significantly altering their appearance. One product performed successfully on most samples, another achieved the highest pH measurements and also caused the most visual change, and the third was ineffective and inconsistent. Further research on the long-term effects of deacidification is necessary before any product can be recommended for use...|$|R
