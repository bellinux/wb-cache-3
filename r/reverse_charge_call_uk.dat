5000|$|In public networks, X.25 was {{typically}} {{billed as a}} flat monthly service fee depending on link speed, and then a price-per-segment on top of this.

A segment was 64 bytes of data (rounded up, with no carry-over between packets), charged to the caller (or callee {{in the case of}} <b>reverse</b> <b>charged</b> <b>calls,</b> where supported). [...] Calls invoking the Fast Select facility (allowing 128 bytes of data in call request, call confirmation and call clearing phases) would generally attract an extra charge, as might use of some of the other X.25 facilities. PVCs would have a monthly rental charge and a lower price-per-segment than VCs, making them cheaper only where large volumes of data are passed.|$|R
50|$|A {{collect call}} in Canada, Pakistan, and the United States, {{also known as}} a <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> <b>call</b> {{in other parts of the}} English-speaking world, is a {{telephone}} call in which the calling party wants to place a call at the called party's expense. In the past, collect calls were only possible as an operator-assisted call, but with the introduction of computer-based telephone dialing equipment, it is now possible to place a collect call without using an operator, which is called automated operator services (AOS) as opposed to Home Country Direct (HCD). Several companies offer services to place collect calls that compete with local service providers. Collect calls can be made from almost any public pay telephone in the world by following directions posted on or near the phone. Collect calling has been in constant decline since the advent of cellular phones and VOIP products, which can offer cheaper international rates.|$|R

50|$|Some {{types of}} <b>calls</b> are not <b>charged,</b> such as local calls (and {{internal}} calls) dialed directly by a telephone subscriber in Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Ireland or New Zealand (Residential subscribers only).

Fees depend on the provider of the service, the type of service being used (a call placed from a landline or wired telephone will have one rate, and a call placed from a mobile telephone will have a different rate) and {{the distance between the}} calling and the called parties. In most circumstances, the calling party pays this fee. However, in some circumstances such as a <b>reverse</b> <b>charge</b> or collect <b>call,</b> the called party pays the cost of the call. In some circumstances, the caller pays a flat rate charge for the telephone connection and does not pay any additional <b>charge</b> for all <b>calls</b> made. Telecommunication liberalization has been established in several countries to allows customers to keep their local phone provider and use an alternate provider for a certain call in order to save money.|$|R

The {{current system of}} value added tax has weaknesses, including carousel fraud, negative impact on cash flow of businesses and complicated rules to collect and manage the tax. <b>Reverse</b> <b>charge</b> mechanism is considered as a solution of existing weaknesses of current system.

Since the accession date, the legislation in the VAT field is repealed and replaced with the legislation harmonized with the Community acquis. The elimination of customs barriers between the 27 Member States of the European Union brings news as concerns the application of the "reverse charge" procedure that is applied in Romania as from the year 2005 for residue transactions and transactions with ferrous and non-ferrous metal waste, with grounds or buildings or building parts or living animals among VAT payers.
