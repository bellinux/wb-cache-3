The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E

Muller from MTV News commended the fashion, the choreography, the appearance of RHOBH in the video, and all who worked in it in the credits, saying [...] "While it's a humbling move to put the spotlight on everyone else's contributions, it's also a reminder of how truly epic this production is. It's gonna be <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Gaga to out-Gaga this one." [...] Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly was impressed by the grandiose of the video calling it [...] "camp-pop delirium". He compared it with director Jean Cocteau's films and proposed different theories as to the plot of the video, including ode to old and new Hollywood and a satire of [...] "corporate subservience". This view was shared by Whitney Phaneuf from HitFix who called it a [...] "heavy dose of camp and pop culture".|$|E
500|$|Jan Hooks reprised {{her role}} as Manjula in the episode. In a scene in the episode, Apu and Manjula are arguing in an Indian language. During the scene, both {{characters}} speak the language accurately, as both Hooks and Hank Azaria (the voice of Apu) were given a phonetic transcription of their lines. The singing parrot that Apu sends to Manjula was voiced by series main cast member Nancy Cartwright, who also portrays Bart in the series. The episode features singer sir Elton John as himself. John's lines were recorded by current showrunner Al Jean, who found working with John being a [...] "wonderful experience". [...] "Elton John {{was a very nice}} person," [...] Scully spoke for Jean in the DVD commentary for the episode, since Jean was busy during the commentary record. [...] "He was a great sport and worked <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the show." [...] Scully also stated that the re-recording of [...] "Your Song", which appears {{near the end of the}} episode, had to be recorded [...] "several times," [...] but that John was [...] "very accommodating" [...] about it.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} [...] August 2001, his company's stock value still falling, Lay named Greg Whalley, {{president}} and COO of Enron Wholesale Services and Mark Frevert, to positions in the chairman's office. Some observers suggested that Enron's investors were in significant need of reassurance, {{not only because the}} company's business was difficult to understand (even [...] "indecipherable") but also because it was difficult to properly describe the company in financial statements. One analyst stated [...] "it's <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> analysts to determine where [...] are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money." [...] Lay accepted that Enron's business was very complex, but asserted that analysts would [...] "never get all the information they want" [...] to satisfy their curiosity. He also explained that the complexity of the business was due largely to tax strategies and position-hedging. Lay's efforts seemed to meet with limited success; by September 9, one prominent hedge fund manager noted that [...] " [...] stock is trading under a cloud." [...] The sudden departure of Skilling combined with the opacity of Enron's accounting books made proper assessment difficult for Wall Street. In addition, the company admitted to repeatedly using [...] "related-party transactions," [...] which some feared could be too-easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on Enron's own balance sheet. A particularly troubling aspect of this technique was that several of the [...] "related-party" [...] entities had been or were being controlled by CFO Fastow.|$|E

Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode. She gave the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] a [...] "B", and explained that [...] "This one took a little time to grow on me. I liked it better on the show than when I heard it by itself, which is weird because it's exactly the same thing. Goes to show how much of a difference a good performance [...] makes." [...] Gonzalez gave the highest grade to the cover versions of [...] "Misery" [...] and [...] "Raise Your Glass", both performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers. In her review for [...] "Misery", she praised the performance, and gave it an [...] "A". She opined, [...] "I'm a sucker for a Warbler-ized pop song, especially when it makes Blaine dance and make his weird, animated faces. They're simply adorable, and these Warblers are simply amazing." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, it gets a 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'.

500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E

2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> us {{to sit here and}} try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie." ...|$|E

George and Michelle shared their passion for teaching with their students, along with Betsy, who said, “I try <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> to connect to the students and make them feel that I’m there for that.

500|$|... "They {{really wanted}} to be able to go beyond the South Park {{television}} show," [...] said Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox to TV Guide at the time. [...] "They <b>really</b> fought <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> and won the right to make an R-rated movie." [...] Paramount executives went as far to prepare graphs displaying how much more money a PG-13-rated South Park feature would perhaps accumulate. The William Morris Agency, which represented Parker and Stone, pushed for movie production to begin as soon as possible, while public interest was still high, instead of several years into its run, as was done with Beavis and Butt-head Do America, possibly because Beavis and Butt-head and South Park were owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom after Doug Herzog left Viacom Media Networks on January 12, 2017.|$|R

The unaccounted [...] "fifth member" [...] of the Graveyard Five was a coffin that the group would ceremoniously carry onto the stage prior to performances.
