5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which <b>ran</b> <b>all</b> the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates is very similar to that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E

25|$|A daily {{through train}} between Hamar and Trondheim was {{introduced}} {{with the opening}} of the line in 1877. It connected with a morning train and steamship departure from Oslo, and required an overnight stay in Koppang. The train stopped the following day at Røros for dinner, with arrival in Trondheim that evening. Parliament approved the first stage of the Dovre Line in 1875, opening between Eidsvoll and Hamar on 8 November 1880. This allowed a significant cut in travel time and from 1881 direct services were introduced, with travel times from Oslo to Trondheim at 24 hours and 15 minutes. At first this ran only during the summer, but from 1885 it <b>ran</b> <b>all</b> year. The cheaper trains with an overnight in Koppang continued to be run.|$|E

Posada established the Jorge Posada Foundation, which helps fund research and offers family support. Jorge released a charity wine in 2008 called Jorge Cabernet to raise funds for his foundation. In June 2011, his son underwent what Posada hoped would be the final surgery for the condition. During his all-star appearances, Jorge would have Jorge Luis at his side during the player introductions. One time during the intro of the 2002 game – the game where he started – Jorge Luis jogged out for his father, but nearly <b>ran</b> <b>all</b> {{the way out of the}} park – only to be quickly picked up by AL teammate Manny Ramirez.|$|E
25|$|The 1920s saw much indecisiveness and {{disputes}} over what route to take between Waipara and Wharanui. The Culverden line now <b>ran</b> <b>all</b> {{the way as}} Waiau and some work took place on a line to link Waiau with Kaikoura, {{but after a few}} kilometres of formation was made, work came to a halt. The coastal route was then chosen and work had only just restarted when the Great Depression began and brought about more severe delays. Fortunes improved in 1936 sufficiently to allow a resumption of progress, and a more coastal route out of Parnassus than the Leader Valley route was chosen. World War II brought even more delays, but this time, construction progressed through wartime and the Main North Line was finally completed when the northern and southern ends met at Kaikoura on 15 December 1945.|$|E

25|$|On 10 August 1852, {{a general}} holiday was {{declared}} in Elgin and Lossiemouth and {{the directors of}} the company along with other local dignitaries walked {{at the head of a}} procession from the town centre, at St Giles Church, to the station where accompanied by celebratory cannon firing, they were given a rousing send off. Some people instead walked to Lossiemouth to see the train arrive. The board of the Elgin and Lossiemouth Harbour Company met the passengers and escorted them to the recently opened Steamboat and Railway Hotel where they were entertained. They then proceeded to a large marquee erected overlooking the station on top of the quarry cliffs where many people made fine speeches before lunch was served. The celebrations included sports and games. The Board and prominent citizens met later that evening for a commemorative dinner. The trains <b>ran</b> <b>all</b> day until midnight and carried around 3000 passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company's Ripley route began in May 1913, and it was opened in several sections, all outside the city. The section between Church Street Basford, and Cinderhill was constructed by the Corporation and, after inspection by Major Pringle on 1 January 1914, through services to Ripley started. This section of the line included the only reserved track in Nottingham, ballasted sleeper track about ¼ mile long cutting off the corner between Nuthall Road and Stockhill Lane. The only Corporation cars to run over this track, so far as can be ascertained, were two test cars and the inspection car and, later, about 1919, one of the Westinghouse bogie cars borrowed by the Tramway Company {{in order to try}} out a car of this type on their line. It is thought that this car was no. 77: the car <b>ran</b> <b>all</b> the way to Ripley, probably the only Nottingham car to do so.|$|E
25|$|Singles {{were taken}} to end the over, but McGrath was to bowl the last over of the game, with England still needing ten to win. Things got easier for England when McGrath overstepped with the first ball of the over, Gough making contact and running the single to cut the target by two – the no-ball for {{overstepping}} and the run single – and the no-ball meant McGrath still had to bowl six balls in the over. Giles then played and missed, before hitting a single, and then Gough drove the two next balls to cover for two. Suddenly, England only needed three off two – and were, incredibly, in a winning position again. But Gough's next shot was right back to McGrath, who took it up well and tossed it at the stumps, running out Gough and meaning that McGrath would bowl to Ashley Giles – and England still required three to win. The ball hit Giles' pads, ran away down the off side, and Giles and Harmison <b>ran</b> <b>all</b> they could to scamper two leg byes – and tie the game.|$|E
