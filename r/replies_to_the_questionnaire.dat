AIM: A study was undertaken <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> degree of interest in preregistration rotations in general practice expressed by medical school deans and heads of departments of general practice. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent to all 26 deans of medical schools and all 25 heads of departments of general practice of teaching hospitals in the UK that undertook clinical training.

In this context, a lower standard implies that the cycle paths do not necessarily have to be given an asphalt surface, {{do not have to}} be provided with lighting or receive winter maintenance. The concept summer cycle path is a new one, and there are therefore no clear assessment criteria as to when a cycle path is to be constructed to a lower standard and therefore classified as a summer cycle path.

The present report describes, inter alia, the work of some Swedish municipalities on summer cycle paths. The data is based on <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> that was sent to around 10 municipalities. The results show that there only is limited number of summer cycle paths.

40|$|The study {{adopted an}} {{experimental}} approach {{to investigate the}} impact of informal use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learner’s interaction. CMC is an umbrella term which refers to human communication via computer either synchronously or asynchronously. It can be implemented in two ways either formally or informally. Informal use of CMC in this study means unevaluated and unplanned activities which can occur outside the classroom, and can be initiated by the students. This study sought to examine: (a) if the learners participate actively in informal CMC; (b) the factors that help informal CMC {{to be a successful}} experience; and (c) the impact of CMC on comprehensible written output. The participants were fifty adult EFL Saudi learners at Najran University, Saudi Arabia. The study utilized a homepage on Facebook as a research tool. Data collection was done through a questionnaire and an interview. The participants’ exchanges in the Facebook group and their <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> were analyzed. The results of the study revealed that informal use of CMC can be affected by many factors. The voluntary nature of learner participation, busy schedules, and the teacher interference were some of these factors.

Design Mail-out questionnaire and histological and bacteriological examination of biopsy tissue from suspect PDD lesions. Procedure The questionnaire {{was mailed to}} 375 veterinarians to evaluate their knowledge of PDD, determine if they had observed the disease in Australian dairy cattle, and to request biopsy material from suspicious cases. Biopsies were examined for histological and bacteriological evidence of PDD, including {{for the presence of}} spirochaetes. Results Eighty-eight <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> were received (23. 5 %). Of 52 respondents who were aware of PDD as a possible cause of lameness, 26 reported observing the condition in Australian cattle. Of 32 respondents who were unaware of the condition, 6 reported observing lesions that might have been PDD. The majority of reports of PDD-like lesions came from the southern Australian states, the condition occurring during periods of high rainfall and proving responsive to topical or parenteral application of antimicrobials. Biopsies from five erosive lesions showed histological similarity to PDD whereas biopsies from five proliferative lesions were consistent with chronic inflammation, fibroma or cutaneous papilloma. The presence of spirochaetes was not demonstrated in any of the lesions by histological or bacteriological methods. Conclusion Anecdotal reports and analysis of biopsy material confirm that a condition similar to PDD does occur sporadically in dairy cattle in southern Australia. However, this condition has so far not been shown {{to be associated with the}} presence of spirochaetes in the lesions...|$|E

Area of study: The COST Action FP 0903 involves 29 European countries and 4 non-COST institutions from USA, Morocco and Tunisia. In this study, the total of 22 <b>replies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> from 18 countries were included. Materials and methods: Based on the feedback from the Action FP 0903 countries, the most popular European Networks were identified. Thereafter, the access to the network database, available quality assurance/quality control procedures and publication were described. Finally, the so-called “Supersites” concept, defined as a “highly instrumented research infrastructure, for both research and monitoring of soil-plant-atmosphere interactions” was discussed. Main results: The result of the survey indicate that the vast majority of the Action FP 0903 countries participate in the International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forest (ICP Forest). The multi-disciplinary International Cooperative Programme on Integrated Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems (ICPIM) is the second most widespread forest programme.

It inquires into the expectations and perceptions of careers teachers themselves and the key members of their role set - the principal, students and parents of the school. A proposed 'Model of Careers Teachers' Roles' derived from the academic literature in the context of Hong Kong is also examined through a number of key questions. This study explores the importance of future policy planning and development of careers guidance to facilitate the school to work transition of students. Careers teachers' roles are presented as multifaceted and reliant on sound knowledge, skills and theories from continued professional development.
