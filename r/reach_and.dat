5|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} {{is about a}} {{relationship}} just out of his <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> the turmoil that ensues. The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the atmospheric production, Ocean's falsetto and writing ability. Some critics noted the possible bisexual undertones featured on the track.|$|E

Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley, on the 1846 {{junction}} of the London and Birmingham railway with the Bedford branch, {{was to become}} an important railway town too. In 1850, another branch from Bletchley to Oxford was built, later to become the (Cambridge/Oxford) Varsity Line. Bletchley, originally a small village in the parish of Fenny Stratford, grew to <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> absorb its parent. In Stony Stratford, expertise learned in the works {{was applied to the}} construction of traction engines for agricultural use and the site of the present Cofferidge Close was engaged in their manufacture.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E
5|$|During the four-day offense of Vahan, {{his troops}} {{had failed to}} achieve any {{breakthrough}} and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard's flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August 636, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce {{for the next few}} days so that fresh negotiations could be held. He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops. But Khalid deemed victory to be in <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> he declined the offer.|$|E

Emile uses a mass driver emplacement to defend the Autumn while Six fights through Covenant ground forces to get Cortana to the Autumns captain, Jacob Keyes. When Emile is slain by Elites, Six remains behind to control the gun, ensuring the Autumns escape.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of funk records such as Sly and the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and James Brown's late 1960s and early 1970s singles, Gaye's Let's Get It On helped further the funk genre's <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> {{influence}} in the music industry, as well as increase its mainstream appeal. Several contemporary R musicians, such as Prince, D'Angelo, and R. Kelly, were greatly influenced by its vintage sound and seductive themes, incorporating much of Gaye's musical style into their music.|$|E

He identified the various divisions of Pillsbury as poorly integrated and reined in their independence to make them more accountable to head office. He also invested heavily in research and development, technology, IT systems and marketing. A boosted marketing budget helped to grow Häagen-Dazs from a well known US brand to a product with global <b>reach,</b> <b>and</b> one of the best known names in luxury ice cream.|$|E

Protesters clashed with police on January 28, injuring at least 9 of the demonstrators. In response to the violence, Human Rights Watch calls for the United Nations to pressure the Cambodian government. Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House have also condemned the violence.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{equivalent}} control based {{sliding mode control}} is proposed for single input linear Markovian jump systems which guarantees the asymptotical stability. Furthermore, by using the stochastic system theory, a multi-step state transition conditional probability function is introduced for the continuous Markovian process, {{which is used to}} define the <b>reaching</b> <b>and</b> sliding probabilities. Furthermore, the formulas for calculating <b>reaching</b> <b>and</b> sliding probabilities are derived for situations where the control force may not be strong enough to ensure the fully asymptotical stability. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results and show the relationship between the control force <b>and</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>and</b> sliding probabilities...|$|R

They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|Jumpscares {{are present}} {{in all of the}} series' main games, and occur when any animatronic manages to <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> attack the player-{{character}}. Most jumpscares involve an animatronic character suddenly appearing in the player's view, followed by a loud, bellowing sound. Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with shrill, distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or restart the game. The player can utilise the tools listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares from occurring.|$|E

Iraqi Republican Guard forces were engaged within the Hammar Marshes of the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iraq while attempting to <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> cross the Lake Hammar causeway and escape northward toward Baghdad on Highway 8. Most of the five-mile-long Iraqi caravan of several hundred vehicles was first boxed into a kill zone and then {{in the course of the}} next five hours systematically devastated by the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, including its armored forces, by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and nine artillery battalions.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} E Company platoon joined Vandygriff, the North Koreans {{attacked}} again. The E Company infantrymen had brought no mortars with them-only small arms. In this situation, Vandygriff took a 3.5-inch rocket launcher and fired into the North Korean attackers, {{causing them to}} break off the attack. By now Vandygriff's troops were nearly out of ammunition. He then instructed his men to gather up all the weapons and ammunition from North Korean dead they could <b>reach,</b> <b>and</b> in this manner they obtained for emergency use about 30 to 40 rifles, 5 PPSh-41 guns, and some hand grenades.|$|E

A record eighth-wicket partnership between James Hildreth and Thomas of 50 brought the victory within <b>reach,</b> <b>and</b> Thomas' highest-score in Twenty20 cricket granted Somerset the win. Somerset lost their second match, being bowled out for their second-lowest Twenty20 total, 106 by Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} is omnivorous {{and although}} mainly a scavenger, it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds, reptiles and rodents.

Their main diet however is carrion and like the vultures their bare head and neck is an adaptation. They are often found on garbage dumps and will feed on animal and human excreta. In 19th-century Calcutta, they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river. In Rajasthan, where it is extremely rare, it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but this has been questioned.|$|E
