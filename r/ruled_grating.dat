40|$|Since de Broglie’s work on {{the wave}} nature of particles, various optical {{phenomena}} have been observed with matter waves of atoms and molecules. However, the analogy between classical and atom/molecule optics is not exact because of different dispersion relations. In addition, according to de Broglie’s formula, different combinations of particle mass and velocity can give the same de Broglie wavelength. As a result, even for identical wavelengths, different molecular properties such as electric polarizabilities, Casimir-Polder forces, and dissociation energies modify (and potentially suppress) the resulting matter-wave optical phenomena such as diffraction intensities or interference effects.

The filter is conformed of a monochromatic source in-cident on a <b>ruled</b> <b>grating,</b> positioned at grazing diffraction, followed by a narrow slit.

The influence of the filter is considered by employing ray trace analysis and conical diffraction theory of ruled gratings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to study {{the design of a}} high {{resolution}} mid-infrared spectrograph for the SOFIA airborne observatory. The primary motivation for the construction and use of such an instrument is the study of vibrational transitions of molecules in molecular clouds, circumstellar inflows and outflows, and planetary atmospheres, which are blocked from ground-based observations by absorption by the Earth's atmosphere. The instrument design studied is a cross-dispersed grating spectrograph with several modes of operation giving spectral resolving powers of approximately 4000, 20, 000, and 100, 000. In the two lower resolution modes a single grating is used in a long-slit spectrograph. At high resolution that grating serves as the cross-disperser for a 1 -m long echelon, a very coarsely and steeply <b>ruled</b> <b>grating,</b> diamond-machined in aluminum. Several design study tasks were carried out: 1. An optical and mechanical design was developed. It differed from the preliminary design by using a reflecting focal reducer in the fore-optics and by rearranging the echelon and cross-dispersing chambers to improve the efficiency of the long-slit modes. 2. A finite-element analysis of the dewar and echelon support structures was done. It led us to change the echelon support to improve its rigidity. 3. Further information was obtained which convinced us that Hyperfine Inc. was capable of diamond-machining the echelon. 4. Several possible vendors of readout electronics and software were identified. It was decided that it is more cost-effective to purchase these items rather than developing them ourselves. 5. Observing and calibration procedures were studied. we did not identify significant changes needed from procedures used previously. 6. Possible expansions of instrument capabilities, including wavelength coverage, were studied. It appears unlikely that the echelon will perform well at wavelengths shortward of 5 microns, but the spectral coverage could be extended longward of 28 microns with the use of an Si:Sb detector.
