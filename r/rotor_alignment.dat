40|$|Wind farm {{operation}} in very complex terrains generally involves complicated and severe environment for wind turbines. Strong speedups, extreme wind veer and high turbulence create a harsh environment for turbine safety and durability. A {{detailed analysis of}} the wind field can be very useful in order to isolate the most dangerous conditions and prevent exceptional loads. In this study it is investigated to what extent numerical free flow model can give reliable information on the operational behaviour of wind farms. For this reason, two wind farms, having very different features, are selected: the former is sited on a very gentle terrain and its dynamics is mainly driven by wake interactions, while the latter is instead sited on a very complex terrain. The wind field induced by the orography is calculated with two different numerical approaches, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and mass consistent modelling. Numerical results are compared and validated against experimental measurements from anemometer met-masts and from turbines SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) data sets. The analysis demonstrates that wind field models can give very useful information on <b>rotor</b> <b>alignment</b> patterns and on their influence on the overall park performance...|$|E
50|$|Rotary-screw {{compressors}} use two meshing helical screws, {{known as}} rotors, to compress the gas. In a dry-running rotary-screw compressor, timing gears {{ensure that the}} male and female <b>rotors</b> maintain precise <b>alignment.</b> In an oil-flooded rotary-screw compressor, lubricating oil bridges the space between the rotors, both providing a hydraulic seal and transferring mechanical energy between the driving and driven rotor. Gas enters at the suction side and moves through the threads as the screws rotate. The meshing rotors force the gas through the compressor, and the gas exits {{at the end of the}} screws.|$|R
5000|$|These have a rotor {{consisting}} of a solid steel casting with projecting (salient) toothed poles. Typically there are fewer rotor than stator poles to minimize torque ripple and to prevent the poles from all aligning simultaneously—a position which cannot generate torque. The size of the air gap in the magnetic circuit and thus the reluctance is minimum when the poles are aligned with the (rotating) magnetic field of the stator, and increases with the angle between them. This creates a torque pulling the <b>rotor</b> into <b>alignment</b> with the nearest pole of the stator field. Thus at synchronous speed the rotor is [...] "locked" [...] to the rotating stator field. This cannot start the motor, so the rotor poles usually have squirrel-cage windings embedded in them, to provide torque below synchronous speed. The machine starts as an induction motor until it approaches synchronous speed, when the rotor [...] "pulls in" [...] and locks to the rotating stator field.|$|R
5000|$|The rotors {{advanced}} odometrically; that is, {{after each}} encipherment, the [...] "fast" [...] rotor would advance one step. Once every 26 revolutions {{of the fast}} rotor, the [...] "medium" [...] rotor would step once. Similarly, ever 26 revolutions of the medium rotor, the [...] "slow" [...] rotor would step, and so on for the other two rotors. However, which rotor was assigned as the [...] "fast", [...] "medium", [...] "slow" [...] etc. rotors was controlled {{by a set of}} five multi-switches. This gave a total of [...] different rotor stepping patterns. The machine was equipped with a total of 10 rotors, each of which could be inserted [...] "direct" [...] or in reversed order, yielding [...] possible <b>rotor</b> orderings and <b>alignments.</b>|$|R
40|$|A short, intense {{laser pulse}} may be {{employed}} to create a spatially aligned molecular sample that persists after the laser pulse is over. We theoretically investigate whether this impulsive molecular alignment technique may be exploited for experiments using x-ray pulses from a third-generation synchrotron radiation facility. Using a linear rigid <b>rotor</b> model, the <b>alignment</b> dynamics of model molecular systems with systematically increasing size is calculated utilizing both a quantum density matrix formalism and a classical ensemble method. For each system, the alignment dynamics obtained for a 95 ps laser is compared with that obtained for a 10 ps laser pulse. The average degree of alignment after the laser pulse, as calculated quantum mechanically, increases {{with the size of}} the molecule. This effect is quantitatively reproduced by the classical calculations. The average degree of impulsive alignment is high enough to induce a pronounced linear dichroism in resonant x-ray absorption using the intense 100 ps x-ray pulses currently available. However, for structural studies based on elastic x-ray scattering, bright x-ray pulses with a duration of 1 ps or shorter will be required in order to make full use of impulsive molecular alignment...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the relative equilibria of a gyrostat with a spring-mass-dashpot damper to gain {{new insights into}} the dynamics of spin-stabilized satellites. The equations of motion are developed using a Newton-Euler approach, resulting in equations in terms of system momenta and damper variables. Linear and nonlinear stability methods produce stability conditions for simple spins about the nominal principal axes. We use analytical and numerical methods to explore system equilibria, including the bifurcations that occur for varying system parameters for varying rotor momentum and damper parameters. The equations and bifurcations for zero rotor absolute angular momentum are identical to those for a rigid body with an identical damper. For the more general case of non-zero rotor momentum, the bifurcations are complex structures that are perturbations of the zero rotor momentum case. We examine the effects of spring stiffness, damper position, and inertia properties on the global equilibria. Stable equilibria exist for many different spin axes, including some that do not lie in the nominally principal planes. Some bifurcations identify regions where a jump phenomenon is possible. We use Liapunov-Schmidt reduction to determine an analytic relationship between parameters to determine if the jump phenomenon occurs. Bifurcations of the nominal gyrostat spin are characterized in parameter space using two-parameter continuation and the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction technique. We quantify the effects of <b>rotor</b> or damper <b>alignment</b> errors by adding small displacements to the alignment vectors, resulting in perturbations of the bifurcations for the standard model. We apply the global bifurcation results to several practical applications. We relate the general set of all possible equili [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Fractional pitch slot / pole {{arrangements}} {{are commonly used}} in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) to significantly reduce cogging torque, however, maximum benefit depends on accurate stator and <b>rotor</b> manufacturing and <b>alignment.</b> This thesis presents a method of identifying the sources of manufacturing induced cogging torque. Decoupling of cogging caused by stator and rotor manufacturing variation is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another. A hybrid FEA / analytical method was developed to simulate cogging torque with multiple manufacturing faults induced which proved to be 6 orders of magnitude faster than FEA alone. The new method utilises a library of FEA derived pole transition over single stator slot waveforms which are then assembled in the correct order and phased corresponding to the slot / pole interactions for a given PMSM. Angular and eccentric misalignment can be identified by investigating the presence of first and second order sidebands about the pole and slot harmonics. Static angular misalignment induces first order sidebands around the slot harmonics while dynamic angular misalignment induces sidebands about the pole harmonics. Static eccentricity induces both first and second order sidebands around the slot harmonics, while dynamic eccentricity has {{the same effect on}} the pole harmonics. A ‘Fault Diagnosis Flow Chart’ is presented to identify the manufacturing sources of additional harmonics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, all combinations of 10 production stators and 10 rotors of 24 slots and 10 poles in an axial flux configuration were experimentally measured and analysed. The stator slot variation and pole misplacement were found to be the largest contributors to unexpected cogging torque. Pole strength variation and static angular misalignment had minor contributions while dynamic angular, static eccentricity and dynamic eccentricity were found to not {{have a significant impact on}} the motors tested...|$|R
