5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> of the {{electron}} Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes {{of silver}} range in <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> from 92.950u (93Ag) to 129.950u (130Ag); the primary decay mode before the most {{abundant}} stable isotope, 107Ag, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before 107Ag are palladium (element 46) isotopes, and the primary products after are cadmium (element 48) isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass.</b> The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
50|$|In the 1860s Stanislao Cannizzaro refined <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> by {{applying}} Avogadro's law (notably at the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860). He formulated {{a law to}} determine <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of elements: the different quantities of the same element contained in different molecules are all whole multiples of the atomic weight and determined <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> and molecular masses by comparing the vapor density {{of a collection of}} gases with molecules containing {{one or more of the}} chemical element in question.|$|R
50|$|The {{estimation}} of the uncertainty is complicated, especially as the sample distribution is not necessarily symmetrical: the IUPAC standard <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> are quoted with estimated symmetrical uncertainties, and the value for silicon is 28.0855(3).

25|$|As {{an example}} from the late superactinides, element 156 is {{expected}} to exhibit mainly the +2 oxidation state. Its first ionization energy should be about 395.6kJ/mol and its metallic radius should be about 170picometers. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 26g/cm3. Its <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> should be around 445u.|$|E

50|$|Multiplying by the {{molar mass}} {{constant}} {{ensures that the}} calculation is dimensionally correct: standard <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> are dimensionless quantities (i.e., pure numbers) whereas molar masses have units (in this case, grams/mole).|$|R

500|$|With a gold-based {{definition}} of the kilogram for instance, the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> of gold could have been fixed as precisely , from the current value of [...] As with a definition based upon carbon12, the Avogadro constant would also have been fixed.

500|$|All silicon-based {{approaches}} would fix the Avogadro constant but vary in {{the details}} of the definition of the kilogram. One approach would use silicon with all three of its natural isotopes present. About 7.78% of silicon comprises the two heavier isotopes: 29Si and 30Si. As described in Carbon12 above, this method would define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of 12C atoms by fixing the Avogadro constant; the silicon sphere would be the practical realization. This approach could accurately delineate the magnitude of the kilogram because the masses of the three silicon nuclides relative to 12C are known with great precision (relative uncertainties of 1ppb or better). An alternative method for creating a silicon sphere-based kilogram proposes to use isotopic separation techniques to enrich the silicon until it is nearly pure 28Si, which has a <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> of [...] With this approach, the Avogadro constant would not only be fixed, but so too would the atomic mass of 28Si. As such, the definition of the kilogram would be decoupled from 12C and the kilogram would instead be defined as · atoms of 28Si (≈ fixed moles of 28Si atoms). Physicists could elect to define the kilogram in terms of 28Si even when kilogram prototypes are made of natural silicon (all three isotopes present). Even with a kilogram definition based on theoretically pure 28Si, a silicon-sphere prototype made of only nearly pure 28Si would necessarily deviate slightly from the defined number of moles of silicon to compensate for various chemical and isotopic impurities as well as the effect of surface oxides.|$|E

50|$|Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1779-1848) was {{instrumental}} in the determination of <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> to ever-increasing accuracy. He was also the first chemist to use oxygen as the standard to which other masses were referred. Oxygen is a useful standard, as, unlike hydrogen, it forms compounds with most other elements, especially metals. However, he chose to fix the <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> of oxygen as 100, an innovation that did not catch on.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{atomic weight}} (or atomic weight) scale {{has traditionally been}} a relative value, that is without a unit, with the first <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> basis suggested by John Dalton in 1803 as 1H. Despite the initial mass of 1H being used as the natural unit for <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass,</b> it was suggested by Wilhelm Ostwald that <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> would be best {{expressed in terms of}} units of 1/16 mass of oxygen (1903). This evaluation was made prior to the discovery of the existence of elemental isotopes, which occurred in 1912.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of isotopic oxygen in 1929 {{led to a}} divergence in <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> representation, with isotopically weighted oxygen (i.e., naturally occurring oxygen <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass)</b> given a value of exactly 16 atomic mass units (amu) in chemistry, while pure 16O (oxygen-16) was given the mass value of exactly 16 amu in physics.|$|E
5000|$|Atomic mass (ma) is {{the mass}} of a single atom, with unit Da or u (the unified atomic mass unit).

50|$|Apart {{from this}} {{uncertainty}} by measurement, some elements have variation over sources.

50|$|Similar {{definitions}} {{apply to}} molecules. One can compute the molecular mass of a compound {{by adding the}} <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of its constituent atoms (nuclides). One can compute the molar mass of a compound by adding the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of the elements given in the chemical formula. In both cases the multiplicity of the atoms (the number of times it occurs) {{must be taken into}} account, usually by multiplication of each unique mass by its multiplicity.|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} of predictive power of theories or models include Dmitri Mendeleev's {{use of his}} periodic table to predict previously undiscovered chemical elements and their properties (though largely correct, he misjudged the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of tellurium and iodine), and Charles Darwin's use of his knowledge of evolution by natural selection to predict that because there existed a plant (Angraecum) with a long spur in its flowers, a complementary animal with a 30 cm proboscis must also exist to feed on and pollinate it (twenty {{years after his death}} Xanthopan morganii, a form of hawk moth, was found which did just that).|$|R
5000|$|The {{well-known}} standard atomic weight, or atomic weight, is {{a specific}} usage of relative atomic mass: it is the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass,</b> with the sources being terrestrial (taken from Earth). The standard atomic weights are reprinted {{in a wide variety}} of textbooks, commercial catalogues, and periodic table wall charts. They are what chemists loosely call [...] "atomic weights". It is the most published form of the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is used as}} {{a synonym}} for atomic weight (and is not to be {{confused}} with relative isotopic mass). <b>Relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> is frequently used as a synonym for the standard atomic weight and it is correct to do so if the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> used is that for an element from Earth under defined conditions. However, <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> covers more than standard atomic weights, and is a less specific term that may more broadly refer to non-terrestrial environments and highly specific terrestrial environments that deviate from Earth-average or have different certainties (number of significant figures) than do the standard atomic weights. In some circumstances may even be synonymous with standard atomic weight (depending on the sample, see below).|$|E
50|$|The {{molar mass}} {{constant}} is unusual (but not unique) among physical constants by having an exactly defined value {{rather than being}} measured experimentally. It is fixed by the definitions of the mole and of <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass.</b> From {{the definition of the}} mole, the molar mass of carbon 12 is exactly 12 g/mol. From the definition of <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass,</b> the <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> of carbon 12, that is the atomic weight of a sample of pure carbon 12, is exactly 12. The molar mass constant is given byThe speed of light, the electric constant and the magnetic constant are other examples of physical constants whose values are fixed by the definitions of the International System of Units (SI), in these cases by the definitions of the metre and the ampere.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} above the atomic weight of carbon is given as 12.011, not 12. This is because {{naturally}} occurring carbon {{is a mixture}} of the isotopes 12C, 13C and 14C which have <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of 12, 13 and 14 respectively. Moreover, the proportion of the isotopes varies between samples, so 12.011 is an average value. By contrast, there is less variation in naturally occurring hydrogen so the average atomic weight is known more precisely. The precision of the molecular mass is determined by precision of the least precise <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> value, in this case that of carbon. In high-resolution mass spectrometry the isotopomers 12C1H4 and 13C1H4 are observed as distinct molecules, with molecular weights of 16 and 17, respectively. The intensity of the mass-spectrometry peaks is proportional to the isotopic abundances in the molecular species. 12C 2H 1H3 can also be observed with molecular weight of 17.|$|R
50|$|Newlands was {{the first}} person to devise a {{periodic}} table of chemical elements arranged in order of their <b>relative</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>masses.</b> Continuing Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner's work with triads and Jean-Baptiste Dumas' families of similar elements, he published in 1865 his 'Law of Octaves', which stated that 'any given element will exhibit analogous behaviour to the eighth element following it in the table.' Newlands arranged all of the known elements, starting with hydrogen and ending with thorium, into seven groups of eight, which he likened to octaves of music. In Newlands' table, the elements were ordered by the atomic weights that were known at the time and were numbered sequentially to show their order. Periods were shown going down the table, with groups going across - the opposite from the modern form of the periodic table.|$|R

By columnar subdivision of such a field, in addition to ground states also nuclear isomers can be shown. The coloring of a field (segmented if necessary) shows in addition to the existing text entries the observed types of radioactive decay of the nuclide and a rough classification of their relative shares: stable, nonradioactive nuclides completely black, primordial radionuclides partially black, proton emission orange, alpha decay yellow, beta plus decay/electron capture red, isomeric transition (gamma decay, internal conversion) white, beta minus decay blue, spontaneous fission green, cluster emission violet, neutron emission light blue. For each radionuclide its field includes (if known) information about its half-life and essential energies of the emitted radiation, for stable nuclides and primordial radionuclides there are data on mole fraction abundances in the natural isotope mixture of the corresponding chemical element. Furthermore, for many nuclides cross sections for nuclear reactions with thermal neutrons are quoted, usually for the (n, γ)-reaction (neutron capture), partly fission cross sections for the induced nuclear fission and cross sections for the (n, α)-reaction or (n, p)-reaction.
