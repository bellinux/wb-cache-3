GenoPro sports built-in ASP objects and many additional objects {{making it easy}} to generate elaborate reports. GenoPro can also load third-party COM modules made in other programming languages such C++, C#, VB.NET or Java and/or connect to external databases such as Microsoft SQL, MySQL, or Oracle to fetch additional data for generating a report. The current version of GenoPro includes a new type of report to generate Microsoft Word and OpenOffice documents.|$|E

50|$|GenoPro's <b>report</b> <b>generator</b> understands {{hierarchical}} {{data and}} its generated reports give the user {{the option to}} expand each node to view details. Also, the <b>report</b> <b>generator</b> displays Geo Mapping in the Google Map for every place defined by a city name or a GPS position. Circular referencing is very common in genealogy, such as displaying a picture for a place, and linking this place to its original picture. Relational databases do not handle circular referencing, or if such a catastrophic scenario happens, the data is in a deadlock and cannot be deleted. Hierarchical data {{is nearly impossible to}} achieve for standard databases without writing massive bug-prone code requiring excessive processing, thus rendering the entire application extremely slow and unusable for large amounts of data.|$|E

It is imperative to establish the value of the radiologists to patient care through good communication with both patients and referrers, and via more direct involvement in clinical problem-solving and patient care. Patient groups expressed the view that direct discussion of imaging investigations, not just a written report, would be valued.|$|R
