40|$|A {{high-pressure}} liquid chromatographic {{method has}} been developed for the quantitative determination of <b>rosaramicin</b> in serum. This procedure involves addition of an internal standard, adjustment to alkaline pH, treatment with potassium carbonate, ether extraction, and a reverse-phase column separation with acetonitrile-acetate buffer mixture as the mobile phase. This technique produces a good linear relationship between the peak height ratio and the <b>rosaramicin</b> concentration. In addition, this method {{has proven to be}} quite specific for <b>rosaramicin,</b> since many of its derivatives tested do not interfere with the assay. The method is accurate and reproducible with a sensitivity of about 0. 01 microgram of <b>rosaramicin</b> per ml of serum. It may be useful in monitoring drug levels in serum of patients and also for the pharmacokinetic studies of the drug in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and microbiological {{outcome of the}} treatment of 94 men for uncomplicated non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) was studied. <b>Rosaramicin</b> 250 mg six hourly for seven days was given to 46 men and tetracycline 250 mg six hourly for seven days to 48 men; the follow-up period was up to six weeks. Complete resolution of the clinical signs of infection was seen in 40 (87 %) of the men treated with <b>rosaramicin</b> and in 37 (77 %) of those treated with tetracycline. Chlamydia trachomatis was eliminated from 17 of the 18 men treated with <b>rosaramicin</b> and {{from all of the}} 16 men treated with tetracycline. Ureaplasma urealyticum was eliminated from 12 of the 14 men treated with <b>rosaramicin</b> and from 15 of the 19 receiving tetracycline. Clinical recovery correlated well with the elimination of C trachomatis but less well with that of U urealyticum. The two antimicrobial agents were equally effective in the therapy of NGU, but gastrointestinal side effects were significantly more common in men treated with <b>rosaramicin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Eight new {{beta-lactam}} {{antibiotics and}} <b>rosaramicin</b> were tested for their activity against penicillin-susceptible and multiply resistant pneumococci.

40|$|Thirty-two {{clinical}} isolates of Ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited by 0. 036 μg of <b>rosaramicin</b> per ml, whereas 25 (78 %) and 13 (41 %) of {{the strains}} were inhibited by this concentration of minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. These {{results suggest that}} <b>rosaramicin</b> may be useful {{for the treatment of}} U. urealyticum infections...|$|E
40|$|The Authors {{studied in}} vitro {{antibacterial}} activity of <b>rosaramicin,</b> a new macrolide antibiotic on 59 strains of anaerobic microrganism and 93 strains of both aerobic and facultative ones.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} failure of antimycoplasma drugs, subject to resistance {{is vital for}} specific microbiological investigation to overcome urogenital diseases among women. The susceptibility of 5 Mycoplasma hominis strains and 11 strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum were studied against six antibiotics namely: minocycline, lincomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline and <b>rosaramicin.</b> Both M. hominis and Ureaplasmas strains were highly resistant to tetracycline. It was observed that both <b>rosaramicin</b> and minocycline were active growth inhibitors for Ureaplasmas. However, erythromycin and lincomycin showed differential growth inhibitory patterns for M. hominis and Ureaplasma strains. In comparison, the minocycline and doxycycline exhibited similar antibiotic activity against Ureaplasma and M. hominis. The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity analysis for <b>rosaramicin</b> and erythromycin was also noted {{to be at the}} same level for all the isolates...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rosaramicin,</b> a new {{macrolide}} antibiotic, {{was compared}} with penicillin G {{in the treatment}} of pneumococcal meningitis in rabbits. Animals were infected intracisternally with 104 colony-forming units of Streptococcus pneumoniae type III (<b>rosaramicin</b> minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations, 0. 25 / 0. 5 μg/ml; penicillin G minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations, 0. 03 / 0. 06 μg/ml). Treatment was instituted 96 h later. Infusion of <b>rosaramicin</b> at 25 mg/kg per h intravenously for 8 h produced a peak cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug concentration of 1. 54 μg/ml (range, 0. 87 - 3. 6 μg/ml). During this infusion the numbers of pneumococci in CSF decreased from 6. 2 ± 0. 5 to 3. 36 ± 1. 12 log 10 colony-forming units per ml. Penicillin G, infused at 30 mg/kg per h for 8 h, reached a similar concentration in CSF but caused a greater reduction (P < 0. 01) in CSF bacteria, from 6. 4 ± 0. 36 to 1. 3 ± 0. 67 log 10 colony-forming units per ml. Penicillin G, at 100 mg/kg per day intramuscularly for 5 days, cured 7 of 10 rabbits with pneumococcal meningitis. A higher dose, 300 mg/kg per day for 5 days, was no more efficacious: 11 of 14 rabbits were cured. <b>Rosaramicin</b> at 100 mg/kg per day intramuscularly for 5 days cured only 5 of 15 rabbits with meningitis, but a higher dosage regimen of that drug (250 mg/kg per day intramuscularly) produced acute, fulminant enterocecitis and death within 48 h in seven of eight rabbits. No cytotoxin was detected in the feces of one rabbit with acute enterocecitis. Thus the efficacy of <b>rosaramicin</b> in experimental pneumococcal meningitis, measured by bacterial clearance from CSF and by treatment outcome, was less than that of penicillin G. In addition, high-dose parenteral <b>rosaramicin</b> caused acute, fulminant enterocecitis in a high proportion of treated rabbits...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of lincomycin-spectinomycin-tylosin was tested against several strains of mycoplasmas and acholeplasmas {{as might be}} encountered in bovine semen and shown to be effective against them. This combination as well as minocin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> rosoxacin, tiamulin, gentamicin and declomycin were tested in vitro against 58 isolates of ureaplasma from the bovine urogenital tract. The lincomycin-spectinomycin-tylosin combination, minocin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> tiamulin and declomycin were quite active, while rosoxacin and gentamicin were much less active against the test strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and metabolism of [14 C]rosaramicin {{were studied}} in dogs after intravenous (i. v.; 10 mg/kg [bodyweight]) and oral (25 mg/kg) administration. After i. v. administration, <b>rosaramicin</b> levels in plasma declined rapidly, with half-lives of 0. 22 h for the distribution phase and 0. 97 h {{for the elimination}} phase. The apparent volume of distribution was 3. 43 liters/kg, and the total body clearance was 106 mg/min. kg, indicating extensive distribution in tissue or metabolism or both. The absorption of oral solution was 58 %, and the absolute bioavailability of <b>rosaramicin</b> was 35 %. The plasma area under the curve of unchanged <b>rosaramicin</b> was only 5 % that of total radioactivity after oral administration and 8 % after i. v. administration, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug. The total radioactivity excreted in urine accounted for only 24 % of the i. v. dose and 17 % of the oral dose. Fecal radioactivity accounted for 71 % of the i. v. dose and 68 % of the oral dose. Several metabolites were observed in the plasma and urine. The amount of unchanged <b>rosaramicin</b> in urine (1 to 2 % of the dose) was quite small after drug administration by either route...|$|E
40|$|One hundred {{isolates}} of Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{obtained from}} patients attending clinics in Johannesburg, South Africa, were tested by a broth dilution technique for their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of benzyl penicillin G, ampicillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, spectinomycin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> chloramphenicol, and rosoxacin. None of the isolates tested produced beta-lactamase. The MICs of penicillin ranged {{from less than}} or equal to 0. 007 to 0. 5 micrograms/ml. The isolates were also very susceptible to <b>rosaramicin</b> (minimal concentration at which 50 % of isolates were inhibited [MIC 50] = 0. 02 micrograms/ml) and to the new cephalosporins (cefotaxime MIC 50 less than 0. 007 micrograms/ml, ceftriaxone MIC 50 less than 0. 007 micrograms/ml, and ceftazidime MIC 50 less than 0. 007 micrograms/ml). By using regression analysis, good correlation was observed between the MICs of penicillin and those of the other agents, with the exception of ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, and <b>rosaramicin.</b> The MICs and the minimal bactericidal concentrations were within a log 2 concentration of each other...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether employing antibiograms {{is useful to}} separate Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, we determined the MICs of 12 antibiotics for 104 human clinical strains and 74 swine strains. Of 74 swine strains, 5 (7 %) were hippurate positive, as were 93 (89 %) of 104 human strains. The 12 antimicrobial agents tested were ampicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, furazolidone, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, rosoxacin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> tetracycline, and Sch 32063. Isolates from humans were significantly (P less than 0. 001) more susceptible than swine strains to clindamycin, erythromycin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> and Sch 32063. Of 11 human hippurate-negative strains, 3 (27 %) were resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> and Sch 32063, compared with 1 of 93 (1 %) hippurate-positive strains. Nearly all human and swine strains were susceptible to furazolidone and nalidixic acid. Campylobacter isolates from humans and swine have different antibiograms, and the susceptibility to certain antibiotics, such as clindamycin, may be helpful for differentiation of C. jejuni from C. coli...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>rosaramicin</b> was {{studied in}} subjects receiving 500 mg {{of the drug}} (i) by 1 -h intravenous infusion, (ii) in solution orally, or (iii) as tablets orally. After intravenous administration, the <b>rosaramicin</b> levels in serum declined rapidly with t 1 / 2 S of 0. 27 h for the distribution phase and 3. 28 h for the elimination phase. The apparent volume of distribution was 3. 78 liter/kg, and the total body clearance was 13. 41 ml/min per kg, indicating extensive tissue distribution or metabolism or both. Similar pharmacokinetic data were obtained after oral administration of the drug in solution or tablets and after intravenous dosing. The absolute bioavailability of the drug administered orally, in either tablets or solution, was 32 to 39 %. The metabolism and excretion of [14 C]rosaramicin administered orally were also evaluated in volunteers. The serum area under the curve (infinity) of unchanged <b>rosaramicin</b> was 19 % of that of total radioactivity, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug. About 7. 0 % of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine, and 86. 7 % was recovered in the feces. Only {{a small amount of}} unchanged <b>rosaramicin</b> was present in the urine (7 to 9 % of urinary radioactivity), but none was present in the feces. The major metabolite, 20 -bis-ureidorosaramicin, represented 17 to 38 % of the radioactivity in the urine and 26 to 29 % of the radioactivity in the feces...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} and bactericidal {{activities of}} <b>rosaramicin</b> were tested against 324 strains of bacteria. A lethal effect at low concentrations was demonstrated against group A streptococci. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemo-philus influenzae and some anaerobic bacteria. Only inhibition was demonstrated in tests of staphylococci, group B streptococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Of 44 strains of Serratia marcescens, 20 - 45 % were inhibited by concentrations of 16 mg/ 1 or less. Bacteristatic synergy between <b>rosaramicin</b> and colistimethate was demonstrated by a checkerboard method against 16 of 17 strains of Ser. marcescens tested, and bactericidal synergy {{was seen in}} 7 of 12 strains tested by a time-killing method...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo {{activity}} of <b>rosaramicin</b> phosphate in disseminated and localized Treponema pallidum infections in rabbits was {{compared with that}} of penicillin G benzathine. Rabbits were injected either intradermally or intravenously to establish infection. Groups of four animals each then received either two weekly injections of 200, 000 U of penicillin G benzathine, injections of 12. 5 or 25 mg of <b>rosaramicin</b> per kg of body weight twice a day for 10 days, or no antibiotic therapy. Treatment of the intradermal and intravenous infections was initiated on days 7 and 14 postinfection, respectively. With both infection models, striking differences were noted between the untreated control rabbits and the three groups receiving treatment; no discernible differences, however, were detected among any of the treated groups. Rabbits that had been infected intravenously did not develop disseminated lesions or orchitis after treatment, and chancres produced by intradermal infection regressed and healed rapidly after the initiation of therapy. Continued increases in treponemal and nontreponemal antibody titers posttreatment did not occur in any of the treated rabbits. Infectivity studies also suggested that the lymph nodes and testes of treated animals were free from infectious organisms. Overall, at the dosage regimens employed, both <b>rosaramicin</b> and penicillin G benzathine appeared to effect complete control of the experimental disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of 11 antimicrobial agents against 36 strains of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni were studied by a broth microdilution method. All strains were susceptible to 7 of the 11 antimicrobial agents.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} determining the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics for Ureaplasma urealyticum which is compatible with current standard of susceptibility testing. A presumptive MIC is available after 24 h of incubation, and the definitive MIC is available at 48 h. The MICs for 9 serotype strains and 27 clinical isolates ranged from {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 to 256 microgram of tetracycline per ml, greater than or equal to 1 to 64 microgram of erythromycin per ml, and 0. 031 to 4. 0 microgram of <b>rosaramicin</b> per ml. Of an additional 555 isolates screened for their response to tetracycline, 2 % required MICs of greater than 64 microgram/ml, which we believe is near the concentration at which in vivo resistance to this agent is expressed. After prolonged exposure to <b>rosaramicin,</b> the resistance of two of three serotype strains of U. urealyticum was increased 8 - and 16 -fold, but the MICs still did not exceed 1. 0 microgram/ml...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-three {{strains of}} Legionella spp., 29 {{of which were}} L. pneumophila, were tested for their susceptibilities to {{erythromycin}} (EM), <b>rosaramicin,</b> tylosin, mycinamicin I (Sch- 27897), and mycinamicin II (Sch- 27896). Testing was performed using an agar dilution method with {{two different types of}} media: buffered charcoal yeast extract medium supplemented with 0. 1 % alpha-ketoglutarate (BCYE alpha) and filter-sterilized yeast extract medium with 0. 1 % alpha-ketoglutarate (BYE alpha). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drugs tested relative to the MICs of erythromycin were: <b>rosaramicin,</b> MIC approximately equal to 0. 2 EM MIC; tylosin, MIC approximately equal to 2 EM MIC; mycinamicin I, MIC approximately equal to 0. 5 EM MIC; and mycinamicin II, MIC approximately equal to EM MIC. Both types of media caused equivalent partial inactivation of the macrolides which was apparently due entirely to pH effect. MICs on BCYE alpha were one to five times more than those observed on BYE alpha; {{this may be due to}} poorer growth on BYE alpha...|$|E
40|$|Recent Chlamydia trachomatis {{isolates}} {{were tested}} in a tissue culture system for susceptibility to tetracycline, erythromycin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> rifampin, and clindamycin. Rifampin was the most active drug (minimal inhibitory concentration, {{less than or equal}} to 0. 02 microgram/ml). Tetracycline and rasaramicin were highly active, with a concentration of {{less than or equal to}} 0. 25 microgram/ml being chlamydicidal. Clindamycin was least active on a weight basis, requiring up to 16 microgram/ml to prevent the passage of chlamydiae into a drug-free tissue culture system.

Fifty patients were treated with tetracycline hydrochloride, 500 mg orally four times daily, and 50 patients were treated with <b>rosaramicin,</b> 250 mg orally four times daily, both for 7 days. Both agents were highly effective in eradicating C. trachomatis. Both produced significant improvement in objective signs of cervicitis: eliminating mucopurulent endocervical discharge and edema of ectopy, and decreasing the clinical severity score of cervicitis.

40|$|The {{following}} macrolide antibiotics {{have been}} covered in this review: erythromycin and its related substances, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, roxithromycin, flurithromycin, josamycin, rokitamycin, kitasamycin, mycinamycin, mirosamycin, oleandomycin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> spiramycin and tylosin. The application of various thin-layer chromatography, paper chromatography, gas chromatography, {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} and capillary zone electrophoresis procedures for their analysis are described. These techniques have been applied to the separation and quantitative analysis of the macrolides in fermentation media, purity assessment of raw materials, assay of pharmaceutical dosage forms and the measurement of clinically useful macrolide antibiotics in biological samples such as blood, plasma, serum, urine and tissues.

40|$|Cell {{extracts}} of Streptomyces antibioticus, an oleandomycin producer, can inactivate oleandomycin in {{the presence}} of UDP-glucose. The inactivation can be detected through the loss of biological activity or by alteration in the chromatographic mobility of the antibiotic. This enzyme activity also inactivates other macrolides (<b>rosaramicin,</b> methymycin, and lankamycin) which contain a free 2 '-OH group in a monosaccharide linked to the lactone ring (with the exception of erythromycin), but not those which contain a disaccharide (tylosin, spiramycin, carbomycin, josamycin, niddamycin, and relomycin). Interestingly, the culture supernatant contains another enzyme activity capable of reactivating the glycosylated oleandomycin and regenerating the biological activity through the release of a glucose molecule. - It is proposed that these two enzyme activities could'be {{an integral part of the}} oleandomycin biosynthetic pathway. Resistance to macrolides in producing actinomycetes has been studied in some detail, and several resistance genes have been cloned (1, 3, 4, 12, 15, 20). Analysis of the biochemical basis of the resistance indicates that ribosomal modification by means of methylation at specific sites in the 23 S rRNA seems to be a quite general resistance mechanis...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) infections {{has increased in}} Canada during the past 2 years. Most of these cases were imported from abroad. The PPNG strains from these cases were characterized with respect to susceptibility to 11 antibiotics, auxotype, and plasmid content. <b>Rosaramicin</b> and cefuroxime {{proved to be the}} most potent of the antibiotics tested. The molecular characterization of the isolates indicated that all carried a 2. 6 -megadalton cryptic plasmid. Most of the PPNG isolates (87 %) harbored a 4. 5 -megadalton penicillinase-producing plasmid, whereas only 13 % harbored the 3. 2 -megadalton penicillinase-producing plasmid. In those cases where contact tracing was possible, the correlation linking strains of Far Eastern etiology with carriage of the 4. 5 -megadalton plasmid was upheld. The penicillinase-producing strains were typed auxanographically in either the proline-requiring (57 %) or prototrophic groups (42 %). Substrate hydrolysis profiles and analytical isoelectric focusing of crude beta-lactamase extracts of several isolates has reconfirmed that these strains elaborate a type TEM- 1 enzyme. Several of the penicillinase-producing plasmids were also examined for plasmid stability...|$|E
40|$|Ureaplasma urealyticum organisms (ureaplasmas) were {{isolated}} {{in large numbers}} (up to 10 (8) colour changing units (ccu) /ml) {{over a period of}} four years from the urethra of a man with hypogammaglobulinaemia and non-gonococcal urethritis. Elimination of Mycoplasma hominis by antibiotic treatment early {{in the course of the}} urethritis did not diminish the severity of his condition, which indicated that this mycoplasma was not a cause. Courses of treatment with tetracyclines, spectinomycin, erythromycin, <b>rosaramicin,</b> and clindamycin on each occasion reduced the numbers of ureaplasma isolated from the urethra and the severity of disease. The organisms were not eliminated, however, sometimes due to the development of antibiotic resistance, and the urethritis recurred. Though netilmicin was not particularly effective in vitro, it was effective clinically, the disease resolving and the organisms disappearing for five months. Recurrence of urethritis, accompanied by epididymitis, was associated this time with the recovery of a different (tetracycline sensitive) ureaplasma strain; the urethritis and epididymitis were treated successfully with a combination of netilmicin and doxycycline. The administration of ureaplasma antiserum did not seem to be instrumental in eradicating the ureaplasmas. The various antibiotics had a greater influence on the mycoplasmas in the urethra than on those in the throat and joints, perhaps because the antibiotics were concentrated in the urogenital tract. The close association between the occurrence of urethritis and the ureaplasmas suggests strongly that they were responsible for it...|$|E
40|$|Production of the {{macrolide}} antibiotic, tylosin, occurs by {{a combination}} of polyketide synthesis and deoxyhexose sugar metabolism in S. fradiae. Polyketide synthesis was stimulated by glycosylated tylosin-precursors, and by tylosin itself, in an S. fradiae strain disrupted in the glycosyltransferase responsible for the addition of mycaminose. The addition of mycaminose is the essential first step in the conversation of the polyketide ring, tylactone, to tylosin. In the absence of glycosylated material, the strain disrupted in mycaminose addition produced no significant amounts of any tylosin precursor. The possibility that this effect might have been the result of downstream effects on a gene, ccr, thought to be involved in polyketide synthesis was refuted by analysis of a strain disrupted in ccr. The behaviour of strains disrupted in orf 1 *, putatively encoding an isomerase and in tylMI, encoding a methyltransferase involved in mycaminose synthesis were also analysed. orf 1 * was revealed to contain an authentic mycaminose-specific gene, designated tylMIII. Both these disrupted strains and the tylB mutant, altered in an aminotransferase gene also required for mycaminose synthesis but located over 45 kb from its functional counterparts, behaved similarly to the mycaminosyltransferase disrupted strain with respect to stimulation of polyketide synthesis. The stimulation of polyketide synthesis was shown to be a catalytic effect which could also be provoked by other glycosylated macrolides, <b>rosaramicin</b> and spiramycin but not by erythromycin, carbomycin or chalcomycin. The possible involvement of recently discovered regulatory genes associated with the tylosin biosynthetic cluster was investigated and interesting preliminary data were obtained...|$|E
