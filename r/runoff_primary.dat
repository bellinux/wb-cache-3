25|$|Badillo unsuccessfully {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} {{for mayor of}} New York in 1969, 1973, 1977, 1981 and 1985, coming closest on his second attempt when he was defeated by then-New York City Comptroller Abe Beame in a <b>runoff</b> <b>primary.</b> In 1981 and 1985 he did not appear on the ballot, but dropped out after early moves to stage a campaign failed to generate broad enough support. In 2001 Badillo unsuccessfully sought the Republican mayoral nomination, losing badly to billionaire businessman and political neophyte Michael Bloomberg who would later prevail in the general election.|$|E
500|$|After Beckham {{declined}} {{to run for}} governor, the anti-Laffoon faction supported Chandler against Rhea. During the primary campaign, Chandler seized upon the unpopular sales tax, labeling Rhea [...] "Sales Tax Tom" [...] and calling on the electorate to redeem the state from [...] "Ruby, Rhea, and Ruin". In {{the first round of}} the primary, Rhea garnered 203,010 votes to Chandler's 189,575. Frederick A. Wallis received 38,410 votes and Elam Huddleston received 15,501. The votes for Wallis and Huddleston meant that neither Rhea nor Chandler had achieved a majority, triggering the <b>runoff</b> <b>primary.</b> Both Wallis and Huddleston backed Chandler in the runoff, and Chandler defeated Rhea by a vote of 260,573 to 234,124 to secure the nomination.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Parker {{had also}} been the Louisiana welfare commissioner. She was the Democratic {{national}} committeewoman from Louisiana from 1948 to 1952 and was therefore a staunch party loyalist. As Dodd attested to her speaking talent, in the 1964 Democratic gubernatorial <b>runoff</b> <b>primary</b> campaign, she delivered a speech entitled [...] "All That Glitters Is Not Gold." [...] Though a line from Shakespeare, Mrs. Parker's speech was really a vituperative attack on the record of McKeithen's intraparty opponent, former New Orleans Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{even lower}} turnout <b>runoff</b> <b>primary,</b> Grover {{defeated}} Fay (1913–1992), the Republican national committeeman from Texas (1960–1969). [...] Grover received 37,842 votes (66.4 percent), some 700 more votes than he {{received in the}} first primary, to Fay's 19,166 (33.6 percent), or 5,000 fewer votes than he obtained in the primary. [...] The Sharpstown bank scandal, which had damaged many of the state's Democratic leaders, worked to Grover's advantage, for he could depict himself as an untainted Republican nominee for governor. [...] His uncompromising conservative, constitutionalist views may have hurt him among moderate voters in both parties.|$|E
2500|$|Guste was a one-term {{state senator}} from Orleans Parish from 1968 to 1972, {{but he had}} {{ambition}} beyond the legislature and ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New Orleans in the 1969 Democratic primary. Two other candidates, Maurice [...] "Moon" [...] Landrieu, with 33,093 votes, and James Edward Fitzmorris Jr., with 59,301 ballots, went into a <b>runoff</b> <b>primary.</b> Guste polled 29,487 votes, just 3,606 ballots behind Landrieu. Landrieu then scored a come-from-behind victory over Fitzmorris. Landrieu {{then went on to}} defeat the Republican mayoral candidate, Ben C. Toledano, in the general election held in the spring of 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Crichton {{traveled}} to Junction, Texas, {{during the campaign}} to meet with former Democratic Governor Coke Stevenson, the official loser by eighty-seven votes in the 1948 <b>runoff</b> <b>primary</b> for the U.S. Senate against Lyndon Johnson. Stevenson had supported John Tower in the 1960 senatorial general election against Johnson and was backing Goldwater in 1964 {{as well in the}} presidential contest. Stevenson told Crichton that the election [...] "is an important part of American history, for it got Lyndon to the Senate, which he later controlled, and was a stepping stone to his becoming President. As for me, I was depressed for quite a while, but in retrospect it has allowed me to enjoy my ranch and my young daughter. With that, we had another bourbon and branch water, and I thanked him and departed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Garrett {{returned}} the favor {{two years later}} and defeated Davis in a rematch. Davis returned {{to his home in}} Sulphur Springs and engaged in Chautauqua work and prohibition work after 1916. He joined the second Ku Klux Klan in his later years. In 1932 he came out of political retirement to oppose Joseph W. Bailey, Jr., for congressman-at-large in the Democratic primaries. The elder Joseph W. Bailey had been a vehement foe of Populism in the 1890s. Davis lost in the <b>runoff</b> <b>primary.</b> He legally changed his name to [...] "James Harvey Cyclone Davis" [...] in 1932. He remarried Maude V. Woods in 1935, after his first wife died, and moved to Kaufman, Texas, where he died on January 31, 1940. [...] Cyclone Davis was buried in the City Cemetery of Sulphur Springs, Texas.|$|E
2500|$|Moore soon {{moved to}} the {{district}} attorney's office, working as the first full-time prosecutor in Etowah County. During his tenure there, Moore was investigated by the state bar for [...] "suspect conduct" [...] after convening a grand jury to examine what he perceived to have been funding shortages in the sheriff's office. Several weeks after the state bar investigation was dismissed as unfounded, Moore quit his prosecuting position to run as a Democrat for the county's circuit-court judge seat in 1982. The election was bitter, with Moore alleging that cases were being delayed in exchange for payoffs. The allegations were never substantiated, and Moore overwhelmingly lost the Democratic <b>runoff</b> <b>primary</b> to fellow attorney Donald Stewart, whom Moore described as [...] "an honorable man for whom I have much respect, and he eventually became a close friend." [...] A second bar complaint against Moore followed, and though this too was dismissed as unfounded, Moore left Gadsden shortly thereafter.|$|E
