5|$|Pennsylvania has a {{long history}} of stone arch bridges, {{including}} the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. Rubble or third-class masonry construction used stones just as they came from the quarry; squared-stone or second-class masonry used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared; and ashlar or first-class masonry used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared. <b>Rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest tolerances. Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> techniques.|$|E

40|$|For many decades, stony {{debris from}} {{building}} and demolition sites was reused as road building material. Until recently {{there was no}} need to look for other uses for this mixture of concrete and <b>masonry</b> <b>rubble.</b> However, now that our supplies of marl and gravel (two of the three ingredients of mortar and concrete) are dwindling and prices are beginning to rise, the concrete industry is showing a growing interest in ways to recycle concrete <b>rubble.</b> Since <b>masonry</b> <b>rubble</b> can only be used as a granulate for road construction in combination with concrete rubble, a vision of a <b>masonry</b> <b>rubble</b> heap without any takers looms ahead if no alternative application is found. Anticipating the problem,civil engineer Koen Van Dijk of the Civil Engineering Materials Science department at tu Delft has developed a number of processing techniques for reusing <b>masonry</b> <b>rubble.</b> Van Dijk was recently gained his doctorate for developing a process that can extract 50 % of the bricks from masonry debris from buildings that have been dismantled selectively. He also uses a magnetic technique to extract the brick fraction from the remaining masonry debris. Mixed with fresh clay it becomes the raw material for a new generation of bricks, thus closing the clay brick cycle. Delft University of Technolog...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{heterogeneous}} and fine-grained <b>masonry</b> <b>rubble</b> {{can only}} be recycled at very low level. To overcome this limitation, the material was employed as feedstock {{for the production of}} lightweight aggregates in a thermal process similar to that used in the manufacture of expanded clay and expanded slate. To that end, the fundamental suitability of <b>masonry</b> <b>rubble</b> as a raw material was evaluated. Experiments were carried out which indicated that lightweight granules with defined, adjustable properties similar to those of natural-materialbased aggregates could be manufactured from <b>masonry</b> <b>rubble.</b> Structural lightweight concretes produced with these secondary aggregates achieved comparable performance to lightweight concretes produced with conventional expanded clay. Lightweight recycled building material aggregates represent a product that hardly requires any primary resources in its manufacture...|$|R

Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century round tower at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule. After the eleventh century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there was increasing influences from English and continental European designs, such as the Romanesque chevron pattern detailing on the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral, and the thirteenth century East-end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery. In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture.
