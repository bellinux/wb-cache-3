25|$|Also in 1934, {{scientists}} Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck, {{produced the}} radioactive isotope tritium by hitting deuterium with high energy nuclei. The deuterium {{used in the}} experiment was a generous gift of heavy water from the Berkeley physicist Gilbert N Lewis. Interestingly, bombarding deuterium produced two previously undetected isotopes, helium-3 and hydrogen-3. Rutherford and his colleagues successfully created tritium, but incorrectly assumed that helium-3 was the radioactive component. The work of Luis Walter Alvarez and Robert Cornog first isolated tritium and reversed Rutherford's incorrect notion. Alvarez reasoned that tritium was radioactive, but did not measure the half life, although calculations at the time suggested over ten years. At the end of World War II, the physical chemist Willard Libby detected the <b>residual</b> <b>radioactivity</b> of a tritium sample with a Geiger counter, providing a more accurate understanding of the half life, now accepted at 12.3 years.|$|E
500|$|Although Martin Marietta {{completed}} its AEC contract and its lease expired on December 21, 1966, {{it had to}} stay at the reactor site [...] "until radiation contamination was brought to acceptable levels". Martin Marietta partially decontaminated the site, and in April 1967 undertook a joint radiological survey with Penn State and the AEC. The survey found [...] "licensable [...] quantities of strontium-90 stayed behind as structural contamination and <b>residual</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in piping and tanks, estimated at about 0.2 curies". This met the standards for that day, although Penn State did raise questions about the contamination remaining. Strontium is chemically very similar to calcium (both are alkaline earth metals) and can be absorbed by the body, where it is chiefly incorporated into bones. Strontium-90 decays by beta decay and has a half-life of 29 years; when it is in the body, its radioactivity can lead to bone cancer and leukemia.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy became the {{standard}} procedure in early breast cancer surgery. Faculty members might be exposed to a trace amount of radiation. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the radiation exposure and verify the safety of the procedure and the facilities, especially during pathologic process. Materials and Methods: Sentinel lymph node biopsies with Tc- 99 m human serum albumin were performed as routine clinical work. Exposed radiation doses were measured in pathologic technologist, nuclear medicine technologist, and nuclear medicine physician using a thermoluminescence dosimeter (TLD) during one month. We also measured the <b>residual</b> <b>radioactivities</b> or absorbed dose rates, the exposure distance and time during procedure, the radiation dose of the waste and the ambient equivalent dose of the pathology laboratory. Results: Actual exposed doses were 0. 21 and 0. 85 (uSv/study) for the whole body and hand of pathology technologist after 47 sentinel node pathologic preparations were performed. Whole body exposed doses of nuclear medicine physician and technologist were 0. 2 and 2. 3 (uSv/study). According to this data and the exposure threshold of the general population (1 mSv), at least 1100 studies were allowed in pathology technologist. The calculated exposed dose rates (μSv/study) from <b>residual</b> <b>radioactivities</b> data were 2. 47 / 22. 4 μSv (whole body/ hand) for the surgeon; 0. 22 / 0 μSv for operation nurse.

Estimates for IUdR-DNA incorporation in tumor tissue (Ki) required pharmacokinetic modeling and fitting of the 0 - 48 min dynamically acquired data to correct the 24 -h image data for <b>residual,</b> nonincorporated <b>radioactivity</b> that did not clear from the tissue during the 24 -h period after IUdR injection. Standard uptake values (SUVs) and tumor:brain activity ratios (Tm:Br) were also calculated from the 24 -h image data. The Ki, SUV, and Tm/Br values were related to tumor type and grade, tumor labeling index, and survival after the PET scan, The plasma half-life of [I- 124]IUdR was short (2 - 3 min), and the arterial plasma input function was similar between patients (48 +/- 12 SUV*min). Plasma clearance of the major radiolabeled metabolite ([I- 124]iodide) varied somewhat between patients and was markedly prolonged in one patient with renal insufficiency. It was apparent from our analysis that a sizable fraction (15 - 93 %) of <b>residual</b> nonincorporated <b>radioactivity</b> (largely [I- 124]iodide) remained in the tumors after the 24 -h washout period, and this fraction varied between the different tumor groups. Because the SUV and Tm:Br ratio values reflect both IUdR-DNA incorporated and exchangeable nonincorporated <b>radioactivity,</b> any <b>residual</b> nonincorporated <b>radioactivity</b> will amplify their values and distort their significance and interpretation. This was particularly apparent in the meningioma and glioblastoma multiforme groups of tumors. Mean tumor Ki values ranged between 0. 5 +/- 0. 9 (meningiomas) and 3. 9 +/- 2. 3 mu l/min/g (peak value for glioblastoma multiforme, GEM). Comparable SW and Tm:Br values at 24 h ranged from 0. 13 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 29 +/- 0. 19 and from 2. 0 +/- 0. 6 to 6. 1 +/- 1. 5 for meningiomas and peak GBMs, respectively. Thus, the range of values was much greater for Ki (similar to 8 -fold) compared with that for SUV (similar to 2. 2 -fold) and Tm:Br (similar to 3 -fold). The expected relationships between Iii, SUV, and Tm:Br and other measures of tumor proliferation (tumor type and grade, labeling index, and patient survival) were observed. However, greater image specificity and significance of the SUV and Tm:Br values would be obtained by achieving greater washout and clearance of the exchangeable fraction of <b>residual</b> (background) <b>radioactivity</b> in the tumors, i. e., by increased hydration and urinary clearance and possibly by imaging later than 24 h after [I- 124]IUdR administration...|$|R

In India, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre started irradiating gemstones in the early 1970s.

30|$|When {{extraterrestrial}} {{materials are}} {{returned to the}} earth by future space missions, these materials are {{to be subjected to}} the initial examination. For such purposes, measurements are desired to be done non-destructively. In this study, we investigated the applicability of non-destructive prompt gamma-ray analysis (PGA) for determining chemical composition of the returned materials, focusing on levels of induced radioactivities and the effect on isotopic composition by PGA. Under current conditions applied for the PGA facility at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, essentially no <b>residual</b> <b>radioactivities</b> remain after appropriate cooling, making the same specimen analyzed by PGA usable for further research without any restriction. The effect on isotopic composition by PGA was examined both for neutron-induced reactions and for neutron-induced nuclear fission of 235 U. No significant effect can be brought by neutron-induced reactions even for some noble gas nuclides such as 80 Kr and 128 I, which can be augmented by (n, γ) reactions on neighboring halogens. Neutron-induced nuclear fission reactions of 235 U yield essentially no effect on isotopic composition. In addition, PGA has several advantages over other nondestructive analytical methods such as instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF); INAA leaves a significant level of induced-radioactivities and SR-XRF yields less reliable and less accurate values for elemental composition. Judging from these features and characteristics, it is concluded that PGA {{can be one of the}} most suitable analytical methods potentially applicable for initial analysis of returned samples from space.|$|R

Rats with 15 d of biliary obstruction underwent BD, BJ, and BJD drainage and were compared with a group submitted to simulated operation (SO) and biliary obstruction (CBO). The serum values of total and fractional bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aminotransferases (AST and ALT), as well as hepatobiliointestinal excretion determined with (99 m) Tc-Disida, were used for comparison. In addition, we used morphometric analyses to estimate the mass of the hepatocytes, bile ducts, and liver fibrosis. We also counted hepatic stellate cells (SC). Results. For each of the three modalities of biliary drainage, there were significant reductions in bilirubin, AST, ALP, and the number of SCs. The recovery of the estimated mass of all histologic components occurred only after BJ and BJD; in the BD group, the estimated hepatocyte mass was reduced compared with the SO group. The <b>residual</b> hepatic <b>radioactivity</b> of (99 m) Tc-Disida was greater in the BJD group than in the SO group. Conclusions. The interposition of the jejunal loop between the biliary tree and the intestine may slow hepatobiliary clearance of radioactivity, even though it provides the resolution of cholestasis and is effective in recovering from hepatic lesions.

Tumor-bearing dogs are an excellent model of human NHL with similar clinical characteristics, behavior, and compressed clinical course. Canine in vivo imaging studies will provide valuable biodistribution and affinity information that reflects a diverse clinical population of lymphoma. This may also help to determine potential dose-limiting radiotoxicity to organs in human clinical trials. To validate this construct in a naturally occurring model of NHL, we performed in-vivo molecular targeted imaging and biodistribution in 3 normal dogs and 5 NHL bearing dogs.

40|$|Radioactive waste {{has been}} {{accumulated}} at CERN as unavoidable consequence of the use of particle accelerators. The elimination of this waste towards the ﬁnal repositories in France and Switzerland requires {{the determination of}} the radionuclide inventory. In order to calculate the <b>residual</b> induced <b>radioactivity</b> in the waste, it is necessary to determine the spectra of secondary particles which are responsible for the material activation. In complex irradiation environments like in an accelerator tunnel it is expected that the secondary particle spectra vary with the characteristics of the machine components in a given section of tunnel. In order to obtain the production rates of the radionuclides of interest the spectra of secondary particles are to be folded with the appropriate cross sections. Though technically feasible, it would be impractical to calculate the particle spectra in every area of any machine and for all possible beam loss mechanisms. Moreover, a fraction of the waste has unknown radiological history, which makes it impossible to associate an item of waste to a precise area of the machine. Therefore it is useful to try to calculate “representative spectra”, which shall apply to a relatively large part of the accelerator complex at CERN. This thesis is dedicated to the calculation of representative spectra in the arcs of the 450 GeV proton synchrotron, SPS, at CERN. The calculations have been performed using the Monte Carlo code FLUKA. Extensive simulations have been done to assess the dependence of proton, neutron and pion spectra on beam energy, size of the nearby machine component and position with respect to the beam-loss point. The results obtained suggest that it is possible to deﬁne one single set of representative spectra for all the arcs of the SPS accelerator, with a minor error {{associated with the use of}} these. ...|$|R

Diagnostic pa rameters included half-time (5), emptying renographic patterns (3, 6) and <b>residual</b> renal <b>radioactivity</b> at 30 mm (7). With this methodology, however, {{a high percentage of}} false-positive and indeterminate studies were found, which raised doubts as to the usefulness of the test (2). Two main problems remain to be solved. First, kidneys with impaired or immature function may show a subop timal response to diuretics and thus, produce inadequate urine output and prolonged washout times. Second, a dilated collecting system will require a larger diuretic response to clear the activity and often shows delayed washout times (8). These two conditions are the most common causes of false-positive results in diuretic reno grams. The Whitaker test (9) is invasive and employs a flow rate that may be too stressful for neonates (10). Contro versy still exists regarding the optimal flow rate (11). This test is performed infrequently at our institution. Although diuretic renography remains the most useful noninvasive diagnostic test for hydronephrosis (8), a technique is needed to help reduce false-positive results caused by impaired renal function and collecting system dilatation. In this study, we introduce the normalized slope ratio (SRn), a parameter obtained by dividing the maximal slope of the diuretic clearance curve by the maximal slope of the uptake portion of the standard renogram, each normalized to maximal activity (Fig. 1). This ratio may be less affected by renal function and volume of the collecting system than other parameters. If this were true, an improvement in specificity and accuracy would be demonstrated. We used this test to evaluate 94 renal units and compared the results to those of standard half time, clearance slope and percent retention...|$|R

40|$|Measurement of {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} (CBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) with 15 O-labelled water is commonly achieved using the one-compartment model of Kety. Unlike this model, a recently developed two-compartment CBF model accounts for nonextracted intravascular radioactivity and therefore provides with perfusion (CBF) as well as vascular, i. e., blood volume (CBV) related, information. The two parameters obtained from this two-compartment analysis, namely cerebral water clearance, KH 2 O 1, a measure of perfusion, and the apparent tracer distribution volume, Vo, provide more complete haemodynamic information than CBF alone. Still, accurate K 1 values can only be obtained if appropriate corrections for tracer delay (Deltat) and dispersion (tau) have been applied. Building on this two-compartment model, we have derived new nonlinear and linear solutions where all parameters involved appear explicitly. Simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision with which K 1, k 2, Vo, Deltat and tau can be determined from multiparameter regression of the model equations on dynamic PET data. It was found that K 1 and k 2 can be estimated with less than 2 % error using 5 -parameter fitting. We have applied our solutions to dynamic 15 O-water bolus PET studies where a CBF change was produced either through neuronal activation triggered by visual stimulation (in normal subjects), or by external pharmacological control through vasodilatory insults induced by Diamox injection (in patients with cerebrovascular disease) and antioxidant LY 231617 administration (in monkeys with unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion). We found {{that in addition to}} accurate pixel-by-pixel estimation of K 1 and k 2, accurate changes in K 1, Vo and the ratio Vo/K 1 between baseline and activation states can also be obtained using our solutions of the two-compartment CBF model with implicit corrections for delay, dispersion and <b>residual</b> vascular <b>radioactivity.</b> These parameter changes provide potential indices of cerebrovascular reserve capacity, and of variations in cerebral vascular volume and mean vascular transit time.

When the labeled complex was incubated for 30 min with isolated ileal cells under conditions that block cellular metabolism, virtually all cellular radioactivity could be removed by washing the cell surface with EDTA or acid. In contrast, washing removed only half the radioactivity from cells incubated at 37 °C in O 2. When <b>residual</b> cellular <b>radioactivity</b> was extracted and analyzed by gel filtration, 80 - 94 % of both the 35 S and 57 Co radioactivity eluted in the same fractions as the original complex. The remaining 6 - 20 % eluted as free [57 Co]cobalamin or [35 S]methionine. To examine events occurring after 30 min, we instilled into tied-off ileal loops of intact guinea pigs radiolabeled intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex and extracted nondissociable radioactivity 2 - 4. 5 h later. The proportion of extracted 57 Co eluting as free cobalamin increased to 39 - 46 %, that eluting as intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex declined to 22 - 45 %, and 9 - 34 % now eluted as a macromolecule that reacted with antitranscobalamin II antibody but not antiintrinsic factor antibody. Extracted 35 S radioactivity eluted in several peaks {{in addition to the}} intrinsic factor peak. These findings suggest that (a) after reversible attachment of intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex to its ileal surface receptor, an energy-dependent process prevents removal of the complex from the cell surface by EDTA or acid; (b) cobalamin dissociates from intrinsic factor and, as suggested by previous workers, binds to a molecule antigenically similar to transcobalamin II; and (c) intrinsic factor is slowly degraded and forms breakdown products that are detectable in ileal extracts...|$|R

Proteins were labelled by infusion of [3 H]leucine for 0. 5 h in vitro. A complete amino acid mixture was then added at 3 times normal rat extracellular concentrations. After labelling, the re-incorporation of [3 H]leucine was competitively inhibited by addition of either 4 mM-leucine or 20 microM-cycloheximide. The <b>residual</b> unincorporated <b>radioactivity</b> and the preferentially labelled rapid-turnover proteins were eliminated during a 3 h preliminary perfusion period. The basal rate of release of [3 H]leucine and percentage changes were then determined at 1 min intervals, by using each heart as its own control. Leucine metabolism was inconsequential to results. Exchange of intracellular leucine pools with extracellular leucine and subsequent release in effluent perfusate was 95 % complete within approx. 2 min. The basal rate of protein degradation was unchanged by electrical stimulation of the heart rate to 360 beats/min or cessation of contractile activity by membrane depolarization under 25 mM-KCl. Infusion of the beta-agonist isoprenaline at 5 - 500 nM caused a graded inhibition of myocardial protein degradation within 5 - 6 min, with a maximum inhibition of 30 %. This inhibition was sustained for at least 1 h of drug administration and was reversed within 4 - 6 min of cessation of isoprenaline or simultaneous infusion of 1 microM of the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol. Minute-to-minute adrenergic proteolytic control was a simultaneous co-variable with beta-receptor-mediated inotropic changes in right-intraventricular systolic pressure. Stoppage of the heart in asystole by the Ca 2 +-channel blocker nifedipine (0. 7 microM) delayed the onset, but did not cause sustained reversal, of adrenergic-inhibited degradation, indicating the absence of a direct obligatory mechanistic linkage between the events of the contraction-relaxation cycle and protein degradation in this preparation...|$|R

Eating many {{over a long period of}} time without having taken remedial measures, however, might result in radiation doses higher than internationally agreed safety levels." [...] IAEA estimated that living in the atoll and consuming local food would result in an effective dose of about 15 mSv/year.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1934, {{scientists}} Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck, {{produced the}} radioactive isotope tritium by hitting deuterium with high energy nuclei. The deuterium {{used in the}} experiment was a generous gift of heavy water from the Berkeley physicist Gilbert N Lewis. Interestingly, bombarding deuterium produced two previously undetected isotopes, helium-3 and hydrogen-3. Rutherford and his colleagues successfully created tritium, but incorrectly assumed that helium-3 was the radioactive component. The work of Luis Walter Alvarez and Robert Cornog first isolated tritium and reversed Rutherford's incorrect notion. Alvarez reasoned that tritium was radioactive, but did not measure the half life, although calculations at the time suggested over ten years. At the end of World War II, the physical chemist Willard Libby detected the <b>residual</b> <b>radioactivity</b> of a tritium sample with a Geiger counter, providing a more accurate understanding of the half life, now accepted at 12.3 years.|$|E
5000|$|Although Martin Marietta {{completed}} its AEC contract and its lease expired on December 21, 1966, {{it had to}} stay at the reactor site [...] "until radiation contamination was brought to acceptable levels". Martin Marietta partially decontaminated the site, and in April 1967 undertook a joint radiological survey with Penn State and the AEC. The survey found [...] "licensable [...] quantities of strontium-90 stayed behind as structural contamination and <b>residual</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in piping and tanks, estimated at about 0.2 curies". This met the standards for that day, although Penn State did raise questions about the contamination remaining. Strontium is chemically very similar to calcium (both are alkaline earth metals) and can be absorbed by the body, where it is chiefly incorporated into bones. Strontium-90 decays by beta decay and has a half-life of 29 years; when it is in the body, its radioactivity can lead to bone cancer and leukemia.|$|E
40|$|At {{the request}} of the USDOE, a team from ORNL {{conducted}} an independent radiological verification survey at the former Bridgeport Brass Company Facility, Seymour, Connecticut, from September 1992 to March 1993. Purpose of the survey was to determine whether <b>residual</b> levels of <b>radioactivity</b> inside the Ruffert Building and selected adjacent areas were rmediated to levels below DOE guidelines for FUSRAP sites. The property was contaminated with radioactive residues of {sup 238 }U from uranium processing experiments conducted by Reactive Metals, Inc., from 1962 to 1964 for the Atomic Energy Commission. A previous radiological survey did not characterize the entire floor space because equipment which could not be moved at the time made it inaccessible for radiological surveys. During the remediation process, additional areas of elevated radioactivity were discovered under stationary equipment, which required additional remediation and further verification. Results of the independent radiological verification survey confirm that, {{with the exception of the}} drain system inside the building, residual uranium contamination has been remediated to levels below DOE guidelines for unrestricted release of property at FUSRAP sites inside and outside the Ruffert Building. However, certain sections of the drain system retain uranium contamination above DOE surface guideline levels. These sections of pipe are addressed in separate, referenced documentation...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear waste at Savannah River Site (SRS) waste tanks {{consists}} of three different types of waste forms. They are the lighter salt solutions referred to as supernate, the precipitated salts as salt cake, and heavier fine solids as sludge. The sludge is settled on the tank floor. About half of the <b>residual</b> waste <b>radioactivity</b> is contained in the sludge, which is only about 8 {{percentage of the total}} waste volume. Mixing study to be evaluated here for the Salt Disposition Integration (SDI) project focuses on supernate preparations in waste tanks prior to transfer to the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) feed tank. The methods to mix and blend the contents of the SRS blend tanks were evalutaed to ensure that the contents are properly blended before they are transferred from the blend tank such as Tank 50 H to the SWPF feed tank. The work {{consists of}} two principal objectives to investigate two different pumps. One objective is to identify a suitable pumping arrangement that will adequately blend/mix two miscible liquids to obtain a uniform composition in the tank with a minimum level of sludge solid particulate in suspension. The other is to estimate the elevation in the tank at which the transfer pump inlet should be located where the solid concentration of the entrained fluid remains below the acceptance criterion (0. 09 wt% or 1200 mg/liter) during transfer operation to the SWPF. Tank 50 H is a Waste Tank that will be used to prepare batches of salt feed for SWPF. The salt feed must be a homogeneous solution satisfying the acceptance criterion of the solids entrainment during transfer operation. The work described here consists of two modeling areas. They are the mixing modeling analysis during miscible liquid blending operation, and the flow pattern analysis during transfer operation of the blended liquid. The modeling results will provide quantitative design and operation information during the mixing/blending process and the transfer operation of the blended liquid in the Salt Disposition Integration (SDI) facility. The results will also help validate the anticipated performance of the pump vendor's design...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{framework}} of the European Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS), studies were carried out on the radioactive material management from future commercial fusion power plants, including among others: clearance and recycling, tritiated waste, waste categorisation, interim storage and final disposal. The present paper is focused on the important role that clearance will have in the management of such material flows. From different studies, performed inside the European Fusion Technology Programme, it is evident that fusion radioactive materials will be characterised by the following specific aspects: • Large volumes; • Mostly solid activated and contaminated material; • Reduced radioactivity in the medium term (< 100 y), no radioactivity in the long term, due to a careful selection of materials; • Low heat generation density and low radiotoxicity; • No transuranic elements beyond trace levels; • No proliferation concerns. These aspects will ensure that fusion materials can be managed so as to leave reduced or even no burden to future generations. The only significant management issue is the relatively large quantities of radioactive materials calculated to be produced. The possibility of drastically reducing this amount is based on the clearance and recycling of material arising from a fusion power plant. While clearance is based on the <b>residual</b> content of <b>radioactivity,</b> recycling involves also a mixture of socio-economic and environmental issues that are being investigated. The present paper will be mostly focused on the important role that might be played by well-defined and harmonised clearance criteria on fusion material management. A categorisation based on the neutron transport and activation calculations carried out on the four different PPCS models has revealed the importance that might be played by the clearance process on the reduction of the amount of material requiring disposal. The four investigated PPCS models span a range from relatively near term, based on limited plasma physics and technology extrapolations, to a rather advanced concept. The technological issues are determined by the different combinations of materials such as armour, structural material, coolant, breeder and neutron multiplier. The activation of the materials in all four Models decays relatively rapidly - very rapidly at first and broadly by a factor ten thousand over a hundred years. For much of this material, after an adequate decay time, the activity falls to levels so low that it could be "cleared" from regulatory control. The estimated share of clearable material ranges up to about 50 % of the total mass after 100 years. Exploiting to a full extent the possibility to carry out recycling would reduce to a very limited quantity the amount of material to be disposed o...|$|R
