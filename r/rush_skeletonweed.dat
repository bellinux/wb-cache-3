50|$|Threats to {{this plant}} include fire suppression, which {{prevents}} a natural fire regime {{that would normally}} exclude larger plants from the open meadow habitat and ecotone. The species is native to a very fire-prone habitat, with hot, dry summers and many lightning-sparked wildfires in a normal season. The plant is expected to become rarer as fire suppression continues in its habitat. Other threats include degradation of the habitat by invasive species of plants such as Centaurea solstitialis, the yellow starthistle. Other noxious weeds in the habitat include Chondrilla juncea (<b>rush</b> <b>skeletonweed),</b> Taeniatherum caput-medusae (medusahead), and Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle). Logging has caused damage to the habitat via soil disruption; however, careful selective logging may clear some of the overgrowth caused by fire suppression. Livestock grazing injures {{the leaves of the}} rare plant, reducing its reproductive potential. Plants may now be limited to ungrazed sites. Mining, road construction, off-road vehicle use, and horticultural collecting are also threats. Herbivory by native wildlife and insects may cause the loss of buds and other plant parts.|$|E
40|$|Of two {{natural product}} phytotoxins, maculosins- 1 and- 2, {{produced}} by Alternaria alternata on spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), only maculosin- 2 appeared active against intact knapweed plants. Furthermore, unlike host specific maculosin- 1, macu-losin- 2 exhibited phytotoxicity {{to a wide}} range of weedy plants including Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), hound’s tongue (Cynoglossum officinale), yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens), <b>rush</b> <b>skeletonweed</b> (Chondrilla juncea), dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), broad-leaved plantain (Plantago major), lamb’s-quarters (Chenopodium album), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), whitetop or hoary cress (Cardaria draba), common mallow (Malva neglec-ta), sulfur (erect) cinquefoil (Potentilla recta), and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). As such, maculosin- 2 and its synthetic analogs are good candidates for development as tar-get specific post-emergence herbicides. One measure of herbicidal activity is detection in the etiolated wheat coleoptile (Triticum aestivum L. cv Wakeland) bioassay.

40|$|Weed {{biocontrol}} {{by using}} Eriophid mites {{could be a}} safe and efficient strategy. In order to find an ecological non-chemical approach for controlling of weeds, and studying {{the possibility of using}} Eriophyid mites, field surveys were conducted in Razavi Khorasan and North Khorasan Provinces during spring 2010. Collecting of mites was carried out at all of the vegetative and reproductive stages of these target weeds. Twenty plants of each species were selected and transferred to laboratory after each sampling. The results showed that gall mite (Aceria drabae Nalepa 1890) (Acarina: Eriophyidae) is a suitable biocontrol agent for controlling hoary cress. It decreased shoot growth and seed number. Gall mite (Aceria chondrillae (G. Can.)) (Acarina: Eriophyidae) was able to prevent seed set and reproductive buds of <b>rush</b> <b>skeletonweed,</b> it could be considered as a potential promising biocontrol agent. Since, Eriophyid mites were able to reduce vegetative and reproductive characteristics of studied weed species, these could be considered as a potential promising biological control agents for using in ecological agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Description: <b>Rush</b> <b>skeletonweed</b> is a tap-rooted {{perennial}} plant {{native to}} central Asia. This weed germinates {{in the fall}} when the rains begin, and develops one or more rosettes from buds on established roots. Leaves are lance-shaped, one-half inch wide and up to two inches long, with a reddish color near the tips during winter. When daylight increases in spring, the plant is stimulated to develop a multi-branched upright stem from the root crown, growing up to 4 feet tall. The lower 4 - 6 inches of the stems are covered with coarse, downward pointing, reddish-brown hairs. Stems, leaves and roots produce a milky sap when broken. Flower production begins when stems reach maximum length in midsummer and continues until ended by frost. Mature, healthy plants can produce 1, 500 flower heads and up to 20, 000 seeds. Rosette leaves die off during flowering, leaving a skeleton-like appearance to the plant. Flower buds, blooming flowers and mature seeds are often on the same stem at the same time. After flowers fall, new rosettes are again established, continuing the cycle. The root system is slender and vertical, penetrating the soil to depths of eight feet or more. Roots develo...|$|E
40|$|Premise of the study: Assessing {{propagule}} {{pressure and}} geographic origins of invasive species provides {{insight into the}} invasion process. <b>Rush</b> <b>skeletonweed</b> (Chondrilla juncea; Asteraceae) is an apomictic, perennial plant that is invasive in Australia, South America (Argentina), and North America (Canada and the United States). This study comprehensively compares propagule pressure and geographic structure of genotypes to improve our understanding of a clonal invasion and enhance management strategies. Methods: We analyzed 1056 native range plants from Eurasia and 1156 plants from three invaded continents using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) techniques. We used measures of diversity (Simpson’s D) and evenness (E), analysis of molecular variance, and Mantel tests to compare invasions, and genotype similarity to determine origins of invasive genotypes. Key results: We found 682 unique genotypes in the native range, but only 13 in the invaded regions. Each invaded region contained distinct AFLP genotypes, suggesting independent introduction events, probably with different geographic origins. Relatively low propagule pressure was associated with each introduction around the globe, but levels of among-population variation differed. We found exact AFLP genotype matches between the native and invaded ranges for five of the 13 invasive genotypes. Conclusions: Invasion dynamics can vary across invaded ranges within a species. Intensive sampling for molecular analyses can provide insight for understanding intraspecific invasion dynamics, which can hold significance {{for the management of}} plant species, especially by finding origins and distributions of invasive genotypes for classical biological control efforts...|$|E
40|$|Sagebrush {{ecosystems}} exhibit widespread degrada-tion due to {{a variety}} of causes, including invasion by exotic plants, expansion of pinyon and juniper, altered fire regimes, excessive livestock grazing, urbanization and land development, conversion to agriculture, road development and use, mining, and energy development. These ecosystems have been identified as the most en-dangered in the United States with 20 percent of plant and animals associated with sagebrush ecosystems at risk of extirpation. Federal, state, and private land managers are increasingly concerned about the fate of sagebrush ecosystems and their associated species and are actively seeking approaches to restore and maintain them. Key Issues Invasive alien plants are expanding throughout the region affecting plant community composition and dis-turbance regimes—The most significant of these are fire-adapted annual grasses, such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and medusahead (Taenatherum caput-medusa), that have resulted in an annual grass-fire cycle and are rapidly replacing sagebrush and salt desert ecosystems. It is estimated that cheatgrass dominated a minimum of 2 million ha (7, 720 mi 2) or 5 percent of the Great Basin in the 1990 s (Bradley and Mustard 2005) - an additional 15 million ha (57, 900 mi 2) have been estimated to be at high risk of cheatgrass invasion within the next 30 years (Suring and others 2005). The expansion of invasive an-nual grasses across the region has increased fine fuels and the rate of fire spread, particularly in more arid Wyoming and basin big sagebrush ecosystems (Link and others 2006). In many parts of the region, an annual grass-fire cycle now exists in which fire return intervals have de-creased from about 60 to 110 years to as little as 3 to 5 years (Whisenant 1990). More recently, noxious weedy forbs have spread across the Great Basin. Particularly problematic in Wyoming and mountain big sagebrush communities are squarrose knapweed (Centaurea squar-rosa), yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), and <b>rush</b> <b>skeletonweed</b> (Chondrilla juncea).
