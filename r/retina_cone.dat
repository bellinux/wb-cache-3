40|$|In {{guinea pig}} retina, {{immunostaining}} reveals a dual gradient of opsins: cones expressing opsin sensitive to medium wavelengths (M) predominate {{in the upper}} retina, whereas cones expressing opsin sensitive to shorter wavelengths (S) predominate in the lower retina. Whether these gradients correspond to functional gradients in postreceptoral neurons is essentially unknown. Using monochromatic flashes, we measured the relative weights with which M, S, and rod signals contribute to horizontal cell responses. For a background that produced 4. 76 log 10 photoisomerizations per rod per second (Rh*/rod/s), mean weights in superior retina were 52 % (M), 2 % (S), and 46 % (rod). Mean weights in inferior retina were 9 % (M), 50 % (S), and 41 % (rod). In superior <b>retina,</b> <b>cone</b> opsin weights agreed quantitatively with relative pigment density estimates from immunostaining. In inferior <b>retina,</b> <b>cone</b> opsin weights agreed qualitatively with relative pigment density estimates, but quantitative comparison was impossible because individual cones coexpress both opsins to varying and unquantifiable degrees. We further characterized the functional gradients in horizontal and brisk-transient ganglion cells using flickering stimuli produced by various mixtures of blue and green primary lights. Cone weights for both cell types resembled those obtained for horizontal cells using monochromatic flashes. Because the brisk-transient ganglion cell is thought to mediate behavioral detection of luminance contrast, our {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that the dual gradient of cone opsins assists achromatic contrast detection against different spectral backgrounds.

40|$|We {{investigated}} gap-junctional coupling of {{rods and}} cones in macaque <b>retina.</b> <b>Cone</b> voltage responses evoked by light absorption in neighboring rods were briefer and smaller than responses {{recorded in the}} rods themselves. Rod detection thresholds, calculated from noise and response amplitude histograms, closely matched the threshold for an ideal detector limited by quantal fluctuations in the stimulus. Surprisingly, cone thresholds were only approximately two times higher. Amplitude fluctuations in cones {{could be explained by}} a Poisson distribution of photoisomerizations within a pool of seven or more coupled rods. Neurobiotin coupling between rods and cones was consistent with our electrical recordings, with approximately six rods labeled per injected cone. The spatial distribution of tracer-coupled rods matched the light-evoked cone receptive field. The gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone abolished both electrical and tracer coupling. Amplitude fluctuations in most rods were accounted for by the expected rate of light absorption in their outer segments. The fluctuations in some rods, however, were consistent with a summation pool of up to six rods. When single rods were injected with Neurobiotin, up to 10 rods were labeled. Rod-rod and rod-cone electrical coupling is expected to extend the range of scotopic vision by circumventing saturation at the rod to rod-bipolar cell synapse; however, because coupling also renders the rod synapse less effective at separating out photon signals from dark noise, coupling is expected to elevate the absolute threshold of dark-adapted observers...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} rod and cone distribution, organization, and phagocytosis in the diurnal mouse-like rodent Arvicanthis ansorgei.

For phagocytosis studies, retinas were sampled every 3 hours under a 12 -hour light-dark cycle and processed for double-label immunohistochemistry. The number of phagosomes in the retinal pigmented epithelium were quantified with a morphometric system. RESULTS: A. ansorgei retinas were composed of 33 % cones and 67 % rods, approximately 10 times more cones than mice and rats. Cones were arranged in two cell layers at the scleral surface, distributed uniformly {{across the entire}} <b>retina.</b> <b>Cone</b> arrestin was distributed throughout the dark-adapted cones, from outer segments to synapses, whereas short- and mid-wavelength cone opsins were restricted to outer segments. Short-wavelength cone density was mapped in wholemounted retinas, in a significantly higher number in the central region. Rhodopsin immunopositive (rod) phagosomes showed a small peak late in the dark phase, then a large burst 1 to 2 hours after light onset, after decreasing to low baseline levels by 12 AM.

To {{describe}} and classify the morphologic {{changes in a}} naturally occurring dog model of early-onset cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and to correlate these with earlier described clinical characteristics of the disease in dogs. METHODS. Purpose-bred Standard Wire-Haired Dachshunds (SWHDs) derived from a large pedigree of dogs with earlyonset CRD were euthanatized at defined ages to characterize morphologic changes in the disease process. Specimens were examined by light microscopy, including morphometric studies, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Peanut agglutinin (PNA), protein kinase C (PKC), synaptophysin (Syn), rhodopsin (Rho) - 63, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and short-wavelength cone opsin (OS) were used for immunohistochemical characterization. RESULTS. The photopic cone-system-derived ERG amplitudes were already significantly reduced or nonrecordable in CRD-affected dogs at 5 weeks, the earliest age studied. The outer retina was morphologically most severely affected initially, with a subsequent degeneration of the inner <b>retina.</b> <b>Cone</b> degeneration was more pronounced than rod degeneration in young CRD-affected dogs.

40|$|Abstract Background Retinitis pigmentosa is {{characterized}} by the sequential loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. The preservation of cones would prevent blindness due to their essential role in human vision. Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor is a thioredoxin-like protein that is secreted by rods and is involved in cone survival. To validate the activity of Rod-derived Cone Viability Factors (RdCVFs) as therapeutic agents for treating retinitis Pigmentosa, we have developed e-conome, an automated cell counting platform for retinal flat mounts of rodent models of cone degeneration. This automated quantification method allows for faster data analysis thereby accelerating translational research. Methods An inverted fluorescent microscope, motorized and coupled to a CCD camera records images of cones labeled with fluorescent peanut agglutinin lectin on flat-mounted retinas. In an average of 300 fields per retina, nine Z-planes at magnification X 40 are acquired after two-stage autofocus individually for each field. The projection of the stack of 9 images is subject to a threshold, filtered to exclude aberrant images based on preset variables. The cones are identified by treating the resulting image using 13 variables empirically determined. The cone density is calculated over the 300 fields. Results The method was validated by comparison to the conventional stereological counting. The decrease in cone density in rd 1 mouse was found to be equivalent to the decrease determined by stereological counting. We also studied the spatiotemporal pattern of the degeneration of cones in the rd 1 mouse and show that while the reduction in cone density starts in {{the central part of the}} <b>retina,</b> <b>cone</b> degeneration progresses at the same speed over the whole retinal surface.

We investigated the expression and targeting of several key elements of ribbon synapses and analyzed the cone morphology in the Ca(V) 1. 4 (α(1 F)) knockout retina. Our data demonstrate that most abnormalities occur after eye opening. Indeed, scaffolding proteins such as Bassoon and RIM 2 are properly targeted at first, but their expression and localization are not maintained in adulthood.

To further investigate this possibility, we compared spectral sensitivity among bowerbird species that occupy different visual habitats and are highly diverged in plumage and decoration colour displays, which are important in mate choice and possibly reproductive isolation. Microspectrophotometry of violet-, short-, medium- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones revealed no significant interspecific variation in visual pigment peak spectral absorbance values that ranged between 404 – 410, 454, 503 – 511 and 558 – 568 nm, respectively. Mean cut-off wavelength values for C-, Y-, R- and P-type coloured oil droplets were 418 – 441, 508 – 523, 558 – 573 and 412 – 503 nm, respectively, with values at longer wavelengths in ventral compared with dorsal <b>retina</b> <b>cones.</b> Low ocular media mid-wavelength transmission values (340 – 352 nm) suggest that bowerbirds may represent a transitional stage in the evolution from the ancestral violet-sensitive- to the derived ultraviolet-sensitive-type short-wavelength-sensitive- 1 -based visual system found in younger passerine lineages. Sequence data obtained for rod opsin and four cone opsin genes were identical at key tuning sites, except for an interspecific leucine- 52 -alanine polymorphism in the short-wavelength-sensitive 2 opsin.

40|$|In the {{mammalian}} <b>retina,</b> <b>cone</b> photoreceptors efficiently {{adapt to}} changing background light intensity and, therefore, {{are able to}} signal small differences in luminance between objects and backgrounds, even when the absolute intensity of the background changes over five to six orders of magnitude. Mammalian rod photoreceptors, in contrast, adapt very little and only at intensities that nearly saturate the amplitude of their photoresponse. In search of a molecular explanation for this observation we assessed Ca 2 +-dependent modulation of ligand sensitivity in cyclic GMP–gated (CNG) ion channels of intact mammalian rods and cones. Solitary photoreceptors were isolated by gentle proteolysis of ground squirrel retina. Rods and cones were distinguished by {{whether or not their}} outer segments bind PNA lectin. We measured membrane currents under voltage-clamp in photoreceptors loaded with Diazo- 2, a caged Ca 2 + chelator, and fixed concentrations of 8 Br-cGMP. At 600 nM free cytoplasmic Ca 2 + the midpoint of the cone CNG channels sensitivity to 8 BrcGMP, 8 BrcGMPK 1 / 2, is ∼ 2. 3 μM. The ligand sensitivity is less in rod than in cone channels. Instantly decreasing cytoplasmic Ca 2 + to < 30 nM activates a large inward membrane current in cones, but not in rods. Current activation arises from a Ca 2 + -dependent modulation of cone CNG channels, presumably because of an increase in their affinity to the cyclic nucleotide. The time course of current activation is temperature dependent; it is well described by a single exponential process of ∼ 480 ms time constant at 20 – 21 °C and 138 ms at 32 °C. The absence of detectable Ca 2 +-dependent CNG current modulation in intact rods, in view of the known channel modulation by calmodulin in-vitro, affirms the modulation in intact rods may only occur at low Ca 2 + concentrations, those expected at intensities that nearly saturate the rod photoresponse. The correspondence between Ca 2 + dependence of CNG modulation and the ability to light adapt suggest these events are correlated in photoreceptors...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the spatial density of cones and rods in eight whole-mounted human retinas, obtained from seven individuals between 27 and 44 years of age, and constructed maps of photoreceptor density and between-individual variability. The average human retina contains 4. 6 million cones (4. 08 - 5. 29 million). Peak foveal cone density averages 199, 000 cones/mm 2 and is highly variable between individuals (100, 000 - 324, 000 cones/mm 2). The point of highest density {{may be found}} in an area as large as 0. 032 deg 2. Cone density falls steeply with increasing eccentricity and is an order of magnitude lower 1 mm away from the foveal center. Superimposed on this gradient is a streak of high cone density along the horizontal meridian. At equivalent eccentricities, cone density is 40 - 45 % higher in nasal compared to temporal retina and slightly higher in midperipheral inferior compared to superior <b>retina.</b> <b>Cone</b> density also increases slightly in far nasal retina. The average human retina contains 92 million rods (77. 9 - 107. 3 million). In the fovea, the average horizontal diameter of the rod-free zone is 0. 350 mm (1. 25 degrees). Foveal rod density increases most rapidly superiorly and least rapidly nasally. The highest rod densities are located along an elliptical ring at the eccentricity of the optic disk and extending into nasal retina with the point of highest density typically in superior retina (5 / 6 eyes). Rod densities decrease by 15 - 25 % where the ring crosses the horizontal meridian. Rod density declines slowly from the rod ring to the far periphery and is highest in nasal and superior retina. Individual variability in photoreceptor density differs with retinal region and is similar for both cones and rods. Variability is highest near the fovea, reaches a minimum in the midperiphery, and then increases with eccentricity to the ora serrata. The total number of foveal cones is similar for eyes with widely varying peak cone density, consistent with the idea that the variability reflects differences in the lateral migration of photoreceptors during development. Two fellow eyes had cone and rod numbers within 8 % and similar but not identical photoreceptor topography...|$|E

It is known that during light adaptation considerable changes occur in the cone ERGs of man, monkeys and mice. All these species have vascular retinae. In the present study we examined whether {{the same applies to}} mammalian species with a limited retinal vasculature (rabbits) or avascular retinae (guinea pigs), and which both have two types of cones but scotopic ERGs with completely different morphology. Material and methods: ERGs were recorded from anaesthetized rabbits and guinea pigs with corneal electrodes made from steal wire. Copper wire placed in the mouth of the animal served as reference electrode, and a subcutaneous needle as ground. Recordings were amplified 1000 -fold, with bandwidth settings at 1 - 1000 Hz, and fed into a computer via an A/D converter. Corneas were anaesthetized with a topical application of proparacaine, and pupils dilated with topical application of tropicamide. ERGs were elicited with brief (10 msec) light flashes, and the retina light adapted with a steady white background light. Results: The scotopic b-wave is more than twice the amplitude of the a-wave in rabbits, while the scotopic b-wave in guinea pigs is only slightly larger than the a-wave. The b-wave of the cone ERG is twice the amplitude of the cone a-wave in both species. Once a background light has been turned on, the amplitude increases in both species and the process of light adaptation reaches a peak about 10 minutes thereafter. The b-wave implicit time is shortened by light adaptation in rabbits, but not in guinea pigs. Oscillatory potentials are present in guinea pig ERGs when recorded in dark but not when recorded in light. Conclusions: Mammals that have avascular retinae and which are without long-wavelength cones show evidence of light {{adaptation of}} the cone ERG. In guinea pigs the cone ERG increases in amplitude during light adaptation without concomitant shortening of the implicit time. These changes occur at similar rate in rabbits and guinea pigs. The oscillatory potentials in rabbits increase in amplitude but not in guinea pigs. These results suggest that different mechanisms determine the light {{adaptation of the}} cone ERG in guinea pigs than in rabbits. Tilgangur: Þegar sjónhimna er aðlöguð að ljósi er hægt að skrá sjónhimnurit (electroretinogram, ERG) keilna. Vitað er að við ljósaðlögun verða miklar breytingar í sjónhimnuriti keilna hjá mönnum, öpum og músum. Þessar tegundir hafa æðar í sjónhimnu. Í þessari rannsókn var athugað hvort sama eigi við um tegundir spendýra með lítið af æðum í sjónu (kanínur) eða engar (marsvín) æðar í sjónu og sem hafa tvær tegundir keilna en alls ólík sjónhimnurit í rökkri. Efniviður og aðferðir: Sjónhimnurit voru skráð frá svæfðum kanínum og marsvínum með skráningarskautum úr stálvír, sem staðsett voru á hornhimnu augans. Koparvír staðsettur í munni var notaður sem viðmiðunarskaut og nál undir húð sem jarðtenging. Skráning var mögnuð 1000 -falt, með bandvídd 1 - 1000 Hz, og niðurstöður fluttar í tölvu með A/D breytikorti. Hornhimna var staðdeyfð með próparakaíni, sjáaldur víkkað með trópikamíð dropum. Sjónhimnurit var vakið með stuttum (10 msek) ljósblikkum, og sjónhimna aðlöguð að stöðugu hvítu bakgrunnsljósi. Niðurstöður: Í rökkri er b-bylgja meir en helmingi stærri en a-bylgja í sjónhimnuriti kanína, en b-bylgja aðeins eilítið stærri en a-bylgja hjá marsvínum. Í sjónhimnuriti keilna er hins vegar b-bylgja helmingi stærri en a-bylgja hjá báðum tegundum. Eftir að kveikt er á bakgrunnsljósi eftir aðlögun að rökkri hækkar spenna svara og nær hámarki eftir um 10 mínútur í báðum tegundum. Dvöl b-bylgju styttist hjá kanínum, en ekki hjá marsvínum. Í sjónhimnuriti keilna hjá kanínum eru sveifluspennur (oscillatory potentials), sem stækka að spennu við aðlögun að ljósi. Sveifluspennur eru í sjónhimnuriti marsvína, þegar það er skráð í rökkri, en engar í sjónhimnuriti keilna. Ályktanir: Spendýr með æðalausa sjónhimnu og engar langbylgjukeilur sýna ljósaðlögun sjónhimnurits keilna. Í marsvínum eykst sjónhimnurit keilna að spennu án þess að dvöl breytist við ljósaðlögun. Þessar breytingar eru svipaðar í tíma í kanínum og marsvínum. Sveifluspennur aukast að spennu í kanínum en ekki marsvínum.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the anatomic and histologic features of the Sapajus sp. eye, comparing similarities and differences of humans and other species of non-human primates for biomedical research purposes. Computed tomography (CT) of adnexa, eye and orbit live animal, as well as formolized pieces of the same structures of Sapajus sp. for anatomical and histological study were also performed. The anatomical description of the eye and adnexa was performed using the techniques of topographic dissection and exenteration. Histological fragments were fixated in buffered formalin 10 %, processed by the routine paraffin inclusion technique, stained with hematoxylin-eosin and special stains. CT scan evaluation showed no differences between the live animal and the formolized head on identification of visual apparatus structures. Anatomic and histologic evaluation revealed rounded orbit, absence of the supraorbital foramen and frontal notch, little exposure of the sclera, with slight pigmentation of the exposed area and marked pigmentation at the sclerocorneal junction. Masson's Trichrome revealed the Meibomian glands, the corneal epithelium and Bowman's membrane; in the choroid, melanocytes and Bruch's membrane were observed; and in the <b>retina,</b> <b>cones</b> and rods as well as, optic nerve, the lamina cribrosa of the nerve fibers bundles. Toluidine blue highlighted the membranes: Bowman, Descemet and the endothelium; in the choroid: melanocytes; and in the retina: nuclear layers and retinal pigment epithelium. In view of the observed results Sapajus sp. is an important experimental model for research in the ophthalmology field, which has been shown due to the high similarity of its anatomical and histological structures with the human species...|$|R
40|$|Retinal bipolar neurons {{serve as}} relay interneurons that connect rod and cone {{photoreceptor}} cells to amacrine and ganglion cells. They exhibit diverse morphologies essential for correct routing of photoreceptor cell signals to specific postsynaptic amacrine and ganglion cells. The development and physiology of these interneurons {{have not been}} completely defined molecularly. Despite previous identification of genes expressed in several bipolar cell subtypes, molecules that mark each bipolar cell type still await discovery. In this report, novel genetic markers of murine bipolar cells were found. Candidates were initially generated by using microarray analysis of single bipolar cells and mining of retinal serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data. These candidates were subsequently tested for expression in bipolar cells by RNA in situ hybridization. Ten new molecular markers were identified, five of which are highly enriched in their expression in bipolar cells within the adult retina. Double-labeling experiments using probes for previously characterized subsets of bipolar cells were performed to identify the subtypes of bipolar cells that express the novel markers. Additionally, the expression of bipolar cell genes was analyzed in Bhlhb 4 knockout retinas, in which rod bipolar cells degenerate postnatally, to delineate further the identity of bipolar cells in which novel markers are found. From the analysis of Bhlhb 4 mutant <b>retinas,</b> <b>cone</b> bipolar cell gene expression appears to be relatively unaffected by the degeneration of rod bipolar cells. Identification of molecular markers for the various subtypes of bipolar cells will lead to greater insights into the development and function of these diverse interneurons...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{described}} for positioning <b>cones</b> in the <b>retina.</b> Each <b>cone</b> has a circular disk of influence, and the disks are tightly packed {{outward from the}} center. This model has three parameters that can vary with eccentricity: the mean radius of the cone disk, the standard deviation of the cone disk radius, and the standard deviation of postpacking jitter. Estimates for these parameters out to 1. 6 deg are found by using measurements reported by Hirsch and Hylton (1985) and Hirsch and Miller (1987) of {{the positions of the}} cone inner segments of an adult macaque. The estimation is based on fitting measures of variation in local intercone distances, and the fit to these measures is good...|$|R
