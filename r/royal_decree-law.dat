5000|$|A <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-Law</b> is a {{legal rule}} having {{the force of a}} law in the Spanish legal system. The name of [...] "Royal" [...] is given because it has state rank and it is the King who is {{responsible}} for sanctioning and ordering the publication and compliance of the rule. However, when the rule is created by an autonomous government, it receives the name of [...] "Decree-Law" [...] because the King only sanctions the Decrees of the central government (the autonomous community Decree-Law is sanctioned by the President of the Autonomous Community {{in the name of the}} King).|$|E
50|$|The main {{drivers of}} the recent (beginning in 2009) and {{continuing}} financial crisis in Spain has been the weaknesses, lending practices and failures of the savings banks in Spain (Spanish: caja de ahorros) or cajas. The current crisis had its roots prior to 2008 which the Credit Crunch and Sovereign Crisis have exacerbated. With the Spanish <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-Law</b> 24/2012 of 31 August 2012, SAREB was created. The Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) held a majority shareholding of the financial institutions which in the judgement of the Bank of Spain require restructuring or winding up in accordance with Spanish Law 9/2012 (Banco Mare Nostrum, CEISS, Caja3 and Liberbank). Private shareholders own 55% of SAREB and the remaining 45% is held by the FROB.|$|E
50|$|On 31 August 2012 the Spanish {{government}} {{approved a}} <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-Law</b> creating a bad bank. The law {{established that the}} FROB had the administrative power to oblige financial institutions to transfer to an asset management company (SAREB) certain assets: particularly impaired assets and assets which {{could be considered a}} threat to the viability of an institution. The aim is to remove the assets from the balance sheets of the institutions to allow them to be independently managed. The asset management company may issues bonds and securities recognising or giving rise to debt. The law establishes that the assets are to be transferred to the asset management company without any need for consent from third parties. Prior to transfer the Bank of Spain will determine the value of the assets based on appraisal reports.|$|E
40|$|Distribution and {{structural}} configuration {{prior to the}} reform of collective bargaining operated in Spain by <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-Law</b> 7 / 2011 came characterized by a reservation and a preference of sectoral level (particularly state) versus lower, on issues relating to occupational safety and health. Currently, under {{the express purpose of}} "rearranging the structure of collective bargaining", amendments to the arts. 83 and 84 of the Statute of Workers entered by <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-Law</b> 7 / 2011 and Law 3 / 2012 allow company level or group of companies agreements to change the provisions (of the state or regional sectoral agreements as well as, of course, the "losers " provincial sectoral agreements) {{in a wide range of}} subjects: some specific; and others indeterminate in a broad spectrum contained in the new letter g) of art. 84. 2. Is also expressly allowed that agreements at the regional level could affect to "untouchable subjects " set at the sectoral estate level-including minimum standards for occupational risk prevention-. All this could be possible thanks to the potential promotional concessions that can be operated through interprofessional or sectoral agreements at higher levels, conditioned by unruly decentralization demands. Traditional intangibility in peius of "minimum standards for occupational risks prevention " established by sectoral agreements could be potentially vulnerable to restrictive considerations due to collective bargaining of crisis...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} passed <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-law</b> on mediation eagerly awaited and pending for approval by Spanish Congress provides {{a great chance}} {{to change the way}} legal disputes are tackled in Spain and to overcome the idea judicial proceedings are the only channel to be considered. Several reasons are causing the heavy workload of Spanish Courts. One of them is the lack of knowledge among legal practitioners regarding collaborative procedures. The author describes these techniques, mentioning other countries have specialized lawyers in this field and explaining their scope for action. The author argues that lawyers should be trained in these techniques, which include negotiation and mediation. She analyzes as well the advantages these methods offer in terms of cost and greater satisfaction of all parties involved. Lawyers will soon find out about all these advantages, she forecasts. Finally the author describes in detail the training needed in the field and the sort of strategies that could boost these channels...|$|E
40|$|The {{mineral waters}} {{have been a}} part of our lives for many centuries, since they are believe to be {{beneficial}} and to have therapeutic properties for the human health. This fact makes a key issue to provide an analyses od the current legislation on this issue (<b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-Law</b> 743 / 1928, April 25 th, that aproves the statute on exploitation of spring of mineral and medicinal water; Mining Law of 1973 and its regulations), in order to determine the treatments that may be applied to these watersm meanly in the case of Legionella appearance, or as preventive maesure of it. The results of this analysis shows that there is no limitation or prohibition in the treatments to what they may be subjected, as long as their physico-chemical characteristic remains altered. Contamination by Legionella bacterium, is nowadays an issue of concern, and that is reason why Public Health Authority has established the quidelines to apply for spas in order to avoid or fight a possible outbreak...|$|E
40|$|In the July 25, 1943, {{during the}} II World War and after {{twenty years of}} dictatorship, Italian {{government}} decided to turn the page and follow the orientation of reviving the liberal institutions of the pre-fascist period. On 2 August of the same year, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree-Law</b> n. 705 dissolving the “Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni” and stated that within four months {{from the end of}} the war were to hold elections for the new Chamber of Deputies. The war and subsequent political prevented the realization of this project and emphasize the need for a comprehensive review of the whole institutional structure. By “Decreto Legge Luogotenenziale” June 25, 1944, n. 151, it was stated that at the end of the war were to elect a Constituent Assembly by direct universal suffrage and secret ballot to choose the new form of state and prepare the new Constitution. In addition, with the “Decreto Legislativo” April 5, 1945, n. 146 it was decided to create a not elected body, the “Consulta Nazionale”, in order to endorse the Government decisions on regulatory issues of particular relevance. This committee also participated in the drafting of the electoral law for the Constituent Assembly. The political post-conflict transformed the framework that was outlined above. The “Decreto Legislativo” 16 March 1946, n. 98, modified the “Decreto Legge Luogotenenziale” n. 151 of 1944, entrusting to a referendum the decision on the institutional form of the state, adding that if a majority of the electors voting had spoken in favor of the Republic, the Constituent Assembly, as his first act was to elect the Provisional Head of State. After 68 years, on the other side of the Mediterranean sea, Egypt, “the oldest state that has always known the meaning of citizenship and equality”, country which like Italy comes from an ancient civilization, lives a constitutional transition. Such as Italy in the forties, almost immediately after the his dictator departure, the SCAF, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the junta to which Mubarak resigned power on February 11 convened a not elected body, a committee of lawyers and judges, to draft amendments to Egypt’s constitution for a rapid transfer of power to an elected, civilian government. The committee generated eight constitutional amendments that implicitly laid out a timetable for Egypt’s transitional period, likewise the “Consulta Nazionale” did in Italy. Is possible to find more connections (e. g. as well as in Italy in Egypt the liberation movement was always a pluralistic on, united most by what they opposed : the dictatorship, even if they opposed it for different reason) but the aim of this working paper is different. The purpose of this paper is to describe briefly how the legal doctrine in Italy studied the constitutional transition, in order to bring out through the comparison between the two experiences of rebuilding of democratic institutions after despotic regimes other works that aim to examine in detail the many questions connected...|$|E
