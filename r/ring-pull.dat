2500|$|Originally the Land Rover was {{a single}} model offering, which from 1948 until 1951 used an [...] {{wheelbase}} and a 1.6-litre petrol engine producing around [...] The four-speed gearbox from the Rover P3 was used, with a new two-speed transfer box. This incorporated an unusual four-wheel-drive system, with a freewheel unit (as used on several Rover cars of the time). This disengaged the front axle from the manual transmission on the overrun, allowing a form of permanent 4WD. A <b>ring-pull</b> mechanism in the driver's footwell allowed the freewheel to be locked to provide more traditional 4WD. This was a basic vehicle: tops for the doors and a roof (canvas or metal) were optional extras. In 1950, the lights moved from a position behind the grille to protruding through the grille.|$|E

50|$|Ammunition for the 51 mm mortar has a small, <b>ring-pull</b> {{safety pin}} {{on the side}} of the nose-fuze. The fuze remains unarmed until the pin is withdrawn. Therefore, the safety pin must always be removed and {{discarded}} before a mortar shell is fired.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1997, the Spice Girls held a two-date {{concert in}} Istanbul named Girl Power! Live in Istanbul, {{sponsored}} by Pepsi. During the concert the group premiered three new songs from Spiceworld: [...] "Too Much", [...] "Stop" [...] and [...] "Saturday Night Divas". Two promotional singles from Spiceworld were released {{prior to the}} album release in 1997; [...] "Step to Me" [...] and [...] "Move Over (Generation Next)". Both songs {{were used in the}} Pepsi advertising campaigns and were also given away free with special <b>ring-pulls.</b> The album version of [...] "Step to Me" [...] is slightly different from the original release of the song, while [...] "Move Over (Generation Next)" [...] was only released as an live version during its promotional release.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous campaigns were {{launched}} {{to promote the}} album. Coca-Cola, in association with RCA and BMG, released a limited edition 3" [...] mini-CD, also titled The Beautiful Game, which was only available through collecting <b>ring-pulls</b> off special cans of Coca-Cola. The CD features five different songs from artists on the album; [...] "Alright" [...] and [...] "This Time" [...] from the album re-appear, whilst a different song by The Boo Radleys ("Wake Up Boo!") and two exclusive remixes of older Jamiroquai and Massive Attack songs also appear. Massive Attack featured on the front cover of the match-day programme for the Bristol City v York City game on 8 April 1996 after appearing in a friendly match with members of Blur and Supergrass at Wembley Stadium to promote the album. Robert Del Naja from the group was interviewed about the album by John Mitchell for Total Football. The album also found some attention in the United States after a feature on the album written by John Crouch appeared in Billboard magazine on 8 June 1996, and Tim Southwell praised the album in popular men's lifestyle magazine Loaded.|$|R
50|$|The PMN-1 mine is armed by {{removing}} a steel <b>ring-pull</b> {{at the end}} of the horizontal fuze. When in position, the pin on the end of the <b>ring-pull</b> holds a spring-loaded striker back from the stab-detonator. Pulling out the <b>ring-pull</b> starts an arming delay, which comprises a thin steel wire (held under tension by the spring-loaded striker) which must cut through a small strip of lead before it is freed. The process of cutting through the lead strip takes between 2 and 12 minutes, depending on ambient temperature. After the wire has completely cut through the lead strip, the spring-loaded striker is freed and slides forward a few millimetres before stopping, blocked by the sliding gate of the pressure plate mechanism. At this point the mine is fully armed i.e. the only thing holding back the spring-loaded striker from the stab-detonator is a weak creep-spring on the pressure plate mechanism. Subsequently, any downward pressure on the pressure plate (i.e. when someone steps on the mine) overcomes the upward pressure of the creep-spring and pushes down the sliding gate that holds back the spring-loaded striker. This action frees the striker which flips forward into the stab detonator, firing both it and the adjacent tetryl booster which triggers detonation of the main TNT explosive filling. It is not a blast resistant mine.|$|E
50|$|The RingCrown (also {{known as}} RipCap, <b>Ring-pull</b> closure or pull off caps) is a bottle closure {{that can be}} opened without any tools. It has a ring that can be pulled in order to detach the cap from the bottle. The cap splits along scores in the cap, {{therefore}} loosens and can {{be removed from the}} bottle. Drink companies use ring pull caps to differentiate themselves from competitors.|$|E
50|$|Typically camembert {{tends to}} be sold whole in thin, round, wooden {{containers}} made from poplar. Modern variations in packaging include cartons and tin cans, with a <b>ring-pull</b> tab for opening (Camembert in metallic boxes does not exist on the French market). The cardboard boxes are reserved for the low-cost camemberts. The product {{is the same as}} in the wooden container, wrapped dry in a paper/foil wrapper, and not immersed in brine or oil.|$|E
50|$|After his {{brothers}} vacated their restaurant from the club, John McCoy established a small 'bistro' dining {{area on the}} 1st floor which was primarily served by an open to view charcoal-grill facility, specialising in locally sourced steaks and salads, served with large bowls of US-style French fries. Another unique aspect McCoy introduced to the club in the 1970s, was 'imported' (and then hard {{to find in the}} UK) Australian 'Fosters' lager, which was served from ice-filled troughs, 'in the can' for patrons to activate the <b>ring-pull</b> themselves. This procedure was so unusual at that time, that an illustration of a 'foaming' can of lager bearing the club's logo quickly became part of its publicity material.|$|E
5000|$|Originally the Land Rover was {{a single}} model offering, which from 1948 until 1951 used an 80 in {{wheelbase}} and a 1.6-litre petrol engine producing around [...] The four-speed gearbox from the Rover P3 was used, with a new two-speed transfer box. This incorporated an unusual four-wheel-drive system, with a freewheel unit (as used on several Rover cars of the time).

50|$|ALKA, the {{predecessor}} {{of the modern}} <b>ring-pull</b> caps, was introduced during the 1930s. ALKA had a seal made of natural cork. It became popular in Nordic countries as an easy-to-open cap. ALKA was made of aluminum and had a tab that was pulled to remove the cap. There was no scoring on an ALKA cap. In the 1970s the MaxiCap was first produced. A MaxiCap is an aluminum closure with scoring and a tab to pull. They were easier to use than the ALKA and pre-manufactured outside of the bottling plant. This allowed for increased production speeds on the bottling line. Soon after the MaxiCap came the RingCrown closure. Invented in the early 1980s it was originally called MaxiCrown and later became known as RingCrown. The RingCrown is easier to use than its predecessors because it has an attached ring rather than a static pull off tab.|$|E
40|$|Rayleigh- Taylor model, an {{important}} theory dealing with ferro-hydrodynamic (FHD) instability, is utilized {{to predict the}} ferro-surface tension in this study. Before hexagonal peaking patterns induced by critical magnetization of ferro-solution, the simplification from proposed theory could be further made under the consideration of normal field imposed, i. e., linear relation of free surface tension proportional to apparent ferro-weight might be successfully predicted. That offers a simple semi-formula easier to study the static ferro-surface tension. To validate above results, a self-designed <b>ring-pull</b> device is set up as auxiliary experimental mechanism. Here relevant test of ferro-sample in various volumetric concentration as well as field intensity will be performed. Consequently, both results accessed from ferro-experiment and theoretic analysis delivers an agreement within the working magnetic intensity 0 ~ 40 mT, where a remarkable increase of surface tension coefficient occurs at higher magnetic field for ferro-solution with denser volumetric concentration considered...|$|E
40|$|The food {{industry}} {{is well aware}} that consumers want innovation and value novelty, and therefore the packaging industry must innovate or stagnate. One of the major trends is material substitution, from glass to polyethylene terepthalate (PET) bottles. Its light weight and convenience are likely to prove popular with consumers. Lightweighting is also a new trend in packaging. Direct printing onto the bottle means that no label is required and a special neck finish enables a tearoff <b>ring-pull</b> closure to be attached. Now a variety of bar code symbologies that can be read by smartphones are appearing on packs. The QR (quick response) is the most common, it can launch exclusive content, update Facebook status, download coupons, promotions and music and invite friends to join. Sustainable packaging has been substituted with a more balanced view of efficient packaging, minimum resources, minimizing product waste, transport and display efficiency and effective after-use disposal and recycling. A very exciting development undertaken by Avantium in The Netherlands {{has resulted in a}} new polyester, polyethylene furanoate (PEF), an analogue of PET. Founded in 2012 from research at MIT, LiquiGlide coatings allow viscous liquids to move easily due to permanently wet slippery surfaces. Serac 2 ̆ 7 s Roll N Blow uses an innovative tubular thermoforming technology to produce cups or bottles from plastic reels of polystyrene or polypropylene...|$|E
40|$|It {{is thought}} {{that one of the}} best ways to gain {{information}} for the development of new products and potentially the adaptation of older ones is through the use of ethnographic research during the development and research phase (Cooper & Edgett, 2008). The world‟s population is ageing and it has therefore become necessary to include elderly people more in the development of new products, particularly where research suggests they are encountering difficulties with grocery packaging, among other products. Product developers need to find solutions to these problems. The ethnographic research used in this study has been valuable in finding out what the problems are that elderly people are experiencing; how they are overcoming or getting around these problems, as well as what could potentially be done to develop appropriate solutions. It was found that elderly people are having difficulties with more traditional styles of packaging, like glass bottles, jars and aluminium cans, as well as some newer packaging types including <b>ring-pull</b> tin cans and freshness seals on milk bottles. These results are similar to those of previous research in this field (Duizer, Robertson, & Han, 2009). Based on this ethnographic research and the above mentioned survey, it has been found that the current guidelines in place for packaging (shown in Table 1) are inadequate from an end users point of view, given that they focus primarily on function and environmental impact and less on openability. An adapted version of the Principles of Universal Design (Appendix VIII) would be immensely beneficial in helping to make the packaging industry more aware of the packaging problems elderly people are faced with, as well as ways to circumnavigate them...|$|E
