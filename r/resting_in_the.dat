5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E
5|$|Just {{one month}} after the match, on 16 November, Keenor and his {{battalion}} began the journey to France to join the front lines, billeting in the village of Les Ciseaux for one month before moving to the city of Béthune. The majority of his posting during their first months in France involved training and guard duty but, on 9 December 1915, the battalion was moved to Annequin which was just miles from the frontline. They were soon moved into the main trenches, which were knee deep in mud and infested with rats, and were stationed on duty until 22 December when they were relieved, <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby village of Beuvry. Cardiff City organised regular collections during their wartime fixtures during this period in order to send parcels to Keenor and Jack Stephenson containing letters from fans and home comforts. The Middlesex Battalion, made up of professional footballers, also claimed the Divisional Football Cup with relative ease, defeating a team from the 34th Brigade 11–0 in the final on 11 April 1916, each player receiving a winners' medal made of bronze.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods near Tycoon, witnesses {{a meteorite}} plunge to the planet's surface {{just outside the}} castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to supply}} {{problems}} during the advance from Beersheba, Allenby maintained Philip W. Chetwode's XX Corps {{in the rear}} close to lines of communication. These troops enjoyed 10 days <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear, where they were easily supplied and refitted. It was these fresh troops of XX Corps which were ordered to take over responsibility for front line operations in the Judean Hills against the defending Ottoman Seventh Army. The 60th (London) Division, commanded by Major General John Shea, arrived at Latron on 23 November from Huj and on 28 November relieved the seriously weakened infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions without much of a reduction in fighting ability. On the same day, the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, commanded by Major General E. S. Girdwood, arrived at Latron from Karm. Two days later the 10th (Irish) Division, commanded by Major General J. R. Longley, also arrived at Latron from Karm. The 53rd (Welsh) Division, with the Corps Cavalry Regiment and a heavy battery attached, remained on the Hebron road north of Beersheba, coming under direct orders from General Headquarters (GHQ); they became known as Mott's Detachment.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1870, flags {{were created}} for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for {{other members of the}} {{imperial}} family. At first, the Emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed {{in the center of a}} monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.|$|E
5|$|The group travels {{into the}} wild, where Gandalf saves {{the company from}} trolls and leads them to Rivendell, where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. Passing over the Misty Mountains, they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets {{separated}} from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, who engages him {{in a game of}} riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers invisibility, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and Wargs give chase, but the company are saved by eagles before <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house of Beorn.|$|E

The crossing of the Salso and Simeto Rivers and the fall of Aderno had cut all the German lateral communications west and south of Mount Etna, and caused the fall of Paterno, Santa Maria, and Biancavilla. The 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers, in the meantime, had captured Capella and Monte Maletto and cleared the village. The fall of Maletto and the subsequent rapid approach to Randazzo forced the Germans on their last hurried withdrawal to the sea.|$|E
25|$|At about 14:00, the Nawab's army ceased the cannonade {{and began}} turning back north to their entrenchments, leaving St. Frais and his {{artillery}} without support. Seeing the Nawab's forces retiring, Major Kilpatrick, {{who had been}} left {{in charge of the}} British force while Clive was <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hunting lodge, recognised the opportunity to cannonade the retiring enemy if St. Frais' position could be captured. Sending an officer to Clive to explain his actions, he took two companies of the 39th Regiment and two field pieces and advanced towards St. Frais' position. When Clive received the message, he hurried to the detachment and reprimanded Kilpatrick for his actions without orders and commanded to bring {{up the rest of the}} army from the grove. Clive himself then led the army against St. Frais' position which was taken at 15:00 when the French artillery retreated to the redoubt of the entrenchment, setting up for further action.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{evidence}} based practice {{has also had}} an influence {{in the field of}} education. Here, some commentators have suggested that the putative lack of any conspicuous progress is attributable to practice <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unconnected and noncumulative experience of thousands of individual teachers, each re-inventing the wheel and failing to learn from hard scientific evidence about 'what works'. Opponents of this view argue that hard scientific evidence is a misnomer in education; knowing that a drug works (in medicine) is entirely different from knowing that a teaching method works, for the latter will depend on a host of factors, not least those to do with the style, personality and beliefs of the teacher and the needs of the particular children (Hammersley 2013). Some opponents of EBP in education suggest that teachers need to develop their own personal practice, dependent on personal knowledge garnered through their own experience. Others argue that this must be combined with research evidence, but without the latter being treated as a privileged source.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{troublesome}} 1980 {{season with}} suspension from {{the league and}} {{a victory for the}} Mapua Cardinals, the Letran Knights started the 1982 season under the tutelage of new coach Coach Larry Albano which featured a very exciting player named Samboy Lim. Samboy Lim is a graduate of San Beda High School and also played for the San Beda Red Cubs (the Juniors Basketball team of San Beda). After sweeping the first round, the Knights continued to pile up victories in the second round and was two wins ahead of #2 ranked San Sebastian. The Knights were unofficially crowned champions but they still had to play Trinity College in a no-bearing game to officially finish their NCAA campaign. The Knights lost that game 102-89 but it didn't matter as the school's 7th trophy was still presented to them. In 1983, the heavily favored Samboy Lim and the Knights advanced to the championship round where they will meet Nani Demegillo and the San Sebastian Stags for the title. The championship game was decided on a best-of-3 series and both teams split the first two games but in Game 3 the Knights played inspired basketball due to Samboy Lim's heroic deed of choosing to play instead of <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital (he suffered an asthma attack in Game 2 and has to be sent in the hospital that night) and captured their 2nd straight championship. Romy Ang was named MVP of the season but Samboy Lim's heroics left an indelible impression to the hearts of those who witnessed it. With San Beda taking a leave of absence in 1984, the NCAA kicked off the season with only 5 schools participating but it didn't distract the Knights as they secured a date with history as the become the first school to finish the season undefeated and champions. Samboy Lim was named MVP of the season and RP Team patron Danding Cojuangco gave him a spot on the National Team roster.|$|E

500|$|Phaeacius {{is unusually}} {{sedentary}} for a jumping spider, generally <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flattened pose for hours or days on logs, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, and captures particular types of prey more often when the predator matches this background. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body or legs. However, if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly, driving its body upward [...] and forward about half the length of its body. The lunge ends with the spider's fangs in the prey and often with the foremost two pairs of legs forming a basket over the prey. When the prey stops struggling, Phaeacius resumes the flattened pose and then feeds.|$|E

500|$|Much nearer was , {{which had}} warned Titanic of ice {{a few hours}} earlier. Apprehensive at his ship being caught in a large field of drift ice, [...] Californians captain, Stanley Lord, had decided at about 22:00 to halt for the night and wait for {{daylight}} {{to find a way}} through the ice field. At 23:30, 10minutes before Titanic hit the iceberg, Californians sole radio operator, Cyril Evans, shut his set down for the night and went to bed. On the bridge her Third Officer, Charles Groves, saw a large vessel to starboard around [...] away. It made a sudden turn to port and stopped. If the radio operator of Californian had stayed at his post fifteen minutes longer, hundreds of lives might have been saved. A little over an hour later, Second Officer Herbert Stone saw five white rockets exploding above the stopped ship. Unsure what the rockets meant, he called Captain Lord, who was <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chartroom, and reported the sighting.

500|$|Zoologist Robert M. Alexander has {{suggested}} that overheating {{may have been a}} serious problem in Paraceratherium due to its size. According to Prothero, the best living analogues for Paraceratherium may be large mammals such as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. To aid in thermoregulation, these animals cool down during the day by <b>resting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shade or by wallowing in water and mud. They also forage and move mainly at night. Because of its large size, Paraceratherium {{would not have been able}} to run and move quickly, but they would have been able to cross large distances, which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food. They may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory. Prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least [...] and that, because of a scarcity of resources, there would have been little room in Asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera. This principle is called competitive exclusion; it is used to explain how the black rhinoceros (a browser) and white rhinoceros (a grazer) exploit different niches in the same areas of Africa.|$|E
