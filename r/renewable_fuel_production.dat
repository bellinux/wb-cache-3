Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) {{has emerged as}} a leading {{candidate}} to be developed as a bioenergy feedstock. To reach biofuel production goals in a sustainable manner, more information is needed to characterize potential production rates of switchgrass. We used switchgrass yield data and general additive models (GAMs) to model lowland and upland switchgrass yield as nonlinear functions of climate and environmental variables. We used the GAMs and a 39 -year climate dataset to assess the spatio-temporal variability in switchgrass yield due to climate variables alone. Variables associated with fertilizer application, genetics, precipitation, and management practices were the most important for explaining variability in switchgrass yield. The relationship of switchgrass yield with climate variables was different for upland than lowland cultivars. The spatio-temporal analysis showed that considerable variability in switchgrass yields can occur due to climate variables alone. The highest switchgrass yields with the lowest variability occurred primarily in the Corn Belt region, suggesting that prime cropland regions are the best suited for a constant and high switchgrass biomass yield. Given that much lignocellulosic feedstock production will likely occur in regions with less suitable climates for agriculture, interannual variability in yields should be expected and incorporated into operational planning...|$|R

This lignocellulosic biomass has deserved attention of researchers concerning the seeking of new usages, as, for example, in <b>renewable</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>production</b> technologies. This study examines the potential of green coconut husk fibers as a feedstock for the production of bioethanol. The coconut fibers were pretreated through an alkaline method, hydrolyzed enzymatically and submitted to ethanol fermentation with commercial yeasts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite the significant loss of cellulose (4. 42 % in relation to the fiber and 17. 9 % concerning the original cellulose content), the alkaline pretreatment promoted an efficient solubilization of lignin (80 %), turning the coconut fibers into a feasible raw material for 2 G ethanol production studies. Enzymatic hydrolysis converted 87 % of the sugars and the ethanolic fermentation consumed 81 % of the substrate in the hydrolyzate, leading to a sugar to ethanol convertion efficiency of 59. 6 %.

It is known that lipid productivity in B. braunii is higher when it is cultivated under nitrogen-depletion or other stress conditions (Cheng et al. 2013).

In this study, {{on the one hand}} hydrocarbon extraction capabilities and biocompatibility are necessary, {{but on the other hand}} a sustainable solvent production and an easy solvent-hydrocarbon separation (low energy cost) are desirable from a <b>renewable</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>production</b> perspective. These last two conditions, are reasons to consider limonene and decane candidates. The former is a non-petroleum derived, renewable solvent (Njoroge et al. 2004), whereas the latter is one of the lowest molecular weight highly biocompatible alkanes (León 2003). Decanol, the alcohol derived from decane, is less hydrophobic and, therefore, more water soluble, what could provide a higher hydrocarbon extraction although a lower biocompatibility. In this study, only biocompatibility will be tested.|$|E

In this paper, we study the longer-term global implications of large-scale <b>renewable</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>production</b> in the U. S. We utilize the GTAP v 7. 1 data base and introduce a detailed breakdown of agricultural crops, first and second generation biofuels and by-products. We update this fully disaggregated data base to reflect the 2010 global economy, based on secondary data for the sectors and regions included. We adapt the Applied Dynamic Analysis of Global Economy (ADAGE) model developed by Ross (2009) into a recursive dynamic framework and introduce agriculture, biofuels, and land use linkages. We construct a dynamic baseline from 2010 through 2050 in five-year time steps. The dynamics in the model comes from growth in GDP, population, capital accumulation, labor productivity, growth in natural resource stocks, and technological changes in the energy intensive and agricultural sectors. We implement a representative RFS 2 policy scenario in the U. S for 2025, using two alternative approaches: (i) RFS permits approach – which assumes biofuels and petroleum fuels are perfect substitutes after adjusting for energy content, and (ii) Target share of biofuels in transportation fuels approach – which treats biofuels and petroleum fuels as imperfect substitutes. Both approaches offer insights regarding potential policy impacts, particularly on the international market and indirect land use change. Because the share approach keeps the biofuels share fixed in the regions outside the U. S., it does not result in dramatic changes {{in the rest of the}} world. In the permits approach, however, the regions without a specific policy requiring a given level of biofuels tend to reduce biofuels consumption. This is a result of the reduction in relative price of petroleum products as U. S. policy increases demand for biofuels and reduces global demand for petroleum, making <b>renewable</b> <b>fuels</b> less cost-competitive in the rest of the world.

However, the use of UCO is not trivial in reactors, as catalysts are sensitive to impurities and contaminations, which are typical of waste oils. Moreover, the chemical composition of UCO is variable regionally as well as seasonally, because the type of base-vegetable oils vary with Country and period of the year. In {{the framework of the}} ITAKA EU FP 7 project, (catalytic) thermochemical conversion of UCO has been considered to obtain an intermediate biofuel suitable for upgrading by hydrotreating. The catalytic conversion of UCO and Fatty Acids were investigated in a 1. 5 kg/h pilot unit. UCO, properly filtered and conditioned, was characterized, and then converted in bio-oil by means of thermal and catalytic reactionsunder controlled conditions. The type of catalyst and the reaction conditions, including several parameters such as temperature, reactor geometry, heating rate and residence time, were evaluated, and selected combinations were tested.

Illumination of this photo-anode, when immersed in an aqueous electrolyte, generates a photocurrent that is sustained for multiple hours {{without the need for}} an applied potential. The complete photo-anode releases protons to solution and oxygen gas, simultaneously with photocurrent generation. The cooperation of all three components: catalyst, proton conductor and dye sensitized titania film were necessary for water oxidation to be achieved using only light as the driving force. This photoanode represents a functional molecular analog of photosystem II, the natural apparatus found in photosynthetic organisms...|$|R
