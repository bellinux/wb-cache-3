5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest.

5|$|On 17 June 2010, the 19-year-old Kieftenbeld {{signed a}} {{four-year}} contract with Eredivisie club Groningen, who paid a €300,000 {{fee for the}} player. He was presented as a <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> despite only ever having played in midfield. In his first season at Groningen he did indeed play at <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> competently enough, but in a 5–1 defeat away to Feyenoord, he struggled against Ryo Miyaichi, a player with pace and ability with both feet, and eventually fouled him to concede a penalty. Groningen finished the season in fifth position, thus qualifying for the play-offs for {{a place in the}} Europa League. Kieftenbeld was sent off in the first leg of the semi-final, so was suspended for the second. He was replaced at half-time in the first leg of the final, which Groningen lost 5–1 to ADO Den Haag, and was an unused substitute in the second leg as they recovered from the four-goal deficit only to lose out on penalties.|$|E

5|$|PSG {{began the}} season with a 2–0 victory over Lyon in the 2015 Trophée des Champions, with Marquinhos an unused {{substitute}} as Serge Aurier played at <b>right</b> <b>back.</b> At {{the end of the summer}} transfer window, Chelsea had two bids rejected for his signature, of amounts between £25.7–£40.4million.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was just}} twelve years old he was spotted by a scout and moved {{with his family to}} London where he joined the Fulham Academy. He progressed through the junior, youth and reserve teams at Fulham, which led him to sign his first {{professional}} contract. Although a centre back by trade, Rehman was used as a holding midfielder as well as <b>right</b> <b>back</b> in his career at Fulham.|$|E
5|$|He is {{predominantly}} a left footed player. During a match he will often drift {{to the left}} wing, with his teammate, {{in the case of}} Bayern Munich, Franck Ribéry, switching over to the right. Another factor in his playing style is his relationship with the right-fullback. At Bayern, this partnership with Philipp Lahm has had benefits for the team's efficiency and chemistry. Robben's defensive work improved when he went to Bayern where he often tracks back and covers for his partner when he pushes forward and becomes a temporary <b>right</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nebraska widened {{its lead}} with a 33-yard {{touchdown}} run six {{minutes into the}} second half, but Tech answered <b>right</b> <b>back</b> with a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score was the closest they would get to a lead as Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E
5|$|Nigel James Gibbs (born 20 November 1965) is an English {{professional}} football manager and former player {{who is an}} assistant coach at Swansea City. He previously worked as a coach with the Under-19 squad of Tottenham Hotspur. A Watford supporter, {{as well as a}} product of their youth system, Gibbs spent his entire professional career as a <b>right</b> <b>back</b> for the club. He was assistant manager of Leeds United after being appointed on 12 April 2013 alongside Brian McDermott, whom he assisted at Reading. He departed from Leeds United in August 2014.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, nearing the halftime break, came an unusual string of {{reckless}} challenges from Toronto <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> Mikael Yourassowsky, on loan from Croatian side Rijeka. In the 36th minute of play, Yourassowsky was carded for a reckless challenge on Andy Najar, and a minute later was given a second yellow and subsequently ejected for doing a similarly mistimed tackle on Chris Pontius. It would not be until the 62nd minute that United were able to capitalize on the shorthanded Toronto, restoring parity at 2–2 thanks a goal from Ngwenya. The draw gave D.C. United the cup title.|$|E

5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, {{the second}} quarter featured three turnovers, and at half time, Penn State led 6–3 with two field goals from senior kicker Sam Ficken. On Penn State's first drive in the second half, Allen Robinson returned and caught a screen pass, which he ran for 25 yards, and then a 51-yard touchdown pass to make the score 13–3. On the ensuing drive, however, Syracuse came <b>right</b> <b>back</b> and scored a touchdown via a Jerome Smith 10-yard run. Early in the fourth quarter, Ficken made his third field goal of the day, a career-long 46 yards. Later in the quarter, Hackenberg threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to Eugene Lewis to make the score 23–10. When only down by 6 points, Syracuse got the ball around their own 45-yard line with {{a little over two}} minutes left, but turned the ball over via an interception with under two minutes to play.|$|E
5|$|Gill {{spent nearly}} {{a full season}} at St Andrew's before he finally made his Football League debut, {{at the age of}} 27, on 18 April 1998 in a 3–0 defeat of Swindon Town. His second game for the club, away to Oxford United, was {{particularly}} eventful. With the score goalless, the referee first failed to award a penalty kick when Gill handled the ball in the penalty area, then disallowed the goal scored when the player deflected an opponent's cross into his own net; a few minutes later Gill was substituted, though he kept his place in the starting eleven for the next game. Then in the summer of 1998, Birmingham paid £1million for Derby County's Gary Rowett. Installed as first-choice <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> in two seasons at the club Rowett missed only five league games. During this period Gill captained the reserve team to victories in the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1999 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands <b>right</b> <b>back</b> up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{used their}} {{third and final}} {{substitute}} in the 75thminute, replacing Giggs with Paul Scholes, who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and Scholes each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80thminutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona <b>right</b> <b>back</b> shepherded the ball out for a goal kick, while Scholes was booked for a late challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players went for the follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first to the ball and sent Puyol sprawling.|$|E
5|$|McCall {{came through}} City's youth system {{after he was}} signed by George Mulhall in 1980 from Farsley Celtic {{at the age of}} 16, before {{becoming}} an apprentice in June 1981. Mulhall's successor, Roy McFarland gave McCall his first-team debut at Reading on 28 August 1982 – the opening day of the 1982–83 season – when he deputised for Ces Podd at <b>right</b> <b>back.</b> He had played just six league games by 29 January 1983 when he made the first of 134 consecutive league appearances, all in midfield under new manager Trevor Cherry. City finished 12th in Division Three that season. The following season City struggled {{to make up for the}} absence of Bobby Campbell, who had left to join Derby County, and won just one of their first fifteen games, until Cherry bought Campbell back from Derby, and City won a record ten consecutive games on their way to a seventh place finish.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{returned}} to Notts County on 26 September 1994 after re-signing {{for a fee}} of £50,000, having made one Premier League appearance for Leicester by that point in 1994–95. Making his debut in a 2–0 away defeat to Reading in the First Division on 1 October 1994, he played regularly at <b>right</b> <b>back</b> before moving to left back {{towards the end of}} 1994–95 after Craig Short {{returned to}} the team. He picked up his last playing honour this season as part of the team that won the Anglo-Italian Cup after County beat Ascoli 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium. However, County were relegated to the Second Division after finishing 24th in the First Division, with Mills making 43 appearances.|$|E
