5000|$|A. M. Tibbetts {{is one of}} {{the main}} critics of the NCTE, {{claiming}} that [...] "the Committee's very approach to the misuse of language and what it calls 'doublespeak' may in the long <b>run</b> <b>limit</b> its usefulness". According to him, the [...] "Committee's use of Orwell is both confused and confusing". The NCTE's publications resonate with George Orwell's name, and allusions to him abound in statements on doublespeak; for example, the committee quoted Orwell's remark that [...] "language is often used as an instrument of social control" [...] in Language and Public Policy. Tibbetts argues that such a relation between NCTE and Orwell's work is contradicting because [...] "the Committee's attitude towards language is liberal, even radical" [...] while [...] "Orwell's attitude was conservative, even reactionary". He also criticizes on the Committee's [...] "continual attack" [...] against linguistic [...] "purism".|$|E

But it {{performed}} only moderately {{well on the}} Billboard Hot 100, peaking just outside the top 40, at #41. It entered the chart on #88 and reached its peak in its eighth week on the chart. Despite this, the song is the most successful single ever recorded by Moore, at least internationally. It received more success abroad, peaking at #6 in the UK and #2 in Australia.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that realistic land {{conditions such as}} soil moisture/soil temperature (SM/ST) can significantly improve the modeling of mesoscale deep convection is tested over the Indian monsoon region (IMR). A high resolution (3 [*]km foot print) SM/ST dataset prepared from a land data assimilation system, {{as part of a}} national monsoon mission project, showed close agreement with observations. Experiments are conducted with (LDAS) and without (CNTL) initialization of SM/ST dataset. Results highlight the significance of realistic land surface conditions on numerical prediction of initiation, movement and timing of severe thunderstorms as compared to that currently being initialized by climatological fields in CNTL run. Realistic land conditions improved mass flux, convective updrafts and diabatic heating in the boundary layer that contributed to low level positive potential vorticity. The LDAS run reproduced reflectivity echoes and associated rainfall bands more efficiently. Improper representation of surface conditions in CNTL <b>run</b> <b>limit</b> the evolution boundary layer processes and thereby failed to simulate convection at right time and place. These findings thus provide strong support to the role land conditions play in impacting the deep convection over the IMR. These findings also have direct implications for improving heavy rain forecasting over the IMR, by developing realistic land conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{cooperative}} {{organization has}} unique financial and pricing characteristics. These characteristics require special financing methods and pricing decisions by cooperatives. Some financial economists believe that cooperatives are economically less viable than investor-oriented firms in facing adverse economic conditions. In addition to this, the cooperative system encourages overproduction in the market. ^ A {{study was conducted}} to identify optimal cooperative financing and pricing strategies using a spreadsheet simulation. The cooperative financial and pricing strategies were tested by changing the values of the debt/equity ratio, interest rates, and the length of the revolving period. In the model, expected patronage refunds were based on actual patronage refunds through use of an adaptive expectation framework. ^ Simulation results showed that the net earnings of the cooperative were large enough to permit the distribution of significant patronage refunds. Particularly under higher borrowing, the per-unit cash patronage refund was higher regardless of the length of revolvement, although longer revolving periods and lower borrowing, usually reduced the level of per-unit cash patronage refunds. Net earnings of the cooperative were implicitly controlled by the expected per-unit patronage refunds. To maintain the optimal level of surplus, the cooperative selected the value of the per-unit cash patronage refund, thereby affecting the expected per-unit patronage refund and the raw product price. This demonstrates how expected per-unit patronage refunds link the financing and pricing decision of the cooperative. Results also showed that cooperatives can overcome the economic burden of higher interest rates by extending the length of revolving period. ^ This study showed that the financing and pricing strategies adopted by the cooperative during adverse economic conditions are useful in maintaining the economic stability of the cooperative. Patrons of the cooperative, by observing the raw product price, {{at least in the short}} <b>run,</b> <b>limit</b> their production. Consequently overproduction in the market can be eliminated. ...|$|E
