5|$|During the {{following}} phase of work, {{four types of}} lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used, while on the eastern side, grouted <b>rock</b> <b>wall</b> can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well {{as much of the}} East Basin. Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme. Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} of {{the royal}} compounds at Ambohimanga, Bevato ("many stones", also called Fidasiana-Bevato), was first established by Andriamborona, who built houses there {{for himself and his}} family in the late 17th century. It was inhabited by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana from 1710 to 1730, during which time he expanded the compound on three occasions. The compound was originally surrounded by a low <b>rock</b> <b>wall</b> that was replaced under Andriambelomasina by a wooden palisade. Ranavalona I expanded the compound toward the west by relocating a small house containing the royal idol Rafantaka; further westward expansion was completed under Ranavalona II. Under Ranavalona I and her successors, Besakana served as the residence of the sovereign's relatives during their visits to Ambohimanga. All buildings on the compound were destroyed by the French, who constructed a school on the site (Ecole Officiel), later followed by the Ambohimanga town hall (Tranompokonolona), which was razed after Madagascar regained independence.|$|E

50|$|Another {{feature of}} the Bluegrass region is <b>rock</b> <b>walls</b> built by Irish stonemasons from {{limestone}} starting in the 1830s. The <b>rock</b> <b>walls,</b> though expensive, are still common along roadways.|$|R
50|$|They {{generally}} prefer humus-rich, moist, well-drained sites, {{ranging from}} bottomland soils to vertical <b>rock</b> <b>walls.</b> Many species are especially known for growing on <b>rock</b> <b>walls</b> around waterfalls and water seepage areas.|$|R
5|$|Within the BWCAW are {{hundreds}} of prehistoric pictographs and petroglyphs on rock ledges and cliffs. The BWCAW {{is part of the}} historic homeland of the Ojibwe people, who traveled the waterways in canoes made of birch bark. Prior to Ojibwe settlement, the area was sparsely populated by the Sioux, who migrated westward following the arrival of the Ojibwe. It is thought that the Hegman Lake Pictograph located on a large overlooking <b>rock</b> <b>wall</b> on North Hegman Lake were most likely created by the Ojibwe. The pictograph appears to represent Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during the early evening, knowledge of which may have been useful for navigating in the deep woods during the winter hunting season. The Grand Portage Indian Reservation, just east of the BWCAW at the community of Grand Portage, is home to a number of Ojibwe to this day.|$|E
25|$|Rosenblum Cellars Winery, <b>Rock</b> <b>Wall</b> Winery, Building 43 Winery, Hangar 1, and St. George Spirits {{are located}} at Alameda Point. In 1978, Alameda {{veterinarian}} Kent Rosenblum {{and his wife}} Kathy founded Rosenblum Cellars. In 2008, the company was purchased by Diageo Estates. Shauna Rosenblum, daughter of Kent and Kathy, is the wine maker for <b>Rock</b> <b>Wall</b> Winery. In December, 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte, produced by St. George Spirits became the first brand of American-made absinthe to be legally produced in the United States since a ban was enacted in 1912.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rocking</b> <b>walls</b> are an {{effective}} method of dissipating seismic response energy and mitigating damage. Semi-active resetable devices have shown significant potential to dissipate energy, customize hysteretic behavior and reduce damage. Hence, {{the addition of}} a resetable device within a <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> can further improve the overall energy management during seismic events. A scaled semi-active <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> system, designed for a large open structure, is analysed using real-time, high-speed hybrid testing. The semi-active devices are controlled to provide supplementary resistance only for the upward rocking motion of the wall, providing semi-active energy dissipation over half of each cycle and relying on radiation damping for the other half. An validated model of the semi-active devices is used to examine the response of a full scale <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> system to a suite of earthquake ground motions to prove the overall concept. Overall, similar semi-active <b>rocking</b> <b>walls</b> could also be used as supplemental, low-footprint response energy management systems in retrofitting a variety of structures...|$|R
50|$|The terraced {{gardens in}} the Kalalau Valley are {{threatened}} by the introduced, invasive trees which create underground root networks invading the <b>rock</b> <b>walls.</b> The trees then fall and topple the <b>rock</b> <b>walls</b> causing permanent damage. The origin of the trees is disputed.|$|R
50|$|Upper Island Cove, {{like many}} {{communities}} on the Avalon {{is built on}} very rugged terrain. People had to remove rocks in order to farm the land. The rocks were then used to build <b>rock</b> <b>walls</b> that served as boundaries between properties. The <b>rock</b> <b>walls</b> can still be seen today.|$|R
25|$|A large Recreation Center {{provides}} {{classes and}} facilities {{for students and}} faculty. The Center has swimming pools, racquetball courts, a <b>rock</b> <b>wall,</b> and exercise machines.

40|$|<b>Rocking</b> <b>walls</b> are an {{effective}} method of dissipating structural response energy and mitigating damage during seismic events. Similarly, semi-active resetable devices have shown significant potential to dissipate energy, customize hysteresis behavior and reduce damage. Hence, {{the addition of}} a resetable device within a <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> can further improve the overall energy management during seismic events. A rocking system, designed for a large open structure, is modeled and the response to a suite of Earthquake records examined for the uncontrolled and device added system. Performance metrics of peak reduction factors, equivalent effective/viscous damping and area enclosed in the Cc vs theta curve are presented for a suite of 10 Earthquakes. Results show that semi-active <b>rocking</b> <b>walls</b> have 3 - 4 x more effective equivalent viscous damping and can provide it every cycle, rather than for 1 - 2 cycles as with pre-stressed, pre-tensioned passive designs. Such semi-active <b>rocking</b> <b>walls</b> could also be used as supplemental, low-footprint response energy management systems in retro-fitting a variety of structure...|$|R
25|$|The entire plateau {{on which}} the {{buildings}} and graveyard lie is walled. In the grounds around the buildings an extensive graveyard includes a number of high crosses. Scully's Cross, {{one of the largest}} and most famous high crosses here, originally constructed in 1867 to commemorate the Scully family, was destroyed in 1976 when lightning struck a metal rod that ran the length of the cross. The remains of the top of the cross now lie at the base of the cross adjacent to the <b>rock</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fourth level houses Science Works (formerly {{known as}} Science Spectrum), an exhibit devoted to {{exploring}} natural science and physical science through building activities. Children may build toy boats to float along the waterway, {{play in a}} construction zone, erect an arch, climb a <b>rock</b> <b>wall,</b> crawl through tunnels, observe a live pond, and participate in other activities. Within Science Works is the Biotech Lab, which hosts daily events focusing {{on the future of}} DNA and chemistry and SciencePort which focuses on plant biology.|$|E
25|$|Block 3 is {{essentially}} the same as the large artillery casemates built by CORF for the main Maginot line in northeastern France, with 75mm guns on the upper level and 81mm mortars firing upwards out of the pit in front of the guns. The block is sunk into the ground, compared to the more typical batteries in the Alps, which were usually built into the side of a cliff or <b>rock</b> <b>wall.</b> Block 2 fired 599 rounds of 75mm shells and 770 81mm mortar rounds in June 1940.|$|E

25|$|The track {{climbs up}} through the forest. On the {{northern}} {{side of the mountain}} there is no bamboo zone, so the forest gradually turns into moorland covered with giant heather. The track ends at Old Moses Camp and becomes a path. This continues up the hill before splitting into two routes. To the left, the least used path goes {{around the side of the}} Barrow, to Likii North Hut. The vegetation becomes more sparse, with giant lobelia and groundsels dotted around. The path climbs over a ridge, before rejoining the main path ascending the Mackinder Valley. Shipton's Cave can be found in the <b>rock</b> <b>wall</b> to the left of the steep path just before reaching Shipton's Camp.|$|E
25|$|Boardwalk Games include {{physical}} challenges {{such as a}} <b>rock</b> <b>wall,</b> soccer, {{basketball and}} a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for {{an expansion of the}} Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.|$|E
25|$|After {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Natural History sent fossil hunter Earl Douglass to Utah to {{excavate}} the Carnegie Quarry in the area now known as Dinosaur National Monument. Four neck vertebrae, each onemeter (3feet) long, were collected in 1912 near a specimen of Diplodocus, but a few years later, William Jacob Holland realized they belonged to a different species. Meanwhile, the type specimen of Barosaurus had finally been prepared at Yale in the winter of 1917 and was fully described by Richard Swann Lull in 1919. Based on Lull's description, Holland referred the vertebrae (CM 1198), along with a second partial skeleton found by Douglass in 1918 (CM 11984), to Barosaurus. This second Carnegie specimen remains in the <b>rock</b> <b>wall</b> at Dinosaur National Monument and was not fully prepared until the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The lichen grow on acidic <b>rock</b> <b>walls</b> {{located in}} inland areas.

Other lichen species that are typically associated with Acarospora flavisparsa include Protoparmelia montagnei, and, to a lesser extent, Dimelaena oreina. A. flavisparsa is known to occur only in Portugal and Spain, in continental Mediterranean areas.|$|R
40|$|Introduced as {{a system}} in {{earthquake}} engineering in 2004 [6], <b>rocking</b> <b>walls</b> are a fairly new system in earthquake engineering. Their performance has been proven, both in research as in practice. However, a few uncertainties about their behavior still remain. One of these uncertainties {{is the effect of}} radiation damping on the motion of the system. Existing estimations for the radiation damping use an equivalent damping ratio, which was actually derived for a rocking block that is not connected to any structure. The formula for this equivalent damping ratio also assumes both the block as the soil to be rigid. The validity of the latter can be questioned. This thesis will research the influence of the flexibility of the soil on the motion of a <b>rocking</b> <b>wall.</b> The influence of the shear wave velocity and the Poisson ratio will be considered. The flexible soil medium is modeled with the finite element method, using a 2 D plain strain analysis. In {{order to be able to}} use a reasonably fine mesh, the dimensions of the soil island will be small. Viscous boundaries are therefore used to absorb incoming waves. The assumption of a rigid <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> is considered to be still valid. Therefore, the motion of the <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> is modeled by adding only three degrees of freedom to the finite element model of the soil, applying constraint equations and inserting bilinear springs in the interface between the <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> and the soil. The dynamic response will be simulated with an implicit, unconditionally stable time domain method. Results show that the motion of the <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> strongly depends on the shear wave velocity. The Poisson ratio has a clear but negligible effect. The simulation also shows that it is, as expected, not valid to estimate an equivalent damping ratio for the <b>rocking</b> <b>wall</b> and using this ratio for the system's response. by Jeroen J. J.
