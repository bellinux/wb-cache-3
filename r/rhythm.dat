5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or <b>rhythm,</b> {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or <b>rhythm.</b> In the context of a new-onset irregular heart <b>rhythm</b> (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a <b>rhythm</b> disturbance is managed, as does whether a <b>rhythm</b> causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

40|$|The {{suprachiasmatic nucleus}} (SCN), the master {{circadian}} clock, contains a network composed of multiple types of neurons which {{are thought to}} form a hierarchical and multioscillator system. The molecular clock machinery in SCN neurons drives membrane excitability and sends time cue signals to various brain regions and peripheral organs. However, how and at what {{time of the day}} these neurons transmit output signals remain largely unknown. Here, we successfully visualized circadian voltage <b>rhythms</b> optically for many days using a genetically encoded voltage sensor, ArcLightD. Unexpectedly, the voltage <b>rhythms</b> are synchronized across the entire SCN network of cultured slices, whereas simultaneously recorded Ca 2 + <b>rhythms</b> are topologically specific to the dorsal and ventral regions. We further found that the temporal order of these two <b>rhythms</b> is cell-type specific: The Ca 2 + <b>rhythms</b> phase-lead the voltage <b>rhythms</b> in AVP neurons but Ca 2 + and voltage <b>rhythms</b> are nearly in phase in VIP neurons. We confirmed that circadian firing <b>rhythms</b> are also synchronous and are coupled with the voltage <b>rhythms.</b> These results indicate that SCN networks with asynchronous Ca 2 + <b>rhythms</b> produce coherent voltage <b>rhythms...</b>|$|R
5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, <b>rhythm,</b> and {{intonation}} of a poem. <b>Rhythm</b> and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while <b>rhythm</b> is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhythm</b> game or <b>rhythm</b> {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of <b>rhythm.</b> Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many <b>rhythm</b> games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} input devices, <b>rhythm</b> games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhythm</b> game, or <b>rhythm</b> action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of <b>rhythm.</b> The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure <b>rhythm</b> and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain <b>rhythm</b> games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending <b>rhythm</b> with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E

40|$|Biological <b>rhythms</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} in practically all groups of laboratory mammals and {{at every level of}} physiological and behavioural organization. Biological <b>rhythms</b> are classified according to their period as ultradian (24 h), and seasonal or circannual <b>rhythms</b> (~ 1 year). This review outlines what is known about the neurobiology of biological <b>rhythms</b> in mammals and describes the hierarchical order in which ultradian, circadian and infradian <b>rhythms</b> are related to each other. The article does not attempt to catalogue every physiological variable showing rhythmical fluctuations in laboratory mammals. Rather, it focuses on the basic concepts of circadian <b>rhythms</b> and recent advances made in our understanding of the physiology of the internal clock controlling circadian and other biological <b>rhythms...</b>|$|R
5|$|The chief {{device of}} ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create <b>rhythm,</b> but instead creates <b>rhythm</b> based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to {{the point that they}} could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a <b>rhythm.</b> In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create <b>rhythm.</b> Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{patterns}} of meter used in Modern English verse to create <b>rhythm</b> no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In {{the case of}} free verse, <b>rhythm</b> is often organized based on looser units of cadence rather than a regular meter. Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry. Jeffers experimented with sprung <b>rhythm</b> {{as an alternative to}} accentual <b>rhythm.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{methods for}} {{creating}} poetic <b>rhythm</b> vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are {{often described as}} having timing set primarily by accents, syllables, or moras, depending on how <b>rhythm</b> is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. Japanese is a mora-timed language. Syllable-timed languages include Latin, Catalan, French, Leonese, Galician and Spanish. English, Russian and, generally, German are stress-timed languages. Varying intonation also affects how <b>rhythm</b> is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch, such as in Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or tone. Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages.|$|E

50|$|Journal of Biological <b>Rhythms</b> is a peer-reviewed {{academic}} {{journal that}} publishes papers focused on chronobiology, or {{any aspect of}} biological <b>rhythms</b> with a special emphasis on seasonal and circadian <b>rhythms.</b> However, papers on various other <b>rhythms</b> are also published in the Journal of Biological <b>Rhythms.</b> These publications can be primary reports of new discoveries, reviews, commentaries, or letters. As such, {{the authors of the}} publications have a diverse set of backgrounds and base their findings in areas like ecology, neurobiology and behavior, psychology and psychiatry, endocrinology, developmental biology, pharmacology, cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and mathematical modeling. The Journal of Biological <b>Rhythms</b> has been in publication since 1986 and is currently published by SAGE Publications. The Journal of Biological <b>Rhythms</b> is the official publication of the Society for Research on Biological <b>Rhythms.</b> The journal's Chief Editor is William J Schwartz.|$|R

5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus <b>rhythm</b> of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart <b>rhythm,</b> such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart <b>rhythm.</b> A random and varying <b>rhythm</b> is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E

5|$|British <b>rhythm</b> {{and blues}} {{differed}} in tone {{from that of}} African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British <b>rhythm</b> and blues singers were criticised for their emulation of <b>rhythm</b> and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (<b>rhythm,</b> lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
50|$|The {{ranking system}} in the drums help in the {{transmission}} of the <b>rhythms.</b> Starting out on the tariparau provides the musician with aural access to the <b>rhythms</b> played on the fa’atete and to’ere while playing the basic pehe.

40|$|Pinealectomized lizards (Podarcis sicula) whose {{locomotor}} <b>rhythms</b> {{were recorded}} in constant temperature (29 degrees C) and darkness were subdivided into 2 groups of hosts: Each belonging to the Ist group (experimentals) received from a donor a pineal gland, and each belonging to the 2 nd one (controls) received a piece of cerebellum. Pineal transplantation induced drastic changes in the free-running period (tau) of locomotor <b>rhythms,</b> which were significantly greater than the tau changes induced by cerebellum transplantation. Either application or removal of melatonin implants left the locomotor <b>rhythms</b> of the controls completely undisturbed, showing that in absence of melatonin <b>rhythms</b> (pinealectomy alone abolishes blood-borne melatonin <b>rhythms)</b> melatonin implants are ineffective. Melatonin <b>rhythms,</b> however, had {{to be present in}} the experimentals, because the circadian system reacts to melatonin implants by changing tau (as if melatonin <b>rhythms</b> had been suppressed) and to removal of the implants by again changing tau (as if melatonin <b>rhythms</b> had been restored) ...|$|R
40|$|In Rhythmanalysis, Henri Lefebvre {{put forward}} his {{ideas on the}} {{relationship}} between time and space, particularly how <b>rhythms</b> characterize space. Here, leading geographers advance and expand on Lefebvre's theories, examining how they intersect with current theoretical and political concerns within the social sciences. In terms of geography, rhythmanalysis highlights tensions between repetition and innovation, between the need for consistency and the need for disruption. These tensions reveal the ways in which social time is managed to ensure a measure of stability through the instantiation of temporal norms, whilst at the same time showing how this is often challenged. In looking at the <b>rhythms</b> of geographies, and drawing upon a wide range of geographical contexts, this book explores the ordering of different <b>rhythms</b> according to four main themes: <b>rhythms</b> of nature, <b>rhythms</b> of everyday life, <b>rhythms</b> of mobility, and the official and routine <b>rhythms</b> which superimpose themselves on the multiple <b>rhythms</b> of the body. ...|$|R
5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} <b>rhythm</b> and blues had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music {{were used to}} {{describe}} popular music by black artists.

Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E

40|$|Circadian <b>rhythms</b> {{modulate}} {{the biology}} of many human tissues, including brain tissues, and are driven by a near 24 -hour transcriptional feedback loop. These <b>rhythms</b> are paralleled by 24 -hour <b>rhythms</b> of large portions of the transcriptome. The role of dynamic DNA methylation in influencing these <b>rhythms</b> is uncertain. While recent work in Neurospora suggests that dynamic site-specific circadian <b>rhythms</b> of DNA methylation {{may play a role}} in modulating the fungal molecular clock, such <b>rhythms</b> and their relationship to RNA expression have not, to our knowledge, been elucidated in mammalian tissues, including human brain tissues. We hypothesized that 24 -hour <b>rhythms</b> of DNA methylation exist in the human brain, and play a role in driving 24 -hour <b>rhythms</b> of RNA expression. We analyzed DNA methylation levels in post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from 738 subjects. We assessed for 24 -hour rhythmicity of 420, 132 DNA methylation sites throughout the genome by considering methylation levels as a function of clock time of death and parameterizing these data using cosine functions. We determined global statistical significance by permutation. We then related <b>rhythms</b> of DNA methylation with <b>rhythms</b> of RNA expression determined by RNA sequencing.
