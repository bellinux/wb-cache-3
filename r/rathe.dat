MÉTODO: Foi aplicado questionário contendo informações gerais, condições socio-econômicas, informações sobre o quadro clínico e tempo de doença. A amostra foi calculada para estimar uma prevalência de 20 %, com erro relativo de 10 %, e intervalo de confiança de 95 % (erro a de 5 %). O sorteio e as análises foram {{realizadas}} por meio de computador usando programas apropriados. RESULTADOS E CONCLUSÕES: Foram colhidas 1. 341 amostras de soro de 9 distritos sanitários, testadas por inibição da hemaglutinação, sendo classificadas como negativas e positivas (respostas primária - RP e secundária - RS). Foram reativas 588 (44 %) amostras, sendo 93 (7 %) RP e 495 (37 %) RS. A prevalência global em Fortaleza variou de 21 % a 71 %. Houve 41 % (243 / 588) de infecções assintomáticas (IA) e 59 % (346 / 588) sintomáticas (IS). Não houve diferença da prevalência quanto ao sexo, faixa etária e escolaridade, ao contrário da condição socioeconômica que apresentou diferenças estatisticamente significantes (p OBJECTIVE: A seroepidemiological random {{survey was}} carried out in Fortaleza city, State of Ceará, Brazil, following an epidemic of dengue virus type 2 (DEN 2), with the purpose of evaluating the frequency of clinical manifestations (signs and symptoms) and the prevalence of dengue infection. METHOD: A questionnaire calling for information on address, sex, age, clinical, epidemiological and economic status was applied to the population, followed by venupuncture collection of 5 - 10 ml of blood for testing by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI). The sample was calculated to obtain a prevalence of 20 % with relative risk of 10 % and confidence interval of 95 %. All information obtained was analyzed by computer using Epi Info 5. 0 ®, Lotus 123 ®, Excel 5. 0 ®, and Stata® software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of 1, 341 serum samples were obtained from nine Health Districts (SD) and tested by hemagglutination inhibition. Of these, 589 (44 %) were positive and 752 (56 %) negative. Of the positive results, 93 primary responses (PR) (7 %) to DEN- 2 and 496 secondary responses (SR) (37 %) were observed. The global prevalence in the SD ranged from 21 % to 71 %. There were 41 % (243 / 589) asymptomatic infections and 59 % (346 / 589) symptomatic infections. Data analysis showed no difference in frequency by sex, age, on schooling, although a highly statistically significant difference was found as between the different social classes, the infection most commonly observed being among people of better social status. The stratification of positive cases showed greater prevalence of AI (p< 0. 001) and SI (p< 0. 0001) in both sexes, among people with SR <b>rathes</b> than PR. The most prevalent symptoms were fever, headache, muscle pains, rash, dizziness, and joint pains. Moreover, itching, retro-bulbar pain, rash, and gingival bleeding, showed statistically significant differences. On the other hand, dizziness and joint pains were more associated in the patients with SR than PR, and statistically significant differences were also observed...|$|R
