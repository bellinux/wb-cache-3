50|$|The {{physical}} or symbolic {{destruction of a}} will constitutes <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> renders it invalid.

Deletion of an entire will is an act of destruction that constitutes <b>revocation,</b> <b>and</b> is thus governed by the common law, but a deletion of a portion of a will, by and large, amounts to an <b>amendment</b> <b>and</b> consequently has to comply with certain prescribed formalities.|$|R

40|$|<b>Revocation</b> <b>and</b> Invalidity of European Trade Mark <b>Revocation</b> <b>and</b> {{invalidity}} of European trade mark, {{more precisely}} termed as Community trade mark (hereinafter as "CTM"), {{is a specific}} field of trade mark law of the European Union. It is Council Regulation (EC) No 207 / 2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark which forms a legal basis in this regard. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and especially the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union play very significant role in this area. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding Directive 2008 / 95 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate {{the laws of the}} Member States relating to trade marks is also relevant for the <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> invalidity of CTM as this Directive provides for the <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> invalidity of national trade marks in similar manner. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the nature of <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> invalidity of CTM and individual grounds for <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> invalidity as well as selected related issues, e. g. of procedural nature. This thesis is divided into four chapters. First chapter briefly introduces the institute of CTM and trade [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Public-key {{infrastructures}} (PKIs) {{that support}} both identity certificates and access control (e. g., attribute, delegation) certificates are increasingly common. We {{argue that these}} PKIs must also support <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> review policies that are typical of more traditional access control systems; e. g., selective <b>and</b> transitive certificate <b>revocation,</b> <b>and</b> per-object access review. Further, we show that PKIs that eliminate identity certificates, such as the SPKI, resolve only selective <b>revocation</b> problems <b>and,</b> at the same time, make access review more complex. 1 Introduction The distribution <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> of identity certificates in Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) have been extensively addressed in the literature [7, 8, 12]. Various PKIs, such as X. 509 [6, 10], SPKI [2], SDSI [11], and PKI applications [1, 8], also include access control (i. e., attribute, delegation) certificates, which are commonly used for the distribution <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> of access privileges.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, identity-based {{cryptographic}} (IBC) schemes {{have been}} considered to secure mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to their efficient key management properties. However, proposed schemes do not provide mechanisms for key <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> key renewal. In this paper, we propose the first key <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> key renewal mechanisms for IBC schemes that are especially designed for MANETs. In our fully self-organized revocation scheme, each node monitors nodes in communication range and securely propagates its observations. The public key of a node is revoked if a minimum number of nodes accused the node. To enable key renewal, we introduce a modified format for ID-based public keys, such that new keys can be issued for the same identity. The introduced revocation scheme is efficient because it uses pre-shared keys from the Weil pairing to secure accusation <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> messages <b>and</b> messages are sent to an m-hop neighborhood instead of to the entire network. Our revocation mechanism {{can be adapted to}} PKI schemes in MANETs. ...|$|R

In addition, a suite of novel security mechanisms are introduced for achieving secure certificate <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> conditional privacy preservation, which are considered among the most challenging design objectives in vehicular ad hoc networks...|$|R
