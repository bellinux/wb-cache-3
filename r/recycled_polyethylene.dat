It is also possible to have carpet made completely from <b>recycled</b> <b>polyethylene</b> terephthalate used for food/drink containers. Recycled nylon is also a common material used and the process takes carpet made with nylon 6 fibers and recycles it into brand new nylon carpet.

This is sustainable and it reduces material sent to landfill; further it uses dyeing methods that are less polluting and require less energy than other flooring. This flooring is sustainable when used alongside eco-friendly adhesive, as some products may have toxic finishes added (stain/fireproofing) that are not considered sustainable.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of using <b>recycled</b> <b>polyethylene</b> on the mechanical properties of PE-MDF composite. Saw dust as a filler at 30 %and MAPE as coupling agent at two levels of 0 and 2 wt% were mixed in an internal mixer and the samples were prepared by injection molding method [...] Mechanical properties such as tensile and flexural (Strength and Modulus) were measured. Morphology of composite was also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Although virgin polyethylene has better mechanical properties than once and twice <b>recycled</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> but with the addition of sawdust as filler consisting of <b>recycled</b> <b>polyethylene</b> composites mechanical properties significantly higher than that virgin polyethylene. The results of mechanical properties showed improvement by the addition of MAPE.

40|$|AbstractBitumen is a {{component}} of asphalt binder that combines gravel, sand and mineral powder in the monolith. Bitumen performs this function due to adhesive properties and ability to become liquid when heated, and becomes solid when cooling. At the same thermoplasticity and low strength makes bitumen the most sensitive of all the components of asphalt {{to the effects of}} traffic loads and climatic factors. Softening of bitumen at summer temperatures causes rutting on roads and winter fragility results in the occurrence of low-temperature cracking. Modification of bitumen by such polymer additives as thermoelastjplastics of SBS type, latex, terpolymers allows improving bitumen properties and increasing asphalt concrete durability. These additives increase cohesive strength and heat resistance of bitumen, impart elasticity to it, improve its behavior at low temperatures. The main reason that hinders wide application of polymeric modifiers is their high cost. One promising way for solving an issue is partial substitution of expensive modifiers for cheaper plastic waste. In addition, this waste must meet two requirements. Firstly, it should be compatible with bitumen. Secondly, it must provide bitumen with the required positive properties, although maybe not to the extent as special modifiers do. The conducted research showed that so-called <b>recycled</b> <b>polyethylene</b> resulting from the processing of plastic products (films designed for agricultural works, packaging material etc.) meets these requirements. <b>Recycled</b> <b>polyethylene</b> increases viscosity, cohesive strength and heat resistance of bitumen. The conducted studies allowed establishing effective combinations on the basis of <b>recycled</b> <b>polyethylene</b> which ensured significant reduction in the content of expensive special polymer modifiers in bitumen. Ratio of components in the polymer composition is as follows: <b>recycled</b> <b>polyethylene</b> - from 50 % to 65 %, latex or SBS thermoelastoplastics type - from 30 % to 50 %, plasticizer (industrial oils, oil extracts, etc.) up to 10 %. Rational content is from 3 % to 4 % by weight of bitumen. The technologies of combining polymer components among themselves and with bitumen were developed. Modification of bitumen by created polymer compositions improved strength and heat resistance characteristics of asphalt concrete and increased its resistance to cracking. Technological parameters of modified bitumen based asphalt mixtures preparation and placing were defined. Modification of asphalt concrete by direct introducing of composite polymer additive in the mix was proposed...|$|E

This study demonstrated that: 1) It is feasible to use <b>recycled</b> high density <b>polyethylene</b> fibers as secondary reinforcement for temperature and shrinkage influences in Portland cement concrete structures, 2) RHDPE fibers appear {{to be able to be}} produced more economically than virgin polypropylene fibers, 3) RHDPE fibers appear to overcome several of the negatives presented by the virgin polypropylene fibers, including floating to the surface and impact on slump, and 4) Shrinkage crack propagation was controlled as effectively by the RHDPE fibers as by the virgin polypropylene fibers. Four very important concerns relative to the use of RHDPE that were reserved for later study subject to the success of this study are: 1) the potential challenge of the alkaline reaction of the RHDPE material, 2) RHPD’s performance under extreme temperature cycling, water migration rate studies, 3) its performance under extreme temperature cycling, and 4) the impact of long-term plastic shrinkage...|$|R

Five different samples of bitumen/γ-LDPER compositions with the modifier content, wt. %: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, were prepared. The effects of the γ-LDPER on original and aged bitumen were investigated by means of morphological, chemical, and physical testing program, including FTIR spectroscopy, conventional tests, rotational viscosity (RV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and bending beam rheometer (BBR) tests. Superior performing asphalt pavements (Superpave) specifications were used to analyze mechanical test results as well as to determine the performance grades (PG) of the binders. Optimum usage of the γ-LDPER as modifier in bitumen were suggested after testing program. The results reveal the stiffening effect of the γ-LDPER on bitumen that provide enhanced temperature susceptibility and also promise better performance grades (PG) with γ-LDPER polymer modification...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{recycled}} plastics {{have drawn}} {{much attention to}} the public and been increasingly used as non-structural engineering and construction components. These materials have moderate mechanical strength, good biodegradable properties and resistance to rot and insect attacks making them to be comparable with timber for light load-bearing structural applications. In terms of the environmental concern, excessive use of timber may cause serious damages to the wildlife environment. Unfortunately, the use of these plastics and their composites in the civil engineering industry is still restricted to indoor non-load bearing components due to their low stiffness and strength properties. In view of the aforementioned problem, this study investigated the tensile properties of glass fibre reinforced recycled mixed plastic composites (GMPC) as an alternative for pure recycled plastics. The matrix of the composites was made by blending <b>recycled</b> high-density <b>polyethylene</b> (rHDPE), <b>recycled</b> low-density <b>polyethylene</b> (rLDPE) and <b>recycled</b> polypropylene (rPP), and the reinforcement was short glass fibre. The contents of fibre for this study ranged from 10 to 30 wt. % and the composites were produced by using injection moulding technique. The tensile property test was carried out by following the ISO 527 standard. It was observed that with the addition of 30 wt% of glass fibre, tensile strength and modulus increased by 100 % and 300 %, respectively. However, the specimens with glass fibre became brittle and ductility was reduced. The comparison of the results of GMPC composites with virgin plastic shows that the addition of glass fibre enhances tensile properties. ...|$|R
