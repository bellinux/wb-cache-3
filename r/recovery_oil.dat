Chemical flooding has been attracted more attention in recent years, because it has various challenges such as wettability alteration, adsorption loss, interfacial tension reduction, and oil and water phase behavior (Kong and Ohadi 2010; Ahmadi and Shadizadeh 2013 a, b, 2015; Ahmadi et al. 2014).|$|R

30|$|From Figs.  3 and 4, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the total oil {{recovery}} increases as the converting time is later, but it changes little when SF is converted to hot-water flooding at 24.28 %-oil <b>recovery.</b> <b>Oil</b> recovery during the hot-water flooding process varies a lot when converted at different moments. The stage oil recoveries are relatively lower when the oil recoveries in the SF process are 14.67 % and 30.50 %. It is highest and reaches 24.56 % when converted at 24.28 %-oil recovery. Therefore, the appropriate converting moment is when oil recovery during the steam flooding process reaches 24.28 %.|$|E

40|$|Key words: Molecular film {{displacement}},enhanced oil <b>recovery,</b> <b>oil</b> displacement mechanism absorption and desorption, spontaneous imbibition diffusion. Abstract. Molecular film displacement {{is a new}} nanofilm EOR technique. A {{large number}} of experiments show that the mechanism of molecular film displacement is different from conventional chemical displacement (polymer, surfactant, alkali and ASP displacement etc). With water solution acting as transfer medium, molecules of the filming agent develop the force to form films through electrostatic interaction, with efficient molecules deposited on the negatively charged rock surface to form ultrathin films at nanometer scale. This change the properties of reservoir surface and the interaction condition with crude oil, making the oil easily be displaced as the pores swept by the injected fluid. Thus oil recovery is enhanced. The mechanism of molecular filming agent mainly includes absorption, wettability alteration, diffusion and capillary imbibition etc...|$|E

Strong evidence has been found for both effects. Progress in transition in one period can significantly affect growth in the subsequent period, and this growth can act as an immediate spur to further reform. While the importance of initial conditions as a determinant of growth has declined over time, fiscal surpluses are positively associated with higher growth.

30|$|While {{implementing}} chemical EOR methods, certain challenges must be faced, namely {{high temperature}} condition, high salinity, geochemical lithology variation, and heterogeneity of formation.

The small size of nanoparticles in a key factor contributes to enhancing the <b>recovery</b> <b>oil.</b> Due to their insignificant size, they can easily move through porous media for substantial lengths. Since the particle size is not high enough to block the pore throats in porous media, nanoparticles can survive the transport through pores (Ayatollahi et al. 2012; Mcelfresh et al. 2012). It is, however, up {{to the point where the}} nanoparticles’ agglomeration process causes the blockage of pore throats leading to permeability impairment of the porous media.

30|$|The {{results of}} contact angle {{measurements}} presented in Figs.  9 and 10 {{and the results}} of core flooding tests presented in Figs.  4 and 5 indicate that <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> could increase if the contact angle is increased. In other words, the <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> could increase as the wettability is changed to more intermediate levels. This observation is in contradiction with Jadhunandan and Morrow (1995), Tang and Morrow (1999 a, b), Zhang and Morrow (2006); they all concluded that water-wet wettability yields higher <b>oil</b> <b>recovery.</b> Agbalaka et al. (2008) conducted a review on the effect of reservoir rock wettability on <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> for secondary and tertiary <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> processes. Several field cases as well as laboratory studies were discussed. The fact that wettability affects <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> can affect <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> efficiency is widely acknowledged. However, the wetting phase that will result in optimal <b>recovery</b> of <b>oil</b> {{has been the subject of}} intense debate. Agbalaka et al. (2008) observed that the reason for this divergence in observed reports is attributable to a number of factors which includes (1) difficulty in wetting state reproducibility, (2) lack of unified standards and procedure for coring, core handling and core storage, and (3) the wetting state characterization method adopted. They concluded that strongly oil wet reservoirs give the least <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> and the best recovery appears to be the intermediate wet reservoirs. These findings are consistent with the results of the present work. Sharma and Filoco (2005) also suggested that low-salinity brine changes the wetting properties of the rock surface from water-wet to mixed-wet and thereby increase the recovery.|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Viscous oil {{reservoirs}} {{tend to be}} low-energy, low-gas/oil-ratio {{systems with}} high viscosities and are difficult to produce, transport and refine by conventional methods. Some of the commonly considered viscous oil recovery methods include processes such as steam flooding, in-situ combustion and miscible gas injection. The large viscous oil deposits in the ANS cannot be produced entirely by conventional methods like pressure displacement or waterflooding. Other methods such as miscible (gas injection and water alternating gas (WAG) also have limited success.

Understanding of the phase behaviour of systems containing asphaltenes is very important to develop effective asphaltene deposition mitigation strategies. In order to get a better understanding of asphaltenes and in particular to get more insight in relations between molecular structural features and observed macroscopic behaviour, the phase behaviour of two poly-aromatic molecules (violanthrone- 79 and hexa-tert-butylhexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene) was studied. Although both compounds do not represent all specific features of real asphaltenes, it is expected that to some extend they do. For instance, real asphaltenes are ill-defined mixtures and hard to characterize, while the selected poly-aromatic compounds form a well-defined system with toluene and CO 2. The poly-aromatic compounds were selected based on their molecular features and their tendency to self-assemble. The phase behaviour of solutions of these compounds in toluene was studied in the presence of different concentrations of carbon dioxide with a so-called Cailletet apparatus. The results in this work showed that the concentration of carbon dioxide affects the precipitation of the poly-aromatic compounds. At low concentration there is no precipitation, i. e., carbon dioxide acts as a co-solvent, while at higher concentration, carbon dioxide acts as an anti-solvent and the poly-aromatic molecule in the ternary system precipitates. As far as the phase behaviour is concerned, hexa-tert-butylhexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene resembles that of a real asphaltene...|$|E

Intended as a text for advanced undergraduates and as a reference for practicing engineers, the book uses the physics of flows in porous materials to tie together a wide variety of important issues from such fields as biomedical engineering, energy conversion, civil engineering, electronics, chemical engineering, and environmental engineering. Thus, for example, flows of water and oil through porous ground {{play a central role in}} energy exploration and <b>recovery</b> (<b>oil</b> wells, geothermal fluids), energy conversion (effluents from refineries and power plants), and environmental engineering (leachates from waste repositories).

Filters, catalytic converters, the drying of stored grains, and a myriad of other applications involve flows through porous media. By providing a unified theoretical framework that includes not only the traditional homogeneous and isotropic media but also models in which the assumptions of representative elemental volumes or global thermal equilibrium fail, the book provides practicing engineers the tools they need to analyze complex situations that arise in practice.
