5|$|Scholars have differing {{views on}} whether this {{dialogue}} {{is evidence that}} in ancient Vedic tradition women were accepted as active participants in spiritual discussions and as scholars of Brahman. Wendy Doniger, an American Indologist {{and a professor of}} History of Religions, states that in this dialogue Maitreyi is not portrayed as an author, but is part of an Upanishadic story of a Brahmin with two wives who are distinguished by their intellect. Karen Pechelis, another American Indologist and a professor of Comparative Religion, in contrast, states that Maitreyi is portrayed as theologically minded, as she challenges Yajnavalkya in this dialogue and asks the <b>right</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
25|$|During his centenary in 1903, while {{receiving}} {{attention from}} all leading musical reference books, {{he was still}} not generally accepted as {{being one of the}} great composers. Some of his music was still in neglect and his following was smaller than other, mainly German, composers. Even half a century did not change much, and it took until the 1960s for the <b>right</b> <b>questions</b> to be asked about his work, and for it to be viewed in a more balanced and sympathetic light. One of the pivotal events in this fresh ignition of interest in the composer was a performance of Les Troyens by Rafael Kubelík in 1957 at Covent Garden. The music of Berlioz enjoyed a revival during the 1960s and 1970s, {{due in large part to}} the efforts of French conductor Charles Munch and of British conductor Sir Colin Davis, who recorded his entire oeuvre, bringing to light a number of Berlioz's lesser-known works. An unusual (but telling) example of the increase of Berlioz's fame in the 1960s was an explosion of forged autographs, manuscripts, and letters, evidently created to cater for a much greater interest in the composer. Davis's recording of Les Troyens was the first near-complete recording of that work. The work, which Berlioz never saw staged in its entirety during his life, is now a part of the international repertoire, if still something of a rarity. Les Troyens was the first opera performed at the newly built Opéra Bastille in Paris on 17 March 1990 in a production claimed to be complete, but lacking the ballets.|$|E

[...] The Nameless One carries a journal, which helps the player keep track of the game's numerous quests and subplots. Death of the player character usually imposes no penalty beyond respawning in a different location.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} the best way for journalists to enable their {{audience}} to determine the truth about international <b>rights</b> <b>questions</b> and to grant the parties’ claims a fair hearing is by adhering to strict impartiality—i. e., by producing coverage that does not reflect the journalist’s personal views on the <b>rights</b> <b>question.</b> I then argue that {{that the best way}} for journalists to provide strictly impartial coverage is by utilizing a legal trial, and more specifically an adversarial trial as a model for impartial presentation. Unlike the traditional Just-the-Facts model, the adversarial model explicitly requires the journalist to challenge the narratives of the parties and to cover the relevant normative controversies. It solves the problem of partiality in content choice by asking the journalist to take up the perspective of a principled zealous advocate for both sides of the international <b>rights</b> <b>question...</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 2001, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy {{published}} Kramer's book Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America. In {{the book}} (as {{reported by the}} New York Times), Kramer argued that Middle East experts [...] "failed to ask the <b>right</b> <b>questions</b> {{at the right time}} about Islam. They underestimated its impact in the 1980's; they misrepresented its role in the early 1990's; and they glossed over its growing potential for terrorism against America in the late 1990's." [...] His critics claimed that “there is an agenda here, which is to discredit the entire Middle East establishment.”.|$|E

[...] Bendis also noted that Rosenberg was approaching the character and issues of rape and abuse differently to him, on which he said [...] "I made the right choice for me as a writer then and they're making the right choice for them as writers now. I thought about how much is different and how much has changed, and if it's not brought up in Jessica, when will it be brought up? So I was like, 'Yeah, you should.'

2500|$|In {{the book}} Eiseley conveys {{his sense of}} wonder at the depth {{of time and the}} vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, {{reactions}} to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In The Immense Journey, Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. Marston Bates writes, [...] "It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are not going to find the answers in human evolution until we have framed the <b>right</b> <b>questions,</b> and the questions are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations." ...|$|E

[...] The report also said that school Board members and school administrators who knew that tracking was in place failed to ask the <b>right</b> <b>questions</b> regarding privacy issues, district lawyers didn't probe the legal considerations of handing out computers, and administrators didn't talk about the ramifications. [...] It noted that Harriton High School Principal Kline, for example, learned about TheftTrack monitoring in September 2008, and said he asked DiMedio whether the district should advise students and parents about it. [...] But he never revisited the subject after DiMedio opined that the district should not because doing so would undermine TheftTrack's effectiveness. [...] The report faulted district administrators and staffers for failing to disclose and mismanaging the surveillance system, and for failing to establish strict policies to protect [...] "unsuspecting" [...] students' privacy.|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to ask the <b>right</b> <b>questions,</b> it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Abigail Thernstrom, {{reviewing}} Sowell's Intellectuals and Race for National Review, wrote [...] "This book is {{a wonderful}} spin-off from Thomas Sowell's magnificent 2009 volume Intellectuals and Society. For those who want a short introduction to Sowell-think, this small {{book is a}} perfect place to start. His main message—amply illustrated—is that, {{on the subject of}} race, intellectuals are useless. Indeed, they don't even ask the <b>right</b> <b>questions.</b> Thus, they're woefully lost when it comes to analyzing America's most important domestic issue: the status of blacks and the state of race relations. Of course his point about lame-brained intellectuals extends far beyond their writings on race. Indeed, his book is a primer on rigorous thinking about social and economic issues in general, here and abroad." [...] Thernstrom, herself a noted scholar of race relations and the Vice Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, concluded, [...] "I didn't think I would learn much from Sowell's wonderful little book, having slogged through the literature on race since I was born—or at least it feels like it's been that long. But I did. Most NR readers will not have been masochistically race-obsessed for years, but this book's tough questions and clear-eyed answers should make them even more disgusted with America's anti-intellectual intelligentsia than they probably already are. Intellectuals and Race is a feast of hard thinking about America's ongoing racial agony." ...|$|E
