5000|$|This {{refers to}} the {{military}} practice. For the civilian practice, see Vehicle recovery Vehicle recovery {{is a type of}} military operation conducted to extricate both wheeled and track vehicles that have become immobile due to condition of the soil, nature of terrain in general, loss of traction due to an attempt to negotiate an obstacle, having broken down, or from sustaining non-combat or combat damage. Recovery can be performed using manual or assisted methods of recovery, using ground or vehicle-mounted recovery equipment (mostly winches and cranes), with the recovery of heavier vehicles conducted using wheel and track recovery vehicles, including recovery {{with the use of the}} Fifth Wheel Towing Device or with Allied Kinetic Energy <b>Recovery</b> <b>Rope</b> (AKERR). Vehicle recovery can be performed by the vehicle itself, or by another like vehicle, and many field expedients for both recovery and repairs have been used by different armed forces since the wide introduction of vehicles into armed forces during the First World War. Special hand and arm signals are used during the vehicle recovery to guide the participants where field of view or [...] are restricted.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{accident}} occurred the agent, Mr. Hoyle, proceeded to descend into the shaft to the estimated 11 ft water-level whereby nothing could be seen. There was some minimal markings to the shaft walls below where the platform had fallen and little damage apart from some girders which had been dislodged at the High Hazel presumably by the tumbling scaffolding <b>ropes.</b> <b>Recovery</b> operations took place and the water remaining {{at the bottom of}} the shaft was removed, some of the wreckage {{at the bottom of the}} shaft had to be removed by using oxyacetylene burners before the bodies were finally recovered. The first body was initially recovered on Wednesday 17 March 1926 and the last on Friday 19 March 1926 and by Thursday 25 March 1926 the shaft bottom was fully cleared.|$|R
40|$|Encapsulation {{of cells}} has the {{potential}} to provide a protective barrier against host immune cell interactions after grafting. Previously we have shown that alginate encapsulated BDNF-producing fibroblasts (Fb/BDNF) survived for one month in culture, made bioactive neurotrophins, survived transplantation into the injured spinal cord in the absence of immune suppression, and provided a permissive environment for host axon growth. We extend these studies by examining the effects of grafting encapsulated Fb/BDNF into a subtotal cervical hemisection on recovery of forelimb and hindlimb function and axonal growth in the absence of immune suppression. Grafting of encapsulated Fb/BDNF resulted in partial recovery of forelimb usage in a test of vertical exploration and of hindlimb function while crossing a horizontal <b>rope.</b> <b>Recovery</b> was significantly greater compared to animals that received unencapsulated Fb/BDNF without immune suppression, but similar to that of immune suppressed animals receiving unencapsulated Fb/BDNF. Immunocytochemical examination revealed neurofilament (RT- 97), 5 -HT, CGRP and GAP- 43 containing axons surrounding encapsulated Fb/BDNF within the injury site, indicating axonal growth. BDA labeling however showed no evidence of regeneration of rubrospinal axons in recipients of encapsulated Fb/BDNF...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increased}} reporting {{figures for}} sexual offences, {{it is believed}} that this crime type is under-reported. Support information stresses the need to preserve forensic evidence, including the victim not washing themselves/their clothes. The bath scrunchie is a popular choice in the UK as a personal cleaning instrument, and its ability to retain semen was examined in this study. Retention of Acid Phosphatase (AP) and spermatozoa was explored on new and previously used bath scrunchies, in the presence/absence of Dove body wash. Seventy-seven percent of samples were positive for AP and spermatozoa were recovered from 99 %, indicating that the bath scrunchie is suitable for recovering this evidence type. Higher spermatozoa recovery was possible from the rope in comparison to the net, as a consequence of differences in surface area, but recovery in the presence of Dove body wash requires further examination, as this was variable. The compactness of the bath scrunchie affected spermatozoa recovery from the net, but did not appear to affect <b>recovery</b> from the <b>rope.</b> These preliminary study results show that the bath scrunchie could be of value as an evidential item if the victim has bathed or showered post-sexual offence and prior to reporting to the Police...|$|R
