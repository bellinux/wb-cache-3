40|$|AbstractAutomatic {{analysis}} and tuning {{is a key}} strategy that helps to exploit the potential of high performance systems. However, for parallel applications with long <b>running</b> times, <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> or highly data dependent performance patterns, {{it is necessary to}} make use of the strength of dynamic auto-tuning. An important factor in dynamic auto-tuning on a large scale is the number of additional resources required by the tuning system itself in order to reduce impact on the application performance. A tradeoff must be made between the loss of effectiveness of a tuning system using too few resources and the loss of its efficiency using too many resources. Most automatic analysis or tuning systems do not provide assistance for defining how many additional resources are required. In this work, we address this problem proposing a method focused on calculating the structure of hierarchical tuning networks. The topology will be composed of the minimum number of non-saturated resources. Experimental evaluation performed covers different use cases, each one showing that tuning networks built according to our proposal make efficient use of resources, while providing a high quality {{analysis and}} tuning environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{frequency}} response function based substructuring method (FRF-BSM) for modelling and investigating <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of engineering structures has received much attention in recent years among modal analysts. However, the accuracy and efficiency of the predicted <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the structures via the method is often found {{to be different from}} the test data. The discrepancy {{is believed to be the}} result of the coupling types used in the modelling. This paper aims to investigate the potential candidates of coupling types for FRF based substructuring in predicting the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a complex assembled structure which consists of a large flat span and two simplified aircraft pylons. Modal tests are performed to measure the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the assembled structure and its components. The finite element method is used for constructing analytical models of the assembled structure. The FRF-BSM is then used for the assembly of the span and pylons, and also to predict the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the assembled structure using rigid and elastic coupling. The comparison of results revealed that elastic coupling has demonstrated better capabilities to represent the bolted joints in the test structure, which may due to the coupling calculated is reasonably representing the stiffness of the bolted joints...|$|R

30|$|There are {{two ways}} to obtain {{frequency}} response of power systems. One is the measurement from devices such as phasor measurement units (PMUs) [8] and digital fault recorders from high voltage levels, and frequency disturbance recorder (FDR) [9, 10] and PMU Lights [11] from low voltage levels. The measured frequency reveals the actual <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of power systems. However, without the knowledge of event type and location, system frequency behaviour can hardly be examined with the measured frequency. In most situations, power systems are operated in ambient mode with little frequency deviation. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of frequency with large frequency deviation can be rarely observed. Therefore, the frequency <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> can hardly be studied using measurement data.|$|R

It is commonly accepted that detecting defects {{as early as possible}} is central in the development process. However, for the early phases, the only available techniques are usually static ones, such as inspections, making analysis of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> difficult. This paper presents an approach where textual scenarios, which represent system requirements, are transformed into state charts. The state charts are then simulated, making an analysis of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> possible. Early experiences indicate that many defects, otherwise difficult to detect, are found both in the transformation and in the simulation.

The vibration characteristics of individual draft pad are compared with draft pads that are part of draft gear.

Such properties are sensitivity to initial conditions, space filling, control and synchronization. Chaotic neural models have been devised to exploit such properties. In this paper, a chaotic spiking neuron model is investigated experimentally. This investigation is performed to understand the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the model. The aim of this research is to investigate the dynamics of the nonlinear dynamic state neuron (NDS) experimentally. The experimental approach has revealed some quantitative and qualitative properties of the NDS model such as the control mechanism, the reset mechanism, and the way the model may exhibit <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> in phase space. It is shown experimentally in this paper that both the reset mechanism and the self-feed back control mechanism are important for the NDS model to work and to stabilise to one of the large number of available unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) that are embedded in its attractor. The experimental investigation suggests that the internal dynamics of the NDS neuron provide a rich set of <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{that can be}} controlled and stabilised.

30|$|As {{described}} in Section ‘Structural testing’, {{the basic idea}} behind structural testing criteria {{is to ensure that}} specific elements (control elements and data structures) in a program are exercised by a given test set, providing evidence {{of the quality of the}} testing activity. It is supposed that the underlying model represents the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of programs based on static information to generate relevant test requirements. In general, such static information is extracted from the source code. However, there may be differences between what is extracted from source code and what is the real <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In techniques such as OO programming, such differences can be seen in cases of, for example, member (e.g. method or attribute) overriding and method overloading. In such cases, a special representation of these cases in the underlying model can help to reveal problems related to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Indian Rail {{transport}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} mode of transportation, so it must offer high comfort level for the passengers and the staff. However, the comfort that passengers experience is a highly complex and individual phenomenon. The improvement of passenger comfort while travelling has been the subject of intense interest for many train manufacturers, researchers and companies around the world. Although new techniques in manufacturing and design ensure better ride quality in railway carriages, still it is impossible to completely eliminate track defects or various ground irregularities. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a train also depends on the load and the mechanical systems, such as springs, dampers, etc., which interact with the wheels, the train body and bogies. The present study deals with the effects of railway track imperfections on <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and investigates the effect of vehicle speed and the rail irregularity on ride comfort through numerical simulation. The numerical simulation of the vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a typical railroad vehicle will be done by modelling through bond graph technique. The model consists of 17 degree of freedom with wheel set, bogie and car. For assessment of ride comfort Sperling ride index used by Indian Railway is calculated using filtered RMS accelerations.

40|$|Despite {{the many}} recent {{improvements}} in the speed and robustness of DPLL-based SAT solvers, we still lack {{a thorough understanding of}} the working mechanisms and <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of these solvers at run-time. In this paper, we present TIGERDISP, a tool designed to allow researchers to visualize the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> of modern DPLL solvers in terms of time-dependent metrics such as decision depth, implications and learned conflict clauses. It is our belief that inferences about <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be drawn more easily by visual analysis than by purely aggregate post-execution metrics such as total number of decisions/implications/conflicts. These inferences can then be validated through detailed quantitative analysis on larger sets of data. To this end, we have used TIGERDISP with the HAIFASAT and MINISAT solvers and have generated a few specific inferences about their relatively efficient and inefficient solving runs. We have then tested one of these inferences through quantitative analysis on a larger data set and have presented our findings in this paper. An important application of TIGERDISP would be {{in the development of a}} solver that employs adaptive algorithms. This is an area that has intrigued researchers in the past, but has not seen significant results for lack of a clear understanding as to what constitutes good progress during the run of a SAT solver.
