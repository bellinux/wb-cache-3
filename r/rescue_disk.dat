25|$|A <b>rescue</b> <b>disk</b> that is bootable, {{such as a}} CD or USB storage device, {{can be used to}} run {{antivirus}} software outside of the installed operating system, in order to remove infections while they are dormant. A bootable antivirus disk can be useful when, for example, the installed operating system is no longer bootable or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed {{antivirus software}}. Examples of some of these bootable disks include the Avira AntiVir Rescue System, PCTools Alternate Operating System Scanner, and AVG Rescue CD. The AVG Rescue CD software can also be installed onto a USB storage device, that is bootable on newer computers.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a <b>rescue</b> boot <b>disk.</b> This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Tow-Line Goes Haywire", one of Tow-Line's first acts on {{arriving}} on Earth was to tow Side Burn, {{much to the}} latter's disgust. Under Prowl's supervision, Tow-Line began towing away Metro City's illegal parkers. Unfortunately his zealousness extended to towing away tricycles, wedding cars, mailmen named Moe, and so on, leading Prowl to reprimand him. Tow-Line's work {{was not lost on}} the Predacons, who ambushed him and dragged him away to do a bit of reprogramming with a disk. Soon Tow-Line considered the other Autobots as villains and began towing X-Brawn. After reasoning failed, X-Brawn attempted to use his grappling hook, causing damage to the other Autobot's circuits, and resulting in Tow-Line dumping him down a hole at the power plant. Side Burn was also captured easily, but while carrying Rapid Run through the city, Tow-Line was spotted by Prowl and Koji. Intercepted by Optimus Prime and Prowl, he was soon <b>rescued</b> from the <b>disk's</b> control and apologized profusely for kidnapping his fellow Autobots. Even after learning his lesson, Tow-Line still cheerfully hauled off Prowl for parking illegally.|$|R

50|$|Puppy Linux is a {{complete}} operating system bundled {{with a collection of}} applications suited to general use tasks.

5000|$|Two {{types of}} attack {{scenarios}} exist {{in which it}} is possible to maliciously take advantage of this bootkit: in the first one, the user is required to launch the bootkit with administrative privileges once the PC has already booted into Windows; in the second one, analogously to hardware keyloggers, a malicious person needs physical access to the user's TrueCrypt-encrypted hard disk: in this context this is needed to modify the user's TrueCrypt MBR with that of the Stoned bootkit and then place the hard disk back on the unknowing user's PC, so that when the user boots the PC and types his/her TrueCrypt password on boot, the [...] "Stoned" [...] bootkit intercepts it thereafter because, from that moment on, the Stoned bootkit is loaded before TrueCrypt's MBR in the boot sequence. The first type of attack can be prevented as usual by good security practices, e.g. avoid running non-trusted executables with administrative privileges. The second one can be successfully neutralized by the user if he/she suspects that the encrypted hard disk might have been physically available to someone he/she does not trust, by booting the encrypted operating system with TrueCrypt's <b>Rescue</b> <b>Disk</b> instead of booting it directly from the hard disk. With the <b>rescue</b> <b>disk,</b> the user can restore TrueCrypt's MBR to the hard disk.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{written by}} Bruce Perens in 1995 and {{declared}} complete for his intended usage in 1996, BusyBox originally aimed {{to put a}} complete bootable system on a single floppy disk that would serve both as a <b>rescue</b> <b>disk</b> and as an installer for the Debian distribution. Since that time, it has been extended to become the de facto standard core user space toolset for embedded Linux devices and Linux distribution installers. Since each Linux executable requires several kilobytes of overhead, having the BusyBox program combine over two hundred programs together often saves substantial disk space and system memory.|$|E
5000|$|SpySheriff, {{also known}} as Brave Sentry, SpywareSheriff, Pest Trap, SpyTrooper, Spywareno, and MalwareAlarm, is malware that disguises itself as an {{anti-spyware}} program. SpySheriff attempts to mislead a user into buying the program by repeatedly informing them of false threats to their system. It {{is very difficult to}} remove SpySheriff from machines, since it nests its components in System Restore folders, and also blocks some system management tools. Similar to most fake antiviruses, SpySheriff asks the user to register when they click [...] "Remove found threats". However, SpySheriff can be removed if the user already has anti-malware tools on the machine, or owns a <b>rescue</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E

50|$|The first Linux-based 'Live CD' was Yggdrasil Linux first {{released}} in beta form 1992~1993 (ceased production in 1995), though in practice its functionality was hampered {{due to the}} low throughput of contemporary CD-ROM drives. DemoLinux, {{released in}} 1998, was the first Linux distribution specially designed as a live CD. The Linuxcare bootable business card, first released in 1999, was the first Live CD to focus on system administration, {{and the first to}} be distributed in the bootable business card form factor. , Finnix (first released in 2000) is the oldest Live CD still in production. Knoppix, a Debian-derived Linux distribution, was released in 2003, and found popularity as both a <b>rescue</b> <b>disk</b> system and as a primary distribution in its own right.|$|E

40|$|Super {{computers}} {{will be replaced}} more and more by PC cluster systems. Also, future LHC experiments will use large PC cluster. These clusters will consist of off-the-shelf PCs, which in general are not built to run in a PC farm. Conguring, monitoring, and controlling such clus-ters requires a serious amount of time consuming and ad-ministrative effort. We propose a cheap and easy hardware solution for this issue. The main item of our cluster control system is the Cluster Interface Agent card (CIA). The CIA card is a low-cost PCI expansion card equipped with a net-work interface. With {{the aid of the}} CIA card the computer can be fully controlled remotely, independent {{of the state of the}} node itself. The card combines a number of features needed for the remote control, including power manage-ment and reset. The card operates entirely independent of the PC and can remain powered while the PC may even be powered down. It offers a wide range of automatization features, including automatic installation of the operating system, changing BIOS settings or booting a <b>rescue</b> <b>disk</b> and as well as monitoring and debugging of the node. With the aid of PCI scans and hardware tests errors and pending failures can be easily detected in an early stage. Working prototypes of the card already exist. The paper will outline the status of the project and rst implementation results of the preproduction devices, currently being built...|$|E
