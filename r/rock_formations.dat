5|$|Juniata County lies over 16 {{different}} <b>rock</b> <b>formations,</b> some {{of which}} contain limestone. These <b>rock</b> <b>formations</b> come from the Ordovician Period, the Silurian Period, and the Devonian Period.

40|$|The {{seismic wave}} {{velocity}} in <b>rock</b> <b>formation</b> {{depends on the}} elastic modulus and mass density of rock where the wave travels. The velocity measurement of P and S waves on <b>rock</b> <b>formation</b> and the mass density in the laboratory {{can be used for}} calculating the elastic modulus of <b>rock</b> <b>formation.</b> The elastic modulus is part of rock mechanical parameter needed in geological engineering researches. The velocity measurement of P and S waves by the seismic refraction method was done on a tunnel with 11 spreads of measurement. From the results of the measurement, three groups of <b>rock</b> <b>formation</b> could be identified. The first is <b>rock</b> <b>formation</b> with Ed= 8. 890 - 12. 68 MPa and G= 3. 306 - 4. 830 MPa; the second group is <b>rock</b> <b>formation</b> with Ed= 8. 890 - 12. 68 MPa and G= 3. 306 - 4. 830 MPa; and the third group is with Ed= 18. 520 - 21. 120 MPa and G= 6. 724 - 7. 744 MP.

5|$|For the CGI {{compositions}} of the Vale of Arryn, {{as seen in}} the {{establishing shot}} of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek <b>rock</b> <b>formations</b> of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were being shot in Ireland, using Meteora was a better option.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Creek {{was used}} as a water supply as early as the {{beginning}} of the 1900s. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek since the 1920s, and it has been dammed by the Bryant Pond Dam. It is possible to canoe on part of the creek. <b>Rock</b> <b>formations</b> consisting of sandstone and shale occur in the watershed.|$|E

The county lies over 16 {{different}} <b>rock</b> <b>formations</b> (which are from the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian) and 51 different soils.|$|E
5|$|Superman pursues Luthor, who {{has made}} his way to the growing land mass. The kryptonite shell {{surrounding}} the crystal has caused the new <b>rock</b> <b>formations</b> to be infused with kryptonite, making the land itself toxic to Superman. Luthor's thugs beat Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall into the ocean, presumably to die.|$|E

5|$|Abrahams Creek is a {{perennial}} stream with relatively poor water quality. However, {{it is not}} considered to be impaired. Its pH ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and has a daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds (31 million kilograms) per day. The main <b>rock</b> <b>formations</b> in the watershed include the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation.

5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with <b>rock</b> <b>formations</b> and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Darby Creek {{flows through}} a narrow valley in its upper reaches and a tidal flat in its lower reaches. The creek is in the Piedmont Uplands and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Major <b>rock</b> <b>formations</b> in the {{watershed}} include the Wissahickon Formation. Three small dams historically existed on the creek, but were removed in 2012. The watershed of the creek is largely developed, with roughly {{half a million people}} inhabiting it. Most of the watershed is in Delaware County, but some parts are in Chester County, Philadelphia County, and Montgomery County. The watershed is part of the Lower Delaware drainage basin.|$|E
