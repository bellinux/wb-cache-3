40|$|This paper compares {{individual}} preferences for {{a market economy}} in Western and Eastern Europe over more than one decade, {{since the fall of}} Berlin Wall. The aim is to understand whether preferences in the two blocks have converged towards the current orientation of the EU's economic policy: a market economy, where the Government decides the rules, but does not enter the game directly. This is important as in a democratic system the approved guidelines need the support of the population to be fully effective and not reversed by a change of the government. In the EU the integration process is still going on, especially since the entrance of several Eastern countries. This paper shows that Eastern and Western Europeans have different preferences: the first would like a larger direct intervention of the public hand in the economy, while the second prefer a more private-oriented market than their Eastern peers. In addition for the citizens of ex-soviet countries, the concept of "competition" seems to represent more the new ideology that defeated the communism rather than a real market mechanism. Nevertheless some convergence emerges from data, especially during the last years, i. e. after the negative impact of transition over Eastern economies left the place to a beneficial <b>recovery.</b> <b>transition,</b> Eastern Europe, Western Europe, people's support, market economy...|$|E
40|$|Myosin II is a {{molecular}} motor that converts chemical to mechanical energy and enables muscle operations. After a power stroke, a <b>recovery</b> <b>transition</b> completes the cycle and returns the molecular motor to its prestroke state. Atomically detailed simulations {{in the framework}} of the Milestoning theory are used to calculate kinetics and mechanisms of the recovery stroke. Milestoning divides the process into transitions between hyper-surfaces (Milestones) along a reaction coordinate. Decorrelation of dynamics between sequential Milestones is assumed, which speeds up the atomically detailed simulations by a factor of millions. Two hundred trajectories of myosin with explicit water solvation are used to sample transitions between sequential pairs of Milestones. Collective motions of hundreds of atoms are described at atomic resolution and at the millisecond time scale. The experimentally measured transition time of about a millisecond is in good agreement with the computed time. The simulations support a sequential mechanism. In the first step the P-loop and switch 2 close on the ATP and in the second step the mechanical relaxation is induced via the relay and the SH 1 helices. We propose that the entropy of switch 2 helps to drive the power stroke. Secondary structure elements are progressing through a small number of discrete states in a network of activated transitions and are assisted by side chain flips between rotameric states. The few-state sequential mechanism is likely to enhance the efficiency of the relaxation reducing the probability of off-pathway intermediates...|$|E

30|$|Regarding the {{dynamics}} of information diffusion, the earliest and most frequently encountered approaches were inspired by epidemiological models [8, 9]. Some {{of the most recent}} ones are [1, 10 – 13], while more {{can be found in the}} references therein. More specifically, both stochastic and deterministic epidemic models exist for information propagation [7, 14], where the nodes having received the information are denoted as “infected”. Stochastic epidemic models treat information propagation as a discrete time process (Discrete Time Markov Chain) [7, 14] being more suitable for small-scale systems whereas deterministic epidemic models assume continuous processes relying on the law of large numbers and applying differential equations or inclusions [15, 16], thus being more suitable for large-scale systems. In this paper, we will apply a deterministic epidemic model. Most of deterministic models consider the evolution of the cumulative system state/number of infected individuals (macroscopic modeling), denoted as “population dynamics”, assuming homogeneous infection rates for all population members. On the other hand, the deterministic “network” models study the state of each individual separately and also segregate infection rates between different pairs of individuals [7]. However, system state transitions (i.e., population dynamics) depend on the state transition models developed for each individual, e.g., susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS), etc. [7, 8]. Contrary to deterministic network models, a typical assumption when considering population dynamics is that of homogeneous mixing, where contact patterns between individuals are considered highly homogeneous [17]. Both types of models, stochastic and deterministic, account for the endogenous (transition that takes place owe to internal individual operation, e.g., <b>recovery</b> <b>transition)</b> and exogenous (transitions dictated by external factors, e.g., infection transition) transition rates expressing the topological and operational, endogenous or exogenous, factors that affect the evolution of the system [7].|$|E
40|$|Although the {{austenitic}} stainless steels 304 and 321 are often treated nominally as equivalents in their hot rolling characteristics, the question remains whether any subtle {{differences between the two}} allow further optimisation of their respective hot rolling schedules. The hot workability of these two types of {{austenitic stainless}} steels was compared through single-hit Gleeble simulated thermomechanical processing between 800 ℃ and 00 ℃ while the strain rate was varied between 0. 00 s and 5 s. It was found that the constants for the hyperbolic sinh equation for hot working of AISI 321 steel are Q = 465 kJ/mol, =. 6 0, = 0. 00 and = 6. while for 304 steel the constants are Q = 446 kJ/mol, =. 4 0, = 0. 008 and = 6 [...] It is shown that the occurrence of dynamic recrystallisation starts when the Zener-Hollomon parameter 6. 4 0 s for both steels but that the differences in the values of Q and A 3 (the structure factor) between the two steels does lead to consistently lower steady state stresses for the steel 321 than is found in the steel 304 at the same Z values. This may, therefore, offer some scope for further optimisation of the hot rolling schedules and in particular in the mill loads of these two respective steels. A modelled constitutive equation derived from hot working tests to predict hot rolling mill loads is proposed and validated against industrial hot rolling data for AISI 321 stainless steel. Good correlation is found between the predicted Mean Flow Stress, the Zener-Hollomon Z parameter and actual industrial mill load values from mill logs if allowances are made for differences in Von Mises plane strain conversion, friction and front or back end tension. The multipass hot working behaviour of this steel was simulated through Gleeble thermomechanical compression testing with the deformation temperature varying between 1200 ℃ down to 800 ℃ and the strain rate between 0. 001 s- 1 and 5 s- 1. At strain rates greater than 0. 05 s- 1, dynamic recovery as a softening mechanism was dominant, increasing the dynamic recrystallisation to dynamic <b>recovery</b> <b>transition</b> temperature DRTT to higher temperatures. This implies that through extrapolation to typical industrial strain rates of about 60 s- 1,most likely no dynamic recrystallisation in plant hot rolling occurs in this steel but only dynamic recovery. Grain refinement by DRX is, therefore, unlikely in this steel under plant hot rolling conditions. Finally, mill load modelling using the hot working constitutive constants of the near-equivalent 304 instead of those specifically determined for 321, introduces measurable differences in the predicted mill loads. The use of alloy-specific hot working constants even for near-equivalent steels is, therefore, recommended.

Because of the size {{and complexity of the}} protein, a detailed understanding of the mechanochemistry that drives dynein's processive motion is lacking. To overcome this deficiency, we developed the first (to our knowledge) computational model for two-headed dynein that couples conformational changes of the motor's subunits to the biochemical steps involved in ATP hydrolysis. Analysis of the model provides what we believe are several novel insights into how the protein functions: 1), structural constraints limit the motion of the free microtubule binding domain to one dimension, increasing the efficiency with which this domain finds a binding site; 2), in addition to the power stroke of the bound head, recovery of the free head to a pre-power-stroke conformation is required for this head to reach a forward binding site; 3), the order in which the power stroke and <b>recovery</b> <b>transitions</b> occur affects the probability of back-stepping; and 4), the existence of multiple equilibria in the motor's bending energy provides a mechanism for processive back-stepping. To the best of our knowledge, our computational model provides the first complete mechanochemical description of the motor protein dynein, and the findings presented here should motivate new experimental investigations to test its predictions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} communication {{places in}} workflow nets, where the connected transitions lie in parallel threads. When a workflow Petri net is constructed structurally, {{by means of}} refinements, such places cannot be modeled structurally. They are added after the net is constructed. Workflow nets constructed in a structural manner are sound, but addition of such communication places can result in losing the desired soundness property. However, there is a method to avoid such misplacement of communication places. We should limit the pairs of connected transitions to the ones that lie in truly parallel threads and to avoid cycles introduced by communication places. <b>Recovery</b> <b>transitions</b> — special kind of transitions used as a powerful tool in dynamic workflow modeling — allow the manager to move tokens arbitrarily, when some unexpected situation happens. They were extensively studied and {{proved to be a}} useful tool in the workflow management [HA 00]. They can be modeled as a kind of reset transitions with additional feature of depositing tokens taken from a specified region to particular places in this region, like it was proposed in [Ch 06]. Moving tokens arbitrarily by the manager requires a lot of attention, since soundness of the net can easily be destroyed. In this paper we present a sufficient and necessary condition of soundness for a marking in a structured net with communication places. Verifying the condition turns out to be fast. The cost is linear with respect to the total number of places and transitions. ...|$|R

SURE is based on computational methods developed at the NASA Langley Research Center. These methods provide an e%cient means for computing reasonably accurate {{upper and lower bounds}} for the death state probabilities of a large class of semi-Markov models. Once a semi-Markov model is described using a simple input language, SURE automatically computes the upper and lower bounds on the probability of system failure. A parameter of the model can be specified as a variable over a range of values, thus directing SURE to perform a sensitivity analysis automatically. This feature, along with the speed of the program, makes it an especially useful design tool. SURE is a flexible, user-friendly reliability-analysis tool. The program provides a rapid computational capability for semi-Markov models useful for describing the fault-handling behavior of fault-tolerant computer systems. The only modeling restriction imposed by the program is that the non-exponential <b>recovery</b> <b>transitions</b> must be fast in comparison to the mission time- a desirable attribute of all fault-tolerant systems. The SURE reliability-analysis method uses a fast bounding theorem based on means and variances; the method yields upper and lower bounds on the probability of system failure. The upper and lower bounds are typieally within 5 percent of each other. Techniques have been developed to enable SURE to solve models with loops and calculate the operational-state probabilities. The computation is extremely fast, and large statespaces can be directly solved; a pruning technique enables SURE to process extremely large models. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} higher {{education}} systems in post-conflict states {{have the potential}} to contribute towards more effective post-war reconstruction and recovery. However, while the role of Higher Education in Development was emphasised in the post-WWII era, the specific experience of higher education in post-conflict contexts has escaped the attention of both academics and policy-makers engaged in reconstruction. Furthermore, donor policy attention has not been placed upon utilising the resources of higher education in post-war recovery. The overall aim is therefore to address this gap in the literature by providing global analysis of higher education in post-war recovery. Firstly, a theoretical framework of the relationship between higher education and recovery was constructed in terms of the functions that higher education can perform in contributing to recovery, the features of the post-war environment that hinder or enable higher education, and various policy options available to post-conflict higher education. Secondly, two case-studies of Iraq and Libya were examined to explore the relationship between higher education and post-war recovery. Principally through interviews with academics and policy-makers from case-study countries, the thesis reveals a range of perspectives and voices on higher education during post-conflict <b>recovery</b> and <b>transition.</b> The thesis concludes that higher education should be conceptualised as an important pillar of recovery; the capacity of domestic higher education sectors in post-conflict contexts is an often under-recognised and under-utilised resource of considerable potential value that can connect {{to a wide range of}} reconstruction and recovery processes and effectively drive post-conflict <b>recovery</b> and <b>transitions.</b> Given the under-theorised and under-studied nature of higher education and post-conflict recovery the thesis operates in a theory-building mode and offers what is to date the first attempt to construct a global theorisation...|$|R
