The South African church society {{is influenced by}} such developments taking place globally and which clearly influence how local churches function. This article explores {{the role of the}} contemporary church as a ‘reformation agency’ in enhancing a socially transformative agenda in South Africa. A qualitative research approach – an interpretative phenomenology design – was employed to negotiate a shared understanding through conversation and intersubjective meaning-making with church ministers, with the primary focus being their subjective experience of the changing role of the church in enhancing a transformative agenda in a South African context. A purposive sampling (n = 6) consisted of local church leaders who participated in the face-to-face and telephonic semi-structured interviews to achieve the purpose of the study. The findings clearly show that deliberate and intentional actions by churches allow them to become a voice for the marginalised, to create spaces for searching for excellence and to increase the quality of servant leadership, all as vehicles for transforming church society. Furthermore, servant leadership is a social phenomenon, a philosophy-in-practice aimed at leading by example to achieve a common goal. To accomplish this, church ministers are required to spearhead the challenge as a prerequisite to creating ‘lived experienced’ opportunities for members as an inward-outward spiritual journey. Finally, church leaders believed that transformation is a secular dimension, but that it can also be aligned towards God’s <b>redemption</b> <b>plan</b> and enhancing a socially just transformation agenda. Ultimately, this study proposed several recommendations to allow the local church to be relevant in practicing and promoting stronger unity and reconciliation amongst all churches nationally and globally...|$|E

The changing business environment in Texas {{and other parts of}} the Midwest has put strain on farm and ranch owners as well as the cooperatives that serve them. As margins diminish and customer base grows smaller, cooperatives must become more financially efficient to remain economically viable. This study was aimed at identifying those operational decisions and company characteristics that separate successful, growing cooperative agribusinesses from stagnant ones through empirical analysis. In addition, through the use of directed acyclic graphs and econometric techniques, the study sought to explain the connection of manager practices and perceptions to organizational performance. The analysis was based on a survey of managers in the state of Texas operating a diverse group of agricultural cooperatives. It did not include financial or utilities cooperatives. The results indicated that successful cooperatives were larger in size, had a smaller number of close competitors, and perceived loyalty to be a large issue for the cooperative. Strategic planning was utilized equally by successful and stagnant cooperatives. Successful cooperatives were more apt to have a formal equity <b>redemption</b> <b>plan,</b> but this did not appear to have a significant impact on financial performance. The directed graphs showed a strong impact of manager perceptions in the area of member loyalty and performance. Further econometric analysis brought us to the conclusion that performance group and perceptions have some measurable impact in the areas of competition and loyalty. This is evidenced by the coefficients of the slope and intercept shifters for performance group being different from zero. An understanding of the factors that have the greatest impact on performance, such as competition and loyalty, can assist cooperative management teams in making operational decisions to mitigate their greatest risks and weaknesses, leading to a stronger financial position...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} theological and practical discourses of missional leadership. Theologically, the research reinterprets various frames of the Bible's viewpoint {{of the cultural}} mandate. Namely, the research understands that the terms "biblical worldview," "biblical theology," and "redemptive history," refer to the Bible's explanation of the triune God's firm will, which is that by His missional leadership, He redeems all of the corrupted world. The triune God's missional leadership also devolved to humans, who {{were made in the}} image of God, as a part of His <b>redemption</b> <b>plan.</b> This dissertation also examines the practical discourse of missional leadership by first exploring contemporary theories behind the practice. The research compares and contrasts the attributes, features, and principles between missional leadership and contemporary general leadership. In contemporary general leadership, leaders tend to interact with members in a horizontal exchange. Missional leadership, however, deals with the vertical relationship between God and the leader, in addition to the horizontal exchange between the leader and members. This dissertation's main focus is the missional leadership of elder Hwang, a Korean American missionary who has been working in Cambodia for 17 years, as an example for practical discourse. Through the qualitative research of Hwang's biographical narrative, the study evaluates the ways Hwang used both the instruments of contemporary general leadership and the demanded features of missional leadership. The intention of the research is to explore the principles, features, and effectiveness of sustainable missional leadership in an intercultural, global society of the postmodern era. This dissertation shows that the triune God's missional leadership plants, nurtures, and uses His people to be leaders who work to restore all the corrupted creatures of this world. Missional leadership helps to fulfill us as the image of God, for both those who receive and deliver the gospel. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

This research addresses the issue of an investment constraint in user-owned agricultural organizations called the horizon problem. Scholars have suggested the restrictions on the transferability of residual claimant rights and the restricted liquidity through a secondary market results in a disincentive for user-owners to invest in growth opportunities. However, despite the conceptual and anecdotal arguments supporting the existence of and degree of investment constraints, the empirical evidence is scarce and inconclusive. This study attempts to fill part of this void in the literature by investigating the investment horizon constraint. This study divides the horizon problem literature into (1) the agent-control horizon problem and (2) the investment horizon problem, but focuses on the latter. The {{purpose of this study is}} to empirically test to what degree the investment horizon problem exists in user-owned agricultural organizations by analyzing several variants of the horizon problem in user-owned organizations: the wait-to-receive horizon problem, the hassle horizon problem, the current obligation horizon problem, the short-term residual horizon problem. This study also identifies the appreciated value horizon problem but space and time preclude its analysis in this study. In order to analyze to what degree the horizon problem exists in user-owned organizations, this study analyzes data generated by research case studies and member surveys conducted between January 2003 and May 2005. The multiple case studies helped inform the member survey design. Multivariate analysis of the data generated from the member surveys of four agricultural cooperatives inform to what degree the investment horizon problem exists in the selected cooperatives by evaluating the member's investment preferences for the cooperative equity <b>redemption</b> <b>plan</b> and the member's preferences for future cooperative investments. Multivariate data techniques including factor analysis, ordinal probit regression and cluster analysis test whether the member's characteristics have a significant impact on his investment preferences to support or reject the operational hypotheses. The obtained results suggest that more than one type of horizon problem exists in user-owned agricultural organizations. Each horizon problem is important in certain contexts and for different types of cooperatives. The results suggest the wait-to-receive horizon problem is more prevalent in cooperatives with passive investment where the investment is redeemed over longer revolving periods. As expected, the hassle horizon problem was more prevalent in organizations where the user and investor benefits are not separable. The results suggest the current obligation horizon problem weakly exists in cost of goods sold cooperatives that pay the minimum percent of allocated equities in cash in year generated. As expected the short-term residual horizon problem exists in organizations where the members cannot transfer their shares or cooperative investment. The results of this study have serious implications for cooperative organizational design as well as capital structure policies in user-owned agricultural organizations...|$|E
40|$|Okosnicu ovog članka tvori istraživanje osnovnih biblijskih pojmova za služenje (hebr. : 2 ̆ 7 abad, ’abodah, ’abdut, ’abuddah, ’ebed; grč. : douleúein, doulos, diakoneîn, diakonía, diákonos, latreúein, leitourgeîn), te misli i ideja koje izražavaju poimanje crkvenosti, budući da se termin 2 ̆ 7 crkvenost 2 ̆ 7 u Bibliji ne spominje. Rezultati članka mogu se sažeti u nekoliko točaka: 1. U tekstovima SZ služenje se ocjenjuje pozitivnim i dobrim, ili negativnim i lošim, ovisno o tome kome se služi. Služenje čovjeku u starozavjetnom književnom opusu općenito ima negativno značenje, iako postoje iznimke, jer vodi u ovisnost, odnosno u podređeni, ropski, položaj (usp. robovanje kumirima). Jedino Bogu treba služiti i njemu se klanjati. 2. Novost u spisima NZ, u odnosu na isti pojam u SZ, dolazi do izražaja i na nivou jezika (diakoneîn je tipično nzv. pojam). Riječ je o temeljnom kršćanskom držanju koje svoje ishodište ima u riječi i ponašanju Isusa Krista. Svaki način autentičnog kršćanskog služenja, pa onda i svaka služba: karitativne, navjestiteljske ili vodstvene prirode, u većini novozavjetnih knjiga, reflektira na temeljnom značenju ovog grčkog pojma. Iako se u NZ govori o služenju Bogu u smislu štovanja Boga, bogoslužje kršćanskih zajednica se ne doživljava u smislu kulta. U ovom vidu se rabe riječi iz grupa: latreueîn i leitourgeîn. Isus je, naime, inaugurirao novo svećeništvo i novo bogoslužje. Zajednica njegovih vjernika je živi hram, a svaki vjernik je svećenik koji umjesto žrtava životinja i stvari žrtvuje samog sebe. Tako se cijeli kršćanski način života može shvatiti kao »bogo-služje života«. 3. Autor izraz ’crkvenost’ ne nalazi u Bibliji. Zato se, kad govori o biblijskom poimanju crkvenosti službâ, služi inkluzivnim govorom. Dakle, govor o specifičnosti i djelovanju Crkve obuhvaća i pojam crkvenosti. Za prosudbu crkvenosti neke službe, prema novozavjetnim spisima, u članku se izdvaja sedam različitih kriterija koji su komplementarne naravi. U zajednici koja slijedi Isusa svi su istog položaja, Božja su obitelj, prijatelji vezani bratskom ljubavlju i nisu pod paskom patrijarhalnog oca, jer svi imaju jednog Oca koji je na nebesima. Iznimku predstavljaju zajednice tzv. »pastoralnih poslanica«. Nikakva borba za vlast ili položaj, pa niti samo obnašanje vlasti nikoga ne legitimira da se »drži višim od drugih«. Krug dvanaestorice je u prvom redu simbol Kristovog sveopćeg otkupiteljskog plana spasenja, a ne isključivo argumenat za hijerarhijsko ustrojstvo njegove zajednice. Kristov način služenja je model svake crkvene službe i u isto vrijeme alternativa vlasti i položaju. 4. U zaključnoj misli člankopisac izdvaja pojedine teze koje bi, prema njegovom mišljenju, mogle doprinijeti premišljanju aktualnog stanja služenja i crkvenosti služba u Crkvi danas. The care of {{this article}} is the {{research}} of the key biblical notions of tendering service (Hebrew: 2 ̆ 7 abad, 2 ̆ 7 abodah, 2 ̆ 7 abdut, 2 ̆ 7 abuddah, 2 ̆ 7 ebed; Greek: douleúein, doulos, diakoneîn, diakonía, diákonos, latreúein, leitourgeîn) and thoughts and ideas that express the notion of »ecclesiasticality«, since the term is not mentioned in the Bible. The results {{can be summed up in}} a few points: 1 -In the texts of the Old Testament tendering service is evaluated to be positive and good, or negative and bad, depending on whom the service is for. Tendering service to a human being in (he literary opus of the Old Testament has almost always a negative connotation (although there are some exceptions) because it leads towards dependence, in other words to a subordinate, slavish position. Tendering service to foreign, other gods, or idols is qualified very negatively. The people of Israel should only lender service to the right God and in such a way that they obey him, cherish and perform according to all his commands, laws and statutes, that they love him with all their hearts, their souls and their forces (cf. Deut 6, 1 - 5). 2 -A novelty in the texts of the New Testament, related to the same notions as in the Old Testament, is evident on the linguistic level, too. It is interesting that the Septuaginta, except in a Jew unimportant quotations, does not use the Greek verb diakoneo, by means of which tendering service is expressed in the texts of the New Testaments when the object of service is either a man; an individual, or a community. It is about the basic Christian attitude whose origins are in the word and behaviour of Jesus Christ. Some specific Christian services and duties within the community are expressed by the same group of words. Every form of authentic Christian service, and consequently every charitable, announcing, or leading service in the majority of the New Testament texts is reflected in the roots of this Greek notion. The Christian community, the Church, is in its basis a community of people who are ready to serve in the same way their Teacher and Lord served them. It is possible just only upon these grounds to make a conclusion that tendering service is rooted in every Christian community and that without it there is neither a union nor a community, in the same way, the texts of the New Testament treat the service to God in the sense of respecting God, so seving God in Christian communities does not have any connotation of a cult. In this case, words like latreúein and leitourgeîn are used. To be more specific at this point let me remind, Jesus has inaugurated a new clergy and a new liturgy. The community of his followers is a community of a living temple in which each follower/believer is a priest who, instead of offering an animal or a thing, offers himself in sacrifice. Thus, the entire Christian life-style can be understood as the »divine-service life-style«. 3 -The author does not find the term »ecclesiastically« in the Bible. Therefore, when speaking about biblical notion of »ecclesiastically of services«, the author uses inclusive speech. In other words, speaking about detailed description and activities of the Church, the notion of »ecclesiastically« should be included. The research of the New Testament environment in the last few years cast a new light upon some perceptions of early Christian communities. Using the theses of these studies in his paper the author has come to a conclusion that ecclesiastically means, in fact, living the ideals of the Kingdom of God hic et nunc, and that church/religious services are there to tender service to that ideal. In order to estimate the ecclesiasticality of a service, according to the scriptures of the New Testament, this paper points out seven different criteria of a complementary nature. In a community following Jesus Christ, all the members are of the same rank, they are God 2 ̆ 7 s family, friends tied up by fraternal love, and are not under surveillance of a patriarchal father, because they all have one Father who is in heaven. Communities of so called »pastoral letters« present exception. In God 2 ̆ 7 s family, Jesus gives a »privileged« position to those who suffer and those who are poor. Therefore, the evaluation criteria of ecclesiastically of a service, and the relationship towards those who suffer and those who are poor, is very important. It is, tendering service out of love and not according to an order or command, that matters. There is neighter fighting for political power or position, nor just only performing a position that gives anybody the right »to hold himself superior than others«. The circle of Twelve is primarily the symbol of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s universal <b>redemption</b> <b>plan</b> of salvation, not only an exclusive argument for a hierarchic organisation of his community. Christ 2 ̆ 7 s way of tendering service is a model for every ecclesiastic service, but in the same time, an alternative for political power and position. The ecclesiasticality criterium of a service is an uncompromising mediation for the realisation of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s programme, even at cost of self-stigmatisation, renunciation from power, possessions, family, etc. Finally, an ecclesiastical service is that much ecclesiastical as it is messianic and missionary, that much »christofanic«, in other words, it means how many acts of Christ, Our Lord does the world recognise in it. Put it otherwise, the biblical notion of ecclesiasticality of a service takes also into account prophetic-eshatologic dimension of tendering a service. 4 - In the conclusive ideas the author of the article points out some theses, which could, according to his point of view, lead to a better pondering of actual status of serving and ecclesiasticality of services in the Church today...|$|E

40|$|D. Phil. et Litt. The {{interaction}} between law and love in Pauline writing {{has been an}} interesting topic, where we have discovered that the law of God cannot be separated from his agape love, which has followed mankind from creation and eventually leads him to eternity. We discovered that the law of God reveals God's character and that is his love. The Law of God and His Love are one and cannot be separated from each other. God gives the law to prove to man that he loves him deeply and eternally. When Jesus Christ died on the cross of Calvary, He died because of the love for his created beings and the law that was broken {{and could not be}} altered or changed without the shedding of blood. The redemption of the sinner had to be made possible through the shedding of blood by the one who had not broken God's law. The love and death of Jesus can only be understood through the plan of salvation, which is the {{interaction between}} law and love as exposed in Pauline writings. This is a mystery of the wonderful love of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is wonderful to discover the way Paul blends the law and love {{in a way that it}} makes it hard to separate the two. If not carefully studied, one would not be able to see this fact in Pauline writings. The Law of God is actually the expression of His love to us. He would like. us to love Him by keeping the first four commandments and loving our fellow man by keeping the last six of the Ten Commandments. We need to have a positive outlook on the law, so that we may love to do God's will and honour Him because He loved us dearly and did not spare His own son for our <b>redemption.</b> The <b>plan</b> of <b>redemption</b> was born out of the eternal love of God towards humanity that could not be measured by anything on earth and in Heaven. In chapter one and two, we look at the overview of law and love in Pauline writings. The Pauline framework, its theology and the ethics of law and love. The whole plan of salvation for all humanity and how God loves all His creation. Although God had a chosen people through Abraham, He only wanted to make His love known throughout the world and all generations. God had always had His special people through whom He made His love and care known although they sometimes failed to is do His will.
