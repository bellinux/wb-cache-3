40|$|The {{evolution}} of genetic systems {{has been studied}} {{through the use of}} modifier gene models, in which a selectively neutral gene controls genetic transmission of other genes under selection. Analytical studies to obtain a general understanding of the dynamics have faced tradeoffs between different features for tractability.

Here techniques from Karlin (1982) are applied to a multilocus model of mutation with multivariate control over mutation rates, and the <b>reduction</b> <b>principle</b> is found to operate. Constraining assumptions are that mutation distributions follow the transition probabilities of reversible Markov chains, and that all loci are tightly linked.

40|$|Abstract Background Harm {{reduction}} {{refers to}} interventions {{aimed at reducing}} {{the negative effects of}} health behaviors without necessarily extinguishing the problematic health behaviors completely. The vast majority of the harm reduction literature focuses on the harms of drug use and on specific harm reduction strategies, such as syringe exchange, rather than on the harm reduction philosophy as a whole. Given that a harm reduction approach can address other risk behaviors that often occur alongside drug use and that harm <b>reduction</b> <b>principles</b> have been applied to harms such as sex work, eating disorders, and tobacco use, a natural evolution of the harm reduction philosophy is to extend it to other health risk behaviors and to a broader healthcare audience. Methods Building on the extant literature, we used data from in-depth qualitative interviews with 23 patients and 17 staff members from an HIV clinic in the USA to describe harm <b>reduction</b> <b>principles</b> for use in healthcare settings. Results We defined six principles of harm reduction and generalized them for use in healthcare settings with patients beyond those who use illicit substances. The principles include humanism, pragmatism, individualism, autonomy, incrementalism, and accountability without termination. For each of these principles, we present a definition, a description of how healthcare providers can deliver interventions informed by the principle, and examples of how each principle may be applied in the healthcare setting. Conclusion This paper is one of the firsts to provide a comprehensive set of principles for universal harm reduction as a conceptual approach for healthcare provision. Applying harm <b>reduction</b> <b>principles</b> in healthcare settings may improve clinical care outcomes given that the quality of the provider-patient relationship is known to impact health outcomes and treatment adherence. Harm reduction can be a universal precaution applied to all individuals regardless of their disclosure of negative health behaviors, given that health behaviors are not binary or linear but operate along a continuum based on a variety of individual and social determinants...|$|E

40|$|Smolin (1992) {{proposed}} that the fine-tuning problem for parameters of the Standard Model might {{be accounted for by}} a Darwinian process of universe reproduction - Cosmological Natural Selection (CNS) - in which black holes give rise to offspring universes with slightly altered parameters. The laws for variation and inheritance of the parameters are also subject to CNS if variation in transmission laws occurs. This is the strategy introduced by Nei (1967) to understand genetic transmission, through the evolutionary theory of modifier genes, whose methodology is adopted here. When mechanisms of variation themselves vary, they are subject to Feldman's (1972) evolutionary <b>Reduction</b> <b>Principle</b> that selection favors greater faithfulness of replication. A theorem of Karlin (1982) allows one to generalize this principle beyond biological genetics to the unknown inheritance laws that would operate in CNS. The <b>reduction</b> <b>principle</b> for CNS is illustrated with a general multitype branching process model of universe creation containing competing inheritance laws. The most faithful inheritance law dominates the ensemble of universes. The <b>Reduction</b> <b>Principle</b> thus provides a mechanism to account for high fidelity of inheritance between universes. Moreover, it reveals that natural selection in the presence of variation in inheritance mechanisms has two distinct objects: maximization of both fitness and faithful inheritance. Tradeoffs between fitness and faithfulness open the possibility that evolved fundamental parameters are compromises, and not local optima to maximize universe production, in which case their local non-optimality may point to their involvement in the universe inheritance mechanisms.
