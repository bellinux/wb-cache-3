40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} clinicians' based <b>risk</b> <b>thresholds</b> at which febrile {{children would be}} managed as serious bacterial infections (SBI) to determine influencing characteristics and to compare thresholds with prediction model (Feverkidstool) risk estimates. Twenty-one video vignettes of febrile children visiting the emergency department (ED) were assessed by 42 (40. 4  %) international paediatricians/paediatric emergency clinicians. Questions were related to clinical risk scores of the child having SBI and SBI management decisions on visual analogue scales. Feverkidstool risk scores were based on clinical signs/symptoms and C-reactive protein. Amongst vignettes assigned to SBI management, the median risk was 60  % (interquartile range (IQR) 30. 0 - 80. 5) and 16. 0  % (IQR 5. 0 - 32. 0) when vignettes were not managed as SBI. Ill appearance and aberrant circulatory signs were the most influencing factors, as age and duration of fever were the least influencing factors on SBI management decisions. Feverkidstool risk scores varied from 13  % (IQR 7. 7 - 28. 1) for SBI management to 7. 3  % (IQR 5. 7 - 16. 3) for no SBI management. CONCLUSION: Clinicians assigned high risk scores to children who they would have managed as SBI, mostly influenced by ill appearance and aberrant circulation. In contrast to SBI risk assessment of the Feverkidstool, clinicians' appeared to apply a more stepwise assessment {{of the risk of}} presence/absence of SBI at different steps in the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Uniform <b>risk</b> <b>thresholds</b> at which one should start SBI management in febrile children remains unclear; <b>risk</b> <b>thresholds</b> at which we refrained from SBI management were more consistent. What is Known: •Only a small proportion of febrile children presenting to the emergency department will have serious bacterial infections (SBI) and uniform <b>risk</b> <b>thresholds</b> to start or withhold SBI treatment are not known. •The low prevalence of SBI and consequently the low exposure of clinicians to these infections make them rely more on alarming signs or clinical decision rules.

Further, concepts from minimal risk in research might assist clinicians regarding when information provision in health promotion is required. We begin by reviewing concepts in both minimal risk in research and informed choice in clinical practice. We then explore how a clinical minimal risk concept may clarify recommendations for information provision in clinical practice and support the patient’s informed choice regarding therapeutic and diagnostic procedures and also health promotion.

Airborne pollen in Guadalajara (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) was studied over a 6 -year period (2008 – 2013) using a Hirst-type volumetric spore trap. The highest pollen concentrations were recorded from February to June, coinciding with the pollen season of the pollen types that most contribute to the local airborne pollen spectrum: Cupressaceae 32. 2 %), Quercus (15. 1 %), Platanus (13. 2 %), Olea (8. 3 %), Populus (7. 8 %) and Poaceae (7. 2 %).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesFebrile {{neutropenia}} (FN) {{in patients}} with cancer treated with chemotherapy has traditionally been managed with inpatient broad-spectrum antibiotics until the infection and neutropenia have resolved. A newer strategy is outpatient oral or intravenous antibiotics in selected patients after an initial hospitalization. We sought to determine these costs, both overall and relative to those of traditional management, and the optimal role of prophylactic colony-stimulating factor (CSF) in patients at greatest risk for FN. MethodsExisting economic decision models were modified by incorporating a treatment strategy for FN in which patients are classified as high- and low-risk according to criteria described by Talcott. Low-risk patients were assumed {{to be treated as}} outpatients. Overall costs with the revised economic model were assessed and sensitivity analyses were performed. ResultsThe costs of an episode of FN were estimated as 1) no CSF: $ 13, 355; 2) CSF with hospitalization for FN: $ 8677; and 3) CSF with risk stratification and outpatient management in low-risk patients: $ 8188. The <b>risk</b> <b>threshold</b> for the cost-effective use of CSF was only slightly lower with outpatient treatment. When all patients with FN are treated as inpatients and the cost of hospitalization is $ 1750 /day the <b>risk</b> <b>threshold</b> for FN at which prophylactic CSF becomes cost-effective is 16 %. It is 15 % when low-risk patients are treated as outpatients. ConclusionsOutpatient treatment slightly decreases the <b>risk</b> <b>threshold</b> for FN at which prophylactic CSF becomes cost-effective. The limited economic effect of this strategy may be because the patients who were at greatest risk of complications had significantly longer lengths of stay and accounted for most of the hospitalization costs...|$|E

40|$|Primary medical {{prevention}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} (CVD) has received low priority in Tanzania, despite evidence of the rising prevalence of CVD risk factors. Different guidelines have been proposed for medical CVD prevention, including the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommend medical prevention for all individuals based on the consideration of single CVD risk thresholds. A third alternative is differentiated risk thresholds according to age. This paper compares the WHO and the differentiated <b>risk</b> <b>threshold</b> by age approaches against a baseline of no medical CVD prevention and a best scenario identical to the ESC approach in Tanzania. Assuming fixed budgets, we evaluate the guidelines according to three outcome measures, namely: efficiency, inequality and the combination of efficiency and inequality. We ran a Markov analysis for an estimated Tanzanian population at risk of CVD employing a 40 years time horizon to estimate the total expected costs and CVD deaths associated with provision of the different guidelines. The results were then used to calculate three outcomes: life expectancy at age 40 {{as a proxy for}} efficiency, the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality), and the achievement index (which combines concerns of efficiency and inequality). Our results suggest that higher life expectancy (28. 3 vs. 26. 6 years) and more equally distributed health (Gini coefficient of 0. 22 vs. 0. 24) could be attained if medical CVD prevention was based on the differentiated <b>risk</b> <b>threshold</b> approach compared to the WHO single <b>risk</b> <b>threshold,</b> when the total cost of these approaches is the same. Preventing CVD based on differentiating risk thresholds by age seems to be the better alternative when concerns of both efficiency and inequality are considered important.

They included 3757 and 2226 participants, respectively, and during median 13. 0 and 17. 3 years follow-up the primary CVD event rates were 16. 6 and 5. 3 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. In Cox models adjusted for basic classical risk factors, 1 SD increases in log-transformed NT-proBNP, high-sensitivity troponin T, and midregional pro adrenomedullin were generally associated with increased primary CVD risk in both the studies (P&# 60; 0. 006) except midregional pro adrenomedullin in MFS (P= 0. 10). In BRHS, QRISK 2 risk factors yielded a C-index of 0. 657, which was improved by 0. 017 (P= 0. 005) by NT-proBNP, but not by other biomarkers. Using 28 % 14 -year risk as a proxy for 20 % 10 -year risk, NT-proBNP improved risk classification for primary CVD cases (case net reclassification index, 5. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 8 %– 9. 2 %), but only improved classification of noncases at a 14 % 14 -year <b>risk</b> <b>threshold</b> (4. 6 %; 2. 9 %– 6. 3 %).
