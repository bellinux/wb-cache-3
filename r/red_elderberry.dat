5000|$|Sambucus racemosa subsp. racemosa is a {{subspecies}} of Sambucus racemosa, {{with the}} common names European red elder and Pacific <b>red</b> <b>elderberry.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} later {{superseded}} by larger forest trees. In Central Europe it often grows {{in association with}} <b>red</b> <b>elderberry,</b> goat willow, Eurasian aspen, and silver birch. The plant is highly flammable and tends not to accumulate plant litter.|$|E
50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} {{also has}} park and recreation facilities, Lynnwood Park and the Lynnwood Athletic Field. Another popular recreational {{area is a}} ravine that extends from Lynnwood Elementary School to the 149 Street / Whitemud Drive interchange. It is particularly popular among dog owners who will walk their dogs {{along the length of}} it. It is lined on both sides with trees and bushes of various species including evergreens, pin cherries, choke cherries, saskatoon berry trees, mountain ashes (Rowan), <b>red</b> <b>elderberries,</b> currants, gooseberries, raspberries and wild roses. It is home to the American Red Squirrel and numerous bird species.|$|R
25|$|Favorite fruits dried {{for winter}} were serviceberries or ″kel″ (Amelanchier alnifolia or Saskatoon berry), black huckleberries or ″cemi'tk″ (Vaccinium membranaceum), <b>red</b> <b>elderberries</b> or ″mi'ttip″ (Sambucus racemosa var. melanocarpa), and chokecherries or ″ti'ms″ (Prunus virginiana var. melanocarpa). Nez Perce {{textiles}} were made primarily from dogbane or ″qeemu″ (Apocynum cannabinum or Indian hemp), tules or ″to'ko″ (Schoenoplectus acutus var. acutus), and western redcedar or ″tala'tat″ (Thuja plicata). The most important industrial woods were redcedar, ponderosa pine or ″la'qa″ (Pinus ponderosa), Douglas fir or ″pa'ps″ (Pseudotsuga menziesii), sandbar willow or ″tax's″ (Salix exigua), and hard woods such as Pacific yew or ″ta'mqay″ (Taxus brevifolia) and syringa or ″sise'qiy″ (Philadelphus lewisii or Indian arrowwood).|$|R

50|$|Despite of {{transformation}} of the basic tree vegetation, the same form of undergrowth survived. There occurs: daphne mezereum, <b>red</b> <b>elderberry,</b> hazel, platanthera bifolia, sweet woodruff, herb paris, cranberry, wood sorrel, chickweed wintergreen, Common Cow-wheat and lily of the valley. The parts over 800 m are mainly covered with grasses, purple small-reeds, cranberries, and willow gentian.|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} of Beaver Run are a {{highbush blueberry}} / meadowsweet shrub swamp which includes {{trees and shrubs}} such as <b>red</b> <b>elderberry,</b> black ash, poison sumac, speckled alder, buttonbush, steeple-bush, and mountain holly. Other plants inhabiting these wetlands include various ferns and sedges and skunk cabbage, cattails, yellow pond lilies, smooth goldenrod, swamp candles, woolgrass, and several other plants.|$|E
50|$|Black Mountain {{is one of}} the few {{sites in}} Kentucky {{supporting}} a Northern Hardwood Forest at higher elevations. Numerous rare plants and animals are found here, including Black Bear, <b>Red</b> <b>Elderberry</b> and Hobblebush. Like many areas of Northern Hardwood Forest in the Southern Appalachia, fires swept through the mountain after intense logging. Black Mountain has a documented fire that occurred in the fall of 1896.|$|E
50|$|Valley {{elderberry}} longhorn beetles in California {{are very}} often found around <b>red</b> or blue <b>elderberry</b> bushes. Females {{lay their eggs}} on the bark. Larvae hatch and burrow into the stems.|$|R
50|$|While many berries are edible, {{some are}} {{poisonous}} to humans, such as deadly nightshade and pokeweed. Others, {{such as the}} white mulberry, <b>red</b> mulberry, and <b>elderberry,</b> are poisonous when unripe, but are edible when ripe.|$|R
500|$|The creek {{begins in}} the Coast Range {{ecoregion}} designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and flows thereafter through the Willamette Valley ecoregion. The narrow riparian corridors along streams in the watershed commonly include native species such as western redcedar, Douglas fir, vine maple, and sword fern as well as invasive species like English ivy. Many red alder and big leaf maple grow in the watershed, and shrubs include <b>red</b> huckleberry, Oregon-grape, <b>elderberry,</b> wood rose, and salmonberry. A restoration project in Tigard along the main stem has removed invasive plants such as reed canary grass and Himalayan blackberry {{and replaced them with}} native species. A project in Beaverton is replacing turf and degraded habitat along the creek with native shrubs and trees such as Oregon white oak.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation in {{the area}} is divided into several sections. Near the Lake Mendota Drive {{entrance}} there is a heavy population of red pine, spruce, white pine, red cedar and catalpa trees. Species in the southern portion of the point include silver maple, hackberry, green ash, box elder, and cottonwood trees. Several hardwood trees round out holes in the forest, including sugar maple, hackberry, basswood, and black cherry, along with <b>red</b> <b>elderberry</b> shrubs. The area has issues with invasive non-native vegetation, such as buckthorn, honeysuckle, and Norway maples.|$|E
50|$|The {{entirety}} of the Eagle Creek watershed {{is in the}} coastal western hemlock biogeoclimatic zone of British Columbia. The protected lands of Burnaby Mountain, {{as well as the}} lands of Burnaby Lake Regional Park are forested with a second growth forest that primarily consists of bigleaf maple, red alder, western hemlock, western redcedar, and Douglas-fir, with an underbrush of salmonberry, Indian plum, <b>red</b> <b>elderberry,</b> and other shrubs and herbs. Mammals found here include the Douglas squirrel, black-tailed deer, coyote, and raccoon. Many birds and amphibians also inhabit the watershed.|$|E
50|$|Red {{spruce and}} Fraser fir are {{dominant}} canopy trees in high mountain areas. In higher elevation (over 1980 m), Fraser fir is dominant, in middle elevation (1675 to 1890 m) red spruce and Fraser fir grow together, and in lower elevation (1370 to 1650 m) red spruce is dominant. Yellow birch, mountain ash, and mountain maple {{grow in the}} understory. Younger spruce and fir and shrubs like raspberry, blackberry, hobblebush, southern mountain cranberries, <b>red</b> <b>elderberry,</b> minniebush, southern bush honeysuckle are understory vegetation. Below the spruce-fir forest, at around 1200 m, are forests of American beech, yellow birch, maple, birch, and oak. Skunk cabbage and ground juniper are northern species that remained in this region after the glacier retreated.|$|E
50|$|Red {{spruce and}} Fraser fir are {{dominant}} canopy trees in high mountain areas. In higher elevation (over 1,980 metres (6,500 ft)), Fraser fir is dominant, in middle elevation (1,675 to 1,890 metres (5,495 to 6,201 ft)) red spruce and Fraser fir grow together, and in lower elevation (1,370 to 1,650 metres (4,490 to 5,410 ft)) red spruce is dominant.

40|$|In 1998, forest {{vegetation}} was monitored for ozone injury on permanent plots in two Sierra Nevada national forests in California, at three locations in Mount Rainier National Park in Washington, and at 68 forest health monitoring (FHM) locations throughout Washington, Oregon, and California. This {{was the first}} year that extensive monitoring of {{forest vegetation}} for ozone injury {{was carried out in}} Oregon, and Washington. Injury was detected on ponderosa and Jeffrey pine in the Sierra Nevada permanent plots and on <b>red</b> <b>elderberry</b> at one FHM location in southwest Washington. No injury was detected at the Mount Rainier sites. The authors also report on results of a trial where red alder, huckleberry, blue elderberry, and chokecherry were exposed to ozone under controlled conditions...|$|E
30|$|The {{number and}} canopy cover of hazel shrubs were {{evaluated}} separately for hazels lower than 4  m and taller than 4  m. The cover of selected {{plants in the}} ground vegetation layer was visually estimated at randomly located 10 [*]×[*] 10 -m squares in each transect. During the evaluation process, the following canopy-forming tree species were recorded: Norway spruce, silver and downy birches B. pendula and B. pubescens, grey and black alders, pedunculate oak, ash, aspen, willow Salix spp. (mostly Salix caprea, but also Salix cinerea and Salix myrsinifolia), small-leaved lime, Scotch pine Pinus sylvestris, Wych and field elms Ulmus glabra and Ulmus minor, Norway maple Acer platanoides, wild apple Malus sylvestris, common buckthorn Rhamnus cathartica, and common hornbeam Carpinus betulus. Understory species recorded were hazel, glossy buckthorn, bird cherry, rowan, dwarf honeysuckle, European spindle Euonymus europaeus, blackcurrant Ribes nigrum, <b>red</b> <b>elderberry</b> Sambucus racemosa, and mezereon Daphne mezereum.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The Roosevelt elk (Cervus elephus roosevelti) is a National Forest {{management}} {{indicator species}} on the westside of the Cascade mountains, Western Oregon. A Habitat Effectiveness model is used by State and Federal agencies to evaluate elk habitat in the region. Concerns about the model's lack of differentiation between winter and summer ranges in the analyses and assumptions that burning will increase forage quality on winter range prompted this study. I investigated the effect of broadcast burning, plant association, and time since disturbance {{on the quality of}} trailing blackberry (Rubus ulna), red huckleberry (Vaccinium parviflorum), willow (Salix spp.), vine maple (Acer circinatum), salal (Gaultheria shallon), and <b>red</b> <b>elderberry</b> (Sambucus racemosa). Crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid insoluble ash, lignin, astringency, condensed tannin, and hydrolyzable tannin contents were measured. No significant effects of burning, plant association, or age were observed for crude protein, hydrolyzable tannins, or neutral detergent fiber. Crude protein varied among taxa: trailing blackberry contained 9. 65...|$|E
