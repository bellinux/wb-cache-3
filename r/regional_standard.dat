25|$|The {{language}} situation today {{consists of}} a complex relationship between several diglossia, since there is a functional distribution within Romansh itself between the local dialect, the <b>regional</b> <b>standard</b> variety, and nowadays the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun as well; and German is also acquired in two varieties: Swiss German and Standard German. Additionally, in Val Müstair many people also speak Bavarian German as a second language. Aside from German, many Romansh also speak additional languages such as French, Italian, or English, learned at school or acquired through direct contact.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{of a new}} {{terminal}} and upgrading the airport to <b>regional</b> <b>standard</b> started in 1984. In February 1987 Vardø Municipality received operating permission from the government. The investments cost NOK11.4 million, of which NOK10 million was to be financed through a loan and the rest through subsidies {{from the government and}} the county. The latter was also responsible for covering the operating deficit. The upgraded airport opened on 6 April 1987. The first two months Norving continued its taxi route service to the airport, but from 1 June a regular concession scheduled service was introduced. Widerøe took over the services in 1991. At first the airport was served using Twin Otters, but from the mid-1990s the Dash 8 was introduced. From 1996, Svartnes and 25 other regional airports were taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). Widerøe lost the bid to operate the services between 2000 and 2003 to Arctic Air, but resumed services in 2003. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. There has several times been discuss whether to close down the airport, having in mind that Vadsø Airport is 67km away by road. In 2002 there was political support in Stortinget to close it if the road was upgraded, but neither happened. In 2015 Avinor stated that closing Vardø would give least passenger trouble related to the financial support in the country, but that no decision on it would be made before 2019. Because of lack of available aircraft for purchase, before 2030 all short airports must be extended, closed or be flown with very small planes. Vardø has no room for extension.|$|E
