5|$|On May 1, 1899, Captain Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich assumed {{command of}} Rostislav, {{becoming}} the first Romanov since Peter I to command a combat ship. Another Romanov, Grand Duke Kirill, spent a few uneventful months on board Rostislav in 1900. Alexander's guests, parties and diplomatic visits to Istanbul regularly interfered with the crew's duties, but he personally managed the repairs and alterations of the ship's equipment. Shipyards and contractors treated Rostislav as a priority customer. Alexander, based on his experience with Sissoi Veliky, persuaded the NTC to reinforce Rostislavs <b>rudder</b> <b>frame</b> and supervised installation of a backup control post deep under the conning tower. In 1903 Alexander was promoted to rear admiral {{and returned to his}} ship as a squadron commander. Rostislav served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of the construction was flawed from the start: the stem and sternposts, <b>rudder</b> <b>frame,</b> and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time, and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress. Verkhovsky, having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers, contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already loaded down with other Navy jobs. The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament {{that the government was}} willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop. The savvy admiral always blamed the suppliers but did not even attempt to fix the disarray in his own office.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rudder</b> <b>frame,</b> {{including}} the 125-ton cast steel connecting rod, {{was produced by}} Å koda Works in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5000|$|The new J-2 had rounded-off wing tips, a {{similarly}} [...] "rounded" [...] fin and <b>rudder</b> <b>framed</b> up and fabric-covered {{separately from the}} fuselage structure, enclosed cabin and wider Goodyear [...] "airwheel" [...] tires, a special low-pressure variety of aircraft landing gear tire pioneered by Alvin Musselmann [...] in 1929 that resembled a later tundra tire in general appearance and proportions. Powered by a 37 hp Continental A-40-3 piston engine the aircraft appeared in October 1935 and the type certificate was issued on 14 February 1936. From September 1936 the engine was changed to a 40 hp Continental A-40-4. One sub-type was produced, the J-2S which was a float-equipped version.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} blocks, called {{chips for}} their square shape, are chip, <b>frame,</b> <b>rudder,</b> rudderf, trim, trimf, wheel, reaction less wheel (RLW), jet, arm, and cowl. All chips have an angle, a color, and an option.|$|R
50|$|The ANBO 51 was {{a fabric}} covered {{aircraft}} with a welded steel tube fuselage structure and steel <b>framed</b> <b>rudder</b> and elevators. The parasol wings {{were attached to}} the lower fuselage with pairs of struts on each side, assisted by further centre section struts. The wings and fixed tail surfaces were wooden structures.|$|R

2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was a pine framed, plywood covered hexagonal box, {{with the}} straight edged fin an integral part. The rudder was rounded and horn balanced. [...] Though the <b>rudder</b> was wood <b>framed</b> and covered, the tailplane, mounted {{just above the}} fuselage and externally braced from below, had a tube steel structure and was fabric covered. The elevators were balanced by an elastic rope to the control column.|$|R
