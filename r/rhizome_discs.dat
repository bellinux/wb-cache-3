40|$|Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. is an {{endangered}} medicinal plant with anticancer properties. The rhizome and tuberous {{roots of the}} plant have been used extensively in India in indigenous medicine. Due to its multiple uses, the demand for Curculigo orchioides is constantly on the rise; however, the supply is rather erratic and inadequate. Destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction {{in the form of}} deforestation has aggravated the problem. The plant is now considered ‘endangered’ in its natural habitat. Therefore, the need for conservation of this plant is crucial. Here, we describe a successful protocol for multiple shoot induction of C. orchioides using shoot tip and rhizome disc. We find that proximal <b>rhizome</b> <b>discs</b> are optimal for high frequency shoot bud formation than shoot tip and distal rhizome disc. We observed a synergistic effect between 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) and kinetin (KN) (each at 1 mg/L) on the regeneration of shoot buds from proximal rhizome disc than shoot tip explant. Optimum root induction was achieved on half-strength MS liquid medium supplemented with 1 mg/L of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA). The in vitro raised plantlets were acclimatized in green house and successfully transplanted to natural condition with 90...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims:Aloe vera {{has been}} used medicinally for several {{thousands}} of years in many cultures from Egypt, Greece, and Rome to China, India, and etc. Although Aloe barbadensis propagates vegetative manner in its natural state, but propagation is too slow for commercial plant production. To overcome slow propagation rate, micropropagation {{will be a very}} useful technique for mass multiplication of Aloe vera. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate and establish an effective method for aseptic micropropagation of Aloe vera. Methods: This researchwas an experimental study that was conducted in tissue culture lab, Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, BHU, Varanasi, India to develop a protocol for surface sterilization of Aloe vera explants. 42 treatments carried out for the shoot tip, apical meristem and <b>rhizome</b> <b>discs</b> of Aloe explant. Results: Using of Tween 20 (5 drops) for 10 mints, Bavistin 1 for 10 mints and NaOCl (1. 0) for 6 minutes followed by rinsing sterilized distilled water showed the higher survival explants (70) and asepsis was 81 and just 11 percent of the explants contaminated after 2 weeks. But the highest survived explants was for Tween 20 (5 drops) 10 minutes, Bavistin 1; 10 minutes and Ca(ClO) 2 (3. 25. 0) 6 minutes (77 survival) and asepsis was 81 and only 11 of the explants contaminated after 2 weeks. Conclusion: In the present study, calcium hypochlorite with the highest asepsis, survival of explant and normally growth were more suitable than sodium hypochlorite for surface sterilization of Aloe vera...|$|E
