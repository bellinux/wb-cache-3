5000|$|After the French {{declared}} war on Britain, the Amsterdam merchants also became heavily involved in the trade in naval stores with France. The French needed those supplies for their naval construction, but were prevented from obtaining those themselves, due to the blockade of the Royal Navy (France being the weaker naval power in the conflict). The Dutch were privileged by a concession obtained after their victory in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, known as the principle of [...] "free ship, free goods" [...] which was enshrined in the Anglo-Dutch Commercial Treaty of 1668 (reconfirmed in the Treaty of Westminster (1674)). This early formulation {{of the principle of}} Freedom of Navigation exempted all but narrowly defined [...] "contraband" [...] goods, carried in Dutch ships, from confiscation by the British prize courts, in wars in which the Dutch remained neutral. According to the treaty naval stores (including ship's timbers, masts, spars, canvas, tar, rope, and pitch) were not contraband and the Dutch therefore were free to continue their trade with France in these goods. Because of the still-important role of the Dutch in the European carrying trade this opened up a large loophole in the British embargo. The British therefore unilaterally declared naval stores to be contraband and enforced their embargo by arresting Dutch (and other neutral) ships on the high seas. This led to strong protests by the affected Dutch merchants, who demanded institution of convoys escorted by the Dutch navy, to protect them against the Royal Navy and British privateers. According to customary international law, such convoys were (and still are) exempt from the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Visit</b> and Search by belligerents. Initially the stadtholder managed to prevent this, but strong diplomatic pressure by France, that selectively applied economic sanctions to Dutch cities supporting the stadtholder in this policy, forced his hand in November 1779. The States General now ordered him to provide the escorts and the first convoy, under command of rear-admiral Lodewijk van Bylandt, sailed in December 1779. This led to the humiliating Affair of Fielding and Bylandt on 31 December 1779, which enraged Dutch public opinion and further undermined the position of the stadtholder. The incident motivated the Dutch to seek adherence to the First League of Armed Neutrality, which espoused the principle of [...] "free ship, free goods," [...] especially after Britain formally abrogated the Commercial Treaty of 1668. The Dutch hoped to gain the armed support of {{the other members of the}} League to maintain their neutral status.|$|E

It includes a comparison between that analysis and the analysis of the just-released (September 27, 2010) Report of the international fact-finding mission to investigate violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, resulting from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance. This three-member mission was chaired by Judge Karl T. Hudson-Phillips, Q. C., retired Judge of the International Criminal Court and former Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago. Its mission was established by the UN Human Rights Council in resolution 14 / 1 of 2 June 2010. Suggestions are made about questions of law to which two remaining panels or commissions of inquiry may wish to give special attention. One such {{question is whether or not}} a belligerent <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visit</b> of vessels for purposes of arms interdiction requires a naval blockade first to be in place. A second question meriting further attention is how to think about the interaction of personal rights of self-defence of both the passengers aboard the ships and the soldiers ordered to seize the ships, in terms of the analysis of the necessity and proportionality of specific actions taken by Israeli soldiers. A third question is whether, without addressing the matter in any detail, the Hudson-Phillips report unhelpfully blurred the jus in bello <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visit</b> within the laws of war and the jus ad bellum right of states to self-defence. The first of these two other commissions is the four-member Panel of Inquiry established by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, with the support of the UN Security Council, that panel is chaired by the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Geoffrey Palmer, and vice-chaired by the former President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, and also includes panel members from Israel and Turkey.

Counter-terrorism measures implemented on the high seas to prevent maritime terrorist attacks from occurring are possible but limited by the International law and notably the law of the sea. To some extent, the law of the sea limits counter-terrorism efforts. On the high seas, enforcement measures against terrorists or terrorist-related activities on board foreign vessels are restricted by the principle of exclusivity of flag State jurisdiction (a). Nevertheless, the application of the principle can be derogated from by the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visit</b> which provides for, under certain conditions, some leeway to States in their fight against maritime terrorism (b). it is difficult to justify interdiction operations carried out in order to counter terrorist threats on the high seas by the right of self-defence.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into four parts. Part I {{consists}} of a general introduction and will start with a brief sketch of the context of naval operations to better understand operational environment in which maritime interception operations are used (Chapter 2), and will also address contemporary maritime interception operations {{by means of a}} short history of the evolution of the term MIO in four strands (Chapter 3). This chapter will also introduce significant naval operations and incidents that occurred in which MIO has formed a part of the operation. Chapter 4 will consider the two fundamental ground-rules of the international law of the sea as a legal point of departure and which are central to considering the law applicable to maritime interception operations. Part II consists of four chapters and will study the different legal basis for maritime interception operations. The legal bases for MIO {{can be found in a}} combination of the generally accepted exceptions on the use of armed force and in the notion of general international law where States can allow other States to conduct activities within their own area of jurisdiction, either by ad hoc consent or consent through treaties. Therefore legal bases for maritime interception operations will be analysed: the collective security system, self-defence, (ad hoc) consent and international agreements. Part III will examine the legal regimes applicable during maritime interception operations. As such, international human rights law and the law of armed conflict will play a central role in this part. It will do so through the lens of three particular subjects: the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visit,</b> the use of force and detention at sea. Lastly, part IV will consist of the conclusions and synthesis...|$|E

40|$|Globalization and {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} {{in international trade}} {{over the past twenty}} years were made possible only by growth in international maritime shipping. International merchant shipping is the lifeblood of the global economy, assimilating nations economically and serving as the principal catalyst for the political and cultural phenomenon of globalization. In recent decades, the world’s marine transportation system has grown exponentially, accelerating interstate and transcontinental integration. As the number of container cargo ships, bulk carriers, and tanker vessels has increased, port facilities on every continent have expanded rapidly to accommodate additional maritime traffic. With international merchant shipping now playing a central role in joining together nations and continents commercially and politically, the system has become more vulnerable to misuse or attack. As the world marine transportation system has grown in importance, it has become a more attractive vector for militants, terrorists, international criminal organizations, and armed groups. Parasitic groups mask illicit activities throughout the marine cargo chain infrastructure, or exploit the system as part of a strategy of asymmetric warfare against prosperous and democratic states. Regional ethnic and clan-based pirates, extremists, and separatist and freelancing smugglers infect the marine transportation system for political, economic, and military purposes. Leveraging the anonymity afforded by the vast tyranny of time and distance in the oceans, the resulting lawlessness destabilizes nations on every continent. To counter these threats, maritime law enforcement, coast guards, and naval forces conduct constabulary patrols and maritime security operations (MSO). States employ warships and law enforcement vessels, as well as submarines and aircraft, to patrol the ocean commons, particularly throughout the coastal zone. Ideally, threats can be disrupted on the land, before they manifest an immediate danger, or along the seashore interface in port facilities, roadsteads, and inshore waters. It is more practical, and often easier, to respond to threats on land than it is at sea, as authorities on land can more quickly coordinate and bring to bear against a threat a wider variety of intelligence assets and security forces. For this purpose, nations operating port facilities may condition entry of port by foreign-flagged vessels on compliance with certain port state safety, security, environmental measures, and inspection regimes. Searching a large ship at sea is impossible—containers cannot be moved about deck and tanks cannot be fully explored unless they are emptied. On other occasions, however, it may be prudent or necessary to counter threats farther out to sea, such as in the 200 -nautical-mile (nm) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or beyond that limit and on the high seas. While MSO include a wide variety of marine constabulary functions, naval forces employ doctrine and tactics, techniques and procedures for vessel interdiction or maritime interception operations (MIO). The term “MIO” itself encompasses a small assortment of naval missions, including naval control and protection of shipping, diversion of vessels away from an area or into port, escort or protection of endangered vessels, and maintenance of maritime security zones and restricted access to sea areas. MIO also includes visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) of ships, and associated capture of dangerous persons or seizure of ships and cargoes. The interception and boarding of a ship during peacetime involves the physical act of intercepting a vessel, which may include approaching and querying the ship (approach and possibly visit), stopping the vessel, sending a boarding team onto the ship (board), conducting an inspection or search of the ship and its cargo (search), and potentially apprehending persons on board and confiscating the ship or cargo (seizure). Maritime interception against suspect vessels may be conducted in consensual, permissive, or non-permissive environments, and {{in a wide variety of}} circumstances. Consequently, legal analysis for MIO and VBSS can become complex because it involves addressing two questions of mixed fact and law. First, the commanding officer of the intercepting ship must acquire and maintain situational awareness of the vessel to be boarded in relation to the maritime zones and navigational regimes reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). As a general rule, MIO may be conducted by an intercepting vessel either in its own territorial sea, or outside the territorial sea—sovereign water and airspace—of any other state. Coastal states exercise sovereignty over their territorial sea, which normally extends 12 nm from the low water mark running along the shore. Although ships of all nations are entitled to exercise the right of innocent passage in the territorial sea, this right typically does not include the right to conduct VBSS. Interception of a vessel and executing a VBSS inside the territorial sea of a coastal state without its consent typically would be regarded as an interference with the sovereignty of a coastal state. Although ships enjoying the right of innocent passage may use force in self-defense, a coastal state has responsibility for the maintenance of maritime security and marine law enforcement inside the territorial sea. Assuming that the state conducting a VBSS has authority to exercise enforcement jurisdiction in the water space of the suspect vessel—that is, the boarding is occurring either inside its own territorial sea or beyond other nations’ territorial seas—a second and perhaps more complex line of inquiry must be addressed: the legal rationale for the boarding. Normally vessels are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the flag state—the nation in which the ship is registered. A warship may always exercise enforcement jurisdiction over its own ships as a matter of international law. If the vessel to be boarded is a foreign-flagged ship, however, there must be some additional basis for a warship to exercise enforcement jurisdiction over it. Exceptions to exclusive flag state jurisdiction exist in times of war or armed conflict, such as the belligerent <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visit</b> and search of a vessel to determine the enemy character of the ship or its cargo. The belligerent <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visit</b> and search, which is a product of the law of naval warfare, is a separate legal right from peacetime MIO and VBSS. Belligerent parties to a conflict are entitled to board neutral ships anywhere in the oceans outside the territorial sea of a neutral state for the purpose of ascertaining the enemy character of the ship or its cargo. This wartime right is distinct from the aforementioned peacetime rule, in which the warship of one nation normally may not assert jurisdiction or control over a ship registered in another state. In time of peace, VBSS may only occur against a foreign-flagged ship subject to some other legal rationale that serves as an exception to exclusive flag state jurisdiction. Generally, the state in which a ship is registered—the flag state— exercises exclusive enforcement jurisdiction over vessels flying its flag. There are exceptions to this universal rule, however. In contrast to the special ship boarding regimes applicable during times of war, the legal rationale for boarding foreign-flagged vessels in peacetime are more numerous, and in several respects more complicated. While the law of naval warfare is a rather discrete body of authority with well-developed ship boarding measures, the rules for ship boarding during peacetime draw on a milieu of sources, and they arise more often. In both war and peace, however, only warships or government vessels on noncommercial service, such as marine law enforcement or coast guard ships, may exercise VBSS. The terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, and the broadened sense of vulnerability to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) has drawn even greater variation into the peacetime composite of norms and regimes. The 2001 attacks illustrated a shocking breach of security in the aviation transportation system, and in doing so also exposed glaring vulnerabilities in the maritime domain and worldwide cargo chain. This Article focuses on the sources of international law that states may invoke as a legal basis for boarding foreign-flagged ships in time of peace. In many nations, additional implementing legislation provides a domestic basis for the activity in municipal law. Furthermore, states conducting VBSS have developed an entire retinue of associated norms, regimes, regulations and doctrine that provide additional fidelity to custom and state practice. In U. S. waters, for example, boarding U. S. vessels for law enforcement purposes is most often conducted by the U. S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard uses the term “boarding” to mean an “armed intervention aboard a vessel to detect [or] suppress violations of applicable law. ” Once on board a ship, Coast Guard officers may conduct inquiries, boat inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests to enforce U. S. law. The Coast Guard’s authority may be exercised on waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or against U. S. ships on the high seas. The U. S. Navy also has extensive doctrine on the conduct of VBSS in unilateral, joint, or combined operational environments. The Navy and Coast Guard are partner armed forces, and they often conduct VBSS together, with individual boarding teams comprised of U. S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments operating in conjunction with Navy boarding teams, which may include trained sailors, special operations forces, or U. S. Marine Corps commandos. Much larger organizations, such as the 2, 200 -person Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable) or MEU/SOC of the U. S. Marine Corps, also are prepared to execute a VBSS or MIO throughout the peace-war continuum. There are a handful of especially crucial international rules and institutions that naval forces, coast guards, and maritime law enforcement authorities invoke as legal authority for boarding foreignflagged merchant ships. The July 28, 2010, entry into force of a newly negotiated ship boarding regime—the 2005 Protocol to the 1988 Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) —provides a timely point of departure for taking stock of the array of VBSS authorities in international law. There exist more legally comprehensive treatments of some aspects of VBSS, particularly within the best volume on the topic by Douglas Guilfoyle. The present study, however, is distinct in that it provides both a maritime operational context for the architecture of VBSS authorities in international law, connecting them to the naval forces that actually implement ship boarding operations, and also includes some background on United States approaches to development of the law. The original 1988 SUA treaty was adopted in the wake of the Palestinian terrorist attack on the Italian-flagged cruise ship, Achille Lauro. With the deposit of its instrument of ratification on April 29, 2010, the Republic of Nauru became the twelfth country to ratify the 2005 SUA Protocol. The twelfth ratification triggered a ninety-day clock, which ushered the treaty into force on July 28, 2010. Bulgaria became the seventeenth state to ratify the 2005 Protocol on October 7, 2010. As important as it is, the SUA treaty is only one international legal authority for boarding ships at sea, and the entry into force of the 2005 Protocol gives rise to the need for a broader understanding of the rest of the tools in the legal toolkit available to maritime security forces. Maritime security forces that seek to board a foreign-flagged merchant ship may obtain flag state permission, the consent of the master of the vessel, and under certain circumstances, board the ship as an exercise in lawful self-defense or pursuant to a U. N. Security Council Resolution adopted under Chapter VII. The exercise of port state control measures may facilitate boarding a ship at the pier, and foreign-flagged ships that violate certain coastal state laws may be boarded in the territorial sea or contiguous zone...|$|E

40|$|The <b>right</b> to <b>visit</b> <b>of</b> which Kant {{speaks in}} the “Third {{definitive}} article on perpetual peace” requires, {{precisely because of}} its theoretical framework, to be inscribed in a broader register, {{that is to say}} one that does not only concern the specifically political and legal aspects of the cosmopolitical project, but makes reference to the issue concerning the very sense in which the possession of reason can legitimately be referred to man. Only thus is it possible theoretically to access in an informed way the main sense of the Kantian cosmopolitical project and the theme of universal hospitality. And this is perhaps the way in which Kant himself, in responding to the urgent issues of his day, can indirectly provide us too with decisive suggestions for working out concrete proposals on the issue of hospitality and pacific cohabitation among peoples...|$|R
60|$|The {{wealth and}} luxury of Babylon were fast spoiling the Persians, who were losing their hardy ways, {{and with them}} their honour, mercy, and truth; and Cambyses was a very savage wretch, almost mad. He made war on Egypt, where he gained a battle by putting a number of cows, dogs, and cats, {{in front of his}} army, and as the Egyptians thought these creatures sacred, they dared not throw their darts at them, and so fled away. He won the whole country; and he {{afterwards}} marched into Ethiopia, where he nearly lost his whole army by thirst in a desert. The Egyptians hated him because he struck his sword into their sacred bull Apis, in his anger at their feasting in honour of this creature, when he himself had just met with such misfortunes. He had but one brother, named Smerdis, whom he caused to be secretly put to death; and when his sister wept for him, he kicked her so that she died. No one grieved when he was killed by a chance wound from his own sword, in the year 522; but a young Magian priest, pretending to be Smerdis, whose death was not generally known, became king. However, some of the nobles suspected the deceit; and one of them, whose daughter was among the many wives of the king, sent word to her to find out whether the king were the real Smerdis. She could not tell, having never seen the Prince Smerdis; but her father, who knew that the young Magian had had his ears cut off for some offence, told her to examine. She Answered that the king was earless; and the fraud being thus detected, seven of the great lords combined and slew him. One daughter of Cyrus still remained and the seven agreed that one of them should marry her and reign. The rest should have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visiting</b> him whenever they pleased, and wearing the same sort of tiara, or high cap, with the point upright, instead of having it turned back {{like the rest of the}} Persians. The choice was to be settled by Heaven, as they thought; namely, by seeing whose horse would first neigh at the rise of their god, the sun. Darius Hystaspes, who thus became king in 521, was a good and upright man, in whose reign the Jews ventured to go on with the Temple. When the Samaritans came and stopped them, they wrote to beg that search might be made among the records of the kingdom for Cyrus's decree in their favour, which no one could change, because the laws of the Medes and Persians could not be altered. The decree was found, and Darius gave the Jews farther help, and forbade anyone to molest them; but they were very poor, and the restoration went on but feebly.|$|R
40|$|Marriage in West Africa {{is almost}} universal; polygyny, {{a form of}} union where a man is married {{to more than one}} wife, is widely practiced in Senegal and Mali. Age at first {{marriage}} is very early for girls and divorced or widowed women quickly remarry. ^ The first chapter is a study of female fertility in rural Senegal according to whether the women are living in monogamous or polygynous unions. The fertility of each wife decreases with the number of wives in the union; the wife of highest rank is more likely to have given birth in the previous year than her co-wives; age of the husband appears to have a stronger effect for monogamists than for polygynists, for whom it is substantial only after 60; childbearing by one wife during the previous year increases the probability of a birth to a co-wife; finally, the presence of a first wife past the age of childbearing has no effect on the fertility of her co-wives. ^ Chapter 2 essentially describes the entry into first marriage in Mali as a process and investigates the relationship between types of marriage celebration, time to co-residence of spouses and age at first birth. The study shows that the delay of age at first marriage (i. e. age at first marriage celebration) is greater for men than for women in Bamako only. The most frequent sequence of marriage ceremonies is the sequence of the three ceremonies (religious, customary, civil) observed together in Bamako; and of the religious and customary ceremonies in other urban and rural areas. The distinction between first births that occur prior to or after the first celebration of marriage shows little change of the timing of first births after first marriage ceremony. In contrast, first births before marriage concern more the younger generation, in all places of residence. ^ Chapter 3 focuses on entry into first marriage in several villages and in Bamako. It uses the qualitative data on first marriage that I collected during a four-month fieldwork in Mali. Islam is the main religion in Mali and marital practices differ between ethnic groups who live in different regions of Mali. For instance, some ethnic groups observe a traditional time of several years between the religious marriage and the entry of the wife into her husband 2 ̆ 7 s house. However, the consummation of the marriage often occurs soon after the religious marriage and sexual relations may be observed during the interval when the husband has <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>visits</b> before the start of co-residence with his wife. In other ethnic groups, the religious marriage and the start of co-residence may occur {{at a very young age}} but the consummation of the marriage may not happen until later because of the young age of the girl. Findings of this paper show how the concepts of “living with a man”, “marriage not consummated” that are used in the DHS are particularly ambiguous and may not always measure the age at marriage.

5000|$|... "Calatrava is the Arabic name of {{a castle}} {{recovered}} from the Moslems, in 1147, by the King of Castile, Alfonso VII, called el Emperador. Located {{in what was then}} the southernmost border of Castile, this conquest was more difficult to keep than to make, especially at a time with neither standing armies nor garrisons were known. In part to correct this deficiency, the military orders such as Knights Templars were founded, where men could fulfill a vow of perpetual war against the Muslim. The Templars, however, were unable to hold Calatrava, and the king found further volunteer warriors when Raymond, Abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Fitero offered himself. This step {{is said to have been}} suggested to the abbot by Father Diego Velázquez, a simple monk, but one who had been a knight, and thus was well acquainted with military matters. Diego was inspired with the idea of employing the lay brothers of the abbey to defend Calatrava. These Cistercian lay brothers--at that time a recent innovation in monastic life--not being in Holy orders, were variously employed in manual trades such as those of tending herds, construction, farm labor, or husbandry. Diego recommended that they become soldiers of the Cross. Thus a new order was created in 1157. Motivated by the desire for religious and pecuniary rewards, these brethren were eager to take the offensive against the Moors. When the Abbot Raymond died (1163), a certain Don García started to lead them in battle as their first grand master. At the same time, the choir monks, not without protest, left Calatrava to live under an abbot whom they had chosen, in the monastery of Cirvelos. Only Velasquez and a few other clerics, to act as chaplains, remained in Calatrava with the knights, Velasquez becoming prior of the whole community. This somewhat revolutionary arrangement was approved by the general chapter at Cîteaux, and by Pope Alexander III (1164). A general chapter held at Cîteaux in 1187 gave to the Knights of Calatrava their definitive rule, which was approved in the same year by Pope Gregory VIII. This rule, modeled upon the Cistercian customs for lay brothers, was imposed upon the knights, besides the obligations of the three religious vows, the rules of silence in the refectory, dormitory, and oratory; of abstinence on four days a week, besides several fast days during the year; they were also obliged to recite a fixed number of paternosters for each day Hour of the Office; to sleep in their armour; to wear, as their full dress, the Cistercian white mantle with the scarlet cross fleur de lisée. Calatrava was subject not to Cîteaux, but to Morimond in Champagne, the mother-house of Fitero, from which Calatrava had sprung. Consequently, the Abbot of Morimond possessed the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>visiting</b> the houses and of reforming the statutes of Calatrava, while the highest ecclesiastical dignity of the order, that of grand prior, could be held only by a monk of Morimond." ...|$|R
