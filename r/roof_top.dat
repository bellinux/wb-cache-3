25|$|Innovatively, {{the report}} {{recommended}} that some areas should change their outlook; rather than facing onto the street, shops could face onto squares or pedestrianised streets, with <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> or multi-storey parking nearby.

25|$|Built in 618, the Church of Saint Hripsimé has {{basically}} survived almost unchanged. It {{is considered one}} of the oldest surviving churches in Armenia, known for its fine architecture of the classical period, which influenced many other Armenian churches. It was erected in 618 by Catholicos Gomidas atop the original mausoleum, built by Catholicos Sahak the Great in 395, which contained the remains of the martyred Saint Hripsimé. According to the 17th century Armenian historian Arakel of Tabriz, the church was renovated during 1651–1653 by Catholicos Philip I. Repairs were made on the <b>roof,</b> <b>top</b> of the dome, the walls and bases. A cross was placed on top of the roof, and a small portico was added to the western side. It is one of the few churches in Armenian that remained active during the Soviet period.|$|E
25|$|In September 2015, {{the mills}} {{were open to}} the public as part of the Open House London weekend in which {{visitors}} were able to tour the sixth floor of the East wing, tenth floor of the main building, the East <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> and the Rank Hovis mill. As of September 2015, the Millennium Mills have been cleared of internal machinery and grain chutes which posed an asbestos risk, though the removed artefacts are planned to be donated to artists to use. A two-storey pavilion on the roof is planned to be removed {{to make way for a}} rooftop bar and restaurant. The concrete East wing stub is planned to be demolished as well as large parts of the south facing fall being removed and replaced. Plans to redeveloped the adjacent Rank Hovis mill are not currently finalised due to its higher rate of decay and architectural significance. Currently, the last remaining grain chute on site resides in the Rank Hovis Mill.|$|E

Scenes are then intercut with shots of Rihanna wearing a black hooded top, in {{what appears to be a}} Church, which is followed by Rihanna changing outfits, again wearing a black bra top and a fur coat sitting on a pair of Angel's wings for the chorus. For the bridge of the song, Rihanna is featured in yet another change of outfit, this time wearing a white vest top and black fur coat, standing on the <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> of a New York skyscraper, with other tall buildings in the background. As Rihanna sings the final chorus, scenes from throughout the video are intercut with each other, with the new addition of Rihanna shown to be wearing what she wore at the start of the video in an underpass.|$|E
500|$|The {{authorities}} were initially wary {{of opening the}} London Underground for shelter, fearing the effect on morale elsewhere in London and hampering normal operations. On 12 September, having suffered five days of heavy bombing, {{the people of the}} East End took the matter into their own hands and invaded tube stations with pillows and blankets. The government relented and opened the partially completed Central line as a shelter. Many deep tube stations remained in use as shelters {{until the end of the}} war. [...] Aerial mines were deployed on 19 September 1940. These exploded at <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> height, causing severe damage to buildings over a wider radius than the impact bombs. By now, the Port of London had sustained heavy damage with a third of its warehouses destroyed, and the West India and St Katherine Docks had been badly hit and put out of action. Bizarre events occurred when the River Lea burned with an eerie blue flame, caused by a hit on a gin factory at Three Mills, and the Thames itself burnt fiercely when Tate & Lyle's Silvertown sugar refinery was hit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hotel was}} [...] planned, {{designed}} and built in the commercial district of Chicago as an upscale hotel for an elite and influential [...] clientele, with luxurious and stately walnut-paneled [...] rooms and lobbies. An elegant <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> garden was planned as a major attraction. When it was opened in 1909, it was hailed as the [...] "largest, safest, and most modern hotel west of New York." [...] The Republican Party of Illinois had their offices located in the luxurious Blue Fountain Room of the hotel. During one of his long visits to Chicago, President William Howard Taft stayed in the presidential suite {{on the third floor}} of this hotel, converting it into de facto White House. A formal visit was also paid to the hotel by President Calvin Coolidge and his wife in 1925. Other visitors came as convention guests.|$|E
2500|$|The {{car park}} is the {{location}} of several key scenes in Get Carter, and is often seen in the distance. Local businessman Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley) meets Jack Carter (Michael Caine) at the incomplete <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> caf, stating {{that he is in}} the process of developing it into a restaurant. Carter later confronts Brumby on one of the building's stairways, and pushes him off; meanwhile the two effete architects waiting in the unfinished caf for Brumby start worrying about ever getting their fees. After this film the Car Park was given the name [...] "Get Carter car park" [...] because of its appearance in the film. [...] The director Mike Hodges was not aware that his friend Rodney Gordon had designed the car park, and did not understand Gordon's constant joking that one of the architect characters was a send-up of him. It was only through reading Gordon's obituaries that Hodges realised he was serious: [...] "Until then I'd always thought the architect was Owen Luder whereas, in fact, it was his practice that took the credit. My friend, Rodney Gordon, had actually designed the Trinity Centre. He hadn't been joking after all." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the center}} of the mosque complex is the main mosque. The main mosque {{consists}} of a main prayer hall, surrounded by three [...] "porch" [...] (serambi) to the north, east, and south. The layout of the main prayer hall is square-shaped, roughly 11.30 x 11.50 meter. The roof is built in a typical Javanese mosque architecture with three-tiers, supported by four main posts (saka guru) and topped with a terracota mustaka (<b>roof</b> <b>top</b> decoration). The main prayer hall's interior is constructed of white-washed brick. Two doors provide entrance to the north and south of the hall. The mihrab is located {{to the west of the}} main prayer hall and contains motifs of false columns and plant-like arabesque on top, reminiscent of the kala makara motif of classical candi architecture. The serambi of Kasunyatan Mosque is enclosed with wall, which is unusual for Javanese mosque architecture which usually has its serambi wall-less like a porch. The northern serambi kept a bedug and an inscription which marked the year the Kasunyatan Mosque received its heritage status in 1932 by Soeria Nata Atmaja. The eastern serambi contains 18 tombs, including the tomb of Ratu Asiyah and Syekh Abdul Syukur Putra. The southern serambi contains 5 tombs.|$|E
2500|$|The 'AC Ace-Aigle' was an aerodynamically {{improved}} single-piece AC Ace Bristol based {{vehicle with}} the BEX289 chassis number {{designed specifically for}} the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1960. The inspiration came from the Swiss [...] AC [...] importer Hubert Patthey, {{as was the case}} with 'AC Ace Bristol Zagato' in 1958, but was conceptually much easier. The Aigle Aigle, which has been legally independent in its own right alongside the design studio and car body builder Ghia in Turin existed. In contrast to the standard vehicle, the 'Ace-Aigle' had a modified front and a fixed hardtop. The <b>roof</b> <b>top</b> had two unusual vaults to give the rider and co-driver plenty of headroom - actually the [...] "double bubble" [...] design, typical of Zagato, and implemented in its 1958 coupé. The normal, aerodynamically relatively unfavorable front body of radiator grille, front fenders and bonnet was replaced by a new front and made of lightweight polyester front. This was rounder, ran longer and flatter forward, and had a flat, oval cooling air intake, backlit headlights clad with plexiglas half shells. She remotely recalled the Jaguar E-Type. According to the same concept and with very similar lines, [...] Ghia Aigle [...] had already changed several Austin-Healey Sprite from 1958 to 1961 (albeit without hardtop).|$|E
