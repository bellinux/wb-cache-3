5|$|If f {{is allowed}} to be any Euclidean function, then the list of {{possible}} D values for which the domain is Euclidean is not yet known. The first example of a Euclidean domain that was not norm-Euclidean (with D=69) was published in 1994. In 1973, Weinberger proved that a quadratic integer ring with D>0 is Euclidean if, and only if, it is a principal ideal domain, provided that the generalized <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> holds.|$|E
25|$|The {{extended}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{extends the}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> to all Dedekind zeta functions of algebraic number fields. The extended <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for abelian {{extension of the}} rationals {{is equivalent to the}} generalized <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> can also be extended to the L-functions of Hecke characters of number fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{practical}} {{uses of the}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{include many}} propositions known true under the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> and some that can be shown equivalent to the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{generalized}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{extends the}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> to all Dirichlet L-functions. In particular it implies the conjecture that Siegel zeros (zeros of L-functions between 1/2 and 1) do not exist.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> can be {{generalized}} by replacing the Riemann zeta function by the formally similar, {{but much more}} general, global L-functions. In this broader setting, one expects the non-trivial zeros of the global L-functions to have real part 1/2. It is these conjectures, rather than the classical <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> only for the single Riemann zeta function, which account for the true importance of the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> in mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Weil's {{criterion}} is {{the statement}} that the positivity of a certain function {{is equivalent to the}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Related is Li's criterion, a statement that the positivity of a certain sequence of numbers is equivalent to the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1913, Gronwall {{showed that}} the {{generalized}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies that Gauss's list of imaginary quadratic fields with class number 1 is complete, though Baker, Stark and Heegner later gave unconditional proofs of this without using the generalized <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{separate}} {{inspiration for}} F1 came from algebraic number theory. Weil's {{proof of the}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for curves over finite fields started with a curve C over a finite field k, took its product , and then examined its diagonal. If the integers were a curve over a field, the same proof would prove the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The integers Z are one-dimensional, which suggests {{that they may be}} a curve, but they are not an algebra over any field. One of the conjectured properties of F1 is that Z should be an F1-algebra. This would make it possible to construct the product , and it is hoped that the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for Z can be proved {{in the same way as}} the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for a curve over a finite field.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Hooley {{showed that}} the {{generalized}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies Artin's conjecture on primitive roots.|$|E
25|$|The grand <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> extends {{it to all}} {{automorphic}} zeta functions, such as Mellin transforms of Hecke eigenforms.|$|E
25|$|In 1923 Hardy and Littlewood {{showed that}} the {{generalized}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies a weak form of the Goldbach conjecture for odd numbers: that every sufficiently large odd number {{is the sum of}} three primes, though in 1937 Vinogradov gave an unconditional proof. In 1997 Deshouillers, Effinger, te Riele, and Zinoviev {{showed that the}} generalized <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies that every odd number greater than 5 is the sum of three primes.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Weinberger {{showed that}} the {{generalized}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies that Euler's list of idoneal numbers is complete.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{arguments}} for (or against) the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> are listed by , , and , and include the following reasons.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies strong bounds on {{the growth}} of many other {{arithmetic}} functions, {{in addition to the}} primes counting function above.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{implies that}} the zeros of the zeta {{function}} form a quasicrystal, meaning a distribution with discrete support whose Fourier transform also has discrete support.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} proof is interesting, in that the {{inequality}} is shown first {{under the assumption that}} the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is true, secondly under the contrary assumption.|$|E
25|$|Another such {{algorithm}} is the class group relations method proposed by Schnorr, Seysen, and Lenstra, that is proved {{under the assumption}} of the Generalized <b>Riemann</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> (GRH).|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} taken to {{understand}} what is meant by saying the generalized <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is false: one should specify exactly which class of Dirichlet series has a counterexample.|$|E
25|$|The strongest {{result of}} this kind one {{can hope for is}} the truth of the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> which would have many {{profound}} consequences in the theory of numbers.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the book}} Open Problems in Mathematics, edited by John Forbes Nash Jr. and Michael Th. Rassias, {{features}} an extensive {{essay on the}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> by Alain Connes.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Chowla {{showed that}} the {{generalized}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies that the first prime in the arithmetic progression a mod m is at most Km2log(m)2 for some fixed constant K.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a {{conjecture}} {{is called}} a hypothesis when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is a conjecture from number theory that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of prime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on {{the truth of this}} conjecture. These are called conditional proofs: the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.|$|E
25|$|By finding many {{intervals}} {{where the}} function Z changes sign one {{can show that}} there are many zeros on the critical line. To verify the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> up to a given imaginary part T of the zeros, one also has to check that there are no further zeros off the line in this region. This can be done by calculating the total number of zeros in the region and checking that it {{is the same as the}} number of zeros found on the line. This allows one to verify the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> computationally up to any desired value of T (provided all the zeros of the zeta function in this region are simple and on the critical line).|$|E
25|$|That leaves 8 (the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis),</b> 12 and 16 unresolved, and 4 and 23 as too vague to ever be {{described}} as solved. The withdrawn 24 would also be in this class. 6 is considered as a problem in physics rather than in mathematics.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, G. Miller {{showed that}} the {{generalized}} <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies that one can test if a number is prime in polynomial time via the Miller test. In 2002, Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena proved this result unconditionally using the AKS primality test.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{conjecture}} is {{a conclusion}} or proposition based on incomplete information, {{for which no}} proof has been found. Conjectures such as the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed {{in order to prove}} them.|$|E
25|$|Bernhard Riemann {{made some}} famous {{contributions}} to modern analytic number theory. In a single short paper (the {{only one he}} published {{on the subject of}} number theory), he investigated the Riemann zeta function and established its importance for understanding the distribution of prime numbers. He made a series of conjectures about properties of the zeta function, one of which is the well-known <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of studying the mathematics of F1 was originally suggested in 1956 by Jacques Tits, published in , {{on the basis}} of an analogy between symmetries in projective geometry and the combinatorics of simplicial complexes. F1 has been connected to noncommutative geometry and to a possible proof of the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Many theories of F1 have been proposed, {{but it is not clear}} which, if any, of them give F1 all the desired properties.|$|E
25|$|The Ihara zeta {{function}} of a finite graph is an analogue of the Selberg zeta function, which was first introduced by Yasutaka Ihara {{in the context of}} discrete subgroups of the two-by-two p-adic special linear group. A regular finite graph is a Ramanujan graph, a mathematical model of efficient communication networks, if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies the analogue of the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> as was pointed out by T. Sunada.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{are examples of}} problems in analytic number theory: the prime number theorem, the Goldbach conjecture (or the twin prime conjecture, or the Hardyâ€“Littlewood conjectures), the Waring problem and the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Some {{of the most important}} tools of analytic number theory are the circle method, sieve methods and L-functions (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of modular forms (and, more generally, automorphic forms) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{there is}} some degree of {{empiricism}} and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes {{with the use of}} a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 2.88Ã—1018. The <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the zeta function. Neither of these statements is considered proved.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Weil used the first {{definition}} (over an arbitrary base field) {{but could not}} at first prove that it implied the second. Only in 1948 did he prove that complete algebraic groups can be embedded into projective space. Meanwhile, {{in order to make}} the proof of the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for curves over finite fields that he had announced in 1940 work, he had to introduce the notion of an abstract variety and to rewrite the foundations of algebraic geometry to work with varieties without projective embeddings (see also the history section in the Algebraic Geometry article).|$|E
25|$|In 1796, Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured {{the prime}} number theorem, {{describing}} the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning {{the distribution of}} the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the Goldbach conjecture, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> formulated by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. The prime number theorem was finally proved by Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la VallÃ©e-Poussin in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} the {{independence}} result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased {{in the language of}} Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC. Statements in this class include the statement that P = NP, the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.|$|E
25|$|Hilbert and PÃ³lya {{suggested}} {{that one way}} to derive the <b>Riemann</b> <b>hypothesis</b> would be to find a self-adjoint operator, from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of Î¶(s) would follow when one applies the criterion on real eigenvalues. Some support for this idea comes from several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius element on an Ã©tale cohomology group, the zeros of a Selberg zeta function are eigenvalues of a Laplacian operator of a Riemann surface, and the zeros of a p-adic zeta function correspond to eigenvectors of a Galois action on ideal class groups.|$|E
