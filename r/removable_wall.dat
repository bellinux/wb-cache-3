The Annex originally included a large central gym with four adjacent basketball courts as well as auxiliary gyms, courts, a weight room, classrooms, and offices for the School of Dance and the School of Exercise, Leisure, and Sport and would serve as the Kent State Recreation Center until 1999. For many years, up until 2016, the Annex housed graduate student studios from the KSU College of Architecture in space taken from two of the original four basketball courts. Since March 2016, the Athletic Training and Education Center, a 10000 sq ft sports medicine facility, is located in the Annex. It includes three therapy pools, a cryotherapy unit, training areas, and meeting rooms.|$|E

5000|$|Plans for the MAC Center {{were drawn}} {{up in the}} late 1940s as Kent State saw a rapid {{enrollment}} increase in men following World War II. It was one of multiple construction projects at KSU during the post-war period, which included the first men's dormitory, Stopher Hall, in 1948, and a new practical arts building, later named Van Deusen Hall, in 1951. The state of Ohio approved funding in 1947 for the gym and work began in late April 1949 with an official groundbreaking on May 3, 1949. The facility was dedicated December 2, 1950 and hosted its first three athletic events {{as part of the}} dedication exercises. The wrestling team defeated Case Institute of Technology 21-8, followed by a 42-33 men's swimming victory over the Ohio Bobcats, and concluded with the men's basketball team claiming a 51-46 upset win over the Pittsburgh Panthers in front of approximately 4,000 fans. [...] As of 2010 it is the 19th-oldest arena in U.S. college basketball. The original building included the main gym and a pool, connected by a <b>removable</b> <b>wall,</b> as well as offices and other rooms to house the Physical Education department. The building replaced Wills Gymnasium, built in 1925, as the home of the Golden Flashes men's basketball, swimming, and wrestling teams. In 1956, the Men's Physical Education building was rededicated as Memorial Gym in honor of Kent State students who died in both world wars.|$|E
5000|$|The MAC Center's {{most visible}} role {{is that of}} being the home court for five of the university's intercollegiate {{athletic}} teams: men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball, women's gymnastics, and wrestling. The Kent State men's basketball team has played home games at the MAC Center since the building opened in 1950 and through the 2009-10 season has an all-time home record of 488-255 (.657). Since 1998, the team has a 149-23 (.866) record in the MAC Center. [...] The largest crowd at the building was 7,778 for a game against St. Bonaventure on January 10, 1970. Since the 1992 renovation, the largest crowd to see a game in the MAC Center was 6,567 on March 4, 2007 against arch-rival Akron. [...] The KSU women's basketball team has an all-time record of 306-101 (.752) which includes a 43-game winning streak that ran from December 3, 1997 to December 1, 2001. Since the 2000 season, the women's gymnastics team has a 60-10 record at the MAC Center. The northern end of the building is the gymnastics center and serves as the practice facility for the women's gymnastics team. It connects to the main arena {{by way of a}} <b>removable</b> <b>wall.</b> Prior to 2005, most home meets were held in the gymnastics center by reversing the direction of a section of baseline bleachers. [...] The arena has been the site of conference and NCAA events as well. During the 1960s, the MAC Center, then known as Memorial Gym, hosted the NCAA Wrestling Team Championship on two occasions. The 1963 tournament, won by the Oklahoma Sooners, was held over three days with a total attendance of over 16,000. The championship returned to Kent in 1967 and drew over 26,000 fans over three days, and was won by the Michigan State Spartans. The building has been a host arena for games in two NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournaments. In the 1966 tournament, Memorial Gym was a host arena for two Mid-East regional quarterfinal games. The Dayton Flyers defeated the Miami Redskins 58-51 and the WKU Hilltoppers defeated the Loyola Ramblers 105-86. [...] Two years later, Memorial Gym was again the site for two NCAA Mid-East regional quarterfinal games: the Marquette Golden Eagles narrowly beat the Bowling Green Falcons 72-71 and the East Tennessee State Buccaneers defeated the Florida State Seminoles 79-69 as part of the 1968 tournament. [...] The MAC Center is also a regular site for Mid-American Conference events such as the women's gymnastics and men's wrestling championships. The MAC Center was the site for the first MAC Women's Gymnastics Championship in 1981 and has hosted the meet five times through 2015. In 2008, the MAC Center was the site of both the wrestling and women's gymnastics championship meets. The MAC Wrestling Tournament returned to the MAC Center in 2014 while the MAC Gymnastics Championship was held at the arena in March 2015.|$|E
40|$|Innovative {{construction}} materials and systems have generated {{a need for}} laboratory scale tests to quantify the effect of air leakage on thermal and moisture performance of building assemblies. Some {{construction materials}} and systems are inherently more air tight than others. It is desirable to do laboratory scale measurements on alternative systems so as to rank them with respect to air tightness just {{as they can be}} ranked with respect to system R-value. Participants in summer 1995 and 1996 workshops for elementary and secondary school science teachers in the Buildings Technology Center (BTC) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory sought a way to illustrate basic principles of building science in the classroom. They decided to build a small metal-framed assembly with internal volume of 44 ft{sup 3 } (1. 25 m{sup 3 }) and <b>removable</b> <b>wall</b> sheathing. The assembly included a door and window. Although the door and window were made from 4 -in. (10. 2 -cm) thick foam insulation, the requisite framing for them detracted from the thermal performance of the walls and occupied a disproportionately large fraction of the wall area. The floor and roof of the assembly were also well-insulated so that the walls dominated the conduction heat loss through the assembly. The plan was to test thermal performance of the assembly with the sheathing and without it. Thereby the teachers hoped to show the effects of thermal bridges with metal framing as well as practical yet insightful way to reduce their effects...|$|E

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} shows functional lateralization in invertebrates 1, with population-level asymmetries observed also in so-called solitary species 2. Such results challenge a theoretical model postulating that group-level lateralization {{is more likely}} to evolve in social species 3. To test this hypothesis further, we investigated whether Procambarus clarkii, a decapod crustacean considered a non-social species with remarkable burrowing capabilities 4, displays behavioural asymmetries while performing a fine motor manipulation task. Crayfish were placed in a rectangular environment, with a <b>removable</b> <b>wall</b> covering one side of the apparatus. Once this wall was removed, animals were free to reach a pellet of food placed beyond a transparent barrier, and only accessible through a small hole, thus requiring the crayfish to use a specific pereopod in order to reach the food. To evaluate lateralization, the pereopod used to grasp the food (left or right) was recorded, along with the time the animals needed to accomplish the task. We observed that crayfish were not strongly lateralized at the individual-level (only 35 out of 122 animals displayed an individual level bias), and the time necessary to solve the task was not different between lateralized and non-lateralized animals (p= 0. 626). This result shows that no advantage is apparent for lateralized individuals 5 - 6 and it could then be concluded that crayfish are equally skilled with both {{the left and the right}} pereopods. By contrast, the analysis on the whole population revealed that there is overall a slight but systematic preference for the use of the right pereopods to graps and pull the food pellet (p= 0. 01). These results indicate that a further invertebrate species can display a certain degree of functional asymmetries within the population, although in absence of significant individual-level lateralization. Furthermore, the systematic preference for right manipulation observed in P. clarkii is similar to that of other vertebrate social species performing the same task 7 and other non-social tasks 8. Therefore, our findings provide support to the fact that preferential limb use has a widespread occurrence and a long evolutionary history...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe report here {{a simple}} yet robust {{transient}} compartmentalization system for microfluidic platforms. Cylindrical microfilaments made of commercially available fishing lines {{are embedded in}} a microfluidic chamber and employed as <b>removable</b> <b>walls,</b> dividing the chamber into several compartments. These partitions allow tight sealing for hours, and can be removed at any time by longitudinal sliding with minimal hydrodynamic perturbation.

500|$|... "Small Victories" [...] {{is split}} into two {{parallel}} storylines, and several space shots of the B story onboard Thor's spaceship were cut at the script stage to allot more money to the A story submarine scenes. [...] "Small Victories" [...] was originally written to set on a fishing trawler until the producers got access to a real Russian Foxtrot class submarine, which was brought from Vladivostok to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where Stargate SG-1 was filmed. Several scenes were filmed in {{and outside of the}} submarine for two days. A matching set with <b>removable</b> <b>walls</b> was built later on because only three film crew members could fit into the real 25-feet-wide submarine. To enhance the submarine's narrowness, Martin Wood lit the ship with the actors' helmet lights and chose an agitated shooting style, holding the shots tight and handholding some of the cameras himself. The logistics of the submarine filming proved difficult and time-consuming, since the computer-generated Replicators needed to appear on Daniel's playback monitors in advance of filming. One scripted scene in which a Replicator piece is removed from Teal'c's shoulder was trimmed on-set because the actors felt it to be redundant.|$|R

5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have <b>removable</b> interior <b>walls</b> to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|R
40|$|A {{principle}} of an acoustic Eaton Lens array and its application as a <b>removable</b> tsunami <b>wall</b> is proposed theoretically. The lenses {{are made of}} expandable rubber pillars or balloons and create a stop-band by the rotating the incoming tsunami wave and reduce the pressure by canceling each other. The diameter of each lens {{is larger than the}} wavelength of the tsunami near the coast, that is, order of a kilometer. The impedance matching on the border of the lenses results in little reflection. Before a tsunami, the balloons are buried underground in shallow water near the coast in folded or rounded form. Upon sounding of the tsunami alarm, water and air are pumped into the pillars, which expand and erect the wall above the sea level within a few hours. After the tsunami, the water and air are released from the pillars, which are then buried underground for reuse. Electricity is used to power the entire process.

25|$|In 1993, George Street was added, {{and soon}} after Walford East tube station was built, to create further {{locations}} when EastEnders went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened. The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it {{was turned into a}} closed front shop, with <b>removable</b> interior <b>walls</b> to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987.

5000|$|Orion {{was called}} [...] "A {{landmark}} {{in the evolution}} of the modern liner" [...] by the Architectural Review. Previous liners had adopted the cloistered and formally decorated styles of interior designing found in the wealthy homes of England, however, Brian OʼRorke, the New Zealand born designer in charge of Orions interior, recognized the need to adapt to the tropical and oceangoing conditions of life aboard ship. The result was an open air layout that made use of <b>removable</b> and folding <b>walls,</b> sliding glass doors, and relatively enormous promenade decks to keep cooling breezes ﬂowing through spaces passengers could relax in. Rooms without access to the deck of the boat were also made to feel breezy by being as light and uncluttered as possible.

Orion was also the first British ship to be fitted with air conditioning, though this was originally confined to the dining rooms.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{dissertation}} is to quantify the efficiency and operation of various types of fish passes for dams. This is achieved through a novel experiment of testing juvenile salmon in a scale model fish-passes with a range of small structures including vertical slots, orifices, weirs and combinations of all three. Direct comparisons of the efficiency of each type of fish pass in terms of upstream migration. Two identical physical models were constructed, one at the Fisheries Research Services Freshwater Laboratory at Almondbank, Perth, Scotland where observations were made of fish behaviour. The other model at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow tested only hydraulic conditions. The physical models were simplified representations of a reach of a river downstream of a dam, weir or any other obstruction to fish migration. A <b>removable</b> cross <b>wall</b> incorporating one of the types of pass tested divided the flume into two pools. A significantly higher proportion of fish moved through submerged orifices or vertical slots than through weirs for a given flow rate and velocity. The orifice and vertical slot passing efficiencies are directly correlated to the velocities existing in their vicinity. To reach the weir/slot/orifice devices, salmon parr tended also to stay {{near the bottom of the}} flume and followed a path along the sides of the arena, which provided them with low velocities and cover. In the vicinity of the weir/orifice/slot devices, the movements of salmon parr were consistent with energy-conserving strategies. Clearly, the extrapolations of results from the behaviour of small to large salmon remains cautious, the intention of this research being to characterise the behaviour of small salmon and to develop clear testable hypotheses about how large salmon may respond to water flow. Preliminary field tests were then conducted at Tongland Dam fish pass to test the main recommendation extrapolated from the parr behavioural study. The particular situation of this fish pass, which contains both weirs and orifices, allows a comparison between the two. Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags together with antennae installed at a weir and an orifice were used to individually monitor the movement of wild spawning salmon passing through the fish pass. The results of the field test are as yet, inconclusive...|$|R
