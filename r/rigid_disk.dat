40|$|An {{experimental}} study is described which investigates the laminar-turbulent transition {{of the boundary}} layer over rigid and compliant disks rotating under water. Hot-film data are presented and analyzed to produce neutral-stability curves. It {{appears to be the}} first time that such data has become available for a compliant disk. Our experiments employing a <b>rigid</b> <b>disk</b> essentially confirm the results of previous authors. For the flow over the compliant disk the turbulence levels in the transitional and fully turbulent flow regimes are found to be considerably lower than the corresponding levels for the <b>rigid</b> <b>disk.</b> The analysis of our experimental data suggests that wall compliance has a stabilizing influence in the frequency range associated with the Type I cross-flow instability. Nevertheless, compliance is found to have an overall destabilizing effect on the boundary-layer flow. This results in a substantially lower transitional Reynolds number compared to the case of the <b>rigid</b> <b>disk.</b> The experimental observations are in qualitative agreement with our theoretical predictions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{asymmetric}} {{problem of}} rocking rotation of a circular <b>rigid</b> <b>disk</b> {{embedded in a}} finite depth of a transversely isotropic half-space is analytically addressed. The <b>rigid</b> <b>disk</b> {{is assumed to be}} in frictionless contact with the elastic half-space. By virtue of appropriate Green's functions, the mixed boundary value problem is written as a dual integral equation. Employing further mathematical techniques, the integral equation is reduced to a well-known Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The results related to the contact stress distribution across the disk region and the equivalent rocking stiffness of the system are expressed in terms of the solution of the obtained Fredholm integral equation. When the <b>rigid</b> <b>disk</b> is located on the surface or at the remote boundary, the exact closed-form solutions are presented. For verification purposes, the limiting case of an isotropic half-space is considered and the results are verified with those available in the literature. The jump behavior in the results {{at the edge of the}} <b>rigid</b> <b>disk</b> for the case of an infinitesimal embedment is highlighted analytically for the first time. Selected numerical results are depicted for the contact stress distribution across the disk region, rocking stiffness of the system, normal stress, and displacement components along the radial axis.
