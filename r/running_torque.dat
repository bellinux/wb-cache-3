The performance of such components will {{be influenced by the}} quality of the working surface. In general, a smoother surface will perform better than a rougher surface since the lubrication conditions are improved. For example, surfaces with a special near-mirror quality finish of low roughness performed better than ground surfaces when tested using a block-on-ring arrangement. Bearings with near-mirror quality have been tested and analyzed; lower <b>running</b> <b>torques</b> were measured and improved fatigue life was anticipated. Experiments have been done to evaluate the performance of gears with improved, low roughness surface finishing. The measured performance improvements include an increased scuffing (scoring) load capacity by a factor of 1. 6, a 30 -percent reduction of gear tooth running friction, and longer fatigue lives by a factor of about four. One can also anticipate that near-mirror quality surface finishing could improve the performance of other mechanical components such as mechanical seals and heavily loaded journal bearings. Given these demonstrated benefits, capable and economical methods for the production of mechanical components with near-mirror quality surfaces are desired. One could propose the production of near-mirror quality surfaces by several methods such as abrasive polishing, chemical assisted polishing, or grinding. Production of the surfaces by grinding offers the possibility to control the macro-geometry (form), waviness, and surface texture with one process. The present study was carried out to investigate the possibility of producing near-mirror quality surfaces by grinding.

40|$|The {{migration}} of low-mass planets {{is driven by}} the differential Lindblad torque and the corotation torque in non-magnetic viscous models of protoplanetary discs. The corotation torque has recently received detailed attention as it may slow down, stall, or reverse migration. In laminar viscous disc models, the long-term evolution of the corotation torque is intimately related to viscous and thermal diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe region. This paper examines the properties of the corotation torque in discs where MHD turbulence develops {{as a result of the}} magnetorotational instability, considering a weak initial toroidal magnetic field. We present results of 3 D MHD simulations carried out with two different codes. Non-ideal MHD effects and the disc's vertical stratification are neglected, and locally isothermal disc models are considered. The <b>running</b> time-averaged <b>torque</b> exerted by the disc on a fixed planet is evaluated in three disc models. We first present results with an inner disc cavity (planet trap). As in viscous disc models, the planet is found to experience a positive <b>running</b> time-averaged <b>torque</b> over several hundred orbits, which highlights the existence of an unsaturated corotation torque maintained in the long term in MHD turbulent discs. Two disc models with initial power-law density and temperature profiles are also adopted, in which the time-averaged torque is found to be in decent agreement with its counterpart in laminar viscous disc models with similar viscosity at the planet location. Detailed analysis of the averaged torque density distributions indicates that the differential Lindblad torque takes very similar values in MHD turbulent and laminar viscous discs, and there exists an unsaturated corotation torque in MHD turbulent discs. This analysis also reveals the existence of an additional corotation torque in weakly magnetized discs. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R

40|$|Flagellated {{bacteria}} propel {{themselves through}} an aqueous medium by rotating their helical flagellar filaments. The torque required for this motion is {{generated in the}} flagellar motor, which anchors the filament to the cell wall. The motor measures only about 25 nm in diameter, and electron micrographs of the isolated organelle show several rings arranged on a rod, which {{is connected to the}} filament by a curved hook. Flagellar rotation is driven by the protonmotive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. In recent years, a motile strain of Streptococcus has emerged as the organism of choice in studies of the flagellar motor, chiefly because its protonmotive force is easily manipulated. Since this bacterium lacks endogenous energy reserves, it can be starved until no metabolic protonmotive force remains. The grampositive cell wall leaves the cytoplasmic membrane accessible to ionophores, which facilitates the generation of artificial proton gradients. Flagellar rotation can be visualized by tethering a bacterium to a glass surface by one of its flagellar filaments, which causes the cell body to spin about the point of attachment. Recently it has also become possible to measure the motor's rotation rate in swimming cells. This thesis contains a variety of functional studies as well as some theoretical considerations of torque generation in the flagellar motor. The rotational angular symmetry of the motor was probed by a study of the angular positions at which it can stop. Only 5 or 6 discrete stopping angles were found. This constraint may result from static interactions between the rod of the motor and components of the cell wall. A technique was developed to measure the external torque required to stop flagellar rotation. This stall torque did not depend noticeably on the motor's angular position. It was equal to the <b>running</b> <b>torque</b> measured in a rotating tethered cell. In particular, a decrease in the <b>running</b> <b>torque</b> at very low and very high pH, as well as its saturation at large protonmotive force, were also observed for the stall torque. These results show that the <b>running</b> <b>torque</b> is not limited by the rates of torque-generating processes associated with motor rotation. The apparent saturation of the torque as a function of protonmotive force seems to result from difficulties in generating large potassium diffusion potentials. Similarly, the artificially generated protonmotive force might be affected at extreme values of the pH. This thesis also reports the first sucessful measurements of the proton flux associated with flagellar rotation. These studies required an investigation of the total proton flux through the cytoplasmic membrane. An unusually large proton conductance was found, ca 10 times higher than the values reported for the membrane of Streptococcus lactis. After energization with an artificial, inwardly directed protonmotive force the rate of proton uptake by the cells decreased by a factor of 10 in 30 to 60 s with roughly exponential time course. Under certain conditions this influx was followed by slow extrusion of protons, part of which could be mediated by passive antiport of protons against other cations. Exchange of H + for Na + and Li + was observed directly. The time course of proton movements accelerated by a factor of 6 as the temperature varied from 16 °C to 32 °C. The rate of proton uptake was reduced by about 25...|$|E

The load distribution model from Amasorrain et al. (2003) and the kinematics model developed by Leblanc and Nelias (2007) have been combined after ignoring centrifugal and gyroscopic effects, a valid assumption for slow speed operation. Results from the model are compared with previous literature data, as well as with tests done on a specially-developed friction torque rig. The comparison with the literature results was done for two specific cases: (i) when only one out of the two contact lines in the four-point contact bearing is active (effectively creating a two-point contact bearing); and (ii) where both contact lines in the four-point contact bearing are active. Further, the comparison was done with a custom-built friction torque rig with FAG QJ 309 bearings, again for two cases: (i) bearings mounted with a specific clearance (two-point contact); and (ii) bearings mounted with larger size balls to obtain interference (four-point contact). All tests were performed at low speeds. The sliding friction, which is an important input to the friction torque model, is carefully measured on ball-on-plate test using the same interface roughness, speed and contact pressure conditions as seen in the QJ 309 friction test.

A software package {{has been developed}} by the authors based on IEC 354 : Loading guide for oil immersed power transformers. It identifies the risks involved and indicates how transformers may be loaded {{in excess of the}} nameplate rating (abnormal loading) without adverse effects for specific load curves. A matrix formulation of top oil temperature allows a near continuous load curve simulation. The relative ageing rate is calculated using Simpson’s rule. Results of the package agree exactly with the two step approach specified in the Loading guide for two step load curves. However, it is shown that the two step approximation gives somewhat inaccurate results for certain practical complex load curves. Thus use of the package could minimise unexpected future damages to transformers. Calculations have been done based on practically obtained data to determine the excess voltage regulation introduced by the abnormal loading and the variation of efficiency of a practical induction motor within this range of voltages. These show that there is no adverse effect on motor efficiency. In addition other general effects of voltage regulation on induction motor characteristics were also considered with the guidance of IEEE standard 141 : 1993.

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) of rocks from drilling data is a promising in-situ method and has been studied by many researchers. In most studies, experimental methods {{have been used to}} determine the relationship between UCS and drilling data. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to deduce the relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process is divided into cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. There is a linear relation between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). The cutting forces and friction forces of both the rake surface and the flank surface are examined. Also, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank surface of the bit and the rock. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts respectively generated from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle <b>running.</b> <b>Torque</b> caused by friction and idle running is ineffective for drilling, whereas that caused by cutting and indentation is effective. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts respectively from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running. For the purposes of this study, effective specific energy is defined as the sum of specific energy consumed by cutting and feeding. Effective specific energy is independent of the penetration rate. Since it is proportional to the UCS of the rocks, it is not influenced by the penetration rate, and is more useful in the evaluation of UCS than other parameters. Some laboratory and field tests were conducted, and the results verified the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|E

Forefoot and rearfoot strike runners had the same thickness of the gastrocnemii muscles. However, in comparison with sedentary walkers, the runners had thicker calf muscles.

50|$|The modern going barrel, {{invented in}} 1760 by Jean-Antoine Lépine, {{produces}} a constant force by simply using a longer mainspring than needed, and coiling it under {{tension in the}} barrel. In operation, only a few turns of the spring at a time are used, with the remainder pressed against the outer wall of the barrel. Mathematically, the tension creates a 'flat' section in the spring's 'torque curve' (see graph at right) and only this flat section is used. In addition, the outer end of the spring is often given a 'reverse' curve, so it has an 'S' shape. This stores more tension in the spring's outer turns where it is available {{toward the end of}} the running period.

40|$|Stepper motors {{are widely}} used on most {{spacecraft}} mechanisms requiring repeatable and reliable performance. The unique detent torque characteristics of these type of motors makes them behave differently when subjected to low duty cycle excitations where the applied driving pulses are only energized {{for a fraction of}} the pulse duration. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in discrete permanent magnet stepper motors used in the space industry. While the inherent high detent properties of discrete permanent magnets provide desirable unpowered holding performance characteristics, it results in unique behavior especially in low duty cycles. Notably, the <b>running</b> <b>torque</b> reduces quickly to the unpowered holding torque when the duty cycle is reduced. The space industry's accepted methodology of calculating the Motorization Ratio (or Torque Margin) is more applicable to systems where the power is continuously applied to the motor coils like brushless DC motors where the cogging torques are low enough not to affect the linear performance of the motors as a function of applied current. This paper summarizes the theoretical and experimental studies performed on a number of space qualified motors under different pulse rates and duty cycles. It is the intention of this paper to introduce a new approach to calculate the Motorization Ratios for discrete permanent magnet steppers under all full and partial duty cycle regimes. The recommended approach defines two distinct relationships to calculate the Motorization Ratio for 100 percent duty cycle and partial duty cycle, when the motor detent (unpowered holding torque) is the main contributor to holding position. These two computations reflect accurately the stepper motor physical behavior {{as a function of the}} command phase (ON versus OFF times of the pulses), pointing out how the torque contributors combine. Important points highlighted under this study are the torque margin computations, in particular for well characterized mechanisms. The rationale at CDR level versus TRR/TRB level will be discussed, aiming at avoiding too much conservatism for units that have extensive test and in flight heritage. A critical topic is related to the magnetic losses and how to sort out such phenomena as a function of the motor type being used. For instance, detent torque is a major contributor that has no reason to evolve during life and is not an uncontrolled torque loss...|$|E

Research suggests that less than 20 percent of daily driving mileages are over 70 km but that longer trips are relatively common. This fact makes the range extended electric vehicle (REEV) potentially more favourable to typical family usage. To fulfil an everyday full electric commute a smaller battery pack can be used, which reduces cost. An on-board auxiliary power unit (APU) is designed to recharge the batteries for occasional long range trips. Usually, a low-cylinder-count small capacity engine coupled with an electric generator {{is used in the}} APU. However, this type of engine inherently exposes the system to more severe torque pulsations due to the lower firing frequency. This is not desirable for intermittent APU operation. The noise and vibration could be noticeable to the passengers once the APU starts <b>running.</b> The <b>torque</b> output of a synchronous electric machine can be accurately controlled by the invertor through vector control theory. Thus, it is feasible to dynamically vary the generator in-cycle torque pattern to counteract the engine torque oscillation. Consequently, a smoother operation is achievable. In this paper, a series of motor/generator control torque patterns were applied to cancel the engine in-cycle torque pulsations. The correlation between the electric machine torque profile and the engine in-cycle speed variation was investigated. As more aggressively use of the electric machine was made to achieve better system operation characteristic, the electric losses become more significant compared to constant torque demand strategies as does the thermal impact. Therefore, the electric losses and thermal effect were also studied for a given motor/generator design when a dynamic torque control strategy is deployed...|$|R
5000|$|The Modificata 456M {{appeared}} in 1998, starting with chassis number 109589. Many {{changes were made}} to improve aerodynamics and cooling, and the interior [...] - [...] still featuring Connolly Leather [...] - [...] was freshened with new seats and other conveniences (fewer gauges on dash, and a new Becker stereo fitted in front of gear stick rather than behind as in the very shallow and special Sony head unit in the 456 GT). Some readily apparent changes {{can be seen in}} the two adjoining pictures. The 456 has a smaller grille with fog lights outside the grille. The 456 also had hood-mounted air scoops which can be seen removed on the 456M. The undercarriage spoiler on the 456M is fixed, where the older 456 had a motorized spoiler that began its deployment above 105 km/h. Power remained unchanged on the Modificata using Bosch Motronic M5.2 engine management at the cylinder firing order was changed for smoother <b>running,</b> and the <b>torque</b> remained the same for later versions of the 456 GT. The Tour de France Blue with Daytona Seats was the most desirable color and option combination.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} hydraulic system performance using vegetable-based palm oil as hydraulic fluid. Design/methodology/approach - The hydraulic system performance test at different operating conditions, such as pressure, speed and oil ageing, was performed using a Yuken vane pump test rig. The endurance system performance test was also conducted for 200 and 400 h. The effect of speed on flow slip coefficient in discrete and continuous tests was studied. In discrete testing, pressure of 35 and 200 bar and speed of 750 and 1, 439 rpm were used in determining flow slip coefficient. The instantaneous data were recorded in a computer using an analog-to-digital data acquisition system with respect to time and the parameters stored were reservoir temperature, return line temperature, suction and delivery pressures, instantaneous flow rate, total flow, total <b>running</b> time and <b>torque.</b> The obtained results were interpolated for future prediction of the system performance. Findings - The experimental and interpolated results showed that slip coefficient decreases with increasing pump speed. The effect of aging condition on volumetric efficiency showed that the efficiency increases with aging period due to increase in oil viscosity. Practical implications - This vegetable-based palm oil could be a potentially useful substitute for mineral-based energy transport media such as hydraulic fluid. Originality/value - The investigation of hydraulic system performance using palm oil as hydraulic fluid is scarce in the literature. Therefore, the current study is quite new for the hydraulic system performance and it is hoped that it will provide a high value to researchers for further research before it can be used as hydraulic fluid...|$|R
