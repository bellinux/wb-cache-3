To avoid a mistuning between the scavenger resonance and frequency of vibration, a plucked harvester based on a rotating excitation is proposed. A contactless magnetic coupling is applied and the whole scavenger is designed to fit the requirements of back bearing sensor of a <b>rolling</b> <b>mil...</b>|$|E

This provided the much needed windfall {{for the young}} company.

The cooling beds of small profiles <b>rolling</b> <b>mils</b> of SC ISPAT-SIDERURGICA SA Hunedoara is most complex, being formed, beside the classics receive-exhaust reeling-path by a few mechanism like: separation mechanism, the mechanism of taking-over and transversal removal, grouping-removing mechanism. Itâ€™s being studied the braking mechanism at the entrance on the cooling-beds. The kinematics and cinetostatic study of this mechanism conducts to dates and conclusions, which can be used forward at the study of component parts of the mechanism using an analysing program with established finite element. Based of results obtained from the kinematics and cinetostatic analyses of the mechanism and the results of feign-modelling is suggested a new solution for the construction of component nod of this mechanism. It must be underlined the fact that, because of the very big length of cooling bed and reduplication of component parts, this thing has a favourable influence concerning the working and the exploitation of the braking mechanism, wish positive influence in global working of the cooling bed rolling mills. 	The study can be extended for all the component mechanism of this cooling bed...|$|R
