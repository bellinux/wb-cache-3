5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust <b>reverser</b> deployed in-flight for reasons {{that could not be}} determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust <b>reverser</b> on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled to the right and crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Relatively rare amongst fighter aircraft, the RB.199 is {{fitted with}} thrust reversers to {{decrease}} the distance required to safely land.

5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw <b>reverser</b> to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam <b>reverser</b> configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

30|$|Proof. The way {{of proving}} of Theorem 4 {{is similar to}} Theorem 3. By the <b>reverse</b> Hö lder's {{inequality}} [9], we have the <b>reverse</b> of (10) and (14). It is easy to obtain the <b>reverse</b> of (13). In view of the <b>reverses</b> of (13) and (14), we obtain the <b>reverse</b> of (12). On the other hand, suppose that the <b>reverse</b> of (12) is valid. Setting the same g(y) as theorem 3, by the <b>reverse</b> of (10), we have J > 0. If J = ∞, then the <b>reverse</b> of (13) is obvious value; if J < ∞, then by the <b>reverse</b> of (12), we obtain the <b>reverses</b> of (15) and (16). Hence, we have the <b>reverse</b> of (13), which {{is equivalent to the}} <b>reverse</b> of (12).|$|R
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam <b>reverser,</b> could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam <b>reverser.</b> The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust <b>reverser.</b> This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing {{the thrust of the}} engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E

5|$|The first 25 were {{constructed}} at Nine Elms Locomotive Works between March and November 1897. Thereafter the M7 class {{had a long}} production run with five major sets of design variants. Between 1897 and 1899 the locomotives {{were constructed}} with a short overhang at the front, and sandboxes combined with the front splashers. Injectors and a lever-type <b>reverser</b> were also added, and a conical, as opposed to flat, smokebox door was implemented on numbers 252–256. In 1900 the design was modified to incorporate the sandboxes inside the smokebox; these were later relocated below the running plate.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust <b>reverser.</b> The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E
25|$|When the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States asked Boeing to do tests {{activating}} {{the thrust}} <b>reverser</b> in flight, the FAA had allowed Boeing {{to establish the}} tests of the thrust <b>reverser.</b> Boeing had insisted that a deployment was not possible in flight. In 1982 Boeing established a test where the aircraft was slowed to 250 knots, and the test pilots then used the thrust <b>reverser.</b> The control of the aircraft had not been jeopardized. The FAA accepted {{the results of the}} test.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} that the thrust <b>reverser</b> of the No. 2 (right side) engine {{activated}} during the climb , since one of the thrust reversers was seen {{to be in the}} deployed position in the wreckage. The investigation concluded that the position of the thrust <b>reverser</b> was a result of the accident, not a cause of it. If the <b>reverser</b> deployed during takeoff, and not as a result of impact, {{it has been suggested that}} the plane would have yawed suddenly to the right. Aircraft engineer Alberto Garcia dismissed this suggestion, pointing out that the MD-82 has tail-mounted engines positioned close to each other and to the plane's longitudinal axis, so that any yaw from asymmetric thrust would be small. Thrust reversers are normally employed just after touch down to reduce braking distances. Examination of the aircraft's maintenance logs showed that the thrust <b>reverser</b> on the right-side engine had been deactivated pending repair. It had been wired shut, and tape placed over the cockpit control to alert the crew. The MD-82 is permitted to fly with just one operable thrust <b>reverser.</b>|$|E
