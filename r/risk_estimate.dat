25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal <b>risk</b> <b>estimate)</b> compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target <b>risk</b> <b>estimate).</b> Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|E

Methods The study comprised 1, 753, 544 individuals, aged 20 – 35  years, and resident in Sweden 2004. They were followed 2005 – 2011 with regard to disability pension, sickness absence (≥ 90  days) and unemployment (≥ 180  days). Immigrants were born in Western countries (Nordic countries, EU, Europe outside EU or North-America/Oceania), or in non-Western countries (Africa, Asia or South-America). Mental disorders were grouped into seven subgroups based on a record of in- or specialised outpatient health care 2001 – 2004. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by Cox regression models with both fixed and time-dependent covariates and competing risks. We also performed stratified analyses with regard to labour-market attachment. Results Individuals with mental disorders had a seven times higher risk of disability pension, a two times higher risk of sickness absence, and a 20 % higher risk of unemployment than individuals without mental disorders. Individuals with personality disorders and schizophrenia/non-affective psychoses had highest <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> for having disability pension and long-term sickness absence, while the <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> of long-term unemployment were similar among all subgroups of mental disorders. Among persons with mental disorders, native Swedes had higher <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> for disability pension (HR: 6. 6; 95 %CI: 6. 4 – 6. 8) than Western immigrants (4. 8; 4. 4 – 5. 2) and non-Western immigrants (4. 8; 4. 4 – 5. 1), slightly higher <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> for sickness absence (2. 1; 2. 1 – 2. 2) than Western (1. 9; 1. 8 – 2. 1), and non-Western (1. 9; 1. 7 – 2. 0) immigrants but lower <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> for unemployment (1. 4; 1. 3 – 1. 4) than Western (1. 8; 1. 7 – 1. 9) and non-Western immigrants (2. 0; 1. 9 – 2. 1). There were similar <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> among sub-regions within both Western and non-Western countries.

We aimed to compare <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> of myocardial infarction (MI) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) by atherosclerotic risk factors during long follow-up using time-fixed analyses without and with correction for regression dilution and time-varying analyses. Methods The study included 5970 subjects {{enrolled in the}} fourth survey of the Tromsø Study (1994 / 95). Blood pressure, lipid levels, body mass index (BMI), diabetes and smoking status were measured at baseline, and subjects still alive at the fifth (2001 / 02, n = 5179) and sixth (2007 / 08, n = 4391) survey were re-measured. Incident events of MI (n = 714) and VTE (n = 214) were recorded until December 2010. Time-fixed and time-varying Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for MI and VTE adjusted for age and sex. Results Variations in BMI, blood pressure and lipid levels were small, and did not alter the <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> when time-varying analyses were compared to time-fixed analyses. For MI, variables that changed considerably over time yielded the greatest changes in <b>risk</b> <b>estimates</b> (HR for smoking changed from 1. 80 (95 % CI 1. 55 – 2. 10) to 2. 08 (95 % CI 1. 78 – 2. 42)).
