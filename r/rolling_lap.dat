5000|$|The song {{has since}} become almost a theme song for the sport of British Banger racing, where it is played {{at the start of}} many races at tracks across Great Britain, as the racers begin their <b>rolling</b> <b>lap.</b> The song is also used during parade laps of Banger races outside Great Britain, like in the Netherlands.|$|E
5000|$|The tune {{has been}} used in {{television}} advertisements for ING Direct in the UK, and as the <b>rolling</b> <b>lap</b> theme for the saloon stock car class in UK oval racing. It also featured in the films An Elephant Called Slowly (1969) and The Dish (2000). It is also used in a 2010-11 [...] "Become an Ex" [...] anti-smoking PSA for the Ad Council.|$|E

Established {{the relationship between the}} rolling pressure and the plastic deformation and residual stress of the fillet, and provided theoretical support for the evaluation and detection of the crankshaft rolling quality...|$|R

50|$|In 2011, Blissett {{took part}} in a celebrity motor race at the 2011 Silverstone Classic. He had a large crash on the opening <b>lap,</b> <b>rolling</b> the car several times. He was unhurt. Rick Parfitt Jnr won the race, with Heston Blumenthal second and Brendan Cole third. They were all raising money for the Bobby Moore fund for Cancer Research. From 2014, Blissett was racing an Alfa 156 in the BRSCC Alfashop Alfa Romeo Championship.|$|R

Was it outside that very house as I first set eyes upon him, <b>rolling</b> in the <b>lap</b> of luxury, when I was selling halfpenny ballads there for a living? And am I to grovel in the dust for HIM to walk over? No!' ...|$|R

40|$|Blue Planet Biophilia is a {{collection}} of final drawings, diagrams and renders that explore how water can be integrated into the workspace to benefit workers’ wellbeing. According to biologist E. O. Wilson, ‘Biophlia’ refers to an innate and genetically determined affinity of human beings with the natural world. These designs show how water can provide natural ventilation and a more ‘biophilic’ atmosphere. With sites in both London and Barcelona, Dechow focuses on designing spaces where the user is surrounded by both the physical presence and the natural acoustics of water. The final design shows an ocean-plastic recycling hub with an adjoining design studio on the coast of Barcelona. Giant cones bring the <b>rolling,</b> crashing and <b>lapping</b> acoustics of the water beneath the building up into the workspace, where designers can sit and work surrounded by ocean views, and the comings and goings of the Mediterranean fishermen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{roughness}} on the directional spectral emissivity {{as well as}} the directional and hemispherical total emissivities was systematically studied for the precious metals silver, gold, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and iridium in order to avoid or minimise the effect of oxidation and other chemical reactions. The microtopography of these surfaces, which were mechanically treated by <b>rolling,</b> turning, grinding, <b>lapping,</b> and polishing, and subjected to an appropriate thermal treatment to remove crystal structure defects caused by roughening, was characterised by roughness measurements yielding roughness profiles and their statistical characteristics such as roughness height, roughness transfer length, and average slope of surface elements. The emis-sivities were measured by radiometric techniques in the wavelength range 2. 5 mm to 51 mm and in the angular range 08 to 758 at a temperature of 150 8 C. The results of the emissivity and roughness measurements are discussed within the scope of the existing theories for the emissivity of rough surfaces. It was found that roughnesses with heights smaller than a fraction 0. 01 of the wavelength can still affect the radiative properties of the surface. However, the emissivity does not monotoni-cally increase with the roughness height but rather correlates with the slope of parts of the surface profile. For the same metal with different surface finish, the directional total emissivity was observed to vary by at most a factor of 20. These changes are much larger than those caused by structural defects due to roughening and should be attributed to the surface topography. ...|$|R
