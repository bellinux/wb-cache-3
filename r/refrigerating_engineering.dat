40|$|The <b>refrigerating</b> <b>engineering</b> is the {{youngest}} and simultaneously the most dynamically developing branch of the food-processing industry in Poland. It groups 16 companies having at their disposal 58 cold stores, which are distributed throughout the whole country (Fig. 1), In the area under survey this industry is represented by The <b>Refrigerating</b> <b>Engineering</b> Company in Łódź and by The Central Laboratory of the <b>Refrigerating</b> <b>Engineering</b> in Łódź. The Central Laboratory of the <b>Refrigerating</b> <b>Engineering</b> is a research and development centre. Its production of frozen foodstuffs constitutes a secondary-type activity, and it is carried out {{at the level of}} about 250 ton in The Experimental Plant of Frozen Foodstuffs. In the future the plant is to supply 800 ton of food products with the entire output being left in Poland. The <b>Refrigerating</b> <b>Engineering</b> Company in Łódź is the main producer and distributor of frozen foodstuffs in the nearby administrative provinces of Łódź, Piotrków, Sieradz, Płock, and Skierniewice. It has 3 cold stores with a total refrigeration capacity of 212 ton per day. The storage capacity of the company meets the demand of the region for frozen foodstuffs in 70 per cent. The company performs services in the field of storage and refrigeration of foodstuffs and produces between 6 and 7 thousand ton of frozen fruit and vegetables, readymade foodstuffs and ice-creams per year (Table 1). Its output goes in GO per cent to the domestic market, while export includes frozen fruit only (60 to 80 per cent of production). The company can process 25 to 30 per cent of the total quantity of goods while the remaining part is sent to other cold stores in Poland within the framework of co-operation. In turn, the se cold stores send between 3 and 5 thousand ton of their own products to The <b>Refrigerating</b> <b>Engineering</b> Company in Łódź. In this way the company is able to supply between 6 and 7 thousand ton of frozen foodstuffs a year to the above mentioned 5 administrative provinces. About 65 per cent of all frozen foodstuffs are sold in the administrative province of Łódź (Tables 5 and 6).

40|$|A {{test rig}} {{was built in}} the {{department}} of energy, in laboratory of <b>refrigerating</b> <b>engineering</b> for test runs with a lot of fluid and equipment of various kind for commercial refrigeration. The facility has been continuously improved during the past years and allows to perform experiments aiming to assess the performance characteristics both of conventional and new equipment for commercial refrigeration. In the test rig can be tested a lot of cooling loop filled with a secondary fluid for simulation of their behavior in industrial and commercial plants (e. g. : during exploitation in supermarket and hypermarket for refrigeration of foodstuffs in cold store, display cases and cabinets, etc.). The paper reports main results of the experiments performed with the new fluid R 422 A versus the original refrigerating fluid R 22...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} utilize clean energy such as solar energy to reduce {{electricity}} consumption in heating, ventilating, {{air conditioning and}} <b>refrigerating</b> (HVAC&R) <b>engineering,</b> the author developed a new style diffusion-absorption refrigerator (DAR) with solution pumps. It can be driven by low-temperature heat sources, in which LiNO 3 -NH 3 -He is used as working fluids and an adiabatic spray absorber with a plate-type solution cooler is designed to enhance the mass and heat transfer, respectively. This paper is mainly concern on the principle and operating performance of the DAR, especially the relationships of evaporator temperature (Te), absorber temperature (Ta) and parameters such as the volume flow rate and inlet temperature of LiNO 3 -NH 3 solution sprayed {{from the top of}} the adiabatic spray absorber. Based on measured data and theoretical analysis, the solution circulation ratio is also presented. Analyses indicate that in this DAR system, Te mainly depends on Ta rather than condenser temperature (Tc) and generator temperature (Tg). Thus Te and the performance of the DAR can be modulated by changing parameters of the sprayed solution. The results show that this DAR system can be driven by solar energy to meet the requirements of air conditioning, freezing or else. A typical operating experiment shows when temperatures of heat source (hot water temperature Tws), Tg, Ta and Tc are 92. 7 °C, 87. 0 °C, 29. 6 °C and 21. 6 °C, respectively, the lowest Te is - 13. 0 °C, the corresponding refrigeration capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) are 1. 9 kW and 0. 156, respectively...|$|R
