40|$|To {{determine}} the prevalence {{and cost of}} alternative medicines and alternative practitioner use in an Australian population. We conducted a representative population survey of persons aged 15 or older living in South Australia, which required 3004 personal interviews. We assessed the rates of use and types of alternative medicine and therapists used by this population in 1993, and correlations with other demographic and medical variables. The overall use {{of at least one}} non-medically prescribed alternative medicine (excluding calcium, iron and prescribed vitamins) was 48. 5 %. The users {{were more likely to be}} perimenopausal females, better educated, have a higher alcohol intake, be of normal weight and more likely to be employed than non-users. 20. 3 % of respondents had visited at least one alternative practitioner, most commonly chiropractors (15 %). The users of alternative practitioners were more likely to be younger, live in the country and be overweight. Women were more likely to consult naturopaths, iridiologists, and <b>reflexologists</b> than men. Extrapolation of the costs to the Australian population gives a natural expenditure in 1993, for alternative medicines, of $ 621 million (Australian dollars) and for alternative therapists of $AU 309 million per annum. This compares to the $AU 360 million of patient contributions for all classes of pharmaceutical drugs purchased in Australia in 1992 / 93. The public health and economic ramifications of these huge costs are questioned in view of the paucity of sound safety and efficacy data for many of the therapies and products of the alternative medicine industry.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesOutline the {{protocol}} {{to be used}} in the establishment of the Practitioner and Researcher Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) – an innovative national practice-based research network (PBRN) for complementary medicine (CM) professions in Australia. Design and methodsA multiphase research design will be employed. Phase 1 will involve geographical mapping of CM practitioner workforce population and location across Australia. Phase 2 involves initial practitioner member recruitment encompassing a preliminary workforce survey to allow population of key information for the PRACI database. Phase 3 will employ a comprehensive practitioner member survey which examines the nature and characteristics of contemporary CM practice. ResultsPRACI will be a multi-modality PBRN which encompasses 14 CM professions: acupuncturists, aromatherapists, Ayurveda practitioners, Bowen therapists, Chinese herbalists, homoeopaths, kinesiologists, massage therapists, musculoskeletal therapists, myotherapists, naturopaths, nutritionists (non-dietetic), <b>reflexologists,</b> Western herbalists, and yoga teachers. Once established, researchers will be able to utilise the PRACI network and infrastructure to undertake CM research which is embedded in, responsive to, and informed by clinical practice. An Expression of Interest (EOI) process by which potential new research through PRACI is vetted based upon feedback by researchers, community representatives and practitioner members. The PRACI network will enable a broad range of research designs including experimental, observational and qualitative research. As such, research conducted through PRACI will be able to examine important research questions and advance new knowledge about contemporary CM practice. ConclusionsPRACI is a practice-based research network which has the potential to offer the CM professions a legacy of clinically relevant research which is embedded in the realities of practice and which can provide a platform for future critical investigation and rigorous enquiry...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Constipation is {{a common}} problem in the UK, {{affecting}} up to 20 % of the population. <b>Reflexologists</b> claim that reflexology can be beneficial {{in the treatment of}} constipation. The aim of this exploratory pilot {{study was to determine the}} effectiveness of reflexology in treating idiopathic constipation in women and it is the first study of the effectiveness of reflexology for the treatment of women with idiopathic constipation defined according to Rome II criteria. Methods Nineteen female patients referred to a specialist biofeedback service with idiopathic constipation defined by Rome II criteria were recruited. A course of reflexology treatment (weekly for six weeks) was given. Patients' subjective perception of constipation was recorded as well as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), the Short form 36 (SF 36), whole gut transit and the Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (HCAMQ) before and after the intervention. Results All participants completed the intervention and none were lost to follow-up. Ninety-four percent of participants identified their constipation to be improved to some extent. Ten participants had improved colonic transit times and two patients had normalised colonic transit. Ten patients (53 %, p = 0. 19) demonstrated an improved anxiety score and 11 participants (58 %, p = 0. 14) demonstrated an improved depression score on the HAD scales. Improvement was seen in general health, mental health and vitality on the SF 36 scale, with vitality improving significantly (p < 0. 05). Sixty-three percent of participants had a more positive attitude (p = 0. 03) towards CAM and holistic health following treatment.

40|$|Objectives: Reflexology {{claims that}} the feet are {{representative}} of the body and that massage to specific points of the feet increases blood supply to "mapped" organs in the body. This review provides the first systematic evaluation of existing reflexology randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether there is any evidence to suggest the existence of a reflexology treatment-related hemodynamic effect; to examine whether reflexology researchers used study designs that systematically controlled for nonspecific effects in order to isolate this specific component; and to highlight some of the methodological challenges that need to be overcome to demonstrate specific and beneficial hemodynamic effects. Design: Fifty-two RCTs of reflexology published from 1990 to September 2011 were initially retrieved. Setting/Location: Cardiorespiratory Department, Highland Heartbeat Centre, Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. Subjects: Adult subjects. Interventions: Studies using reflexology foot massage techniques as the intervention versus sham reflexology treatment, simple foot massage, conventional treatment, or no treatment as the control were then selected.  Outcome measures: Outcome measures included any hemodynamic parameter potentially involved in the regulation of circulating blood volume and flow, including heart rate and systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure. Results: Seven RCTs suggested that reflexology has an effect on selected cardiovascular parameters; however, five of these delivered the reflexology intervention as a whole complex treatment, with the data collector often delivering the intervention themselves. Conclusions: This systematic review found that although reflexology has been shown to have an effect on selected hemodynamic variables, the lack of methodological control for nonspecific general massage effects means that there is little convincing evidence at this time to suggest the existence of a specific treatment-related hemodynamic effect. Furthermore, the review found that few studies of reflexology controlled for nonspecific effects in order to isolate any specific active component, despite the hemodynamic claim being {{a key part of the}} therapeutic value of reflexology. Therefore, further research approaches using more innovative designs and robust methods that can allow a treatment-induced, therapeutically beneficial hemodynamic effect to reveal itself are needed to help reflexology purchasers make a more informed decision about the safety and product quality of the reflexology hemodynamic claim and for <b>reflexologists</b> to be able to guarantee minimum product quality, validity, and safety standards in their practice...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure trends in the {{prevalence}} and cost of alternative medicines and alternative practitioner use in an Australian population and to obtain a profile of users and their beliefs. Methods. In 2000, we repeated a 1993 representative population survey of persons ages 15 years or older living in South Australia, which provided 3, 027 personal interviews. We assessed the rates of use, types of alternative medicine and therapists, costs, and beliefs of users and nonusers. Comparisons in usage patterns with the 1993 survey were also made. Findings. In 2000, the overall use of at least one nonmedically prescribed alternative medicine (excluding calcium, iron, and prescribed vitamins) was 52. 1 % (CI +/− 1. 8). Users were more likely to be female, be better educated, have a higher income, and be employed. Since 1993, females were using significantly more herbal medicines, ginseng, Chinese medicines, and aromatherapy oils. Many were self-prescribed. Among users, 57. 2 % (CI +/− 1. 2) did not tell their doctor. In 2000, 23. 3 % of respondents had visited at least one alternative practitioner with increasing use of acupuncturists, <b>reflexologists,</b> aromatherapists, and herbal therapists. Most thought alternative medicines were safe but thought they were, or should be, subject to the same standards as prescribed medicines. Among respondents, 92. 9 % wished product information to be of standard and content similar to those supplied with pharmaceuticals. Interpretation. Extrapolation of the costs to the Australian population gives an expenditure on alternative therapies in 2000 of $AUD 2. 3 billion and for the U. S. population an annual expenditure of $US 34 billion. In Australia this represents a 120 and 62 % increase in the cost of alternative medicines and therapists, respectively, since 1993. In 2000 expenditure on alternative therapies was nearly four times the public contribution to all pharmaceuticals. The public appears to have ambivalent standards for alternative therapies but wishes to be empowered with accurate information to facilitate self-prescription. The public health ramifications of an expanding alternative medicine industry are great. Alastair H. MacLennan, David H. Wilson, and Anne W. Taylor[URL]...|$|R

Subjective scores (describing symptoms,β 2 -inhalations and quality of life) and also bronchial sensitivity to histamine improved on both regimens, but no differences were found between groups receiving active or placebo reflexology. However, a trend in favour of reflexology became significant when a supplementary analysis of symptom diaries was carried out. It was accompanied by a significant pattern compatible with subconscious un-blinding, in that patients tended to guess which treatment they had been receiving.

40|$|There is an {{underlying}} need {{to gather information}} for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms of action, safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CAM. Once this information has been collected, the research needs to be distributed amongst healthcare professionals, the public and governing bodies. In my work, I looked at the range of German and UK general practitioners' attitudes toward CAM and medical students' CAM attitudes in the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Hong Kong. GPs' CAM attitudes did not differ across countries but a lack of information regarding safety and efficacy, as well as CAM training opportunities were criticized. CAM education was found to vary across countries due to different curricula and personal CAM use was a better predictor of CAM attitudes than was CAM exposure in the medical schools' curricula. I furthermore collected information on how CAM practitioners respond to specific patient and researcher health queries via e-mail. Medical herbalists, chiropractors, <b>reflexologists,</b> acupuncturists and homeopaths were contacted. lt was found that response rates to a fictitious patient were significantly higher than those given to a researcher. Some of the advice given online was interpreted as misleading or dangerous. Regulations for CAM practitioners dealing with potential clients' postal or online health queries should be put in place. I co-authored various systematic reviews, which summarize data from clinical trials and thus assessed the efficacy of mistletoe, co-enzyme Q 10, guided imagery acupuncture and Ukrain for cancer care and music therapy for cardiovascular conditions. To summarize these reviews I conclude that some CAM modalities play an important role as an adjunct to conventional medicine in palliative cancer care and are based on a non-specific effect. Specific effects of CAM for certain health conditions are rather small. There is a need to regulate how CAM information is distributed. More rigorous clinical trials need to be financed and carried out independently to assess CAM efficacy and safety in those CAM modalities where a specific effect is suspected and in others with non-specific effects possibly CAM therapist evaluations should be carried out. Further international regulations should be put in place regarding CAM education in medical schools and CAM training for healthcare professionals.

40|$|To {{provide a}} {{non-invasive}} treatment to promote relaxation {{and management of}} pain relief for women in labour. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Reflexology is a treatment in which the thumb or fingers of the practitioner are used to apply pressure to reflex points on a person’s hands or feet. By applying therapeutic pressure to the reflex points the body’s energy flow {{is thought to be}} unblocked, normalising blood and lymphatic flow in the body. 1 The potential benefits include increased energy levels, deep relaxation, reduced stress, improved circulation and an enhanced feeling of wellbeing. Scientific evidence is not available to explain the physiological effect of reflexology. 2 KEY POINTS 1. Scientific evidence is not available to establish the benefit of reflexology for women in labour. 3 2. Reflexology should not be performed on women in labour unless verbal consent is obtained.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between Pepper's (1942) worldview theory and health promoting behavior. Three hundred and twenty three college students at a medium-sized Midwestern state university were asked to complete a battery of inventories measuring worldview, health promoting behavior, socioeconomic status, alcohol consumption, demographic variables, and willingness to seek treatment from a variety of health service practitioners. It was hypothesized {{that there would be a}} positive relationship between worldview and health promoting behavior. Specifically, individuals endorsing an organismic worldview would engage in more health promoting behaviors than those endorsing a mechanistic worldview. It was also hypothesized that socioeconomic status and gender would be related to worldview and indirectly to health promoting behavior. Finally worldview was hypothesized to be related to subjects' willingness to seek treatment from a variety of "alternative" health providers. The data were analyzed by means of structural equation modeling using the SPSS and AMOS computer programs. The results of the study support the idea that a modest relationship exists between worldview and health promoting behavior. There was also a slight indirect effect of sex on health promoting behavior, with women more likely to endorse an organismic worldview and therefore more likely to engage in health promoting behavior than men. No relationship was found between socioeconomic status and health promoting behavior. In addition, significant correlations were found between certain health care providers over others. Specifically, an organismic worldview was significantly correlated with willingness to receive services from a <b>reflexologist,</b> a clinical or counseling psychologist, a herbalist, an aromatherapist, and a homeopath.
