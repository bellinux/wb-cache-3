50|$|The Curtisville {{area was}} one of the first parts of Glastonbury to be settled by English colonists, who had been using its riverfront meadows since the 17th century. Early land use in the area divided the area into narrow strips {{fronting}} on the river, with houses located on the terrace facing what is now Main Street. Salmon Brook was recognized as a source of water power in the colonial period, but its industrial development did not begin until the 1840s, when Oswin Welles began the manufacture of wooden wares and cigars. Brothers Frederick and Joseph Curtis established a major silver plating factory on the south bank of the brook around that time. Their endeavour was underfinanced and failed around 1860. The property was taken over by Thomas Vail, who manufactured rifles and single-shot pistols during the American Civil War. The property returned to silver plating when his business failed after the war ended. Tobacco continued to be a mainstay of agriculture in the area, and there was <b>regular</b> ferry and <b>barge</b> <b>service</b> at a wharf at the end of Pratt Street.|$|R
