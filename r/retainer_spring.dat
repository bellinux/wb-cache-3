25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the <b>retainer,</b> <b>spring</b> and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two efficient {{methods to}} calculate the unbalance vibration response of a flexible rotor provided with a squeeze-film damper (SFD) with <b>retainer</b> <b>springs.</b> Both methods are iterative and combine the harmonic balance and receptance approaches. The first method, called the modified iteration method (MIM), is suitable for predicting the three-dimensional mode shapes of a concentric SFD-rotor system. The second method, called the modified harmonic balance method (MHBM), is developed {{to calculate the}} non-linear vibration response of a flexible shaft provided with either a concentric or eccentric SFD. The system is also investigated experimentally under different conditions. The predictions computed by these methods are compared with experimental measurements and reasonably good agreement is obtained...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} {{improvement of}} the performances of squeeze film damper (SFD) for supporting the rotors of high-speed turbomachinery has been sought adopting a two lobe, wave (2 LW) geometry of the bearing bore. A statically unbalanced, symmetrical, rigid rotor supported with 2 LW-SFD has been theoretically examined through numerical continuation, assuming laminar, isoviscous oil flow within the damping film and incomplete centering action of the <b>retainer</b> <b>springs</b> mounted parallel to the film. Despite nonlinearity which still affects the system, the obtained results highlight {{the potential of the}} unconventional geometry as a mean for a possible reduction of the typical drawbacks in the response with conventional SFD, mainly consisting in undesired whirling motions with too large journal orbits and/or nonsynchronous character, so as to assure more safe conditions for the rotor operation. Yet, further theoretical and experimental investigation is desirable in order to confirm such an outcome...|$|R

The valve reed, cross shaped above its <b>retainer</b> <b>spring,</b> is still beryllium copper alloy, in this old engine. The glow plug is built into the cylinder head. Large production volume makes it possible to use a machined cylinder and an extruded crank case (cut away by hand in the example shown). These Cox Bee reed valve engines are notable for their low cost and ability to survive crashes. The components of the engine shown come from several different engines.|$|E

40|$|A {{flexible}} shaft with an overhung disc {{supported by the}} squeeze-film damper is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The system is simplified as a three-mass system based on a transfer matrix calculation. Governing equations for both models with and without <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> are derived. A fast integration method is used to obtain vibration responses. Both concentric and eccentric responses at the damper are examined. Different imbalances and different supply pressures are supplied to see their influence on the vibration of the system. It is found that for the system with <b>retainer</b> <b>spring,</b> positions of the resonance move between two extremes, {{one of which is}} the case with no damping in the system and the other with “full damping” where the SFD is locked-out and the system behaves exactly like one without a <b>retainer</b> <b>spring.</b> Therefore, improvements can be obtained by using a centralizing <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> and an accompanying SFD as resonance peaks can be moved to lower frequencies and/or such peaks can be kept down to reasonable limits.

40|$|PaperPg. 127 - 142. This study {{investigates the}} {{steady-state}} and transient {{response of the}} squeeze film damper bearing. Both the steady-state and transient equations for the hydrodynamic bearing forces are derived.

These coefficients are used to find the damper configuration which will provide the optimum support characteristics based on a stability analysis of the rotor-bearing system. The effects of end seals and caveated fluid film are included. The transient analysis of rotor-bearing systems is performed by coupling the dampening and rotor equations and integrating forward in time. The effects of unbalance, cavitation and <b>retainer</b> <b>springs</b> are included in the analysis. Methods of determining the stability of a rotor-bearing system under the influence of aerodynamic forces and internal shaft friction are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on solving the system characteristic frequency equation and stability maps produced using this method are presented.

40|$|A wedge {{and spring}} {{assembly}} {{for use in}} electromagnets or dynamoelectric machines having a housing with an axis therethrough and a plurality of coils supported on salient poles that extend radially inward from the housing toward the housing axis to define a plurality of interpole spaces, respectively between the housing and adjacent coils, the interpole spaces each extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge and spring assembly includes a nonmagnetic <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> and a nonmagnetic wedge. The <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> is formed to fit {{into one of the}} interpole spaces, and has juxtaposed ends defining between them a slit extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge for insertion into the slit provides an outwardly directed force on respective portions of the juxtaposed ends defining the slit to expand the slit so that respective portions of the <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> engage areas of the coils adjacent thereto, thereby resiliently holding the coils against their respective salient poles. Preferably, the spring retainer and wedge are self-locking wherein wedge is fabricated from a material softer than a material the <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> is fabricated from, so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit. The <b>retainer</b> <b>spring</b> is generally triangular shaped to fit within the interpole space and fabricated from berryllium-copper alloy, and the wedge is generally T-shaped and fabricated from aluminum.

40|$|A twin {{caliper brake}} system is {{investigated}} using {{the whole body}} visual technique of holographic interferometry. It is shown that the disc mode of vibration has a preferred position where a disc antinode is situated under one caliper and a disc node under the second caliper. The maximum angular space occupied by the pad antinode is, as predicted by the theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry, the angle subtended by the pad length. For a four- piston opposed caliper the minimum distance is slightly larger than the piston centers. There {{is evidence that the}} disc mode position, in relation to the two calipers, may be antinode/node, node/node or antinode/antinode. With these arrangements an accompanying revised theoretical study of the disc/pad interface geometry predicts two stable conditions are possible - if the calipers are positioned either at an angle between 125 to 130 or 165 to 175.

Apart from several minor improvements, such as a lightened bolt and carrier assembly to reduce the impulse of the gas piston and bolt carrier during firing, the rifle features a new glass-filled polyamide stock that retains the shape of the original AK-74 fixed laminated wood stock, but side-folds to the left like the skeletonized AKS-74 buttstock.

5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve <b>spring</b> <b>retainer</b> mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
