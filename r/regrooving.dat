40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that in most}} circumstances, some special treatment of an asphalt surface is required to improve aircraft braking in wet conditions. It is increasingly common for transverse grooves to be sawn in the runway surface for this purpose. Grooves introduce a number of potential distress mechanisms that are not present in an ungrooved surface including, rubber filling the grooves, reduction of groove depth due to surface erosion, groove edge break and groove closure. Groove loss by closure is the most concerning form of distress as this usually occurs early in the surface's life and cannot be corrected by re-sawing the grooves. Asphalt resurfacing and <b>regrooving</b> after removal of the closed grooves is required. In addition, maintenance activities such as crack filling, surface rejuvenation sprayed treatments, patching and resurfacing, require additional consideration when grooves are present. Despite the difficulties associated with grooves, sawing of grooves is now the most common method used for improving aircraft braking performance on wet asphalt runways...|$|E
