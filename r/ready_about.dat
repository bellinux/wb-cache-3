5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma rotors, and {{was used to determine}} the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was <b>ready</b> <b>about</b> 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.|$|E

60|$|After {{the colonel}} had {{finished}} this, he asked permission {{to take on}} a postscript about how he was being treated, so the railroad wouldn't feel uneasy in its bosom about him.

60|$|It {{is easy to}} see the New Paper {{had been}} set up overnight, and then large pieces of the stereo plates {{replaced}} subsequently. I do not know enough of the old methods of printing to know precisely what happened. The thing gives one an impression of large pieces of type having been cut away and replaced by fresh blocks. There is something very rough and <b>ready</b> <b>about</b> it all, and the new portions print darker and more smudgily than the old, except toward the left, where they have missed ink and indented.

6000|$|Yes, Doctor, that Lady {{in black}} is the Czarina; and {{has come a}} drive of twenty miles this morning; and done {{a great deal of}} {{business}} in Town,--one day before the set time. In her remote Apartment at Peterhof, this morning, between 2 and 3, she awoke to see Alexei Orlof, called oftener SCARRED Orlof (Lover GREGORY'S Brother), kneeling at her bedside, with the words, [...] "Madam, you must come: there is not a moment to lose!"--who, seeing her awake, vanished to get the vehicles <b>ready.</b> <b>About</b> 7, she, with the Scarred and her maid and a valet or two, arrived at the Guards' Barracks here,--Gregory Orlof, and others concerned, waiting to receive her, in the fit temper for playing at sharps. She has spoken a little, wept a little, to the Guards (still only half-dressed, many of them): [...] "Holy religion, Russian Empire thrown at the feet of Prussia; my poor Son to be disinherited: Alack, ohoo!" [...] Whereupon the Guards (their Officers already gained by Orlof) have indignantly blazed up into the fit Hurra-hurra-ing:--and here, since about 9 A.M., we have just been in the [...] "Church of St. Mary of Casan" [...] ("Oh, my friends, Orthodox Religion, first of all!") doing TE-DEUMS and the other Divine Offices, for the thrice-happy Revolution and Deliverance now vouchsafed us and you!
