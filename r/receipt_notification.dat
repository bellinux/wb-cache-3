40|$|Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) are a peer-topeer {{communication}} network {{that can be}} used to transmit data using a mobile or wireless link without the support of fixed infrastructure. A literature survey highlighted that the key characteristics of efficient MANET nodes are reputation value, residual battery level and energy consumption. Various MANET algorithms and routing techniques such as location aided routing, broadcasting, multicasting and energy efficient routing have been developed. MANET intelligent routing algorithm requirements include a range of characteristics. This paper proposes a new MANET routing algorithm that includes quadrant based opportunistic routing, an intelligent energy matrix and energy status request messages with packet <b>receipt</b> acknowledgement <b>notification.</b> In quadrant based routing packets are transmitted towards the quadrant that the destination resides within. The proposed algorithm uses an intelligent energy matrix that creates a look up table including the key characteristics: reputation value, residual battery level and energy consumption. The proposed algorithm balances the traffic uniformly across four intermediate nodes in any desired quadrant. The simulation results presented in this paper demonstrate that due to the inclusion of the energy matrix and quadrant based routing, the number of broadcast messages decreases, reducing data flooding, providing improved channel efficiency and improves bandwidth utilization. Load balancing also increases the lifetime of intermediate nodes which provides improved route stability. The proposed algorithm also includes packet <b>receipt</b> acknowledgement <b>notification</b> which guarantees end-to-end packet delivery and provides reliable MANET routing. Comparison with two other MANET broadcast algorithms identifies that a slower transmission speed is offset by the proposed routing algorithm providing higher energy efficiency, reliability and stability...|$|R

With {{the introduction of the}} World Wide Web 9 awareness of the existence of the Internet has exponentially increased over the last two years, and people are starting to realize that there is more to the Internet than just the Web. Companies are expanding their use of e-mail from internal to external. But the large set of proprietary, noninteroperable e-mail systems make this more of a trip through a jungle than a drive along the information highway. Most approaches to overcome the connectivity problems use gateways to convert between the proprietary format and the Internet standards. These conversions are lossy at best; hence, most proprietary system vendors are revamping their systems to base them on Internet standards. This paper summarizes {{the current state of the}} most important Internet standards related to e-mail and the general state of proprietary e-mail systems.

40|$|AIMS—To {{assess the}} effect on health visitor action of {{providing}} community health visitors with information on all injury attendances in children under 5 attending an accident and emergency (A&E) department and of providing additional information about each injury.  METHODS—Children under 5 years attending the A&E department at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham between October 1998 and April 1999 were studied, using a randomised controlled trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design. All attendances or selected attendances (all children under 1, burns and scalds, poisonings, head injuries, and repeat attendances in preceding six months) were notified. Provision of standard (diagnosis, circumstances surrounding injury, and disposal) or additional information (standard information plus place of injury, number of A&E attendances for injury in previous year, and any information recorded about safety equipment) was noted.  RESULTS—Many notifications (56 %) do not result in any action. Health visitors were nearly {{twice as likely to}} take action of some kind and three times as likely to undertake a home visit on <b>receipt</b> of <b>notifications</b> for selected attendances than on those for all attendances. A greater number of actions per notification were taken on receipt of information about selected attendances.

The utility of notifying all injury attendances is questionable, as many do not result in any action. ...|$|R

METHOD: We surveyed all notifications of Salmonella to the South Australian Department of Human Services between July 1995 and June 1996 We entered data onto an Epi Info 6. 02 database and calculated the time interval between {{various stages of}} typing notification. RESULTS: The median time taken between collection of a faecal specimen and <b>receipt</b> of serotype <b>notification</b> was 10 days (range, 5 – 38), while phage type notification took a further seven days (range 0 – 40). The time interval between collection of a specimen and notification of a Salmonella final identity was 14 days (range 6 – 49). The internal mail system of the Department of Human Services delayed notification a median of two days. Environmental Health Officers supplied reports for 224 (58 %) of 384 cases, 71 % of which occurred before the final Salmonella isolate was known. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the internal departmental mail system delayed the notification of Salmonella. In South Australia, investigations should focus on clusters of cases of known Salmonella identity, rather than all notified cases. IMPLICATIONS: To improve communicable disease investigations, health agencies should {{evaluate the}} timeliness of surveillance systems and examine the feasibility of transferring laboratory data electronically.

The authors undertook a survey to determine the views of patients and parents of patients about being notified that they or their child had received such blood products. METHODS: The study population consisted of 528 transfusion recipients, of whom 453 (85. 8 %) were under 16 years of age, notified by the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, of the CJD recalls in 1995 and 1996. Families attending an information session {{were asked to complete}} a self-administered questionnaire (85 cases). Ninety-seven families randomly selected from those who did not attend the session were interviewed by telephone. The questionnaire was adapted from a questionnaire used to evaluate families' responses to notification of transfusion and risk of HIV infection. RESULTS: More than 80 % of the respondents said they wanted to be notified and would want to be notified if there were another recall. On initial <b>receipt</b> of the <b>notification</b> about two-thirds of the respondents had been anxious, fearful or angry. There was no one method of conveying the information that suited all, but a personalized letter was seen as the most acceptable method.

40|$|Unintentional {{injuries}} in childhood {{are a major}} cause of mortality and morbidity. Numerous risk factors for unintentional injury have been identified over recent years, and there have been several suggestions that injury prevention programmes should be targeted at children identified as high risk, based on these risk factors. There has also been increasing interest in, and emphasis on, the role of members of the primary health care team in preventing unintentional injuries to children, including within recent government policy. There is some evidence, so far, that primary care interventions can be effective in reducing hazards, increasing knowledge and changing behaviour. There is however, less evidence that they can be effective in reducing injury frequency or severity, with very few studies of high quality addressing this issue. The objectives of the research presented in this thesis are: 1.) {{to examine the relationship between}} accident and emergency department attendance and future hospital admission following unintentional injury, and to consider the transmission of injury data between secondary and primary care and the uses of such data within primary care; 2.) to examine the associations between risk factors for childhood injury and a variety of injury outcomes and to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for risk factors in identifying children who will subsequently suffer an unintentional injury, and to consider high risk group and whole population strategies for injury prevention in the light of the findings; 3.) to assess knowledge, attitudes and current practices in childhood injury prevention amongst members of the primary health care team and to consider the implications of the findings for injury prevention in primary care. The first objective has been achieved by a matched case-control study. The main findings were that children who had been admitted to hospital following an unintentional injury were twice as likely to have previously attended the accident and emergency (A&E) department than community controls. However, only one third of hospital admissions had a history of previous A&E department attendance, hence most of the children admitted to hospital would not have been identified using A&E attendance. Current practice in many A&E departments is that a paediatric liaison health visitor notifies the community health visitor of children attending A&E following injury. Most authors in the field discuss post injury follow up visits as an appropriate response to <b>receipt</b> of such <b>notifications,</b> but there is little evidence for their effectiveness, and several studies show such visits are perceived to be difficult for both parents and health visitors. There is little evidence that, at present, injury data transmitted from secondary care is collated in a systematic way, to be used in primary care for needs assessment or injury surveillance. It is therefore recommended that the role of the paediatric liaison health visitor in the collection and transmission of injury data is in need of further consideration, and that post injury follow up visits require further study to demonstrate their effectiveness. The second objective has been achieved by a cross sectional survey followed by a cohort study. The main findings from this study are that only previous injury and male sex were associated with A&E department attendance and only previous injury with primary health care team attendance, despite sufficient power to demonstrate associations for several other risk factors. Consequently the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the risk factors in identifying children who will suffer previous injury was found to be low. The specificity was high for most risk factors, suggesting they will miss most children who will have injuries but will correctly identify most children who will not suffer future injury. The number of children needing to be targeted with an intervention to prevent one injury was similar for most risk factors, and similar to that if the whole population received an intervention. The results could not be adequately explained by bias, confounding or insufficient power Further work examining associations between risk fectors and unintentional injury in childhood is needed with larger sample sizes and in a population with a wide cross section of socioeconomic status to confirm these findings. At present, it is recommended that injury prevention programmes in primary care use a population approach. The third objective was achieved by a cross sectional survey of general practitioners, practice nurses and health visitors in Nottinghamshire. The main findings from this survey were that health visitors had a significantly higher score for knowledge of childhood unintentional injury epidemiology than general practitioners or practice nurses. They held significantly more positive attitudes to, and were undertaking significantly more injury prevention than, both general practitioners and practice nurses. Despite this both general practitioners and practice nurses held positive attitudes to at least some injury prevention activities. The activities most commonly undertaken were those using a preventive model of health education, for all professional groups. Activities involving empowerment or radical or political models of health education were used less often. There was little evidence of a systematic approach to injury prevention, with prevention occurring most often opportunistically. For all activities, and across all professional groups, a greater proportion of respondents agreed that an activity should be undertaken than actually undertook that activity, suggesting there may be barriers to undertaking injury prevention in primary care. The difference between the proportion agreeing an activity should be undertaken and doing so, was greatest for lobbying or campaigning and for collecting injury data. The conclusions from this study are that current injury prevention practice, which often uses a preventive model of health education, often as an isolated approach, and most often opportunistically, may not be the most effective strategy for reducing unintentional {{injuries in}} primary care. Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of primary health care team interventions offered systematically, using a combination of health education models and approaches. Such studies must address the barriers to injury prevention in primary care. The findings from this study suggest there is already some knowledge, and positive attitudes towards injury prevention, amongst at least some primary health care team members, on which to build interest in such future research.
