25|$|Irish {{people at}} home were facing {{discrimination}} from Great Britain based on the former's religion. Evictions only increased after {{the repeal of the}} British Corn Laws in 1846 and the new Encumbered Estates Act being passed in 1849 as well as the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> civil rights. There had been agrarian terrorism against landlords which these new laws were implemented to stop the retribution. Any hope for change was squashed with the death of Daniel O'Connell in 1847, the political leader championing for Ireland, and the failed rising of the Young Irelanders in 1848. More was to be gained by immigrating to America from Ireland and the 1848 discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada lured away more.|$|E
2500|$|Iliescu {{proposed}} multi-party {{elections and}} an [...] "original democracy". This is widely held to have meant {{the adoption of}} Perestroika-style reforms rather than the complete <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> institutions; it {{can be linked to}} the warm reception the new regime was given by Mikhail Gorbachev {{and the rest of the}} Soviet leadership, and the fact that the first post-revolutionary international agreement signed by Romania was with that country.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{the only}} US Navy ships {{that can produce}} enough {{electrical}} power to get desired performance are the Zumwalt-class destroyers; they can generate 78 megawatts of power, more than is necessary to power a railgun. [...] Engineers are working to derive technologies developed for the DDG-1000 series ships into a battery system so other warships can operate a railgun. Most current destroyers can spare only nine megawatts of additional electricity, while it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range [...] (i.e., to launch 32MJ projectiles {{at a rate of}} 10 shots per minute). Even if current ships, such as the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, can be upgraded with enough electrical power to operate a railgun, the space taken up on the ships by the integration of an additional weapon system may force the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> weapon systems to make room available. The first shipboard tests was to be from a railgun installed on an Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transport (EFT), but this was later changed to land based testing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{old stone}} work may only need {{cleaning}} or sandblasting, {{but it may}} need more. [...] Firstly, the building exterior (facade) needs to be inspected for unsafe conditions. [...] Next, the building walls need to be inspected for water leakages. [...] The most likely needs are mortar restoration (repointing), applying consolidants to the old stone, or replacing pieces of stone that are deteriorated (damaged) beyond the point of any repair. The repointing is the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> damaged mortar from the outer portion of the joint between stone units and its replacement by new mortar matching {{the appearance of the}} old. [...] The consolidants re-establish the original natural bonding between the stone particles that weathering has removed. [...] Deteriorated pieces of stone work are replaced with pieces of stone that match the original as much as possible. Exterior dimension stone will often change color after exposure to weather over time. For example, Indiana Limestone will weather from a tan to an attractive light yellow. Interior dimension stone can sometimes change its shade a little over time too. For both, it may not be possible to find an exact match, even from the original quarry. [...] Stone will often change its appearance from location to location in the same quarry. [...] If the dimension stone renovationist is truly fortunate, the original builder put aside some spare pieces of the stone for future need.|$|E

50|$|Section 17 was {{controversial}} {{because the}} issue of religious instruction also paralleled language issues, as Protestants were mainly anglophones, and most francophones were Roman Catholic.

Clifford Sifton resigned rather than support the initial draft of this provision, which he considered to be expanding the rights then in force under territorial law. A modified version of section 17 was included in the Act despite the protests and Sifton's resignation.|$|E
