40|$|A simple {{technique}} for calculating the error probability performance and associated noisy <b>reference</b> <b>loss</b> of practical unbalanced QPSK receivers is presented. The approach {{is based on}} expanding the error probability conditioned on the loop phase error in a power series in the loop phase error and then, keeping only the first few terms of this series, averaging this conditional error probability over the probability density function of the loop phase error. Doing so results in an expression for the average error probability {{which is in the}} form of a leading term representing the ideal (perfect synchronization references) performance plus a term proportional to the mean-squared crosstalk. Thus, the additional error probability due to noisy synchronization references occurs as an additive term proportional to the mean-squared phase jitter directly associated with the receiver's tracking loop. Similar arguments are advanced to give closed-form results for the noisy <b>reference</b> <b>loss</b> itself...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} deep {{learning}} in computer vision is mainly attributed to {{an abundance of}} data. However, collecting large-scale data is not always possible, especially for the supervised labels. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to utilize labeled data from a source domain to learn a model that generalizes to a target domain of unlabeled data. A large amount of existing work uses Siamese network-based models, where two streams of neural networks process the source and the target domain data respectively. Nevertheless, most of these approaches focus on minimizing the domain discrepancy, overlooking the importance of preserving the discriminative ability for target domain features. Another important problem in UDA research is how to evaluate the methods properly. Common evaluation procedures require target domain labels for hyper-parameter tuning and model selection, contradicting {{the definition of the}} UDA task. Hence we propose a more reasonable evaluation principle that avoids this contradiction by simply adopting the latest snapshot of a model for evaluation. This adds an extra requirement for UDA methods besides the main performance criteria: the stability during training. We design a novel method that connects the target domain stream to the source domain stream with a Parameter <b>Reference</b> <b>Loss</b> (PRL) to solve these problems simultaneously. Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed PRL not only improves the performance on the target domain, but also stabilizes the training procedure. As a result, PRL based models do not need the contradictory model selection, and thus are more suitable for practical applications.

40|$|Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCFs) have {{attracted}} considerable attention of research communities and industries for peculiar propagation characteristics and prove to have {{wide range of}} applications, such as security, sensing, high power fiber laser, and communications, in wide range of frequency regions from visible, infrared, to THz frequency. The optical properties of materials in PCF can be controlled by proper design of the fiber cross-section. Among wide area of PCF applications, the PhD activity mainly focus on two interesting applications of PCF: high power fiber laser in IR region and low-loss waveguiding in THz region. The applications will be presented in relation {{with the kind of}} PCF designs. Large Pitch PCF, short called by Large Pitch Fiber (LPF), a hexagonal PCF structure, enable the large mode area and achieves the delocalization property of higher order modes, granted high output power and good beam quality. The properties are maintained even by scaling the whole structure to obtain the large mode area. In the mid-infrared range of 2 µm - 3 µm, the doublecladding silica based PCF with 80 µm-core and reduced cladding symmetry has been investigated, aiming to obtain robust single mode guiding even at high power load of fiber lasers. Single mode propagation with effective area larger than 2500 µm(2) has been demonstrated at heat load of 340 W/m. For THz region, the PCF obtained by arranging N dielectric tubes made by Zeonex plastic material in a circular pattern has been designed and optimized for flexible low-loss waveguiding of terahertz application. The fibers guide through inhibited coupling. Using the FEM, the scaling laws of confinement loss and absorption loss of the fibers have been numerically investigated with the purpose to obtaine design guidelines for small and flexible low-loss THz waveguides. By choosing the a total reference value of 10 dB/m, a remarkable transmission band of about an octave, ranging from 0. 7 THz to 1. 3 THz, is obtained with number of tubes 16 and tube thickness 100 µm. By reducing the <b>reference</b> <b>loss</b> value as low as 1 dB/m the maximum band of 280 GHz is obtained with number of tubes 14, ranging from 0. 94 THz to 1. 22 THz. The bandwidth can be further increased around one and half larger by reducing tube thickness to 90 µm and applying touchless cladding tubes...|$|E

40|$|Much {{research}} suggests that consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of value are frequently articulated relative to a reference level; options are valued as gains and losses relative to a <b>reference</b> point. Moreover, <b>losses</b> from this <b>reference</b> point are weighed more heavily than equivalent gains. This asymmetry has been termed loss aversion. This dissertation examines the effects of <b>reference</b> dependence and <b>loss</b> aversion on the processes and outcomes of choice among multiattribute options in multialternative choice sets. Based on past research, we propose that consumers often designate one brand in the choice set as a reference brand and then evaluate, in a loss averse manner, the attractiveness of competing brands as gains and <b>losses</b> from this <b>reference</b> brand. In a set of two experimental studies, we propose and test hypotheses regarding the effects of reference dependence on choice outcomes and processes. Specifically, we examine how loss aversion affects preferences within two and three alternative efficient choice sets. Moreover, we investigate a loss aversion based explanation for the attraction effect. In terms of the choice process, we examine how <b>reference</b> dependence and <b>loss</b> aversion affect information search, and whether these process-level changes mediate reference-dependent preferences. In line with previous evidence, we find that in efficient choice sets, reference status enhances a brand 2 ̆ 7 s attractiveness. A similar reference effect is obtained for the dominating option in asymmetrically dominated choice sets. Moreover, we find some support for our account of the attraction effect that hinges on aggregate reference brand relocations and loss aversion. Based on information acquisition patterns, {{we find that the}} perceptual phenomena of <b>reference</b> dependence and <b>loss</b> aversion have specific cognitive processing analogs. Compared to a control condition, more attention is paid to <b>reference</b> and <b>loss</b> information. Similarly, more comparisons are made involving <b>reference</b> and <b>loss</b> information. In addition, we find some evidence for a process-level mediation of reference-dependent preferences. We conclude that a reference dependence can change the processes and outcomes of consumer choice in systematic and predictable ways. The implications of such reference-dependent choice behavior for consumers and marketers are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} four {{problems in the}} context of Internet traffic control. The first problem is to understand when and why a sender that implements an equation-based rate control would be TCP-friendly, or not—a sender is said to be TCP-friendly if, under the same operating conditions, its long-term average send rate does not exceed that of a TCP sender. It is an established axiom that some senders in the Internet would need to be TCP-friendly. An equation-based rate control sender plugs-in some on-line estimates of the loss-event rate and an expected round-trip time in a TCP throughput formula, and then at some points in time sets its send rate to such computed values. Conventional wisdom held that if a sender adjusts its send rate as just described, then it would be TCP-friendly. We show exact analysis that tells us when we should expect an equation-based rate control to be TCP-friendly, and in some cases excessively so. We show experimental evidence and identify the causes that, in a realistic scenario, make an equation-based rate control grossly non-TCP-friendly. Our second problem is to understand the throughput achieved by another family of send rate controls—we termed these "increase-decrease controls," with additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease as a special case. One issue that {{we consider}} is the allocation of long-term average send rates among senders that adjust their send rates by an additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease control, in a network of links with arbitrary fixed routes, and arbitrary round-trip times. We show what the resulting send rate allocation is. This result advances the state-of-the-art in understanding the fairness of the rate allocation in presence of arbitrary round-trip times. We also consider the design of an increase-decrease control to achieve a given target loss-throughput function. We show that if we design some increase-decrease controls under a commonly used <b>reference</b> <b>loss</b> process—a sequence of constant inter-loss event times—then we know that these controls would overshoot their target loss-throughput function, for some more general loss processes. A reason to study the design problem is to construct an increase-decrease control that would be friendly to some other control, TCP, for instance. The third problem that we consider is how to obtain probabilistic bounds on performance for nodes that conform to the per-hop-behavior of Expedited Forwarding, a service of differentiated services Internet. Under the assumption that the arrival process to a node consists of flows that are individually regulated (as it is commonplace with Expedited Forwarding) and the flows are stochastically independent, we obtained probabilistic bounds on backlog, delay, and loss. We apply our single-node performance bounds to a network of nodes. Having good probabilistic bounds on the performance of nodes that conform to the per-hop-behavior of Expedited Forwarding, would enable a dimensioning of those networks more effectively, than by using some deterministic worst-case performance bounds. Our last problem is on the latency of an input-queued switch that implements a decomposition-based scheduler. With decomposition-based schedulers, we are given a rate demand matrix to be offered by a switch in the long-term between the switch input/output port pairs. A given rate demand matrix is, by some standard techniques, decomposed into a set of permutation matrices that define the connectivity of the input/output port pairs. The problem is how to construct a schedule of the permutation matrices such that the schedule offers a small latency for each input/output port pair of the switch. We obtain bounds on the latency for some schedulers that are in many situations smaller than a best-known bound. It is important to be able to design switches with bounds on their latencies in order to provide guarantees on delay-jitter...|$|E

Over-consumption has been {{proven to be a}} main cause of environmental degradation, and a shift to sustainable consumption practices is needed. Yet research has found that despite knowledge of environmental issues, and a supportive attitude, pro-environmental behaviour amongst consumers is lacking, with a key influence being the lack of personal utility found in the pro-environmental choice. This study attempts to contribute to narrowing the knowledge attitude practice gap in this domain, by using message framing to isolate the personal utility available in a sustainable choice, thereby influencing a pro-environmental outcome. A study was conducted to determine the main and interaction effects of various salient message frames (<b>reference</b> dependence, <b>loss</b> aversion and time sensitivity) on behavioural intention within sustainable consumption context. Environmental attitude was also tested to ascertain the interaction effect of this variable with the other independent variables and the resultant impact on the choice made.
