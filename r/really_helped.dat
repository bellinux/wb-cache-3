[...] Bunn credits Arrington with helping to alter the band's focus: [...] "We were playing music for God, but we didn't really know why we were doing it. [...] It was more so to be 'rock stars', per se, and just use God {{as a way to}} get there. [...] And so he <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> us flip-flop that and get it the way it should be." ...|$|E

[...] He's good at helping me make a quick decision. I really trust his opinion because he makes great records.|$|E

Having a positive attitude probably sounds like a corny thing to say, but a positive attitude <b>really</b> <b>helps,</b> and respecting your job <b>really</b> <b>helps,</b> and having the support of your family and friends <b>really</b> <b>helps.</b>|$|R

Her role was originally set for Nicole Kidman, who dropped out over scheduling conflicts with The Hours.

But it <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> to see the scenes for myself. At Lewes, we actually walked along the same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed. It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs, gazing out upon the same view that he would have seen".|$|E

Besides the laughing man, she included her primary school, her apartment and a sandwich store where she used to work. Stead also added memories of herself acting mean without reason. Slowly the novel became [...] "more and more about these ordinary mysteries of life and less about the fantastic time-travel-y one". After developing the basic idea, Stead began researching the science behind time travel to make sure her ideas would be logical. She asked her father for help with the science and complicated technical aspects, since he enjoyed mathematical puzzles. As they talked about time travel, Stead [...] "just kept falling into the same hole with the logic, and he <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> me straighten it out".|$|E

West gave it a grade of [...] "A–", and wrote, [...] "This was such big fun and the backup guys ... <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> amp it up." [...] Slezak was less enthusiastic about the sequence. He was critical of Salling's vocals, and felt that a heavy metal song was not suited to his stylings; he ultimately gave it a [...] "C+" [...] grade.

Chris Buck later commented that getting the actresses in together as much as they could helped add the real, amazing chemistry between them and made them really interact. Bell's recording sessions were completed while she was pregnant, and later she had to re-record some of the lines after giving birth, as her voice had deepened. After watching the completed film, Bell described her performance as [...] "cool and weird and surreal and jarring", saying that she was really proud that Anna [...] "came out like she did that [...] let [...] do her like this." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1976, {{at the age}} of 17, Eaton {{made his}} debut in NWA Mid-America. He entered his first match, a loss to Bearcat Wright, as a last-minute {{substitute}} for Wright's absent opponent. He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship. [...] Gulas decided to [...] "promote" [...] Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches later in the show, closer to the main event. The angle that <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> elevate Eaton's name up the card in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team The Hollywood Blonds (Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts). Eaton fought the Blonds with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and [...] "Pistol" [...] Pez Whatley.

Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it felt a little bit rushed.

[...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|According to Gough, Justin Hartley was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to play the}} role of Oliver Queen, and his alter ego Green Arrow. Oliver was {{designed}} to provide an alternative view for what it means to be a hero. At the same time, the producers wanted a character that could impact the lives of both Clark and Lois. The actor is also the first to portray Oliver Queen/Green Arrow in any live-action media. Hartley believed that it was the season six episode [...] "Reunion" [...] that <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> him to understand his character. In the episode, it is revealed that Oliver was [...] "a jerk to Lex" [...] when the two were at school together, and after another kid falls into a coma because of Oliver and Lex's actions, Oliver decides to start a new path for himself. According to Hartley, this allowed the actor to [...] "justify why someone would put their life in danger every night and have such strong feelings about going out and being this social advocate". Hartley was a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons, but became a series regular in season eight.|$|E

Taylor told Inside Soap's Allison Maund that Charlie's advice <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> Toyah to start getting back on her feet. However, the process was hampered when Toyah received an anonymous phone call, which left her feeling [...] "extremely frightened". The phone call sparked [...] "a terrifying event" [...] in which Toyah's rapist was finally revealed to be her friend Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). When Phil came round to comfort Toyah, she recognised his voice as he called out her name and realised that he was her rapist. While Toyah tried to escape, Phil grabbed her and held her hostage. Toyah's screams were heard by Peter, who broke the door down and knocked Phil unconscious. A show spokesperson commented that Toyah would be left to worry about whether Phil would deny the rape and be convicted.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{entering}} the Marseille youth academy, Nasri quickly impressed. Upon moving to Bastide, where the club's youth players reside, {{his style of}} play began to take shape. In 2007, Nasri admitted that the move to Bastide <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> his game, stating, [...] "That's where I really started to progress.

[...] As {{a result of his}} quick progression, Nasri {{was an integral part of}} every youth team he was a part of winning several trophies, such as the Championnat de Provence, Coupe de Provence, and the Ligue de la Méditerranée. After spending most of the 2003–04 season playing with the club's under-18 team, for the latter part of the season, the now 16-year-old Nasri was promoted to the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. He appeared primarily as a substitute in a few matches during the campaign as the reserve team failed to rebound from its bad start to the season, which resulted in a 16th-place finish and relegation to the Championnat de France amateur 2.|$|E
500|$|Weiland {{announced}} in 2005 that Velvet Revolver's next album would be titled Libertad {{and would be}} a concept album. When they started writing material, they decided against the concept idea. Initially, the band started working with producer Rick Rubin on the album. However, due to his methods, such as having a crew {{to do the work}} and engineering while only popping in occasionally, and {{due to the fact that}} he was also working with other bands at the same time, they decided against continuing with Rubin. At the suggestion of Weiland, Velvet Revolver began working with Brendan O'Brien. Slash stated that O' Brien [...] "brought more than just discipline to the equation, he brought a musicality that stems from the fact that he plays guitar, bass and drums. At any given moment he could play along [...] and it <b>really</b> <b>helped</b> the process." [...] While writing for the album, Weiland believed that his band mates were going to reunite with Guns N' Roses when the band's manager was talking to Axl Rose about switching management companies, and were not going to record their second album. He was later convinced by the band that this was not the case.|$|E

Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call.
