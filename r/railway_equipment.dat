5|$|While other closed {{stations}} on {{the former}} MR lines north of Aylesbury were generally demolished or sold, in 1969 the Quainton Railway Society was formed to operate a working museum at the station. On 24 April 1971 the society absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking custody of its collection of historic <b>railway</b> <b>equipment.</b> The station was maintained in working order and used as a bookshop and ticket office, and the sidings—still intact, although disconnected from the railway line in 1967—were used for locomotive restoration work.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 the Quainton Road Society {{was formed}} {{with the aim}} of {{preserving}} the station. In 1971, it absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking over its collection of historic <b>railway</b> <b>equipment.</b> The station was fully restored and reopened as a museum, the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. In addition to the original station buildings, the museum has also acquired the former Oxford Rewley Road railway station and a London Transport building from Wembley Park, both of which have been reassembled on the site. Although no scheduled trains pass through Quainton Road, the station remains connected to the railway network. Freight trains still use this line, and passenger trains still call at the station for special events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.|$|E

The main advantage of our approach is that it offers a well known and user friendly interface: a web browser (such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer). In addition, it gives the possibility for remote diagnosis and monitoring <b>railway</b> <b>equipments.</b> Thus experts, not necessarily on site in the depot, can make diagnosis and detect faulty components. They can inspect, more than one vehicle at a time, directly from their office. The onboard communication system and related network management services provide a unified entry point to the train data for diagnosis. We have built an automatic configuration approach for such a maintenance system. As a result, this maintenance system can be installed [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Historically, many narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{were built}} {{as part of}} specific industrial enterprises and were primarily industrial railways rather than general carriers. Some common uses for these industrial narrow-gauge railways were mining, logging, construction, tunnelling, quarrying, and the conveying of agricultural products. Extensive narrow-gauge networks were constructed {{in many parts of}} the world for these purposes. For example, mountain logging operations in the 19th century often used narrow-gauge railways to transport logs from mill sites to market. Significant sugarcane railways still operate in Cuba, Fiji, Java, the Philippines, and Queensland. Narrow-gauge <b>railway</b> <b>equipment</b> remains in common use for the construction of tunnels.|$|E

25|$|Rail {{transport}} modelling uses {{a variety}} of scales (ratio between {{the real world and}} the model) to ensure scale models look correct when placed next to each other. Model railway scales are standardized worldwide by many organizations and hobbyist groups. Some of the scales are recognized globally, while others are less widespread and, in many cases, virtually unknown outside their circle of origin. Scales may be expressed as a numeric ratio (e.g. 1/87 or 1:87) or as a letter defined in rail transport modelling standards (e.g. HO, OO, N, O, G, TT and Z.) The majority of commercial model <b>railway</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers base their offerings on Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen (NEM) or National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) standards in most popular scales.|$|E
25|$|Extreme flood events often {{result from}} {{coincidence}} such as unusually intense, warm rainfall melting heavy snow pack, producing channel obstructions from floating ice, and releasing small impoundments like beaver dams. Coincident events may cause extensive flooding {{to be more}} frequent than anticipated from simplistic statistical prediction models considering only precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels. Debris modification of channel geometry is common when heavy flows move uprooted woody vegetation and flood-damaged structures and vehicles, including boats and <b>railway</b> <b>equipment.</b> Recent field measurements during the 2010–11 Queensland floods showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by velocity and water depth fluctuations.
