50|$|Among several unusual {{properties}} of this postulated superconductivity of the vacuum {{is that it}} would, unlike previously known superconductivity, be expected to persist at temperatures {{of at least a}} billion, perhaps billions of degrees. Chernodub sees a possible explanation of his results in the quarks and antiquarks constituting the <b>rho</b> <b>mesons</b> being forced to move only along the magnetic field lines, which would render the <b>rho</b> <b>mesons</b> far more stable. The effective mass of the <b>rho</b> <b>mesons</b> would be lowered to zero, enabling them to condense and move freely, due to an interaction of their spins with the external magnetic field. The apparently strange situation that a current should flow without a carrier is {{explained by the fact that}} a vacuum is never truly empty.|$|R
25|$|Experimentally it is {{seen that}} the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the <b>rho</b> <b>meson).</b> The most convincing {{evidence}} for SSB of the chiral flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with chiral perturbation theory. The internal consistency of this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by chiral perturbation theory.|$|E

50|$|Chernodub found, on {{the basis}} of the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), that charged <b>rho</b> <b>mesons</b> — charged virtual {{particles}} popping into and out of being in a vacuum — can linger long enough to become real in a magnetic field of 1016 Tesla or more.

5000|$|Thus, the {{lifetime}} of a particle is the direct inverse of the particle's resonance width.

50|$|In the De Rujula - Georgi - Glashow {{description}} of hadrons, the rho mesons {{can be interpreted}} as a bound state of a quark and an anti-quark and is an excited version of the pion. Unlike the pion, the <b>rho</b> <b>meson</b> has spin j = 1 (a vector meson) and a much higher value of the mass. This mass difference between the pions and rho mesons is attributed to a large hyperfine interaction between the quark and anti-quark.

5000|$|The {{second term}} {{establishes}} the characteristic {{size of the}} lowest-energy soliton solution; it determines the effective radius of the soliton. As {{a model of the}} nucleon, it is normally adjusted so as to give the correct radius for the proton; once this is done, other low-energy properties of the nucleon are automatically fixed, to within about 30% accuracy. It is this result, of tying together what would otherwise be independent parameters, and doing so fairly accurately, that makes the Skyrme model of the nucleon so appealing and interesting. Thus, for example constant [...] in the quartic term is interpreted as the vector-pion coupling [...] between the <b>rho</b> <b>meson</b> (the nuclear vector meson) and the pion; the skyrmion relates the value of this constant to the baryon radius.|$|E
5000|$|The Vector Meson Dominance model still {{sometimes}} makes {{significantly more}} accurate predictions of hadronic decays of excited light mesons involving photons than subsequent models {{such as the}} relativistic quark model for the meson wave function and the covariant oscillator quark model.
