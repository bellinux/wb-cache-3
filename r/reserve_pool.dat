25|$|Vesicles in {{the nerve}} {{terminal}} are grouped into three pools: the readily releasable pool, the recycling pool, and the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool.</b> These pools are distinguished by their function and {{position in the}} nerve terminal. The readily releasable pool are docked to the cell membrane, making these {{the first group of}} vesicles to be released on stimulation. The readily releasable pool is small and is quickly exhausted. The recycling pool is proximate to the cell membrane, and tend to be cycled at moderate stimulation, so that the rate of vesicle release is the same as, or lower than, the rate of vesicle formation. This pool is larger than the readily releasable pool, but it takes longer to become mobilised. The <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> contains vesicles that are not released under normal conditions. This <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> can be quite large (~50%) in neurons grown on a glass substrate, but is very small or absent at mature synapses in intact brain tissue.|$|E

25|$|Neurotransmitter {{release is}} {{dependent}} on an external supply of Ca2+ ions which enter axon terminals via voltage-gated calcium channels. Vesicular fusion with the terminal membrane and release of the neurotransmitter {{is caused by the}} generation of Ca2+ gradients induced by incoming action potentials. The Ca2+ ions cause the mobilization of newly synthesized vesicles from a <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> to undergo this membrane fusion. This mechanism of action was discovered in squid giant axons. Lowering intracellular Ca2+ ions provides a direct inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release. After release of the neurotransmitter occurs, vesicular membranes are recycled to their origins of production. Calcium ion channels can vary depending on the location of incidence. For example, the channels at an axon terminal differ from the typical calcium channels of a cell body (whether neural or not). Even at axon terminals, calcium ion channel types can vary, {{as is the case with}} P-type calcium channels located at the neuromuscular junction.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{examines}} the behaviour of rupiah {{over the last eight years}} (1995 - 2003) to ascertain whether in fact there is specific evidence of a return to de facto US dollar peg in Indonesia. While we fail to find strong evidence to suggest Indonesia has reverted to the extent of dollar pegging that was undertaken pre-crisis, there are indications that the fluctuations of the US dollar have increasingly influenced the movements of rupiah, especially since 2000. Given the apparent gradual tendency towards a Â“hardeningÂ” of the exchange rate, there is consequently an increasing need to maintain a sizeable level of international reserves to support the peg. The next question that arises naturally from this is whether there is any way in which the benefits from holding reserves may be obtained without the need for Indonesia to continue to accumulate them.

The paper analyzes the trade structure of ASEAN and China in terms of both geographic sources of imports and markets for exports, and of the commodity structure of trade. The similarities of the geographic and commodity trade structures across the region are consistent with adoption of a common currency basket for stabilization, and with an argument for monetary integration across the region along the lines of Mundell (1961) on optimum currency areas.

The next year, 150 Breguet 19 biplane light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft were purchased on credit from the French government, signalling the first significant expansion of the air force. The new aircraft were assembled at Novi Sad, then distributed to the other military aerodromes at Sarajevo, Mostar, Zagreb and Skopje. The Ikarus plant was producing training aircraft and seaplanes using Austrian engines captured at the end of World War I, and imported steel tubing and wire stays.
