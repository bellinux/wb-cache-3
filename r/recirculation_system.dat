5|$|Zirconium binds urea, a {{property}} {{that has been}} utilized extensively {{to the benefit of}} patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and <b>recirculation</b> <b>system</b> known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.|$|E
25|$|Emissions are {{inherent}} to the combustion of diesel fuels that are {{regulated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process, {{in order to ensure}} E.P.A. compliance a fuel system must be capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The exhaust gas <b>recirculation</b> <b>system,</b> E.G.R., and the diesel particulate filter, D.P.F., are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions.|$|E
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas <b>recirculation</b> <b>system.</b> Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E

40|$|<b>Recirculation</b> <b>systems</b> create unique {{environments for}} fish culture. Opportunistic {{microorganisms}} may cause disease due to favorable conditions occurring in <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems.</b> The biofilters used may become reservoirs of infectious microorganisms. Stressful {{conditions such as}} suspended solids in culture tanks and high rearing densities may contribute to disease outbreaks.

2500|$|In 1991, the ZR-1 {{and base}} model {{received}} updates to body work, interior, and wheels. The rear convex fascia {{that set the}} 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model {{found its way to}} all models, making the high-priced ZR-1 even less distinguishable. Further changes were made in 1992, including extra ZR-1 badges on the fenders and the introduction of Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR) or traction control. For model year 1993, Lotus design modifications were made to the cylinder heads, exhaust system and valvetrain of the LT5, bringing horsepower up from 375 to 405. In addition, a new exhaust gas <b>recirculation</b> <b>system</b> improved emissions control. [...] The model remained nearly unchanged into the 1995 model year, after which the ZR-1 was discontinued as the result of waning interest, development of the LS series engines, cost and the coming of the C5 generation.

Not until the debut of the C5 platform Z06 in 2001 would Chevrolet have another production Corvette capable of matching the ZR-1's performance.|$|E
5000|$|Recirculation systems: Since a {{tankless}} {{water heater}} is inactive when hot water is not being used, they are incompatible with passive (convection-based) hot water <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems.</b> They may be incompatible with active hot water <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems</b> and certainly use more energy to constantly heat water within the piping, defeating one of a {{tankless water heater}}'s primary advantages. On-demand recirculating pumps are often used to minimize hot water wait times from tankless water heaters and save water being wasted down the drain. On-demand recirculating pumps are activated by push-button or other sensor. A water contacting temperature probe installed at the hot water usage point signals the pump to stop. Single-cycle pumping events only occur when hot water is needed thereby preventing the energy waste associated with constantly heating water within piping.|$|R

40|$|The HVAC {{systems in}} {{cleanroom}}s may use 50 {{percent or more}} of the total cleanroom energy use. Fan energy use accounts for a significant portion (e. g., over 50 %) of the HVAC energy use in cleanrooms such as ISO Classes 3, 4, or 5. Three types of air-handling systems for recirculating airflows are commonly used in cleanrooms: (1) fan-tower systems with pressurized plenum, (2) ducted HEPA systems with distributed-fans, and (3) systems with fan-filter units. Because energy efficiency of the <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems</b> could vary significantly from system type to system type, optimizing aerodynamic performance in air <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems</b> appears to be a useful approach to improve energy efficiency in cleanrooms. Providing optimal airflows through careful planning, design and operation, including air change rate, airflow uniformity, and airflow speed, is important for controlling particle contamination in cleanrooms. In practice, the use of fan-filter units (FFUs) in the air-handling system is becoming more and more popular because of this type of system may offer a number of advantages. Often modular and portable than traditional <b>recirculation</b> airflow <b>systems,</b> FFUs are easier to install, and can be easily controlled and monitored to maintain filtration performance.

40|$|As {{environmental}} regulations become more stringent, environmentally sound waste management and disposal {{are becoming increasingly}} more important in all aquaculture operations. One of the primary water quality parameters of concern is the suspended solids concentration in the discharged effluent.

For <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems,</b> the proposed TSS limitations would have applied to solids polishing or secondary solids removal technology. The new rules and regulations from EPA (August 23, 2004) require only qualitative TSS limits, {{in the form of}} solids control Best Management Practices (BMP), allowing individual regional and site specific conditions to be addressed by existing state or regional programs through NPDES permits. In <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems,</b> microscreen filters are commonly used to remove the suspended solids from the process water.

With all methods except direct plating Phytophthora spp. could be detected in the four nurseries.
