5|$|On 5 June 2014, the Geographic Names Committee {{decide to}} rename the roads that connect Forrest Highway to Bunbury – part of Old Coast Road {{as well as}} Australind Bypass – {{as part of the}} highway. The <b>renaming</b> had been {{proposed}} in 2013 due to public confusion over the three names used for the route to Bunbury: Forrest Highway to Lake Clifton, Old Coast Road from there to north of Australind, and then Australind Bypass.

Changes to the road signs were expected to be completed by mid-July.
