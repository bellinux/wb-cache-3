5000|$|The winter road is {{constructed}} by Nuna Logistics and RTL-Robinson every January and takes {{about six weeks}} to complete. The first vehicle along each season is a Swedish-made Hägglund army-type reconnaissance vehicle designed to float if it falls through the ice; it tows an ice-thickness-detecting sonar. This is followed by <b>road</b> <b>building</b> <b>equipment</b> including [...] "specialized low ground pressure equipment". The road, built extra wide to avoid blockages during blizzards and to allow opposing trucks to pass, is kept clear of snow, which acts as insulation, throughout the season as removal allows the ice to freeze faster and thicker. The road is 50 m wide on the ice, but narrower on land portages ranging between 12 and 15 m wide. Once initially built, the road is checked by drilling holes into the ice. If the ice needs to be thickened, water trucks are called in to add water to that specific area. The road is only operational during February and March, an average of 67 days per year. The ice has been proven by engineers to support light vehicle loads at 70 cm and increasing to full highway truck loads as the ice thickens. A thickness of 107 cm is required for a super B tanker carrying up to 50000 L and may weigh up to 42 t.|$|R
5000|$|The Coats Steamer was an American steam {{automobile}} promotion by George A. Coats. A corporation {{was formed}} and perhaps two prototypes were assembled. Five incrementally different designs were described. The first was by a [...] "Norwegian engineer" [...] and used two three-cylinder radial engines {{on the rear}} axle, one powering each wheel. The second was by James Yeikichi Sakuyama, for years an engine designer at Indianapolis, with a V-3 engine, gearbox and cast grid steam generator. It was quickly changed to a fire tube steam generator and inline-3 cylinder engine flat in the chassis. The fourth design took that Sakuyama chassis and engine and replaced the steam system in late 1923 with Charles A. French's patent design. The French-Coats was technically the most superior, probably {{the most likely to}} have been functional, and the car used in photographs. The fifth design was simply the chassis of Purdue professor Allen C. Staley, shown as a high grade Coats steam car at three shows. The car price remained the same at $1085 throughout the promotion, and dealerships and distributorships were sold to finance the development and sales effort. Eventually Coats obtained the confidence of Y. F. Stewart who had manufacturing facilities. A pickle factory in Bowling Green, Ohio was obtained and a defunct coachbuilder's factory in Columbus, Ohio was purchased. The Cumberland tire company was shown in advertisements as a third factory, as they were to be the tire supplier. All was gone by mid 1924 when the Columbus plant was sold. Coats went on to many enthusiastic promotions including <b>road</b> <b>building</b> <b>equipment</b> in 1924 in New Jersey and inadvertently became one of the creators of the syndicate which quickly became CBS. He stayed in radio promotion in New York City and was buried in the family cemetery in Indiana.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rise}} in the {{functions}} required in modern building structures, the role of the <b>building</b> <b>equipment</b> that maintains the functions of a building has been emphasized and increased. Effective management in this area is only possible when the construction manager (CMr) is qualified and has the knowledge of <b>building</b> <b>equipment</b> that is needed. Therefore, in this study, a questionnaire survey was carried out on equipment engineers and CMrs, {{in order to determine the}} level of <b>building</b> <b>equipment</b> knowledge required, and to identify the perception level of CMrs about the <b>building</b> <b>equipment</b> in the construction project at the project design stage. The results of this study revealed that the CMrs surveyed had a lower level of knowledge on the <b>building</b> <b>equipment</b> than the level that was desired by the equipment engineers.
