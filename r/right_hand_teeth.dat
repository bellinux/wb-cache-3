50|$|Gumming {{involves}} grinding the gullets of the {{saw teeth}} {{to a particular}} shape. The saw filer uses a semi or fully automatic grinding machine for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and {{in the presence of}} wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents case hardening and fatigue cracking of the saw band gullets. Resaw Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>teeth</b> first.|$|E
60|$|True, Jerry could trace as far back. His ancient {{ancestors}} had been Irish wolf-hounds, and, long before that, {{the ancestors of}} the wolf-hounds had been wolves. The note in Jerry's growls changed. The unforgotten and ineffaceable past strummed the fibres of his throat. His teeth flashed with fierce intent, in the desire of sinking as deep in the man's hand as passion could drive. For Jerry by this time was all passion. He had leaped back into the dark stark rawness of the early world almost as swiftly as had Borckman. And this time his teeth scored, ripping the tender and sensitive and flesh of all {{the inside of the}} first and second joints of Borckman's <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> Jerry's <b>teeth</b> were needles that stung, and Borckman, gaining the grasp on Jerry's jaw, flung him away and down so that almost he hit the Arangi's tiny-rail ere his clawing feet stopped him.|$|R
