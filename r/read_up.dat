In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E

25|$|The seven person crew of STS-131 {{was awakened}} {{to begin their}} first full day in space on Flight Day 2. Due {{to the lack of}} Ku-band communication, changes to the crews daily plan were <b>read</b> <b>up</b> for them to write out. After their post sleep activities, {{commander}} Alan Poindexter and pilot Jim Dutton fired Discoverys Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines to correct and further refine the shuttle's path to the ISS. Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and checking out the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the Canadarm. While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with Canadarm, Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the mid-deck of Discovery checking out the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) and getting them ready for their three spacewalks. The last portion of the crew day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools used during rendezvous.|$|E

However, Vyse is separated from Aika and Fina when Drachma's ship is severely damaged in a Valuan attack. Vyse ends up stranded on the small Crescent Island, where he manages to uncover letters and a map left behind by another pirate seeking a great treasure. Vyse is later found by a fellow Blue Rogue named Gilder, who takes him aboard to help him search for his friends. Meanwhile, Aika and Fina {{end up in the}} care of another Blue Rogue, Clara, who takes them to Nasr to help search for Vyse. Aika and Fina find out about the same treasure Vyse <b>read</b> <b>up</b> on, and the three soon reunite, but are then captured by Ramirez and brought to the Valuans' prison fortress. By enlisting the aid of the Valuan prince Enrique, who has lost patience with his government's tyranny, and stealing a powerful Valuan warship named the Delphinus, the Blue Rogues are able to escape. Vyse brings everyone back to Crescent Island, upon which he formally establishes a base of operations and living quarters for he and his fellow shipmates.|$|E

Although an attacker has some control over the disclosed memory block's size, it has no control over its location, and therefore cannot choose what content is revealed.|$|E

[...] Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta's adherence to Christianity was [...] "desultory". While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to Islam. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta <b>read</b> <b>up</b> on Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was [...] "not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible". Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything African as evil. In Facing Mount Kenya, he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call [...] "ancestor communion".

500|$|Hordern was a self-confessed [...] "lazy bugger" [...] {{when it came}} to role preparation. He did not regret {{his lack}} of formal acting training, and {{attributed}} his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: [...] "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it scares the shit out of me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." [...] In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. [...] The director advised him to [...] "never <b>read</b> <b>up</b> on them" [...] before going on to say [...] "read the plays as much as [...] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, {{and for the rest of}} his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, [...] "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".|$|E
500|$|Although a {{significant}} {{member of the}} troupe, Sylvester remained a relatively isolated figure; {{not only was he}} one of very few African-American members, he eschewed the group's more surrealist activities for what he saw as classier, more glamorous performances onstage. In the Cockettes' performances, he was usually given an entire scene to himself, often with little relevance to the narrative and theme {{of the rest of the}} show, although through doing so, he gained his own following. With a piano player named Peter Mintum, Sylvester worked on solo scenes in which he exhibited his interest in blues and jazz by imitating several of his musical idols like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. Adding to his image, Sylvester used the pseudonym [...] "Ruby Blue" [...] and described himself as [...] "Billie Holiday's cousin once removed." [...] Fascinated by black musical heritage, he <b>read</b> <b>up</b> on the subject and became a collector of [...] "negrobilia"; in some of his Cockette performances, he played up to racial stereotypes of African-Americans in order to ridicule the stereotypes themselves.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Reitman {{had wanted}} to direct but had made only one film, Cannibal Girls, for $5,000. The film's {{producers}} approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before considering John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on Kentucky Fried Movie. That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis' movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembers, [...] "When I was given the script, it was the funniest thing I had ever <b>read</b> <b>up</b> to that time. But it was really offensive. There {{was a great deal}} of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things". There was also friction between Landis and the writers early on because Landis was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis remembers, [...] "He sort of referred immediately to Animal House as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} years saw Morrissey cast in two high-profile feature films; while filming the Brian Jones biopic Stoned (2005), {{he got an}} audition for psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass, the male lead in Basic Instinct 2 (2006). He was flown out to Los Angeles for a one-hour screen test with Sharon Stone. Their immediate rapport led to the screen test being extended by another hour and Morrissey's casting in the role. Morrissey had enjoyed the first film and liked the script for the sequel. He <b>read</b> <b>up</b> on psychiatry and worked out in a gym for the nudity scenes. The film was a box office and critical failure. The Washington Post criticised the film's focus on Morrissey's character and called the actor [...] "overmatched by Stone" [...] and [...] "a sad sack", and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called him [...] "a charisma-challenged non-entity". The same Washington Post critic later wrote in the Los Angeles Times that because Morrissey was not a film star, the chemistry between him and Stone had been spoiled. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that Morrissey had [...] "the charisma of beige wallpaper" [...] and that [...] "the producers could have replaced him halfway through shooting with a handsome mahogany coat rack and nobody {{would be able to}} tell the difference". The bad reviews depressed Morrissey, and he briefly considered giving up acting, but instead saw the role as a chance to learn.|$|E
