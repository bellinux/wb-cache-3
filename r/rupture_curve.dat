40|$|This study {{proposes a}} cyclic yield {{strength}} (CYS, σc) {{as a key}} characteristic for the definition of safe design for engineering structures operating under fatigue and creep conditions. CYS is defined on a cyclic stress-strain curve, while monotonic yield strength (MYS, σm) is defined on a monotonic stress-strain curve. Both values of σc and σm are identified using a 2 -steps fitting procedure of the experimental stress-strain curves using Ramberg-Osgood and Chaboche material models. Comparison of σc and fatigue endurance limit σf on the S-N fatigue curve reveals that they are approximately equal. Hence, basically safe fatigue design is guaranteed in purely elastic domain defined by the σc. A typical creep <b>rupture</b> <b>curve</b> in time-to-failure approach for creep analysis has 2 inflections corresponding to the σc and σm. These stresses separate 3 sections on the creep <b>rupture</b> <b>curve,</b> which are characterised by 3 different creep fracture modes and 3 creep deformation mechanisms. Thus, basically safe creep design is guaranteed in linear creep domain with brittle failure mode defined by the σc. These assumptions are confirmed for several structural low- and high-alloy steels for normal and high-temperature applications...|$|E

The design of a material part involves various types of geometrical irregularities such as notches, holes, etc. which impose a certain degree of constraint on the deformation. The present work aims to couple one such mechanical constraint with the metallurgical changes that occur during creep. Multiaxiality is generated following the mechanical route, by machining a circumferential 60 0 V-notch. This study not only represents the case of threaded portions, but is also used for observing the notch strengthening or weakening behavior.

The ratio of the load of SP creep test to the stress of standard uniaxial creep test was calculated so that both the creep <b>rupture</b> <b>curves</b> (load/stress versus Larson-Miller parameter curves) were overlapped to convert the results of SP creep test into those of standard test.

40|$|This {{metallurgical}} {{program was}} specifically {{conducted for the}} establishment of material properties required for the design of the LF 460 fan. The LF 460 lift fan is an advanced 18 : 1 high thrust to weight single stage design. It has a turbine attached to the outer flowpath of the fan blade tip which minimizes the axial depth of the fan. Advanced lightweight attachment designs are employed in this concept to achieve minimum mass polar moments of inertia which are required for good aircraft flight response control. The design features which are unique to this advanced LF 460 lift fan are the 0. 010 inch thin Udimet 700 alloy integral tip turbine design, minimum weight braze attachment of the turbine to the fan blade, and the high strength and elevated temperature capability of the Rene' 95 alloy for the fan blade. The data presented in this report show that the LF 460 fan rotor design is feasible and that the design stresses and margins of safety were more than adequate.

40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that {{moisture}} ingress in glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) enhances the phenomenon of stress corrosion cracking in the fibers, and that this reaction is likely to proceed more rapidly at the weakest sites in the glass fiber surface, a fundamental law that would permit the valid extrapolation of stress <b>rupture</b> <b>curves</b> to long service lives is yet to be developed. As a result, design guidelines for glass fiber reinforced polymers components have been developed mainly on a prescriptive rather than of a performance basis. Based on the well established knowledge on the chemical behavior of glass and, in particular, that of glass flaws, a model that combines fracture mechanics, shear lag theory, and a probability model for flaw size is developed to describe the behavior of GFRP composites. The predicted results, although limited to rather idealized situations, are very encouraging. They suggest that, with only modest assumptions about material properties, it is possible to obtain mechanisms of GFRP breakdown, which correspond with observed experimental behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{damage caused}} by {{creep-fatigue}} {{is an important factor}} for materials at high temperatures. For in-vessel components of fusion reactors the material EUROFER 97 is a candidate for structural application where it is subjected to irradiation and cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. To be able to evaluate fusion reactor components reliably, creep-fatigue damage has to be taken into account. In the frame of Engineering Data and Design Integration (EDDI) in EUROfusion Technology Work Programme rapid and easy design evaluation is very important to predict the critical regions under typical fusion reactor loading conditions. The presented Creep-Fatigue Assessment (CFA) tool is based on the creep-fatigue rules in ASME Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section 3 Division 1 Subsection NH which was adapted to the material EUROFER 97 and developed for ANSYS. The CFA tool uses the local stress, maximum elastic strain range and temperature from the elastic analysis of the component performed with ANSYS. For the assessment design fatigue and stress to <b>rupture</b> <b>curves</b> of EUROFER 97 as well as isochronous stress vs. strain curves determined by a constitutive model considering irradiation influence are used to deal with creep-fatigue damage.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The design of polyethylene (PE) pipelines for applications in the gas, water and chemical process industries {{has been based on}} data mainly obtained from stress rupture testing pipes only. In practice, installations are composed of both extruded pipe and injection moulded fittings which are joined by a fusion welding technique and are very often subjected to internal pressures of a fluctuating nature. Several makes of PE pipe systems were therefore obtained and work was undertaken to fully characterise mechanical performance in terms of internal pressure loadings. Butt-welded test specimens comprising pipe lengths and fittings were subjected to both static and fluctuating conditions at 80 °C, at pressures resulting in brittle fractures (below the knee on stress <b>rupture</b> <b>curves)</b> and at frequencies not exceeding 7. 5 cpm (0. 125 Hz). Resulting fracture surfaces were examined to identify sources of crack initiation and mechanisms of failure. Mechanical behaviour of the PE pipe samples was found to be markedly influenced by the grade of plastics compound, the pipe system dimensions, mould designs and methods of processing. Fatigue loading was the most aggressive test method and significant reductions in lifetimes were observed in fittings or joints between pipes and fittings with only modest increases in the frequency of pressurisation. It was also demonstrated that improved stress rupture behaviour did not necessarily lead to better fatigue performance. For the square-wave loading profiles used, an idea of the relevant failure mechanisms in any given system was obtained by comparing experimental Nf values with those predicted from cumulative damage principles based on Nf=τSR/τmax. In all types of system, failure was initiated at a defect residual from processing or jointing. Over 95...|$|R

Recently, mesoporous materials have been studied {{with the aim of}} having the highest possible surface area. Mesporous materials have pore diameter between 20 and 50 Å, with high values of specific surfaces. The order of the pores in space influences the value of the specific surface obtained. When porous are ordered in the space the surface area is greater than when the porous are disordered. In order to maximize the value of the specific surface, it is desirable to obtain ordered mesoporous materials. It is possible to obtain different properties of silica materials with small variations in the processes of its synthesis in these materials. This is why the synthesis of mesoporous materials is studied with the aim of have them ordered such as getting (or not) mesoporous materials. Nowadays, the TEOS or TMOS silica sources are used in obtaining mesostructured silicas. These sources of silica are intended to be replaced by substitutes and the use of sodium silicate as an alternative source of silica may have greater advantages on an industrial scale because, among other reasons, it is cheaper than TEOS or TMOS. It also aims to obtain an alternative process of silica synthesis mesoporous materials because nowadays acid catalysts are used as a proton source involving a washing process which can be avoided by using ion exchange resins as proton source. Therefore, the use of sodium silicate as well as the use of ion exchange resins in columns provides greater benefits from the industrial punt of view. This is why this project is based chiefly on the synthesis of mesoporous material using a column with ion exchange resin. The variables studied are the relations of surfactant: water and the ratio of sodium silicate: water. They are chosen from previous studies in the synthesis of mesoporous materials. The variable to maximize is the surface area of the materials obtained. Ion exchange column should be studied because working ranges must be known in order to obtain desired mesoporous materials. The first step is to obtained ion exchange resin column <b>rupture</b> <b>curves.</b> Microscopy techniques such as TEM and SEM and other techniques as BET and SAXS are used in order to characterize the synthesized mesoporous silica materials from the ion exchange column. The results obtained are subjected to statistical analysis using the "Statgraphics Plus 4. 1 " program having Pareto charts and estimated response surfaces. The last step is to study the influence of the ratio of surfactant:water and sodium silicate:water in the studied range. It has been found that the ratio of sodium silicate:water a maximum value of the obtained specific surface is obtained corresponding with the maximum management of these materials. In the range studied, the ratio of surfactant:water has not been a significant variable in the value of specific surface area of the materials obtained...|$|R

The load environment that an artery is subjected can be simulated in vitro through biaxial tensile tests. For this, many procedures have been used to characterize this kind of tissue, and therefore there is no standardization of these procedures. In this study, a methodology for testing and data processing has been proposed and tested. Biaxial tensile testing for three groups of arteries: abdominal aorta, thoracic aorta and left subclavian were performed at the Biomechanics Laboratory of INEGI, University of Porto (FEUP) to assess the methodology. The samples were tested up to the <b>rupture.</b> Stress-strain <b>curves</b> in the axial and circumferential axes were obtained and showed the nonlinear hyper-elastic behavior of the arteries. The limit to rupture and the elastic limit were estimated. Analyzing the mechanical behavior of both axis and making a comparison between them, it can be concluded that the axial axis shows greater resistance on average for all sample groups. The two-dimensional model of Strain Energy Function for hyper-elastic materials proposed by Fung and the bilayer model proposed by Holzapfel, both derived from the continuum mechanics, were used to perform a fitting of the experimental data, and predict the tissue behavior under different stresses or strains. The high coefficients of correlation between the experimental and fitted curves indicate that both models can model the pig arterial tissue. Histological analyses of the samples were performed in order to estimate the average content of collagen and elastin in the tissue. A high percentage of elastin was observed in all sample groups.

In all tests conducted on this material, creep curves showed only tertiary stage and the surface connected intergranular cracking was found to be dominant in creep fracture. It was shown that γ′ precipitate coarsening occurs in the bulk of the specimens and obeys the LSW kinetics. Metallographic analysis led to the conclusion that creep does not alter oxidation, except at grain boundaries, where oxide spikes can be developed under creep. Therefore grain boundary oxidation was found to be creep strain-assisted. A constitutive model accounting for precipitate coarsening was proposed. The oxidation-assisted intergranular damage and the oxidation embrittlement of the microstructure elements phenomena were successfully described using the continuum damage mechanics and the local ductility exhaustion laws, respectively.

It is not clear which method offers the most reliable fixation strength if axial pullout and a bending moment is applied. The {{purpose of this study is}} to validate a new in vitro model aimed to reproduce a cut out mechanism of lumbar pedicle screws, to compare fixation strength in elderly spines with different cement augmentation techniques and to analyze factors that might influence the failure pattern. Materials and methodsSix human specimens (82 – 100 years) were instrumented percutaneously at L 2, L 3 and L 4 by non-augmented screws, vertebroplasty augmentation and fenestrated screws. Cement distribution (2 ml PMMA) was analyzed on CT. Vertebral endplates and the rod were oriented at 45 ° to the horizontal plane. The vertebral body was held by resin in a cylinder, linked to an unconstrained pivot, on which traction (10 N/s) was applied until <b>rupture.</b> Load-displacement <b>curves</b> were compared to simultaneous video recordings. ResultsMedian pullout forces were 488. 5 N (195 – 500) for non-augmented screws, 643. 5 N (270 – 1050) for vertebroplasty augmentation and 943. 5 N (750 – 1084) for fenestrated screws. Cement augmentation through fenestrated screws led to significantly higher rupture forces compared to non-augmented screws (P= 0. 0039). The pullout force after vertebroplasty was variable and linked to cement distribution. A cement bolus around the distal screw tip led to pullout forces similar to non-augmented screws. A proximal cement bolus, as it was observed in fenestrated screws, led to higher pullout resistance. This cement distribution led to vertebral body fractures prior to screw pullout. ConclusionThe experimental setup tended to reproduce a pullout mechanism observed on radiographs, combining axial pullout and a bending moment. Cement augmentation with fenestrated screws increased pullout resistance significantly, whereas the fixation strength with the vertebroplasty prefilling method was linked to the cement distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract One {{approach}} to investigate earthquake source processes {{is to produce}} kinematic source models from inversion of seismic records and geodetic data. The setup of the inversion requires a variety of assumptions and constraints to restrict the range of possible models. Here, we evaluate to what extent physically plausible earth-quake scenarios are reliably restituted {{in spite of these}} restrictions. We study which characteristics of ruptures, such as rupture velocity, slip distribution, stress drop, rise time, and slip function, can be reliably determined from the inversion of near-field seismic and geodetic data. Using spontaneous dynamic rupture simulations, we gen-erate five earthquake scenarios, each of which has different characteristics of the source process. Then we conduct a blind test by modeling the synthetic near-source data using a standard inversion scheme that optimizes the fit to the observations while searching for solutions with minimum roughness. The inversion procedure assumes a rupture front propagating away from the hypocenter with variable rupture velocity and a simple cosine slip-time function. Our results show that, overall, slip distribution and stress drop are reasonably well determined even for input models with relatively complex histories (such as a subshear rupture transitioning to supershear speeds). Depth-averaged rupture velocities are also reasonably well resolved although their estimate progressively deteriorates away from the hypocenter. The local rise time and slip function are not well resolved, but there is some sensitivity to the rupture pulse width, which can be used to differentiate between pulse-like and crack-like ruptures. Our test for understanding the inaccuracies in Green’s functions shows that random 3 D perturbations of 5 % standard deviation do not lead to significant degradation of the estimation of earthquake source parameters. As remedies to the current limitations, we propose smoothing slip function parameters and using more complicated inversion schemes only if data necessitates them.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the measurement and modelling {{of the fire}} reaction and resistance properties of fibre glass polyester and vinyl ester composite laminates. A new small-scale loading frame was designed and fabricated to apply tensile and compressive stresses in a cone calorimeter under a constant heat flux of 75 kW/m 2. It was found, for the first time, that stress has a small but {{significant effect on the}} fire reaction properties. Increasing tensile stress increased heat release rate and smoke production, while shortening the time-to-ignition. Compressive stress had the reverse effect. This was attributed to the fact that tensile stress promotes the formation of matrix microcracks, facilitating the evolution of flammable volatiles. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that stress has the greatest effect on the early heat and smoke release peaks, with a lower effect on the final `run-out' values. Another new small scale testing rig was developed along with a calibrated conical radiant heater, which resembles the cone calorimeter's heater, to allow testing composite laminates at high tensile and compressive stresses. Stress <b>rupture</b> (time-to-failure) <b>curves</b> were produced. It was shown that, in tension, the behaviour was fibre dominated, with failure times roughly ten times those in compression. Compressive failure involved resin dominated local fibre kinking initiated near the cold face and was controlled by the matrix glass transition temperature. The existing thermal model was upgraded to include the mass flux effect into the net total energy on the hot face of the composite laminate at flashover. This novel approach has resulted in very good predictions of the most important fire reaction properties obtained from the cone calorimeter such as time-to-ignition, mass loss rate, heat release rate and flame-out time. In addition, the predicted temperature and resin content profiles combined with the temperature dependent properties values were used to model the failure times by applying a suitable empirical relationship. Good agreement was found. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceLibyan Higher Education Secretary : Culture Affairs Department of the Libyan People's Bureau, LondonGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The (M_L 5. 8) Sierra Madre {{earthquake}} of 28 June 1991 {{occurred at}} a depth of 12 km under the San Gabriel Mountains of the central Transverse Ranges. Since at least 1932 this region had been quiescent for M ≧ 3. The mainshock focal mechanism derived from first-motion polarities exhibited almost pure thrust faulting, with a rake of 82 ° on a plane striking N 62 °E and dipping 50 ° to the north. The event appears to have occurred on the Clamshell-Sawpit fault, a splay of the Sierra Madre fault zone. The aftershock sequence following the mainshock {{occurred at a}} depth of 9 to 14 km and was deficient in small earthquakes, having a b value of 0. 6. Twenty nine single-event focal mechanisms were determined for aftershocks of M > 1. 5. The 4 -km-long segment of the Clamshell-Sawpit fault that may have ruptured in the mainshock is outlined by several thrust focal mechanisms with an east-northeast-striking fault plane dipping to the north. To the west, several thrust aftershocks with east-striking nodal planes suggest some complexity in the aftershock faulting, such as a <b>curved</b> <b>rupture</b> surface. In addition, several strike-slip and normal faulting events occurred along the edges of the mainshock fault plane, indicating secondary tear faulting. The tectonic stress field driving the coexisting left-lateral strike-slip and thrust faults in the northern Los Angeles basin is north-south horizontal compression with vertical intermediate or minimum principal stress axis...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Individual rupture risk {{assessment}} of intracranial aneurysms {{is a major}} issue in the clinical management of asymptomatic aneurysms. Aneurysm rupture occurs when wall tension exceeds the strength limit of the wall tissue. At present, aneurysmal wall mechanics are poorly understood and thus, {{risk assessment}} involving mechanical properties is inexistent. Aneurysm computational hemodynamics studies make the assumption of rigid walls, an arguable simplification. We therefore aim to assess mechanical properties of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms in order to provide the foundation for future patient-specific aneurysmal risk assessment. This work also challenges some of the currently held hypotheses in computational flow hemodynamics research. Methods: A specific conservation protocol was applied to aneurysmal tissues following clipping and resection in order to preserve their mechanical properties. Sixteen intracranial aneurysms (11 female, 5 male) underwent mechanical uniaxial stress tests under physiological conditions, temperature, and saline isotonic solution. These represented 11 unruptured and 5 <b>ruptured</b> aneurysms. Stress/strain <b>curves</b> were then obtained for each sample, and a fitting algorithm was applied following a 3 -parameter (C(10), C(01), C(11)) Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic model. Each aneurysm was classified according to its biomechanical properties and (un) rupture status. /nResults: Tissue testing demonstrated three main tissue classes: Soft, Rigid, and Intermediate. All unruptured aneurysms presented a more Rigid tissue than ruptured or pre-ruptured aneurysms within each gender subgroup. Wall thickness was not correlated to aneurysmal status (ruptured/unruptured). An Intermediate subgroup of unruptured aneurysms with softer tissue characteristic was identified and correlated with multiple documented risk factors of rupture. Conclusion: There is a significant modification in biomechanical properties between ruptured aneurysm, presenting a soft tissue and unruptured aneurysms, presenting a rigid material. This finding strongly supports the idea that a biomechanical risk factor based assessment should be utilized in the to improve the therapeutic decision making...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{morphological}} alterations of {{the deep}} fascia subjected to leg lengthening have been investigated in cellular and extracellular aspects, the impact of leg lengthening on viscoelastic properties {{of the deep}} fascia remains largely unknown. This study aimed to address the changes of viscoelastic properties of the deep fascia during leg lengthening using uniaxial tensile test. Methods Animal model of leg lengthening was established in New Zealand white rabbits. Distraction was initiated {{at a rate of}} 1 mm/day and 2 mm/day in two steps, and preceded until increases of 10 % and 20 % in the initial length of tibia had been achieved. The deep fascia specimens of 30 mm × 10 mm were clamped with the Instron 1122 tensile tester at room temperature with a constant tensile rate of 5 mm/min. After 5 load-download tensile tests had been performed, the specimens were elongated until <b>rupture.</b> The load-displacement <b>curves</b> were automatically generated. Results The normal deep fascia showed typical viscoelastic rule of collagenous tissues. Each experimental group of the deep fascia after leg lengthening kept the properties. The curves of the deep fascia at a rate of 1 mm/day with 20 % increase in tibia length were the closest to those of normal deep fascia. The ultimate tension strength and the strain at rupture on average of normal deep fascia were 2. 69 N (8. 97 mN/mm 2) and 14. 11 %, respectively. The increases in ultimate tension strength and strain at rupture of the deep fascia after leg lengthening were statistically significant. Conclusion The deep fascia subjected to leg lengthening exhibits viscoelastic properties as collagenous tissues without lengthening other than increased strain and strength. Notwithstanding different lengthening schemes result in varied viscoelastic properties changes, the most comparable viscoelastic properties to be demonstrated are under the scheme of a distraction rate of 1 mm/day and 20 % increase in tibia length. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} {{anatomical}} and biomechanical {{features of the}} interosseous membrane (IOM) of the cadaveric forearm. MethodsTen radius-IOM-ulna structures were harvested from fresh-frozen cadavers to measure the length, width and thickness of the tendinous portion of IOM. Then, the tendinous portion was isolated along with the ulnar and radial ends to which the tendon attached after measurement. The proximal portion of the radius and the distal portion of the ulna were embedded and fixed in the dental base acrylic resin powder. The embedded specimen was clamped and fixed by the MTS 858 test machine using a 10 000 N load cell for the entire tensile test. IOM was stretched at a speed of 50 mm/min until it was <b>ruptured.</b> The load-displacement <b>curve</b> was depicted with a computer and the maximum load and stiffness were recorded at the same time. ResultsThe IOM of the forearm was composed of three portions: central tendinous tissue, membranous tissue and dorsal affiliated oblique cord. IOM was stretched at a neutral position, and flexed at pronation and supination positions. The tendinous portion of IOM was lacerated in 6 specimens when {{the point of the}} maximum load reached to 1021. 50 N ± 250. 13 N, the stiffness to 138. 24 N/m± 24. 29 N/m, and the length of stretch to 9. 77 mm± 1. 77 mm. Fracture occurred at the fixed end of the ulna before laceration of the tendinous portion in 4 specimens when the maximum load was 744. 40 N ± 109. 85 N, the stiffness was 151. 17 N/m± 30. 68 N/m, and the length of the stretch was 6. 51 mm± 0. 51 mm. ConclusionsThe IOM of the forearm is a structure having ligamentous characteristics between the radius and the ulna. It is very important for maintenance of the longitudinal stability of the forearm. The anatomical and biome-chanical data can be used as an objective criterion for evaluating the reconstructive method of IOM of the forearm...|$|R
