40|$|As for a {{variable}} air volume (VAV) system, the air duct <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is a typical}} control variable maintained by modulating supply fan speed. The <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> equals to the summation of the duct pressure loss downstream of the sensor to the terminal box and box inlet <b>static</b> <b>pressure.</b> Typically, the air duct <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> is set as a constant set point based on the system design information and sensor location. However, under partial load conditions, the terminal box dampers have to be closed more since either required airflow {{is less than the}} design airflow which directly leads to much less pressure loss. Thus the <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> set point should be reset lower in order to reduce fan power, avoid noise at terminal box dampers and box damper malfunction due to excessive <b>pressure.</b> Different <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> reset schedules are reviewed and compared, considering the influence of outside air temperature on the building load, availability of the VAV box damper positions, the airflow ratio based <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> reset has also applicable advantages over the existing constant <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> set point and two typical reset methods. This paper present the theoretical models to express the impacts of <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> reset on fan airflow, fan head, air leakage, fan power and thermal energy for both pressure independent and pressure dependent boxes.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} of calibrating airspeed installations on airplanes at transonic and supersonic speeds {{by use of}} instrumentation in the airplane only, The method consists in first making a survey of temperature, <b>static</b> <b>pressure,</b> and total pressure over the desired range of altitudes at speeds for which the airspeed calibration is know. The airplane is then flown at speeds for which the calibration is desired through the range of altitude surveyed, and the measurements of temperature, <b>static</b> <b>pressure,</b> and total pressure are repeated. The values of total pressure and indicated temperature at a given instant in the calibration run, together with the temperature recovery factor of the thermometer, define the relation between ambient temperature and <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> at that instant. Comparison of this relation with that determined from the survey gives the value of free-stream <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> at that instant.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} different duct <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> control strategies {{which could}} be implemented in variable air volume air-conditioning systems (VAV). Two pressure reset control strategies are compared to the commonly used control solution based on the “Constant static pressure” method. First pressure reset control strategy, known as PID Control, uses signals from VAV boxes controllers to reset duct <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in a way that}} one of the VAV dampers is maintained almost entirely open. Second strategy decreases <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> setpoint until an adjustable number of pressure requests occur. As a response to the certain amount of requests, <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> setpoint is increased. This strategy is called Trim & Respond. Both <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> reset control strategies described in this paper are considered to have more significant potential for energy savings than the “Constant static pressure” method. In order to validate this potential, several simulations for different control strategies were carried out and the obtained results are compared and analysed.

In order to invasively record the <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> of carotid artery dur ing cardiac cycle in rabbit s and compare it with noninvasive technique, T–shaped tubes have been designed and constructed and calibrated. A noninvasive method to measure <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> in arteries and finally estimate the elasticity of vessels is provided. Materials and Methods: In male white rabbits, we estimated the <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> changes in carotid artery noninvasively by measuring blood flow velocities throughout cardiac cycle using Color Doppler Ultrasound. The blood flow ve locities were converted to <b>static</b> <b>pressure</b> changes by using energy conservation low. The st atic pressure changes of arterial wall were estimated.
