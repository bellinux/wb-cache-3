40|$|Abstract—Fraud or {{cheating}} of malicious nodes were {{restrained by}} reducing the trust value of malicious nodes in the past trust model, but few <b>recommendation</b> nodes for cooperation cheating are punished, so it has had only limited malicious <b>recommendation</b> or fraudulent action again and again. Due to lack of punishment for malicious <b>recommendation</b> of <b>recommendation</b> nodes, enormous malicious <b>recommendation</b> nodes remain and search for next criminal opportunity. By borrowing idea of bidding {{and the introduction of}} competition and the mechanism of rewards and penalty, this paper proposes a dynamic <b>recommendation</b> trust evaluated model based on bidding in E-Commerce environment. By greatly increasing the “criminal cost ” of malicious <b>recommendation</b> nodes, with <b>recommendation</b> optimization algorithm based on Markov chain, the model ensures that the <b>recommendation</b> service is true and more objective, which will stimulate the enthusiasm of nodes objective <b>recommendation</b> and reach the goal that nodes give up malicious <b>recommendation</b> and cooperative cheating on its own initiative by objective method so as to restrain malicious <b>recommendation</b> and cooperative cheating effectively. In simulation experiment, the model also shows good restraint on malicious <b>recommendation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the tourism}} <b>recommendation</b> system, {{the number of}} users and items is very large.

Collaborative filtering is the primary approach of any <b>recommendation</b> system. It provides a <b>recommendation</b> which is easy to understand. It is based on similarities of user opinions like rating or likes and dislikes. So the <b>recommendation</b> provided by collaborative cannot be considered as quality <b>recommendation.</b> <b>Recommendation</b> after association rule mining is having high support and confidence level. So that will be considered as strong <b>recommendation.</b> The hybridization of both collaborative filtering and association rule mining can produce strong and quality <b>recommendation</b> even when sufficient data are not available.

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Recommendation</b> {{systems are}} the agents {{that help the}} learner to {{identify}} a subset of suitable learning resources {{from a variety of}} choices. <b>Recommendation</b> Systems is a widely explored field since the last decade. Much of the work is going on in <b>recommendation</b> systems that are based on the evaluation of resources and users‟ data. In this paper we concentrate on E-Learning <b>Recommendation</b> Systems. An E-learning <b>recommendation</b> system is a derivative field of <b>recommendation</b> systems in which the resources are specifically the available bulk of learning material either online or offline. The aim of E-learning software is to select the useful piece of material which the learner actually requires to study. Our aim in this paper is to study various <b>recommendation</b> techniques with their virtues and shortcomings. Further we will discuss E-learning <b>recommendation</b> systems with a brief review of some major milestones in the field of E-Learning.

The 30-person commission {{was formed in}} July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 <b>recommendations</b> – in September 1986. Among the <b>recommendations</b> in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's <b>recommendations</b> were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other <b>recommendations</b> in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Presently <b>recommendation</b> {{systems have}} {{gradually}} {{become an important}} part in E-Commerce, more and more research papers about <b>recommendation</b> systems in E-Commerce appeared in many kinds of conferences and journals. With expanding of E-Commerce it also faces series of challenges. Traditional collaborative filtering <b>recommendation</b> technique is hard to provide <b>recommendation</b> service for unregistered users. To overcome this problem, we suggested a framework of <b>recommendation</b> system based on web mining. It is made up of two parts, offline and online. This method first clustered web usage data, web content data and web structure data respectively, then provided high-quality <b>recommendation</b> services based on mining results. Compared with traditional collaborative filtering techniques, <b>recommendation</b> systems based on web mining are convenient for users because user need not to provide user-rating data explicitly. In end of this paper, accuracy of <b>recommendation</b> system based on web mining was tested and compared with traditional collaborative filtering <b>recommendation</b> system. Testing results showed that, quality of <b>recommendation</b> system based on web mining is better than quality of traditional collaborative filtering <b>recommendation</b> system...|$|R

Therefore, the aim of this study attempts to explore how consumers assess the quality of two types of <b>recommendation</b> systems, collaborative filtering and content-based by using a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Specifically, the under-investigated concept of trust in technological artifacts is adapted to the UTAUT model.
