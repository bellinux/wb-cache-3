25|$|There is {{evidence}} on the foreshore {{on the western side}} of the Cape, below the Battery Observation Post (BOP), of a concrete and rock pathway leading from the road down to the water, where 1940s photographs show a rock jetty in this position. A rusted gearbox lying beside this pathway may be that used in the winch. Above the road is the cutting (somewhat overgrown) where a rail line was laid to winch equipment and supplies from the road and the beach to the Battery Observation Post high on the hill. At the top of the cutting, {{to the side of the}} BOP, is a concrete slab which may have been associated with the <b>rail</b> <b>wagon</b> and winch area.|$|E
500|$|In 2013 {{the company}} signed an {{agreement}} with ABP to develop handling facilities at the Port of Hull, Immingham and [...] Grimsby; construction of automated facilities began in 2013, creating capacities of 3 and 1million tonnes per year at the ports of Immingham and Hull respectively, adding to the 1.4million tonne per year Port of Tyne biomass facility built in 2009. In the same year a new design covered <b>rail</b> <b>wagon</b> with high volumetric capacity for transporting the low density biomass pellets was unveiled for use by Drax in the UK; 200 wagons of the type were ordered. At Drax pellets would be stored in domes, and transferred by a pneumatic conveyor system before grinding to dust for use.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of old socialistic {{industries}} that survived the transition period in Serbia. The biggest one is the chemical fertilizer factory [...] "Azotara" [...] and the <b>rail</b> <b>wagon</b> factory [...] "Bratstvo". Currently the biggest export industry in town is the [...] "Siemens Subotica" [...] wind generators factory and it is the biggest brownfield investment so far. The other big companies in Subotica are: Fornetti, ATB Sever and Masterplast. More recent companies to come to Subotica include Dunkermotoren and NORMA Group. Tourism is important. In the past few years, Palić has been famous for the Palić Film Festival. Subotica is a festival city, hosting more than 17 festivals over the year.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1849 {{the first}} goods trains {{ran through the}} tunnel. <b>Rail</b> <b>wagons</b> were pulled by {{locomotive}} from Waterloo Dock down a gradient to the Byrom Street cutting. From the cutting the tunnel rose to Edge Hill. <b>Rail</b> <b>wagons</b> were pulled up the steep gradient from the Byrom Street cutting by a wire rope. The rope was the largest iron wire rope ever manufactured. A brick building housed a large static steam engine that wound the rope pulling the <b>rail</b> <b>wagons</b> up the tunnel.|$|R

2500|$|The TranzCoastal was {{suspended}} {{as a result}} of the major Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 and did not resume until August that year, returning to the original Coastal Pacific name. The line was closed by major slips {{as a result of}} the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake with a freight train being left stranded north of Kaikoura. The line between Picton and Spring Creek yard remained open to allow <b>rail</b> <b>wagon</b> hreight from the Interislander ferries to be transshipped to road and vice versa. The section of line from Spring Creek south to Lake Grassmere reopened on 16 January 2017. [...] Works to restore the line were completed on 8 August 2017, and limited freight services were restored on 15 September 2017[...]|$|E
2500|$|For a {{small boat}} (e.g. 22' / 6.7 m sailing yacht), this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12mm or 14mm rising chain {{attached}} to the [...] "anchor", and a bridle made from 20mm nylon rope, steel cable, or a 16mm combination steel wire material. [...] The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material. [...] Old <b>rail</b> <b>wagon</b> wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose. [...] In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may {{be placed in a}} grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings. [...] Ropes (particularly for marker buoys and messenger lines) should be [...] "non floating" [...] to reduce likelihood of a boat's prop being fouled by one.|$|E
2500|$|However, Ken Heard, Consultant Museologist, Canadian Museums Association, was {{reported}} to say: [...] "One {{of the terms of}} these agreements was that the track gauge was to accommodate wagons. As horse car rail was step rail, the horse cars, equipped with iron wheels with flanges on the inside, ran on the outer, or upper step of the <b>rail.</b> <b>Wagon</b> wheels naturally did not have a flange. They were made of wood, with an iron tire. Wagons would use the inner, or lower step of the rail. The upper step of the rail guided the wagons on the track. In order to accommodate this arrangement, the track gauge had to be 4 feet, 11 inches. As the streets themselves were not paved, this arrangement permitted wagons carrying heavy loads a stable roadbed." [...] In support of Heard's statement about the pre-TTC gauge, the Charter of the Toronto Railway Company said [...] "the gauge of system (4 ft. 11 in.) is to be maintained on main lines and extensions thereof".|$|E

40|$|A {{road bridge}} {{containing}} disused flatbed <b>rail</b> <b>wagons</b> {{as the primary}} deck superstructure was performance tested in a low volume, high axle load traffic road in Queensland, Australia; some key results are presented in this paper. A fully laden truck of total weight 28. 88 % of the serviceability design load prescribed in the Australian bridge code was used; its wheel positions were accurately captured using a high speed camera and synchronised with the real‐time deflections and strains measured at the critical members of the flat <b>rail</b> <b>wagons.</b> The strains remained well below the yield and narrated the existence of composite action between the reinforced concrete slab pavement and the wagon deck. A three dimensional grillage model was developed and calibrated using the test data, which established the structural adequacy of the <b>rail</b> <b>wagons</b> and the positive contribution of the reinforced concrete slab pavement to resist high axle traffic loads on a single lane bridge in the low volume roads network...|$|R
