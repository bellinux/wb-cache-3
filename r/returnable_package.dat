Sources also propose that <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> is dealt with inefficiently within the automotive suppliers.    Purpose The purpose of the thesis is to explore and analyze how <b>packaging</b> and <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> are managed within suppliers in the ASC. It also aims to identify perceived important factors for efficient <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> management from the perspective of suppliers, sub-suppliers and OEMs. Method The research is based on a holistic single case study. Further, it adopts the inductive approach and exploratory purpose. Data collection is facilitated by qualitative methods, using ten semi-structured interviews and four on-site observations. Conclusion Packaging was found to be managed somewhat differently in the internal, outbound and inbound flows. Non-returnable and <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> was found used in all flows at different ratios. Further, several factors were regarded important for efficient <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> management.

Design/methodology/approach A theoretical evaluation model for comparing cost efficiency and environmental impact of one-way and <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> systems in supply chains is developed from literature. The deducted model is subsequently tested in a case study of a supply chain involving Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Logistics Corporation, comparing the use of a newly developed one-way packaging with the sustainability of a <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging.</b> Findings The developed theoretical model showed to be useful to compare the environmental and economic impact of two different packaging systems in a specific supply chain. The criteria used in the model are 1) packaging efficiency, 2) packaging material, 3) transport, 4) material handling, 5) waste, recycling and reuse, and 6) administration. In the case study, the one-way packaging resulted in less economic and environmental impact, indicating the importance for companies to question their packaging systems.

40|$|Currently the {{performance}} of a traditional forward supply chain is broadly studied in literature. The less known reverse supply chain is an upcoming research theme, with more companies adapting this concept. In the beverages industry this reverse logistics are common and based on <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging,</b> so called empties. Beer brewers are {{under a lot of pressure}} and cost reductions are essential to remain competitive and to survive. This research aims at creating knowledge on redesigning a reverse supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> from a transport logistic perspective. This research is performed based on a proposed method called DMADE. The research problem is identified as a lack of knowledge on redesigning of a reverse supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging.</b> Literature is researched and a new process improvement method called VSM-I is introduced. This combines both physical values streams with information flow swimlanes. Performance measures are defined for the reverse flow. A case study is performed and the current state of the supply chain at Heineken is created. By analyzing this current state, waste that obstruct improved performance is identified. 4 New transport logistic strategies are introduced based on the analysis. The current state transport strategy, Strategy 1; the triple trip, Strategy 2; Direct trip from market to sorter and Strategy 3; a direct trip the market with sorted empties to the production warehouse(LCDB). A discrete event simulation model is constructed to evaluate {{the performance}} based on an experimental plan. The 4 transport strategies with each 10 input scenarios that capture potential growth, new processing times and other mix of sorted and unsorted empties returned. They are tested based on cycle time, throughput, CO 2 emission, inventory utilization, handling cost and storage cost. The transport strategies show that introducing Strategy 3; direct trip from the market to the LCDB is the most beneficial for cycle time reduction and increase in throughput. Depending on the input scenario up to 3. 36 weeks € 2. 359 k of cycle time can be reduced and an increase of 4, 3 % in throughput is realized. Strategy 1; the triple trip reduces 165 tons of CO 2 emission per year. Strategy 2; direct trip from the market to Leiter performs the best handling and storage cost reduction with respective € 231 k & € 373 k savings. Inventory utilization results show a shift of inventory to other locations in the supply chain since no changes to the initial inventory levels are made when changing transport strategies. A supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> can be redesigned from a transport logistic perspective with a structured method called DMADE. When combining this method with a new introduced process improvement method called VSM-I a more detailed current state analysis can be performed.

A theoretical evaluation model for comparing cost efficiency and the environmental impact of packaging systems in supply chains are developed from literature. The model is tested in a case study of a supply chain involving Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Logistics Corporation, comparing the use of newly developed, one-way packaging with the sustainability of <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging.</b> The model compares the environmental and economic impacts of two packaging systems in a specific supply chain. The criteria used in the model are (i) packaging fill rate, (ii) packaging material, (iii) transport, (iv) material handling, (v) waste handling and (vi) administration. In the case study, the one-way packaging resulted in fewer economic and environmental impacts, thereby indicating the importance for companies to question their packaging systems. The model has been tested on one component in a case study.

30|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} have developed models that assist decision makers in planning the purchase, distribution and return of reusable packaging material. However, {{as will be}} shown in the next section, publications in this area had a focus on conceptual models of RTI management, {{on the use of}} radio-frequency identification (RFID) in the management of RTIs and on container routing and repositioning models.

To close this gap, this paper studies a supplier who uses <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> material for supplying a product to multiple customers. The objective is to develop a mathematical model that helps decision makers in coordinating the flow of finished products and RTIs along the supply chain and to minimize the total logistics cost of the chain.|$|R

It has gained increasing attention in the last decade and has been a new frontier of strategic management. One of the driving forces for firms to adopt the reverse logistics practice is cost saving from reverse logistics activities. Another motivation to put reverse logistics forward is probably due to environmental impacts on non-returnable materials. Reverse logistics, however, may require cooperation of more than one company and hence it is generally poorly managed due to self-interest of different companies.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study for {{analysing}} costs affected by packaging in a producing industry. The purpose {{is to develop a}} model that will calculate and present possible cost savings for the customer by using Volvo Logistics Corporations, VLC’s, <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> instead of other packaging solutions. The thesis is based on qualitative data gained from both theoretical and empirical studies. The methodology for gaining information has been to study theoretical sources such as course literature and articles, as well as through interviews and consolidation with staff at Volvo Logistics Corporations office in Gothenburg. The model is constructed in Microsoft Excel and consists of six different sheets. The first sheet is a front page that summarises the costs calculated in the other sheets and presents the possible cost savings. After the front page there are three sheets with calculations for the costs in different scenarios, Today’s Situation, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre implementation) and VLC Packaging Solution (Post implementation). The first sheet, Today’s Situation, presents the result of the model that will calculate the customers’ current costs that are associated with packaging. The different costs presented in the model are costs for unloading, repacking, today’s cost for an internal packaging solution, quality related costs, one-way packaging costs and the costs for other packaging solutions. The next sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre), presents an estimation of the cost for thecustomer when using VLC’s <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> system. The estimation will serve as an investment tool, for calculating possible cost savings compared to the present situation. The different costs that will be discussed are handling costs, quality related costs, distribution cost, transaction cost, and investment cost. The third and final calculation sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Post), presents the actual costs for the customer after the implementation. When the costs have been calculated they will be used to evaluate the actual cost savings for the customer. The last two sheets are a data sheet, which consists of data needed for the calculations in the previous sheets, and an instruction sheet where there are instructions to the different calculations in the model. The conclusion shows that the objective to create a model for calculating the costs for different packaging systems and present possible cost savings is fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|Report no. E 2016 : 009, Volvo Cars {{handles and}} plans its own <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> {{material}} and {{the purpose is to}} serve the suppliers, plants and terminals with packaging material like pallets, boxes and frames. <b>Returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> is made out of durable materials so it can be used several times. To be able to in time serve the production plants with packaging material the company needs to make calculations based on real factors and numbers. One of the tasks for the department Packaging Operations is to secure the packaging availability. If there is shortage of packaging it can cause a stop in the production line and this is caused because the suppliers are short of packaging to pack their products on, which can cause delays in the production. To prevent this problem, the department has developed a calculation model in Excel to calculate the required packaging in circulation for different time periods and the outcome is an investment sum. This model is based on three variables: production volume, loop time and packaging per car. The last variable defines the amount of packaging needed to manufacture one car model and loop time is the time it takes for one packaging to travel from the terminal to the supplier, from the supplier to the plants and finally back to the terminal before it is sent out again. However, the department saw an opportunity to develop this model with more accurate numbers and data, make it more user-friendly and general so the data and assumptions could be updated easily. The purpose of this thesis was to improve and verify the original model and the wanted outcome was to develop a new model and make it useful according to two perspectives. The short-term perspective that the model will achieve is to secure packaging availability and make investments in time to always be able to serve the suppliers with packaging. Moreover, the long-term perspective is to plan the cost for future car models and the time span for this is over three years from now. Today there is lack of reliable data at the department to get an understanding if there is enough packaging in circulation and to decide the cost for future car models, so the new model will fulfil both these perspectives. Using information from an analysis of the original model, requirements for the new model and by making a gap analysis between the original model and the requirements developed the new model. First, the new model consists of two documents, one to calculate packaging per car and the other to calculate the investment sum. Both of the documents are improved and are now more general than the original model, the raw data can be updated easily and the calculations will automatically using the updated data and present it. Another improvement is that the assumptions for example loop time can be regulated at any time and the calculations will adjust to the changes automatically. A user manual exists to facilitate the transfer of knowledge to the concerned department. However, it is a prerequisite that the user has prior knowledge about the organization and processes to also evaluate the outcome’s reliability. There are some improvement potentials and weaknesses to further consider for Volvo Cars. The purpose of this thesis was to develop a model and not to evaluate the numbers used in the model. However, the raw data changes frequently and thus the investment sum. A first step to increase the reliability of the investment sum is to verify the numbers and assumptions. In conclusion, a functioning model is delivered to Volvo Cars, but the numbers need to be evaluated and analysed to be able to trust the investment su...|$|R
40|$|A {{certain amount}} of {{construction}} waste comes from disposable packaging and this waste is ecologically damaging, one solution would be to reduce the disposable by using <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> for non-specific construction products. To find out if this solution is feasible a study {{has been carried out}} on the economical and ecological consequences. A housing construction project was chosen to get insight into the sizes of the construction products and in the amount of packaging used in the construction products. Based on these results a transportation system has been developed. First an inventory was made of all the functions needed in the transportation system. For every function a solution is developed, and for the functions together, a principle design was chosen. This study led us to design a synthetic crate with the floor dimensions of 400 by 600 and 400 mm height, and a lid which {{can be used as a}} small pallet. The crates are transported to the building site on EURO-pallets and are manually handled into the building by a specially designed handcart. The handcart has the functions of a palletcart, wheel barrow and sack car. To manage these crates,lids and pallets a pool system was also designed. The principle of this system is that the pool organisation buys the crates and lends them to the packers with a deposit. The packer pay a fee to the pool organisation to can fill a crate. The transportation firm gets paid from the pool organisation for bringing back the empty crates to the packers. Based on this systern, calculations are made on what the fee should be. The use of the crate is economically and ecologically more interesting for construction products which use a high proportion of disposable packaging. What important is in introducing a returnable crate is an efficient pool organisation. The packers must be the owners of tbe pool organisation. The returnable crate is not only interesting for the environment, but it also has advantages for tbe working circumstances and the logistics between the producers and users of building materials...|$|R

Accordingly, Volvo Group has initiated a project called Next Generation Packaging with the objective to harmonize and standardize the Volvo Group’s packaging pool. However, there are concerns that disposable packaging material (often cardboard) will {{have a negative impact}} on the material handling, scrapping or recycling, and the level of cleanliness inside production plants, thus affecting the production quality. The aim of this thesis is to study the effects of an increased usage of disposable packaging in the Volvo Group’s receiving plant from goods receiving to point of use to waste handling, and to identify potential problems that arise from replacing the <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> with disposable alternatives. The total scope for the project Next Generation Packaging is global, but the master thesis is limited in terms of geographical location and the main focus is on the production plant in Tuve. The report will further be limited to the packaging alternatives that Next Generation Packaging is reviewing, which are disposable boxes and pallets in cardboard provided by Papyrus Supplies. In order to fulfil the aim and answer the research questions, an extensive part of the study was to understand and to map the current state of Volvo Group’s internal logistics processes by conducting a Material Flow Mapping. The flows decided to follow were two pallet flows and four box flows. The six flows together covered all logistics processes that the disposable packaging needed to be tested in, in order to ensure endurance and applicability before a possible implementation. To evaluate the packaging performance, the disposable packaging alternative provided by Papyrus Supplies have been analysed from four different packaging requirements: the protective perspective, the handling efficiency perspective, the ergonomic perspective, and the information perspective. The main conclusions made from analysing the disposable packaging based on these four perspectives are that the disposable packaging solutions could, in the rough, be handled in the same internal logistics processes up to the handling and collection of empty packaging. The breakdown of empty cardboard packaging does require new processes, as well as space and locations for handling of empty packaging...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} choice of {{packaging}} {{is important in}} achieving an efficient materials supply, and a central choice is between <b>returnable</b> and one-way <b>packaging.</b> This paper seeks to identify contextual variables governing the choice, from a cost and CO 2 footprint perspective. Data are analysed {{in a case of}} an automotive company, covering approx. 900 components. Results show how much five cost/CO 2 variables and three contextual variables (cubic utilisation, transport distance, packaging size) contribute to the cost and CO 2 difference between the packaging options, and that both types of packaging systems should be utilized to minimize costs and CO 2 emissions...|$|R
40|$|This study, {{drawing on}} natural resource-based view (NRBV), {{identifies}} drivers, barriers {{and the potential}} benefits of <b>Returnable</b> Transport <b>Packaging</b> (RTP) –that is, the repeated use of packaging items– and conceptualises RTP as a technology and resource that supports organisational competitiveness. Specifically, it investigates the impact of RTP adoption on business performance, the effects of drivers, barriers and size of organisations. The data collection took place in Nigeria and South Africa. The findings suggest that RTP has a significant positive impact on business performance. Whilst prior studies seem to suggest that shrinkage and attrition are the major problems identified with the usage of RTP, our findings indicate that there are several other barriers affecting RTP adoption and the resultant performance advantage. The results also show that there is increasing move towards adoption of RTP but some organisations are faced with financial constraints, especially the small and medium size enterprises. In addition, the results show that RTP is largely a ‘sustainability facing’ initiative with adoptee motivated primarily by potential environmental, economic, social and operational benefits of adoption...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of different control strategies on the management of returnable transport items (RTIs) in closed-loop supply chains. A simulation model is developed based on an empirical case and is used to explore different scenarios. The {{results suggest that the}} choice of control strategy has a significant impact on investments and operating costs, and that RTI shrinkage can be controlled either through the use of tracking systems, or choice of control strategy. Moreover, a simulation-based method for estimating the fleet size required to operate the system for the different strategies is presented.
