If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.|$|E

40|$|Background Although the “right not to know” is well {{established}} in international regulations, it has been heavily debated. Ubiquitous results from extended exome and genome analysis have challenged the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Recommendations urge to inform about incidental findings that pretend to be accurate and actionable. However, ample clinical cases raise the question whether these criteria are met. Many incidental findings are of uncertain significance (IFUS). The eager to feedback information appears to enter the field of IFUS and thereby threaten the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> This makes it imperative to investigate the arguments for and against a <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> for IFUS. Discussion This article investigates how the various arguments for and against a <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> hold for IFUS. The main investigated arguments are: hypothetical utilitarianism, the right-based argument, the feasibility argument, the value of knowledge argument, the argument from lost significance, the empirical argument, the duty to disclose argument, the avoiding harm argument; the argument from principle, from autonomy, from privacy, {{as well as the}} argument from the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> an open future. The analysis shows that both sides in the debate have exaggerated the importance of incidental findings. Summary Opponents of a <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> have exaggerated the importance of IFUS, while proponents have exaggerated the need to be protected from something that is not knowledge. Hence, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> or not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is not the question. The question is whether {{we should be able to}} stay ignorant of incidental findings of uncertain significance, if we want to. The answer is yes: As long as the information is not accurate and/or actionable: ignorance is bliss. When answering questions that are not asked, we need to think twice...|$|R

25|$|The Sixth Amendment (1791) {{provides}} several protections {{and rights}} {{to an individual}} accused of a crime. The accused {{has the right to}} a fair and speedy trial by a local and impartial jury. Likewise, a person has the right to a public trial. This right protects defendants from secret proceedings that might encourage abuse of the justice system, and serves to keep the public informed. This amendment also guarantees a right to legal counsel if accused of a crime, guarantees that the accused may require witnesses to attend the trial and testify {{in the presence of the}} accused, and guarantees the accused a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the charges against them. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that, with the Fifth Amendment, this amendment requires what has become known as the Miranda warning.|$|E

40|$|Moral intuitions, judgments, and {{justifications}} {{may change}} over time. This thesis discuss {{the relation between}} moral change and technological change in a particular case. I present the bioethical debate on the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> as discussed {{in the context of}} Huntington’s disease {{on the one hand and}} in the context of direct-to-consumer tests on the other hand. I compare the bioethical debates «then and now», as a way of mapping the differences in normative argumentation. As a tool to understand these differences and changes, I will use Tsjalling Swierstra’s concept of technomoral change. The questions of the theses are the following: How has our understanding of, and justification for, a <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about genetic information changed from the development of genetic testing for Huntington’s disease to today’s direct-to-consumer genetic testing? Can Swierstra’s conceptualization of technomoral change help us understand and discuss such chan ges? I argue that this is the case, that our normative justifications of a <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> has been subject to technomoral change, and that Swierstra offer tools for meaningful discussion of such changes, and in effect, a way of better handling such changes. The structure of my argument is built upon the interplay of two discussions: Swierstra’s meta-discussion on technomoral change, and a substantial bioethical discussion on the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in what I refer to as two technomoral periods...|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is often defended {{on the basis}} of the principle of respect for personal autonomy. If I choose not to acquire personal information that impacts on my future prospects, such a choice should be respected, because I should be able to decide whether to access information about myself and how to use it. But, according to the incoherence objection <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in the context of genetic testing, the choice not to acquire genetic information undermines the capacity for autonomous decision making. The claim is that it is incoherent to defend a choice that is inimical to autonomy by appealing to autonomy. In this paper, I suggest that the choice not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in the context of genetic testing does not undermine self-authorship, which is a key aspect of autonomous decision making. In the light of this, the incoherence objection <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> seems less compelling...|$|R
