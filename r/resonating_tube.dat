50|$|The {{concept of}} {{reducing}} the brass instrument size without reducing the <b>resonating</b> <b>tube</b> length {{can be seen in}} several 19th century models of cornet.Pocket cornets have been constructed since the 1870s and are used in marching bands.|$|E
50|$|The pan flute is an end-blown flute. Sound is {{produced}} by the vibration of an air-stream blowing across an open hole {{at the end of}} a <b>resonating</b> <b>tube.</b> The length of the tube determines the fundamental frequency. An overblown harmonic register is near a 12th above the fundamental in cylindrical tubes, but can approach an octave jump (8th) if a decreasing taper is used.|$|E
50|$|While in Belgium, Schilke became {{acquainted with}} the {{acoustical}} ideas of eighteenth century instrument designer and acoustical scientist Victor Mahillon. His theories described nodal points in a <b>resonating</b> <b>tube</b> that would dramatically affect the final pitch produced. Schilke used mathematics and measurements taken with a contact microphone and oscilloscope to identify these key nodes for each pitch in his horns. By making adjustments to {{the diameter of the}} tubing, or by eliminating intrusions into the geometric progression at these points, he improved the overall intonation.|$|E

50|$|The hosho are Zimbabwean musical {{instruments}} {{consisting of a}} pair of maranka (mapudzi) gourds with seeds. They typically contain hota (Canna indica) seeds inside them. The hosho are used to accompany Shona music, especially mbira music. They make a rattling sound that western ears may be unaccustomed to hearing. However, this accompaniment is essential when playing mbira and/or marimba music. So essential, in fact, that extra vibrating elements such as mirlitons (buzzing membranes made from spider webs) are attached to the <b>resonating</b> <b>tubes</b> of marimbas and machachara (miniature Hosho made from seashells or bottle caps) are attached to the mbira and its deze. Mbiras and marimbas from Africa; and even other instruments, such as drums, will have some kind of rattles associated with their use.|$|R
50|$|Coriolis meters have compensations from pitting, cracking, coating, erosion, and corrosion. These damages {{affect the}} way that the <b>tube</b> <b>resonates.</b> These changes affect the baseline. Compensations cannot be made dynamically. These damages {{typically}} cause offsets that can be added to the existing calibration factors that will ensure that a consistent reading is still acquired.|$|R
50|$|On woodwind {{instruments}} {{such as a}} flute or saxophone, {{keys are}} finger operated levers used to open or close tone holes, thereby shortening or lengthening the <b>resonating</b> <b>tube</b> of the instrument. The keys on the keyboard of a pipe organ also open and close various valves, but the air flow is driven mechanically rather than lung powered, and the flow of air is directed through different pipes tuned for each note. The keys of an accordion direct the air flow from a manually operated bellows across various tuned vibrating reeds.|$|E
40|$|When vibrating, {{the needs}} of wood wind {{instruments}} displace an amount of air that shifts the resonance frequency of the instrument {{in the same way}} as does a mouthpiece cavity. In cylindrical instruments, this shift corresponds to an effective lengthening of the <b>resonating</b> <b>tube.</b> In conical instruments, the shift is strongly frequency dependent and it is essential for bringing first and second mode in tune. © 1966, American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|The {{wavelength}} and {{end correction}} was investigated {{as a function}} of the tube length of a recorder over a range of frequencies. It was found that the period of the sound produced varies linearly with the recorder’s tube length, as expected. It was also found that the end correction does not vary {{as a function of}} frequency. However, the end correction at the hole was found to be much greater than the end correction at the end of a <b>resonating</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E
50|$|Higher {{in pitch}} than the jegog is the jublag or calung (pronounced chalung). This instrument, like jegog, also {{requires}} long <b>resonating</b> bamboo <b>tubes</b> so is often played while {{sitting on a}} small stool, and consists of one female/male pair. These instruments {{have a range of}} one octave, in between pemadé and ugal. Some have five keys (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) but seven key jublag are also commonly found in Bali (though gong kebyar ensembles typically do not use notes 4 and 7, using only the pelog selisir scale). It usually plays at submultiples of the pokok; the keys are struck more frequently than the jegogan and usually less frequently than the ugal (playing the pokok). The calung part is often the full the pokok while the ugal part includes some ornamentations and flourishes; however, the calung do not play full kebyar sequences, for example. This instrument is one octave above the jegogan and overlaps tones with the ugal.|$|R
5000|$|Many headers {{are also}} {{resonance}} tuned, {{to utilize the}} low-pressure reflected wave rarefaction pulse which can help scavenging the combustion chamber during valve overlap. This pulse is created in all exhaust systems each time a change in density occurs, such as when exhaust merges into the collector. For clarification, the rarefaction pulse is the technical term for the same process that was described above in the [...] "head, body, tail" [...] description. By tuning {{the length of the}} primary tubes, usually by means of resonance tuning, the rarefaction pulse can be timed to coincide with the exact moment valve overlap occurs. Typically, long primary <b>tubes</b> <b>resonate</b> at a lower engine speed than short primary tubes.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} work is to {{fabricate}} and evaluate a <b>resonating</b> silicon <b>tube</b> as a density and a Coriolis mass flow sensor. This project consists of three course works: a project work, a microelectronics project, and a master thesis. At first, the licenses needed {{to work with the}} clean room facilities were obtained. Several process steps were optimized/calibrated and finally, the first prototypes were fabricated. The fixtures and the electrodes were prepared. A quantitative model for the density/Coriolis mass flow sensor was derived. Several parameters like density sensitivity, pull-in-voltage, Q-factor, resonance frequency, burst pressure, the amplitude of Coriolis effect were investigated/formulated/calculated. An electrical-optical setup was prepared to evaluate the tube as a density sensor. The first three vibration modes were calibrated and the important parameters of a densitometer, quality factor and fluid density sensitivity, were measured. Several sources of loss were investigated. The effect of viscosity and flow were investigated and finally, the results were published in a journal paper and two conference papers. An optical-electrical setup was designed and implemented to detect the Coriolis effect using geometrical optics and MATLAB calculations. Detecting this effect and evaluating the mass flow sensor are the next steps...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFrom the conch {{shell and}} the cow horn {{to the modern}} orchestral brass section, lip-excited aerophones have {{played a central role}} in human music-making. Until the middle of the twentieth century the {{evolution}} and sophistication of brass instruments proceeded through a process of trial and error. In recent decades theoretical, experimental and computational scientific methods have been used to study the dynamics and aeroacoustics of sound production in lip-excited instruments. While considerable advances have been made in understanding the physics of the coupling between the lips of the player and the acoustic modes of the <b>resonating</b> <b>tube,</b> and the effects of bore profile on sound propagation and radiation, success in applying this knowledge in the improvement of brass instrument design has been hampered by uncertainty as to the specification of musically relevant targets for optimisation. This question can be illuminated by considering the relationship between musical function and acoustical behaviour in instruments of earlier periods. The approach is illustrated by brief acoustical histories of two lip-excited instruments: the trombone and the serpent...|$|E
40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) {{produce a}} broad diversity of sounds ranging from infrasonic rumbles to much higher frequency trumpets. Trumpet calls are very loud voiced signals given by highly aroused elephants, {{and appear to}} be produced by a forceful expulsion of air through the trunk. Some trumpet calls have a very distinctive quality that is unique in the animal kingdom, but resemble the "brassy" sounds that can be produced with brass musical instruments such as trumpets or trombones. Brassy musical sounds are characterised by a flat spectral slope caused by the nonlinear propagation of the source wave as it travels through the long bore of the instrument. The extent of this phenomenon, which normally occurs at high intensity levels (e. g. fortissimo), depends on the fundamental frequency (F 0) of the source {{as well as on}} the length of the <b>resonating</b> <b>tube.</b> Interestingly, the length of the vocal tract of the elephant (as measured from the vocal folds to the end of the trunk) approximates the critical length for shockwave formation, given the fundamental frequency and intensity of trumpet calls. We suggest that this phenomenon could explain the unique, distinctive brassy quality of elephant trumpet calls...|$|E
40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a non-intrusive {{technique}} for simultaneously measuring the velocities at many {{points in a}} fluid flow. The fluid is seeded with tracer particles and the region under investigation is illuminated. An image of the illuminated region is captured and then, a short time period later, a second image is taken. Suitable analysis of these images yields an instantaneous velocity vector map. Until recently, restrictions in {{the rate at which}} images could be captured have limited the PIV technique to the analysis of slow flows. However, advances in camera technology have now opened up the possibility of using PIV in the analysis of faster flows. Indeed, image capture rates are now fast enough to enable two images to be captured during a fraction of an acoustic cycle, indicating the potential for using PIV to analyse sound fields. In this thesis, after some aspects of sound field theory have been outlined and following a discussion of the theory of PIV, the development of experimental PIV apparatus for measuring sound fields is described. Measurements of the temporal variation in the velocities of particles within some common sound fields are presented. In particular, the passage of an acoustic pulse is monitored and the sinusoidal motion of particles in a <b>resonating</b> <b>tube</b> is recorded yielding the corresponding standing wave pattern. Finally, the main limitations of the PIV technique when applied to acoustic fields are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|A {{closed tube}} (also called a [...] "stopped pipe" [...] in the organ) is a tube which is closed at one end. The tube has a {{fundamental}} frequency {{but can be}} overblown to produce other higher frequencies or notes. These overblown registers can be tuned by using different degrees of conical taper. A closed <b>tube</b> <b>resonates</b> at the same fundamental frequency as an open tube twice its length, with a wavelength equal to four times its length. In a closed tube, a displacement node, or point of no vibration, always appears at the closed end and if the <b>tube</b> is <b>resonating,</b> it will have an antinode, or point greatest vibration at the Phi point (length × 0.618) near the open end.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a simple and}} inexpensive sensor capable of weighing microgram- scale objects in fluid. When objects flow through a glass tube that is vibrating at its resonance frequency, the frequency changes by an amount that is inversely proportional to the object’s buoyant mass. By measuring this frequency change, microgram objects can be weighed in fluid with nanogram-scale resolution. These sensors are easily fabricated, require no labels or tags, and are versatile, making them a valuable instrument for both in situ and laboratory measurements. They are fully automated and can measure any appropriately sized object {{in a wide range}} of biological, physical, and chemical applications. Using <b>resonating</b> glass <b>tubes,</b> we demonstrate the mass change detected in zebrafish (D. rerio) embryos as they are exposed to various toxicants, the water uptake and germination of dry seeds as they are put in water, and degradation rates in biomaterials in different fluid media. Aside from the experimental data from two separate resonator geometries, we also present simulations on other geometries that can be explored for these sensors. We explore the advantages and disadvantages in each geometry and potential sources of measurement error associated with the resonators. The simulations allow us to predict the resolution and the quality factor of the resonator before a prototype is developed. We took advantage of various rapid prototyping techniques, including 3 D printing for developing these sensors. In this process, we discovered that 3 D printed parts produce a toxic effect in zebrafish embryos. This observation led to a separate project, in which we assessed the toxicity of printed parts from two main classes of commercial 3 D printers, fused deposition modeling and stereolithography. We used zebrafish embryos, a widely used model organism in aquatic toxicology and monitored them for rates of survival, hatching, and developmental abnormalities. We found that parts from both types of printers were measurably toxic, with STL-printed parts significantly more toxic than FDM-printed parts. We also developed a simple post-printing treatment (exposure to ultraviolet light) that largely mitigates the toxicity of the STL-printed parts. Our results call attention to the need for strategies for the safe use and disposal of 3 D-printed parts and printer waste materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of weak shocks in ducts of complex geometry {{and the sound}} radiation produced by the reflection of a weak shock from the open end of a duct have been investigated. Duct geometries include expansion chambers with and without inlet or outlet tubes extended and enclosed perforated tubes. Internal and external pressure histories of the interaction of weak shocks with simple muffler elements have been recorded using a standard one-shot shock <b>tube</b> and a <b>resonating</b> shock <b>tube.</b> The excitation shock Mach number ranged from 1. 05 to 1. 55. Analytical investigations, including a synthesis of existing works on internal weak-shock interactions of an acoustic treatment of the sound radiation produced by weak shock waves, are presented. Combining the above analyses, models for the reduction in radiated sound per unit of incident shock amplitude, {{as a result of}} inserting a muffler between the source and the tailpipe exit, are developed. For expansion chambers with and without extensions, the dependence of the transmitted and reflected waves and of the radiated sound on area ratio is compared with predictions. In particular, measured transmission coefficients for expansion chambers agree reasonably well with the predictions for all shock strengths; however, for large area ratios, the predicted sound attenuation is not observed, as waves diffracted at the upstream junction cause more sound to be radiated. For expansion chambers with internal extensions, sound attenuation is increased for low incident shock strengths; while for increasing incident shock strength, the internal transmission characteristics deteriorate, the reducing the sound attenuation. For enclosed perforated tubes, the dependence of the transmitted and reflected waves and of the radiated sound on the perforated area ratio and incident shock strength is compared with predictions. For perforated tubes with infinite enclosure, the transmission and reflection coefficients depend on both incident shock strength and perforated area ratio, as predicted. However, agreement with data is obtained only after inserting a perforated discharge coefficient with the perforated area ratio in the theory. The reduction of sound radiation with perforated area ratio is measured for one incident shock strength and then compared with predictions. For small area ratios, there is agreement but for large area ratios the measurements show that less sound is radiated than predicted. For large area ratios, gradual compressions with smooth fronts (not shock fronts) are transmitted, resulting in less radiated sound. Enclosures have no effect on the sound attenuation for small perforate area ratios; however, as the perforate area ratio increases, the enclosure eventually inhibits further increase in sound attenuation...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{refrigerating}} fluids {{compatible with}} the environment and which do not present problems of safety appears the air, ideal as regards the safety of both as regards the availability and cost. The air {{is used as a}} refrigerant since the beginning of refrigeration applications. It presents the ODP and GWP indices equal to zero, but its use has always been penalized by the low energy performance of the Brayton-Joule inverse cycle, compared to vapor compression cycles so as to exclude its use in air conditioning systems of buildings. A cooling system with acoustic resonator uses the direct conversion of mechanical work, associated with the wave propagation, in a transfer of heat from a heat source at low temperature to a source at a higher temperature. One problem in the use of an acoustic resonator is the realization and the position of the heat exchanger within the resonant volume of air. With regard to the position in a thermoacoustic tube resonator, it is mandatory to preliminarily know what the conditions of the resonant air column are, since it gets excited by an outside power source, whose form and position determine the resonance conditions. In the present paper, a simple model is presented and the definition of an effective length of the <b>resonating</b> <b>tube</b> of a thermoacoustic refrigerator is properly given. Few data are also given relative to the temperature difference obtained in a specific experimental case...|$|E
