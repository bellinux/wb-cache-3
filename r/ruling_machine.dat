2500|$|Thorp died at Prestatyn on 13 June 1914, {{leaving a}} widow and three sons, one of whom– Franklin– also had involvements {{in the gas}} industry. He was buried at All Saints' Church, Stand, a few days later. He also left a {{partially}} developed scheme for the manufacture of a <b>ruling</b> <b>machine</b> that obviated {{the need for a}} screw drive, being controlled instead by a mercury clepsydra and micrometre valve, and had been working on the design of a cinema screen. Thorp's Cooke telescope was given by the family to Stand Grammar School. One obituarist remarked on his [...] "unassuming and genial manner to all with whom he came into contact, and his readiness to explain and to make suggestions on any subject in which his wide knowledge could be of any assistance." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the South China Morning Post, Yvette Leh {{rated the}} film 3/5, stating [...] "Ho, who directed, wrote and co-produced the film, {{is to be}} commended for an ambitious work packed with {{substantive}} content and believable characters." [...] Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter showed less enthusiasm: [...] "the initial rage against Hong Kong's <b>ruling</b> <b>machine</b> ... quickly dissipates to reveal clichéd romantic or familial melodrama".|$|E
50|$|Brian George William Manning (14 May 1926 - 10 November 2011) was an English {{astronomer}} {{who discovered}} 19 minor planets. He {{was born in}} 1926 in Birmingham. He constructed his first mirror from a piece of glass that a World War II bomb blew out of {{the roof of the}} factory where his father worked. He began as an engineering draughtsman but later became a metrologist at the University of Birmingham. In the late 1950s, he constructed an interference-controlled <b>ruling</b> <b>machine</b> in a home workshop, which was able to rule high-quality 3 by 2 inch gratings. In 1990, he received the H. E. Dall prize of the BAA.|$|E

5|$|The {{convention}} met from June 12, 1901 to June 26, 1902, at Richmond in the Capitol Building {{and elected}} John Goode, Jr. its presiding officer, a former {{delegate to the}} 1861 Secessionist Convention. Progressives sought to reform corrupt political practices of the <b>ruling</b> Martin <b>machine</b> and to regulate railroads and big corporations. Martin delegates agreed to restrict suffrage of African-Americans and illiterate whites, and a State Corporation Commission was established. When the railroads challenged the State Corporation Commission's constitutionality on the grounds it violated separation of powers, the commission was upheld in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century, new tools made engraving much easier and more exact. The <b>ruling</b> <b>machine</b> created parallel straight or wavy lines very close together, usually for use with etching. [...] Another of these tools is the geometric lathe. The lathe is used to engrave images on plates, which are in turn engraved on rolls for such uses as printing banknotes. Another of these tools is the engraving machine. This machine uses a master template to lightly engrave a duplicate image which can be then engraved by hand or etched with acid. The machine also makes possible the reduction or enlargement of the letter for the duplicate image.|$|E
50|$|During the 1820s steel {{began to}} replace copper as the {{preferred}} medium of commercial publishers for illustration, but still rivaled by wood engraving and later lithography. Steel engraving produced plates with sharper, harder, more distinct lines. Also, the harder steel plates produced much longer wearing dies that could strike thousands of copies {{before they would}} need any repair or refurbishing engraving. The hardness of steel also allowed for much finer detail than {{would have been possible}} with copper, which would have quickly deteriorated under the resulting stress. As the nineteenth century began to close, devices such as the <b>ruling</b> <b>machine</b> made even greater detail possible, allowing for more exact parallel lines in very close proximity. Commercial etching techniques also gradually replaced steel engraving.|$|E
5000|$|Gobrecht {{was born}} on December 23, 1785, in Hanover, Pennsylvania, to Reverend John C. Gobrecht, who came to America from Germany in 1755, and Elizabeth Sands, with ancestry going back to 1642 in Plymouth Colony. After apprenticing in Manheim, Pennsylvania, he {{engraved}} ornamental clockworks in Baltimore, Maryland, until he moved to Philadelphia in 1811 to join Murray, Draper, Fairman, and Company, an engraving firm, around 1816. [...] He invented a medal <b>ruling</b> <b>machine</b> in 1810, which he improved upon in 1817. In 1823, Mint Director Robert Patterson sought to engage Gobrecht as assistant director, but Gobrecht declined the position. Instead, in December, Gobrecht sought the position of chief engraver of the Mint, writing to President James Monroe. Instead, the position went to William Kneass.|$|E
40|$|A good POS tagger is a {{critical}} component of a machine translation system and other related NLP applications where an appropriate POS tag will be assigned to individual words in a collection of texts. There is not enough POS tagged corpus available in Manipuri language <b>ruling</b> out <b>machine</b> learning approaches for a POS tagger in the language. A morphology driven Manipuri POS tagger that uses three dictionaries containing root words, prefixes and suffixes has been designed and implemented using the affix information irrespective of the context of the words. We have tested the current POS tagger on 3784 sentences containing 10917 unique words. The POS tagger demonstrated an accuracy of 69 %. Among the incorrectly tagged 31 % words, 23 % were unknown words (includes 9 % named entities) and 8 % known words were wrongly tagged. ...|$|R
50|$|By {{this time}} the William Street {{building}} {{had been reduced to}} secondary or service functions, including printing of railway tickets. The ground floor was a store, the first floor was used as a <b>machine</b> <b>ruling</b> room, and the second floor was the artists and process workroom. Around this time new windows were inserted to the top floor and new dormers were added to the roof (all since removed), and the toilets and lift {{at the end of the}} rear wing were demolished. From the end of the first floor rear verandah, a gallery ran to the former engine room and the Lithographic Office.|$|R
2500|$|The Model 1927 was {{the open}} bolt semi-automatic-only {{version of the}} M1921. It was made by modifying an {{existing}} Model 1921, including replacing certain parts. The [...] "Thompson Submachine Gun" [...] inscription was machined over {{to replace it with}} [...] "Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine", and the [...] "Model 1921" [...] inscription was also machined over to replace it with [...] "Model 1927." [...] Although the Model 1927 was semi-automatic only, it was easily converted to fully automatic by installing a full-auto Model 1921 fire control group (internal parts). Most Model 1927s owned by police have been converted back to full-auto. The original Model 1927 is classified as a machine gun under the National Firearms Act of 1934 (a) by being [...] "readily convertible" [...] by swapping parts and (b) by a 1982 BATF ruling making all open bolt semi-automatic firearms manufactured after the date of this <b>ruling</b> classified as <b>machine</b> guns.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a system modeling based control scheme of an ultra precision positioning {{system for a}} grating <b>ruling</b> <b>machine.</b> Since the positioning system having a long stroke with ultra precision, the positioning system consists of a coarse positioning stage driven by a servo motor and a fine positioning stage driven by a piezoelectric ceramic. In order to improve positional accuracy and remove the noise components of motion, a hybrid control scheme based on the system modeling is implemented. Considering position-dependent and time-dependent behaviors of the stages, a model based LQ controller is utilized to the coarse stage and a PID feedback controller based on neural network is utilized to the fine stage. Experiment results reveal the efficient and robust of the control scheme and show that the positional accuracy has been readily achieved within 8. 6 nm...|$|E
40|$|Ultra precise {{reflective}} and diffractive optical elements like blazed {{diffraction gratings}} or ultra precise mirrors of flat, elliptic, parabolic, or other shapes have become key components in today s synchrotron optics. These optical components feature nanometre accuracy on a macroscopic length scale. Beamlines with extreme lengths of 100 m to 1 km or more as {{planned for the}} European XFEL will require plane mirrors characterized by a residual slope error of 50 nrad rms and a curvature radius of gt; 1000 km on a length of 800 mm or even more. Diffraction limited focusing mirrors for hard X ray application show residual slope deviations of 50 nrad rms on a length of 350 mm. The current slope limit for focusing mirrors in VUV application lies at around 0. 5 rad rms, one order of magnitude inferior compared to hard X ray focusing optics, and it can still not be exceeded due to technological restrictions. The requirements for diffraction gratings are even more challenging. In addition to the challenges posed by perfect substrate quality, special attention is needed to guaranty a precise positioning of the grooves along the full aperture length. A positioning accuracy of about 20 nm for the carriage system of a ruling engine is mandatory to meet the Marechal tolerance for gratings. For the manufacture of blazed and laminar gratings, we are currently establishing a new technological laboratory at the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin HZB, including instrumentation from Carl Zeiss. Besides the present Zeiss technology, we are also developing an advanced technology line, including a new ultra precise <b>ruling</b> <b>machine,</b> ion etching technology as well as laser holograph...|$|E
5000|$|The front (William Street) {{wing of the}} new {{building}} stood {{on the site of}} the 1862 building, which had been demolished in late 1872. The new William Street building had an [...] "L" [...] shape and extended onto the (recently repurchased) land previously occupied by the Commandant's residence, wrapping around the south-east side of the 1865 building. It had an arcade to the street frontage of the ground floor, and the roof was covered in Welsh slate to reduce the risk of fire. Narrow rear verandahs were located on the north-west side of the first and second floors of the rear wing. The ground floor included a public counter, offices, newspaper room, and a large publishing room in the front wing, with a store in the rear wing. The first floor consisted of a composing room in the front wing, with a drying room in the rear wing; while the second floor contained a binding room in the front wing and a ruling room in the rear wing. It was connected to the 1865 building, which included a machine printing room on the ground floor, the engraving and lithographic work on the first floor, and <b>machine</b> <b>ruling</b> and book binding on the second floor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In many {{real-world}} scenarios, predictive models {{need to be}} interpretable, thus <b>ruling</b> {{out many}} <b>machine</b> learning techniques known to produce very accurate models, e. g., neural networks, support vector machines and all ensemble schemes. Most often, tree models or rule sets are used instead, typically resulting in significantly lower predictive performance. The over-all purpose of oracle coaching is to reduce this accuracy vs. comprehensibility trade-off by producing interpretable models optimized for the specific production set at hand. The method requires production set inputs to be present when generating the predictive model, a demand fulfilled in most, but not all, predic-tive modeling scenarios. In oracle coaching, a highly accurate, but opaque, model is first induced from the training data. This model (“the oracle”) is then used to label both the training instances and the production instances. Finally, interpretable models are trained using different combinations of the resulting data sets. In this paper, the oracle coaching produces regression trees, using neural networks and random forests as oracles. The experiments, using 32 publicly available data sets, show that the oracle coaching leads to significantly improved predictive performance, compared to standard induction. In addition, it is also shown that a highly accurate opaque model can be successfully used as a pre-processing step to reduce the noise typically present in data, even in situations where production inputs are not available. In fact, just augmenting or replacing training data with another copy of the training set, but with the predictions from the opaque model as targets, produced significantly more accurate and/or more compact regression trees.
