50|$|Founded in 2003, the National <b>Roads</b> <b>Authority</b> of Israel plans, {{develops}} {{and maintains}} {{most of the}} inter-city roads in Israel. This authority also builds and plans interchanges, bridges etc. The road length that is under control of the authority is approximately 6,500 km long. Some inter-city routes are built by concessionaires and private companies in exchange for payment from the government, outside of {{the responsibility of the}} National <b>Roads</b> <b>Authority,</b> while others are developed and maintained by regional or municipal <b>road</b> <b>authorities.</b> The National <b>Roads</b> <b>Authority</b> of Israel took over the responsibility for most of Israel's intercity roads from the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2003. Modern road development in the country began during the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1921 the Mandate government founded an engineering branch for carrying out infrastructure projects, this later became the PWD, which later evolved into the National <b>Roads</b> <b>Authority</b> of Israel. In ancient Israel the development of an unpaved yet extensive road system has been attributed to efforts under King Solomon (Herzog and Gichon, 1978, p.121).|$|R

25|$|Beltway 8, a state highway, runs mostly {{along the}} {{frontage}} roads of the tollway, only using the main lanes {{where they are}} free between Interstate Highway 45 (North Freeway) and Interstate Highway 69/U.S. 59 (Eastex Freeway). The main lanes elsewhere are the Sam Houston Tollway, a toll road {{owned and operated by}} the Harris County Toll <b>Road</b> <b>Authority</b> (HCTRA). East of Houston, the Tollway crosses the Houston Ship Channel on the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, a toll bridge; this forms a gap in Beltway 8 between Interstate Highway 10 (Baytown-East Freeway) and State Highway 225 (La Porte Freeway).|$|E

25|$|In 2000 {{increased}} {{traffic levels}} and congestion led to plans being approved for widening of the freeway to 16 lanes with {{a capacity for}} 200,000 cars per day. An old railway running along {{the north side of}} the freeway was demolished in 2002 in preparation for construction which began in 2004. The interior two lanes in each direction between SH6 and west I-610, the Katy Freeway Managed Lanes or Katy Tollway, were built as high-occupancy toll lanes and are managed by the Harris County Toll <b>Road</b> <b>Authority.</b> The section just west of SH6 to the Fort Bend–Harris county line opened in late June 2006. Two intersections were rebuilt (Beltway 8 and I-610), toll booths were added, together with landscaping as part of Houston's Highway Beautification Project. Most of the section between Beltway8 and SH6 had been laid by September 2006 and work was completed in October 2008.|$|E

40|$|A great {{challenge}} for <b>road</b> <b>authorities</b> {{is to improve}} the effectiveness and efficiency of their core processes by improving data exchange and sharing using new technologies such as building information modeling (BIM). BIM has already been successfully implemented in other sectors, such as architecture. But the civil infrastructure sector still lags behind. This paper reports the core findings of the research undertaken in an FP 7 project called V-Con, Virtual Construction for Roads. In this EU-funded project, BIM technologies are being implemented at <b>road</b> <b>authorities.</b> Typical interest areas of the <b>road</b> <b>authorities</b> are the programming phase, in which requirements management and systems engineering play a key role, as well as the use and maintenance phase, in which asset management is essential. These processes require special attention in information management for <b>road</b> <b>authorities.</b> Furthermore, <b>road</b> <b>authorities</b> are interested in standardized “as designed” road information. IFC would be a good standard for this, but there is no “IFC for roads” yet. But <b>road</b> <b>authorities</b> are also interested in information about the context of the road, as usually defined in GIS. So GIS should be linked to the envisaged system as well. Finally, it was observed {{that there is a need}} in the infrastructure sector for so-called concept libraries, libraries with objects and concepts that can be located and managed on different levels (from project-specific to national and global). It was found that the support of such libraries requires changes in the way information modeling and exchange is commonly approached. The new approach is called “distributed modeling” and will be elaborated in this pape...|$|R
