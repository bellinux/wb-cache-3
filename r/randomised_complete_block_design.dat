Analysis of variance for a <b>randomised</b> <b>complete</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>design,</b> with subjects constituting blocks, was used to analyse heart rate, estimated maximal oxygen intake, and residual estimated maximal oxygen intake variations among the experimental conditions.

The experiment was conducted under field conditions in a <b>complete</b> <b>randomised</b> <b>block</b> <b>design.</b> The treatments consisted of soils with and without herbicide application {{as well as the}} absence and presence of C. ensiformis cultivation associated with incorporation into the soil or the removal of shoots of C. ensiformis.

Sulfentrazone application in areas without C. ensiformis cultivation decreased plants stands, productivity, and height of sorghum compared to treatments where C. ensiformis was cultivated. Sorghum cultivated in succession to C. ensiformis in areas contaminated with sulfentrazone resulted in dry matter production, plants numbers, productivity, and height of sorghum equivalent to uncontaminated areas. The results of this research indicate that the use of jack bean for the bioremediation of sulfentrazone treated soils would provide greater security in the planting of susceptible species in areas where this herbicide has been applied.

The mean number of adult whiteflies per plant was significantly greater on rme 1 mutants than on Motelle plants and slightly lower but not significantly different from those on Moneymaker. For the no-choice assay, 11 eight-week old plants of each genotype were kept in a growing chamber. Five adult female whiteflies were placed into a plastic clip-cage attached to the under surface of one leaf (one cage per plant). After 6 days, the averaged number of eggs observed on the rme 1 mutant plants was almost identical to Moneymaker and significantly greater than that observed on Motelle.

40|$|The {{concept of}} sward target {{has been used}} {{recently}} to characterise grazing management practices, but its efficiency to monitor and control sward structure questioned since it corresponds to a single sward structural feature, usually sward surface height. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate sward structure and its patterns of variation throughout the year on continuously stocked marandu palisadegrass swards maintained at 30 cm and subjected to contrasting rhythms of growth from January 2007 to April 2008. Treatments corresponded to three nitrogen application rates (150, 300 and 450 kg ha- 1 of N) plus the control (no N fertilisation), and were allocated to experimental units according to a <b>complete</b> <b>randomised</b> <b>block</b> <b>design,</b> with four replications. Sward herbage mass, morphological composition, leaf area index (LAI), foliage angle and light interception were evaluated. The increase in nitrogen application rates resulted in increased sward herbage mass, proportion of leaf and stem, and reduction {{in the proportion of}} dead material. These modifications were in line with the increase in LAI and reduction in foliage angle, although they did not modify sward light interception. Despite the wide range of nitrogen application rates used, there was a common pattern of variation in sward structure. Overall, changes in sward structural characteristics generated by the range of growth rhythms studied were small, indicating that sward height corresponded to an efficient way to monitor and control the grazing process and sward structure, and can be used to define targets of grazing management...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the effect of {{nitrogen}} (N) and potassium (K) fertilisation on the forage accumulation and nutritive value of Urochloa ruziziensis {{during the summer of}} 2010 / 2011 and autumn, winter, spring and summer of 2011 / 2012. A <b>complete</b> <b>randomised</b> <b>block</b> <b>design</b> with four treatments (0, 120, 240 and 360 kg ha- 1 year- 1 N and K 2 O) and five replicates were used. The data were analysed under the PROC MIXED of SAS®. The following variables were evaluated: sward height; forage mass; forage bulk density; percentages of leaf blade dry matter, stem dry matter, and dead material dry matter; leaf blade:stem ratio; contents of dry matter and crude protein; in vitro digestibility of dry matter; neutral detergent fibre content; and lignin content of Urochloa ruziziensis. There was an interaction between the N and K levels of fertilisation and the season for all variables. In addition, there was a positive linear effect of the N and K levels of fertilisation on the forage accumulation rate, the crude protein content and the in vitro digestibility of dry matter and a negative linear effect these levels on the neutral detergent fibre and lignin contents during {{the spring and summer of}} 2011 / 2012. N and K fertilisation and the climate changes characteristic of each season jointly affected the accumulation and nutritive value of Urochloa ruziziensis. N and K fertilisation up to 360 kg ha- 1 year- 1 improved the forage accumulation and nutritive value of Urochloa ruziziensis...|$|R
