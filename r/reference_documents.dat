The title has been {{modified}} in order to clarify {{the relationship between the}} <b>Reference</b> <b>Document</b> and the Garcia River Watershed Water Quality Attainment Action Plan for Sediment (Action Plan) and to avoid confusion between the two documents. The Action Plan consists of the portions of the Strategy that were modified and adopted by the Regional Water Quality Control Board as an amendment to the Water Quality Control Plan in December, 1998. This clarification also required all references to the “Strategy ” be modified to refer to the either the “Reference Document ” or the Action Plan. ” Other clarifications to the <b>Reference</b> <b>Document</b> include the addition of several sections into the Load Allocation chapter of the <b>Reference</b> <b>Document.</b> These sections include the General Discussion, Technical Rational for the Load Allocations, Analysis of the Load Allocation Contained in the Proposed Action Plan, and the Margin of Safety sections. These sections were produced for the December 1998 Regional Water Board Hearing and are now included in the <b>Reference</b> <b>Document</b> for ease of reference and technical support. Revisions were also made to the <b>Reference</b> <b>Document</b> so as to obtain complete consistency between the <b>Reference</b> <b>Document</b> and the Action Plan.
