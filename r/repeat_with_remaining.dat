50|$|An {{alternative}} {{method of preparation}} is taking each sheet of dough, laying it out flat and sprinkling some of the filling on it. Then, the sheet is rolled up into a tight roll with the filling {{on the inside of}} the roll. The long roll is then taken and rolled up in a circle. This first sheet of dough is then placed in the baking pan. The process is <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> sheets of dough and each consecutive roll is placed around the first one in the pan. The resulting shape resembles a spiral (see photo). The banitsa is then sprinkled with sunflower oil or melted butter and baked.|$|R

50|$|The final five contestants {{compete to}} win $2,000,000. Four contestants are {{isolated}} backstage {{while the first}} contestant selects a card containing a bar code from a rack of 100 cards. The bar code is scanned and a number between 1 and 100 is revealed; the contestant can keep that number or return the card to the rack and select a second card to scan. After the contestant makes their decision and their final number is revealed, the next contestant is brought out and follows the same process. However, the current high-scoring number is not revealed to the current contestant until after they decide to keep or return their first card; they must base their decision solely on the number they have selected first. The process <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> contestants and the contestant whose number is the highest after all five have played wins $2,000,000.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{technique}} to compute the maximum of a weighted sum of the objective functions in multiple objective linear fractional programming (MOLFP). The basic idea of the technique is to divide (by the approximate [`]middle') the non-dominated region in two sub-regions and to analyze each of {{them in order to}} discard one if it can be proved that the maximum of the weighted sum is in the other. The process is <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> region. The process will end when the remaining regions are so little that the differences among their non-dominated solutions are lower than a pre-defined error. Through the discarded regions it is possible to extract conditions that establish weight indifference regions. These conditions define the variation range of the weights that necessarily leads to the same non-dominated solution. An example, illustrating the concept, is presented. Some computational results indicating the performance of the technique are also presented. [URL]...|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} members of each family {{appeared}} at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family's bank. The process then <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the four <b>remaining</b> members from each family. On {{the first half of}} the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.|$|R
50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. <b>Repeat</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> fastnachts.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: We studied intra-individual and inter-individual {{variability}} of two online sedation monitors, BIS and Entropy, in volunteers under sedation. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were sedated in a stepwise manner with doses of either midazolam and remifentanil or dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. One week later {{the procedure was}} <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> drug combination. The doses were adjusted to achieve three different sedation levels (Ramsay Scores 2, 3 and 4) and controlled by a computer-driven drug-delivery system to maintain stable plasma concentrations of the drugs. At each level of sedation, BIS and Entropy (response entropy and state entropy) values were recorded for 20 minutes. Baseline recordings were obtained before the sedative medications were administered. RESULTS: Both inter-individual and intra-individual variability increased as the sedation level deepened. Entropy values showed greater variability than BIS(R) values, and the variability was greater during dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation than during midazolam/remifentanil sedation. CONCLUSIONS: The large intra-individual and inter-individual {{variability of}} BIS and Entropy values in sedated volunteers makes the determination of sedation levels by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) variables impossible. Reports in the literature which draw conclusions based on processed EEG variables obtained from sedated intensive care unit (ICU) patients may be inaccurate due to this variability.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{technique}} to compute non-dominated solutions, with an error {{that can be made}} as low as the user wants, in multiple objective linear fractional programming (MOLFP), using reference points. The basic idea is to divide, by the approximate ‘middle’, the non-dominate region in two sub-regions and to analyze each of them {{in order to try to}} discard one. The process is <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> region and it ends when the regions are so little that the differences among their non-dominated solutions are lower than a predefined error. The results of several tests to the technique performance are reported. We also report a financial planning model with multiple linear fractional objectives, and propose a straightforward computational tool implementing the above mentioned technique to help the decision maker (DM) finding the most preferred non-dominated solution. The financial planning model includes three objective functions: (1) the maximization of the company net present value; (2) the maximization of the average interest cover ratio during the planning period; and (3) the maximization of a productivity ratio. The management of the company has to evaluate a set of investment projects, simultaneously considering a series of financing decisions like: the balance of funds, dividend distribution policy, debt and equity issuing limitations. We tested the model with a set of 10 projects over a 6 year planning period resulting on a problem with 45 decision variables and 38 constraints. The computation technique proved to be fast enough to deal with this model in an interactive way, using a desktop computer...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} there were decreas-es in insulin-like growth factors (IGF) -I and-II and increases in low-molecular-mass IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) in associa-tion with an inhibition of aromatase activity (AA) and follicular fluid estradiol (E 2) production during progesterone (P 4) -induced dominant follicle atresia in cattle. Twelve cycling cows received a norgestomet ear implant at proestrus for 9 days and were as-signed to control (n = 3) or P 4 -treated (n = 9) groups. Injections of P 4 (150 mg, i. m.) were given on Days 3 and 4; Days 3, 4, and 5; or Days 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the implant period. Controls received injections of corn oil on Days 3, 4, 5, and 6. Ultrasonography of the dominant follicle and blood sampling were done daily. Unilateral ovariectomy was done one day after the last injection. The experiment was <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> ovary (6 fol-licles/treatment group). Granulosa cells were cultured with ra-diolabeled testosterone to measure AA. Steroid hormones, IGF-I, and IGF-II were measured in follicular fluid by RIA. The follic-ular fluid IGFBP profile was quantified by Western ligand blot-ting. P 4 -treated cows showed a drastic reduction in AA in the dominant follicles, and follicular fluid E was several times lower than in controls. Moreover, in P 4 -treated groups, concentrations of follicular fluid IGF-I and IGF-II were lower than in controls. The quantity of low-molecular-mass follicular fluid IGFBPs in-creased in P 4 -treated groups. Accumulation of low-molecular-mass IGFBPs with a reduction in IGFs may be a mechanism of dominant follicle atresia during the bovine estrous cycle...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} ergogenic effect of short-term oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation {{and the associated}} changes in redox balance and inflammation during intense training. Methods: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover design {{was used to assess}} 9 d of oral NAC supplementation (1200 mg·d⁻¹) in 10 well-trained triathletes. For each supplement trial (NAC and placebo), baseline venous blood and urine samples were taken, and a presupplementation cycle ergometer race simulation was performed. After the loading period, further samples were collected preexercise, postexercise, and 2 and 24 h after the postsupplementation cycle ergometer race simulation. Changes in total antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing ability of plasma, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, interleukin 6, xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, nuclear factor κB, and urinary 15 -isoprostane F 2 t concentration were assessed. The experimental procedure was <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>remaining</b> supplement after a 3 -wk washout. Eight participants completed both supplementation trials. Results: NAC improved sprint performance during the cycle ergometer race simulation (P p ² = 0. 03). Supplementation with NAC also augmented postexercise plasma total antioxidant capacity (P = 0. 005, η p ² = 0. 19), reduced exercise-induced oxidative damage (plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, P = 0. 002, η p ² = 0. 22; urinary 15 -isoprostane F 2 t concentration, P = 0. 010, η p ² = 0. 431), attenuated inflammation (plasma interleukin 6, P = 0. 002, η p ² = 0. 22; monocyte chemotactic protein 1, P = 0. 012, η p ² = 0. 17), and increased postexercise nuclear factor κB activity (P p ² = 0. 21). Conclusion: Oral NAC supplementation improved cycling performance via an improved redox balance and promoted adaptive processes in well-trained athletes undergoing strenuous physical training...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{ascertain}} the relative activity offive oxytocin antagonists (OTAs) in vivo in a tethered pregnant baboon model and compare these results to previously reported affinities in human and rat oxytocin receptor assays and {{median effective dose}} in rat uterotonic bioassays. METHODS: Pregnant tethered baboons between days 130 and 160 ofpregnancy were given an oxytocin challenge test 1 minute after infusion of 1 mg of one offive randomly selected OTAs: ANTAG I, ANTAG II, ANTAG III, L 366948, and Atosiban. Once the uterine response to oxytocin returned to normal (1 - 8 days) the OCT was <b>repeated</b> <b>with</b> one ofthe <b>remaining,</b> untested OTAs during the 130 - 160 day period. Uterine activity, the time until the first significant response, and the dose of oxytocin needed to induce this response were allfactored into one expression, the antagonist-response interval (ARI). RESULTS: 4 hen expressed as ratio to ANTAG I the relative ARIfor the OTAs were 0,. 5, 1. 0, 2. 4 and 59. 2 for L 366948, Atosiban, ANTAG I, ANTAG II, and ANTAG III, respectively.
