50|$|Although {{it appears}} like trading {{relationships}} determine the <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> production, Marx argues that in aggregate (in an overall sense) {{it is just}} the other way round: the <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> the direct production process (the mode of production) determine the <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> exchange. This justifies the initial analysis of production in abstraction from all kinds of price fluctuations.|$|R

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{note that}} Tibetan leaders during the Ming frequently engaged in {{civil war and}} conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as Nepal. Some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the Ming-Tibetan relationship, noting the Ming dynasty's shortage of horses for warfare and thus {{the importance of the}} horse trade with Tibet. Others argue that the significant religious nature of the <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> the Ming court with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. In hopes of reviving the unique <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> the earlier Mongol leader Kublai Khan (r.1260–1294) and his spiritual superior Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Yongle Emperor (r.1402–1424) made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with Deshin Shekpa (1384–1415), the Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school. However, the Yongle Emperor's attempts were unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure It Out.
