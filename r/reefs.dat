5|$|Approximately 10% of the world's coral <b>reefs</b> are dead. About 60% of the world's <b>reefs</b> {{are at risk}} due to human-related activities. The {{threat to}} reef health is {{particularly}} strong in Southeast Asia, where 80% of <b>reefs</b> are endangered. Over 50% of the world's coral <b>reefs</b> may be destroyed by 2030; as a result, most nations protect them through environmental laws.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral <b>reefs</b> {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. <b>Reefs</b> are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the <b>reefs</b> themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, <b>reefs</b> are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on <b>reefs</b> provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage <b>reefs</b> in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the <b>reefs.</b> Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|A major {{scientific}} {{controversy over}} the origin of coral <b>reefs</b> {{took place in the}} late 19th Century, between supporters of Darwin's theory (such as the American geologist James Dwight Dana, who early in his career had seen coral <b>reefs</b> in Hawaii and Fiji during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition), and those who supported a rival theory put forward by the Scottish oceanographer John Murray, who participated in the 1872–76 Challenger expedition. Murray's theory challenged Darwin's notion of subsidence, proposing instead that coral <b>reefs</b> formed when accumulating mounds of calcareous marine sediments reached the shallow depths that could support the growth of corals. Amongst Murray's supporters was the independently wealthy American scientist Alexander Agassiz, who financed and undertook several expeditions to the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean regions to examine coral <b>reefs</b> in search of evidence to support Murray's theory, and to discredit Darwin.|$|E

5|$|Coral <b>reefs</b> form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, <b>reefs</b> provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing <b>reefs</b> just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the <b>reefs</b> protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the <b>reefs</b> for protection or breeding.|$|E
5|$|Local economies near major coral <b>reefs</b> {{benefit from}} an {{abundance}} of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. <b>Reefs</b> also provide recreational scuba diving and snorkeling tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such as Green Fins that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} types of shallow-water coral reef, {{including}} fringing <b>reefs,</b> barrier <b>reefs</b> and atolls; most occur in tropical and subtropical seas. They are very slow-growing, adding perhaps one centimetre (0.4in) in height each year. The Great Barrier Reef {{is thought to have}} been laid down about two million years ago. Over time, corals fragment and die, sand and rubble accumulates between the corals, and the shells of clams and other molluscs decay to form a gradually evolving calcium carbonate structure. Coral <b>reefs</b> are extremely diverse marine ecosystems hosting over 4,000 species of fish, massive numbers of cnidarians, molluscs, crustaceans, and many other animals.|$|E

5|$|Coral <b>reefs</b> {{and shallow}} marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate <b>reefs,</b> and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|Coral <b>reefs</b> {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral <b>reefs</b> are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the <b>reefs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coral <b>reefs</b> {{are under}} stress around the world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, 16% of the world's <b>reefs</b> {{died as a}} result of increased water temperature.|$|E

25|$|Coral <b>reef</b> {{ecosystems}} contain distinct zones {{that represent}} {{different kinds of}} habitats. Usually, three major zones are recognized: the fore <b>reef,</b> <b>reef</b> crest, and the back <b>reef</b> (frequently {{referred to as the}} <b>reef</b> lagoon).|$|R
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among <b>reefs</b> is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from <b>reefs,</b> and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|Corals {{that grow}} on <b>reefs</b> are called hermatypic, with those growing {{elsewhere}} {{are known as}} ahermatypic. Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both shallow and deep sea habitats. In the deep sea they share the ecosystem with soft corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. In the Atlantic Ocean, the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa forms extensive deep-water <b>reefs</b> which support many other species.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{damage was}} {{widespread}} but generally mild. Although damage to mangroves was minor, the cyclone defoliated swaths of many coastal and island forests. For the most part, cays and <b>reefs</b> were unharmed, with no visible {{change in the}} general appearance or shape of <b>reefs</b> and little underwater change as well. It was noted, however, that water clarity surrounding certain <b>reefs</b> was poor. River plumes of the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Hull, Johnstone, and Mulgrave/Russell rivers were noticeably changed, with some paths diverted. The Herbert River plume expanded to encompass areas near the Greater Palm group of islands, the Mulgrave/Russell around the Frankland Islands. In addition, {{the loss of a}} raft system utilized for farming of giant clams was noted near Fitzroy Island. Tourist operations experienced little damage from Winifred, with only minimal damage on Dunk Island, Bedarra Island, and Mission Beach. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and $130million (1986AUD) in damage, and was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as the worst cyclone to strike Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971.|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether <b>reef</b> visitors’ ideal images of the Great Barrier <b>Reef</b> {{were used in the}} development of visitor expectancies of the <b>reef</b> experience and evaluative judgments of coral <b>reef</b> quality.

5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing <b>reefs,</b> sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier <b>reefs</b> or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s.

5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building <b>reefs.</b> Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form <b>reefs</b> but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E

40|$|Microbes and {{microbial}} carbonates in reef-flat {{and coral}} community dynamics and submarine geomorphologic features in <b>reef</b> crest and fore <b>reef</b> of Yongxing Island, the Xisha Islands, South China Sea, were studied {{by means of}} scuba diving, underwater investigation, and line intercept transect survey. Studies indicate a very high coral mortality with few living corals in the <b>reef</b> flat of Yongxing Island. Moreover, macro algae, sea grass and cyanobacteria are common in <b>reef</b> flat. Microbes and microbially induced carbonates occur in <b>reef</b> flat. Living corals grow mainly in the <b>reef</b> crest and fore <b>reef,</b> but are also declined dramatically. From coast to off shore, the southeast <b>reef</b> flat of Yongxing Island {{can be divided into}} beach, inner <b>reef</b> flat, outer <b>reef</b> flat, <b>reef</b> flat front (<b>reef</b> crest and fore <b>reef),</b> and fore-reef slope settings. Sedimentary facies include coast, <b>reef</b> flat, <b>reef</b> crest and fore <b>reef,</b> and fore-reef slope. Reefal carbonate sediments are composed of coral skeletons and framework, coral fragments, bioclasts, and lime mud. With the deterioration of environment and water quality, the coral communities tend to be distributed in the <b>reef</b> crest and fore <b>reef</b> with clean sea water, well circulation and moderate water energy. <b>Reef</b> flat is occupied mainly by the macro algae and Heliopora coerulea communities. The coverage statistics on the <b>reef</b> crest demonstrate that the coverage of Acropora cytherea is more than 28 % and represents a dominant species with wave-resistant ecological type. Sedimentary characteristics and geomorphologic features are different between the southeast and northwest reef-flat fronts (<b>reef</b> crest and fore <b>reef)</b> of Yongxing Island. The former shows discontinuously tidal channels in outer <b>reef</b> flat and different dimensional and deep <b>reef</b> ponds in <b>reef</b> crest and fore <b>reef,</b> and the latter presents a typical spur-and-groove system. Microbes (cyanobacteria Lyngbya sp.) occur generally in the inner <b>reef</b> flat and <b>reef</b> ponds of <b>reef</b> crest with restricted water circulation. Widely algae growth indicates a eutrophic environment, and the common microbes on the coral surface in the <b>reef</b> flat and <b>reef</b> ponds also demonstrate eutrophication in seawater and deteriorated water quality.
