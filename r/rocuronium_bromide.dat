40|$|Introduction: Dose of <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> usually {{used for}} rapid {{sequence}} intubation (RSI) allows rapid paralysis but {{the duration of}} action is prolonged making it unsuitable for short duration surgeries. Theoretically, use of low doses of neuromuscular blocking agents shortens the time for recovery from neuromuscular blockade (NMB). Hence we studied the intubating conditions of <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> at 2 × ED 95 dose (0. 6 mg/kg) in comparison with 3 × ED 95 dose (0. 9 mg/kg). Methods: Sixty patients aged 18 - 60 years, ASA PS 1 and 2 posted for elective surgeries requiring GA with endotracheal intubation were studied.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : The goal {{of rapid}} {{sequence}} intubation is {{to secure the}} patients airway smoothly and quickly, minimizing the chances of regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents. Traditionally succinylcholine chloride has been the neuromuscular blocking drug of choi ce for use in rapid sequence intubation because of its rapid onset of action and profound relaxation. Succinylcholine chloride remains unsurpassed in providing ideal intubating conditions. However the use of succinylcholine chloride is associated with many side effects like muscle pain, bradycardia, hyperkalaemia and rise in intragastric and intraocular pressure. <b>Rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> is the only drug currently available which has the rapidity of onset of action like succinylcholine chloride. Hence {{the present study was}} undertaken to compare <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> with succinylcholine chloride for use during rapid sequence intubation in adult patients. METHODOLOGY : The study population consisted of 90 patients aged between 18 - 60 years posted for various elective su rgeries requiring general anaesthesia. S tudy population was randomly divided into 3 groups with 30 patients in each sub group. 1. Group I : Intubated with 1 mg kg - 1 of succinylcholine chloride (n= 30). 2.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the mydriatic efficacy of a neuromuscular blocking agent (<b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide)</b> applied topically {{to only one}} eye of nocturnal birds of prey and to assess for any general and/or local adverse effects due to its use. Animal studied Twelve healthy adult tawny owls (Strix aluco) were randomly divided in two groups. Procedures Six birds (Group 1) received a single dose of 0. 35 mg of <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The second group of subjects (Group 2) received two doses of 0. 35 mg of <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (total 0. 70 mg/eye). In both groups, the curariform agent was instilled topically. Pupil diameter was measured with a pupillary gauge in 10 min intervals {{for a total of}} 100 min and then every 20 min for a total of 240 min. The assessment of the pupillary light reflex was performed using a standard light source during pupillary size recording. Results Maximal pupillary diameter was 11. 5 ± 0. 3 mm for Group 1 and 11. 0 ± 0. 6 mm for Group 2 and no statistically significant differences were detected among the two groups. The maximal pupillary diameter was achieved at T 80 for Group 1, and at T 60 for Group 2. A complete fundus examination was possible on all treated eyes of subjects of both groups.

40|$|Background and Aims: Patients with {{intracranial}} tumour {{are usually}} on anticonvulsants. Patients on phenytoin therapy demonstrate rapid metabolism of nondepolarising muscle relaxants secondary to enzyme induction. Infusion dose requirement of rocuronium in such patients has been sparingly studied. We studied the continuous infusion dose requirement of <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> in patients on phenytoin therapy and its correlation with serum levels of phenytoin. Methods: Seventy-five patients scheduled for supratentorial tumour surgery {{were included in}} the study. Patients not on phenytoin were taken as control. The primary outcome variable studied was the infusion dose requirement of rocuronium in patients on phenytoin. Based on pre-operative serum phenytoin levels, study group patients were divided into two groups: sub-therapeutic level group (phenytoin level 10 μg/mL). Following anaesthesia induction, <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> 0. 6 mg/kg was administered to achieve tracheal intubation. Rocuronium infusion was titrated to maintain zero response on the train-of-four response. Results: Demographic data were comparable. Patients receiving phenytoin required higher infusion dose compared to the control group (0. 429 ± 0. 2 mg/kg/h vs. 0. 265 ± 0. 15 mg/kg/h, P < 0. 001). The serum phenytoin level had no correlation to infusion dose requirement of rocuronium (0. 429 ± 0. 205 mg/kg/h vs. 0. 429 ± 0. 265 mg/kg/h (P = 0. 815). The recovery was faster in the phenytoin group compared to the control group. Haowever, it was not clinically significant.

40|$|Background: The patient's {{individual}} anemia tolerance is pivotal when {{blood transfusions}} become necessary, {{but are not}} feasible for some reason. To date, the effects of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) on anemia tolerance have not been investigated. Methods: 14 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs {{were randomly assigned to}} the Roc group (3. 78 mg/kg <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> followed by continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg/min, n = 7) or to the Sal group (administration of the corresponding volume of normal saline, n = 7). Subsequently, acute normovolemic anemia was induced by simultaneous exchange of whole blood for a 6 % hydroxyethyl starch solution (130 / 0. 4) until a sudden decrease of total body O- 2 consumption (VO 2) indicated a critical limitation of O- 2 transport capacity. The Hb concentration quantified at this time point (Hb(crit)) was the primary end-point of the protocol. Secondary endpoints were parameters of hemodynamics, O- 2 transport and tissue oxygenation. Results: Hb(crit) was significantly lower in the Roc group (2. 4 +/- 0. 5 vs. 3. 2 +/- 0. 7 g/dl) reflecting increased anemia tolerance. NMB with <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> reduced skeletal muscular VO 2 and total body O- 2 extraction rate. As the cardiac index increased simultaneously, total body VO 2 only decreased marginally in the Roc group (change of VO 2 relative to baseline - 1. 7 +/- 0. 8 vs. 3. 2 +/- 1. 9 % in the Sal group, p < 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aggressive {{surgical}} {{removal of}} the primary tumour is the preferred treatment, but with tumour progression, some tumours cannot be completely removed surgically. Anaesthetics are administered to facilitate surgery. However, anaesthetics act as a potential factor in tumour recurrence or metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal breast cells and cancer breast cells were treated with different doses of muscle-relaxant anaesthetics. The effects on breast cancer cell invasion, adhesion and migration of these anaesthetics were then investigated using in vitro models. RESULTS: With increasing dose of <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> and suxamethonium chloride CRS, the number of MCF- 10 A and MCF- 7 cells, but not that of MDA-MB- 231 cells, decreased.

40|$|Introduction. It is a {{consensus}} that the postoperative cognitive function is impaired in elderly patients after general anaesthesia, and such category patient takes more time to recover. Xenon is a noble gas with anesthetic properties mediated by antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. With a minimum alveolar concentration of 0. 63, xenon is intended for maintaining hypnosis with 30 % oxygen. The fast recovery after xenon anaesthesia was hypothesized to be advantageous in this scenario. Case Presentation. We report the case of 99 -year-old woman who underwent sigmoid colon carcinoma resection with colorectal anastomosis. We carried out the induction phase by propofol, oxygen, fentanil, and <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and then we proceeded to a rapid sequence endotracheal intubation consequently. The patient was monitored by IBP, NIBP, ECG, cardiac frequency, respiratory rate, capnometry, TOF Guard, blood gas analysis, and BIS. For maintenance we administrated oxygen, remifentanil, <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and xenon gas 60 – 65 %. Shortly {{after the end of}} surgery the patients started an autonomous respiratory activity, and a high BIS level was also recorded. Decision was made by our team to proceed into the emergence phase. The residual neuromuscular block was antagonized by sugammadex, modified Aldrete score was implicated, and we got our patient fully awake without any cognitive dysfunction or delirium. Conclusion. The rapid emergence to full orientation in very elderly patient who had been anesthetized by xenon shows concordance to the high BIS values and the clinical signs of the depth of anesthesia...|$|E

Good to excellent intubation conditions were achieved in 94 % in the two groups,we conclude that in this study the intubating conditions approximately 60 sec after the administration of rocuronium were satisfactory and almost similar to those observed After Suxamethonium and the onset of action is comparable with that of Suxamethonium...|$|E
40|$|Perioperative {{anaphylaxis}} {{is characterized}} by severe respiratory and cardiovascular manifestations. Correct management of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia requires a multidisciplinary approach with prompt recognition and treatment of the acute event by the attending anesthesiologist. A 34 -year-old woman was scheduled to undergo endo venous laser therapy of varicose veins. She had no history of allergies and had never undergone general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Approximately three minutes after rocuronium administration, hypotension and tachycardia developed and angioedema around the eyelids and skin rashes and urticaria appeared. The patient received ephedrine and hydrocortisone with hydration. After achieving stable vital signs and symptom relief, surgery was performed without complications. A postoperative skin dermal test performed to identify the agent responsible revealed a positive skin test for rocuronium.

Indeed, the BIS was over 90 before induction of general anesthesia. Anesthesia was uncomplicatedly induced by propofol 120  mg, remifentanil 0.5  μg/kg/min, and <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> 40  mg followed by tracheal intubation. After the induction, ultrasound-guided left femoral nerve block was performed with 0.375 % ropivacaine 20  ml. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol 6 – 8  mg/kg/h and remifentanil 0.1 – 0.2  μg/kg/min to keep BIS value between 40 and 60. Intravenous acetaminophen 1000  mg was also administered as a part of multimodal analgesia. As hemodynamics were stable during anesthesia, vasoactive agents were not required. The duration of surgery was 50  min. The patient emerged from anesthesia and extubated 9  min after discontinuation of propofol and remifentanil infusion. Her consciousness was clear and the BIS values were above 90. Intravenous fentanyl 100  μg was required for relief of pain of sciatic nerve region.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn organotypic spinal cord–skeletal muscle co-cultures, motoneurons {{are driven}} by {{locomotor}} commands and induce contractions in surrounding muscle fibres. Using these co-cultures, {{it has been shown}} that effects of organophosphorus compounds on neuromuscular synapses can be determined in vitro. In the present study we aimed to extend this in vitro tool for pharmacologic testing of botulinum toxin B. This neurotoxin is widely used for the treatment of dystonia. Besides its effects on the neuromuscular junction, botulinum toxins may also act at centrally located synapses. Incubation with botulinum toxin B (Neurobloc®) induced a significant increase in muscular activity after 24, 48 and 72 h. Application of the NMDA- and AMPA-receptor antagonists AP 5 (20 μM) and CNQX (15 μM) induced a similar augmentation of muscle activity after 48 and 72 h, respectively. Administration of the glycine- and GABA(A) -receptor antagonists strychnine (1 μM) and bicuculline (100 μM) did not alter intrinsic muscle activity. In contrast, application of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant <b>rocuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> reduced the muscle activity in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that glutamatergic synapses in the spinal cord are more sensitive to botulinum toxin B than synaptic contacts between spinal motoneurons and muscle fibres...|$|E

Blood samples were collected over 390 min and concentrations of rocuronium and its putative metabolites measured using HPLC. Onset time for maximum block {{and duration of}} clinical relaxation (DUR(25)) were 61 (SD 25. 0) s and 65 (16. 4) s, 55 (26. 9) min and 42 (9. 3) min, respectively, for patients with and without renal failure. The time for train-of-four ratio to return spontaneously to 0. 7 was 99 (41. 1) min and 73 (24. 2) min, respectively, in the two groups. None of these differences was significant. The pharmacokinetic data were best described by a three-exponential equation. There were significant differences between patients with and without renal failure in the rates of clearance (2. 5 (1. 1) mL kg(- 1) min(- 1) and 3. 7 (1. 4) mL kg(- 1) min(- 1), respectively) and the mean residence times (97. 1 (48. 7) min and 58. 3 (9. 6) min) (P < 0. 05).
