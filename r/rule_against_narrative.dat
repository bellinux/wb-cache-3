40|$|The <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities {{is dying}} an ignoble death. To attract trust {{business}} and the lawyers 2 ̆ 7 fees and trustees 2 ̆ 7 commissions that come with it, twenty states have abolished the Rule as applied to interests in trust. But the <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities {{is not the only}} rule of property law that bears on trust duration. Another is the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income, which limits the timeframe during which a settlor may direct the trustee to accumulate and retain income in trust. For 200 years, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income has lurked in the shadow of its older and more distinguished cousin, the <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities. But with the race to abolish the <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income may have newfound relevance. Perpetual trusts are more likely than ordinary trusts to involve accumulations of income in trust. Accordingly, the task for this short essay is to examine the lurking <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations of income and its potential impact on the 100 billion perpetual trust industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this study {{comprises}} the judicial and legislative rules developed to restrict attempts by men of property to endow their families in perpetuity, usually with land, in such manner that each successive living generation can neither part with the property nor prevent unborn generations from succeeding to it. Part One deals with attempts to accomplish this object by bestowing the whole title on each living generation but denying each such generation the power {{to dispose of the}} property or to prevent its· descent to the next generation. In this part the principal restrictive rules are judicial, the common-law <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> restraints on alienation. Part Two deals with attempts to accomplish the same object by splitting the title into present and future estates; bestowing only an estate for life on the currently living generation and conveying future estates directly to unborn generations, so that the currently living generation cannot cut them off. In this part the principal restrictive rules are likewise judicial, the common law <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities and the common-law <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Accumulations. Part Two also deals with a partial statutory substitute for the common law <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Accumulations which was in force in Michigan from 1847 to 1952. Part Three deals with a group of Michigan statutes, applicable to dispositions of land made between 184 7 and 1949, which partially superseded the common-law <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> Perpetuities and supplemented, but did not supersede, the common-law <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> restraints on alienation.

This symposium article discusses the asymmetric benefits and drawbacks of perpetual trusts and concludes that the decline of the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> perpetuities cannot be explained solely in terms of rational tax planning...|$|R
