25|$|While {{traditional}} thromboelastography is {{a global}} assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays. They allow testing {{in the presence of}} therapeutic heparin concentrations and provide differential diagnostic information to support decisions in therapy. In numerous publications the validity of the method is shown. Application of TEM at the point of care (POC) or in emergency laboratories is getting more and more popular. TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable <b>rapid</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the fibrin stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true haemostasis disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and protamine, hemostyptic and antifibrinolytic drugs. Several reports confirm that application of TEM is cost effective by reducing the consumption of blood products.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rapid</b> {{diagnostic}} <b>tests</b> {{that might}} be capable of detecting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigens or nucleic acids represent the possibility of merging 2 key advancements in HIV testing: <b>rapid</b> <b>testing</b> and detection of acute HIV infection. In this article, we review the public health goals of <b>rapid</b> HIV <b>testing</b> and acute HIV testing and explore how <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> to directly detect HIV antigens or nucleic acids might alter current approaches to HIV case identification in clinical and public health screening settings. We discuss the specific types of HIV screening programs and settings in which direct viral <b>rapid</b> <b>testing</b> would offer an important advantage. Finally, we suggest priorities in operations research that must be achieved {{to pave the way}} for the future introduction of direct <b>rapid</b> viral <b>testing</b> technologies in the HIV testing marketplace. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnostics are in a period of transition. The Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC) currently promotes the widespread use of simple <b>rapid</b> HIV <b>tests</b> [1], and some public health agencies have instituted and are expand-ing programs that use very sensitive assays (eg, antigen immunoassays or complex nucleic acid amplification assays) [2, 3]. These technologies address different im-portant deficiencies in the existing approach to HIV diagnostic testing. Although these tests also pose dis-tinct challenges, their use represents the future of HIV screening in the United States and abroad.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Following World Health Organization {{recommendations}} that a quality control (QC) system {{be implemented in}} African blood centers, a pilot study {{of the performance of}} human immunodeficiency virus antibody (anti-HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) testing by several Sub-Saharan African blood centers was initiated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A reference laboratory sent a panel of 25 samples to six African blood center laboratories. The panel included eight negative samples; four anti-HIV- 1 –, one anti-HIV- 2 –, four anti-HCV–, and five HBsAg-positive samples; and three samples consisting of mixtures of two sera to mimic coinfections. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall quality (correct positive or negative status) scores were calculated. RESULTS: From the 21 sets of results obtained (seven for each virus), eight were from <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> (two for HIV, three for HBV, and three for HCV) and 13 were from enzyme immunoassays (EIAs; all HIV EIAs were antigen/antibody combination assays). Overall assay sensitivity was 98 % for HIV, 75 % for HBV, and 88 % for HCV; agreement between blood centers using the same assay was good. Sensitivity of <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> was notably poorer than EIAs, with overall sensitivity quality scores of 64. 5 % for <b>rapid</b> <b>tests</b> (20 % for HBsAg <b>rapid</b> <b>tests)</b> compared to 100 % for EIAs. The overall specificity quality scores were 98. 3 and 94. 5 % for EIAs and <b>rapid</b> <b>tests,</b> respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot QC study organized for blood centers of Sub-Saharan Africa showed the feasibility of the approach despite some logistic constraints. Although interlaboratory variability was small, the poor performance of <b>rapid</b> <b>tests,</b> especially for HBsAg, raises policy questions about their use as the only screening assay...|$|R
