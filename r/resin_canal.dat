50|$|B. xylophilus has the {{shortest}} {{life cycle of}} any known parasitic nematode. In laboratory studies {{in which it is}} cultured on fungal media, its life cycle is completed in four days. In nature it reproduces most rapidly in the summer, producing large numbers of individuals that spread throughout the <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> system of susceptible pines, into the trunk, the branches, and the roots. If living tree cells are no longer available the parasite feeds and reproduces on the fungal hyphae growing in the resin canals. In the fall and winter the parasite becomes inactive.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to being an efficient disperser, P. pinaster is known to produce oleoresins, such as oily terpenes or fatty acids, which can inhibit other species within the community from growing. These resins are produced as a defense mechanism against insect predators, such as the large pine weevil. According to an experiment done in Spain, the <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> density was twice as high in the P. pinaster seedlings attacked by the weevils compared to the unattacked seedlings. Since P. pinaster {{has the ability to}} regulate their production of defense mechanisms, it can protect itself from predatory in an energy-efficient manner. The resins make the P. pinaster less vulnerable to damage from insects, but they are only produced in high concentrations when P. pinaster is under attack. In other words, P. pinaster does not waste energy producing resins in safe conditions, so the conserved energy can be used for growth or reproduction. These characteristics enhance the ability of P. pinaster survive and flourish in the areas it invades. Both the traits of P. pinaster and the habitat in South Africa are conducive to the success of P. pinaster in this region of the world.|$|E

In this paper, with the branches and trunks of Cedrus deodara taken as research objects, the <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> in the phloem and xylem of Cedrus deodara are quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed and researched {{with the principles of}} wood science, aiming at exploring whether its distribution provided with regularity.

In terms of occurrence probability and quantities, the <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> generally occurred in the compression and lateral zones of branches while few in the opposite zone; the occurrence of the <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> of trunks had an extremely close tie with the growth and insertion angle/direction of the branches of different areas and directions, etc. Therefore, from the perspective of formation time, Cedrus deodara belongs to the tree species with slowly-formed <b>resin</b> <b>canals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Frankincense, a gum-resin, {{has been}} tapped from Boswellia papyrifera trees for centuries. Despite the {{intensive}} tapping and economic interest of B. papyrifera, {{information on the}} resin secretory structures, which are responsible for synthesis, storage and transport of frankincense, is virtually absent. This study describes the type, architecture and distribution of resin secretory structures of B. papyrifera and its relevance for the ecophysiology and economic use of the tree. The type and architecture of resin secretory structures present in bark and wood was investigated from transversal, tangential and radial sections of bark and wood samples. The diameter and density (number of <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> mm(2)) of axial <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> were determined from digital images of thin sections across the different zones of inner bark. <b>Resin</b> <b>canals</b> form a three-dimensional network within the inner bark. Yet, the intact resin-conducting and producing network is on average limited to the inner 66 mm of the inner bark. Within the inner bark, the density of non-lignified axial <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> decreases and the density of lignified <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> increases from the vascular cambium towards the outer bark. In the wood, only radial <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> were encountered. Frankincense tapping techniques can be improved based on knowledge of bark anatomy and distribution and architecture of resin secretory structures. The suggested new techniques will contribute to a more sustainable frankincense production that enhances the contribution of frankincense to rural livelihoods and the national economy...|$|R
50|$|<b>Resin</b> <b>canals</b> are elongated, tube-shaped {{intercellular}} spaces {{surrounded by}} epithelial cells that secrete <b>resin</b> into the <b>canal.</b> They {{exist in the}} wood of the genera Picea, Larix, Pinus, Pseudotsuga and Shorea.|$|R
5000|$|They are {{medium-sized}} {{to large}} evergreen trees, ranging from 10 - 60 m tall, with a conical to irregular crown, the latter occurring especially {{in some of}} the Asian species. The leading shoots generally droop. The bark is scaly and commonly deeply furrowed, with the colour ranging from grey to brown. The branches stem horizontally from the trunk and are usually arranged in flattened sprays that bend downward towards their tips. Short spur shoots, which are present in many gymnosperms, are weakly to moderately developed. The young twigs, as well as the distal portions of stem, are flexible and often pendent. The stems are rough due to pulvini that persist after the leaves fall. The winter buds are ovoid or globose, usually rounded at the apex and not resinous. The leaves are flattened to slightly angular and range from 5-35 mm long and 1-3 mm broad. They are borne singly and are arranged spirally on the stem; the leaf bases are twisted so the leaves lie flat either side of the stem or more rarely radially. Towards the base, the leaves narrow abruptly to a petiole set on a forward-angled pulvinus. The petiole is twisted at the base so it is almost parallel with the stem. The leaf apex is either notched, rounded, or acute. The undersides have two white stomatal bands (in T. mertensiana they are inconspicuous) separated by an elevated midvein. The upper surface of the leaves lack stomata, except in T. mertensiana. They have one <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> that is present beneath the single vascular bundle.|$|E

The effect of fertilisation on the <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> structure of Pinus pinaster seedlings established in two trials in NW Spain, one attacked by Hylobius abietis {{and the other}} non-attacked, was studied. The leaders of 50 plants were destructively sampled and the <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> density, the canal area and its relative conductive area in the phloem and xylem were assessed. Experimentally increased nutrient availability significantly decreased <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> density in the phloem of the seedlings in the two analysed trials, where unfertilised seedlings presented up to 30 % more <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> density than the fertilised seedlings (mean value ± SEM = 0. 32 ± 0. 02 resin canals mm− 2 in the fertilised plants versus 0. 45 ± 0. 04 resin canals mm− 2 in the control plants). Fertilisation {{had no effect on}} the <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> system in the xylem, but significantly increased tracheid size. Significant differences of resin canals among sites were observed mainly in the xylem; the <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> density was 1. 7 -fold greater in the attacked site than in the non-attacked site.

40|$|We {{report on}} some new {{aspects of the}} {{internal}} architecture of conifer shoot, proving that {{it is even more}} strongly related to phyllotaxis than was initially thought. The number of vascular sympodia in an open system of Abies and Picea shoots is correlated with the number of cortical <b>resin</b> <b>canals.</b> Both numbers are the consecutive members of the phyllotactic series, which defines the phyllotactic pattern of the shoot. This means that the concentric systems of alternately oriented vascular sympodia and <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> are interlocked, following the course of superficial opposite parastichies. Such pattern of inner architecture most likely contributes to the mechanical strengthening of the shoot. It also provides a new example of heterogenetic induction in plant morphogenesis because the development of orderly spaced <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> is dependent upon earlier differentiation of vascular system. A rapid method of assessing the number of vascular sympodia becomes available by means of counting the number of discrete cortical <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> visible on the cut surface of the shoot sectioned transversely.

Previous work based on common garden trials has demonstrated that native pine populations (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) exhibit differentiation in terms of growth, phenology and frost resistance. However, despite their important role in plant fitness, no such information is available on leaf traits, which have shown both plastic and adaptive genetic responses to environmental variation in other species. We analysed a subset of 11 needle characters in 192 saplings grown in a population-progeny common garden trial based on seedlots from eight native pinewoods.

A large pollen cone cluster attached to a cunninghamioid twig and surrounded by leaves has been identified from Eocene calcium carbonate marine concretions from the Appian Way locality on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The cluster preserves 18 cones but probably bore at least 24 pollen cones based on cone placement in the cluster. Methodology. Specimens were studied using the cellulose acetate peel technique, and reconstructions were made with ImageJ visualization software. Pollen was examined using SEM. Pivotal results. Cones are helically arranged around the tip of an ultimate leafy branch that terminates in scale leaves, each showing a central <b>resin</b> <b>canal.</b> Vegetative leaves on the twig are amphistomatic, showing typical cunninghamioid anatomy, with a large central <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> abaxial to the vascular bundle, an elongate zone of transfusion tissue, a nonplicate mesophyll, and a hypodermis three to four cells thick. Each pollen cone is produced in the axil of a bract and has three scale leaves surrounding the base of the cone axis. Individual pollen cones have helically arranged microsporophylls, each with three elongate abaxial pollen sacs. While the cones are immature, pollen sacs with pollen are present in several cones. The exine is scabrate, with numerous orbicules, and no papilla is evident. Conclusions. This cluster provides the first detailed anatomically preserved fossil evidence for the pollen cones of Cunninghamia. It shows a large number of similarities to the pollen cone clusters of extant Cunninghamia lanceolata and Cunninghamia konishii and the Late Cretaceous Cunninghamia taylorii, strengthening hypotheses for a basal position of cunninghamioids within the Cupressaceae and further demonstrating that some characters of Cunninghamia have remained relatively unchanged since at least the mid-Cretaceous...|$|E

To study the causes, the permeability of Dacrydium cupressinum Lamb, (rimu) and Pinus radiata D. Don wood was measured along the three principal directions. These two softwood species are anatomically very similar, but differ in that rimu has no <b>resin</b> <b>canals.</b> The radial and tangential permeabilities {{of the green}} sapwood of the two species were similar and {{of the order of}} 10 - 16 m 2. The transverse permeability of the green rimu intermediate wood was lower and of the order of 10 " 17 m 2. After drying andresaturation the radial and tangential permeability of the rimu intermediate wood were practically unchanged, while the transverse permeability of the sapwood dropped to that of the intermediate wood. For P. radiata sapwood the tangential permeability decreased to IO- 18 m 2. In contrast, after drying and resaturation the radial permeability of P. radiata sapwood was of the order of 10 ~ 14 m 2, two orders of magnitude greater than for the green wood. This increase in radial permeability was caused by an interplay of flow along the radial and axial <b>resin</b> <b>canals.</b> It is believed that the absence of preservative screening in P. radiata sapwood during impregnation is due to rapid dispersal of preservative solution along the <b>resin</b> <b>canals,</b> followed by movement into the tracheids where the preservative fixes to the cell walls.

40|$|In the {{practice}} of silviculture we are often impressed with the necessity of identifing the species of seeds or seedlings just germinated. However Pinus densiflora SIEB. et ZUCC. and P. Thunbergii PARL. are hard to distinguish in their seed stage. It is also {{much more difficult to}} distinguish between them by the external form of their seedlings in the year of germination. Therefore the authors have sought for a method of distinguishing the seedlings of P. densiflora from P. Thunbergii during the year of germination by the anatomical characters of their cotyledons and primary leaves. 1. The cross-section of the cotyledon of P. densiflora is always a regular triangle in shape and the apex of the ventral side is acute, but that of P. Thunbergii is always an isosceles triangle in shape, based on the dorsal side, and the ratio of the length of the base to the other side is 1 : 1. 2; Moreover the apex of the ventral side is much more obtuse than that of P. densiflora. 2. The endoderm of the cotyledon of P. densiflora is always circular in shape, but that of P. Thunbergii is usually elliptic in shape, the long axis being dorsiventral. 3. In the primary leaves of P. densiflora, the sclerenchyma cell surrounding the <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> is always absent at the part touching the epiderm and 2 to 4 of the secreting cells are close to the epiderm. on the other hand, in the primary leaves of P. Thunbergii, the sclerenchyma cells are usually continuous and surround all the circumference of the <b>resin</b> <b>canal,</b> but the resin canals are close to the epiderm. Rarely a sclerenchyma cell is absent at the point touching the epiderm and one of secreting cell is close to the epiderm. Then it becomes clear that the resin canals of the primary leaves of P. Thunbergii lie somewhat inward comparing those of P. densiflora. And it is true of the adult leaves. In the adult leaves the resin canals of P. densiflora are close to the hypoderm, but those of P. Thunbergii lie in the green tissue and after adult leaves have appeared (which is generally in the Autumn of the year following the Spring germination) it is easy to distinguish between them by the site of the resin canals in the adult leaf. In both spesies, the number of resin canals in adult leaves is generally 2 within about three full years after germination, and 3 to 4 develop within four or five years. Thereafter the resin canals gradually increase in number, usually to 12, very rarely to 15. In seedlings and trees of vigorous growth the resin canals usually extend from the base {{to the top of the}} adult leaf, but in cases of poor growth the canals disappear half way up the leaf or ever earlies. 1. 赤松と黑松の子葉 (Cotyledon) の數は通常前者は 5 - 9 本, 後者は 4 - 9 本にして其外觀は極めて相似し, 又其の内部組織に於ても兩者共に解剖學的識別上最も必要なる樹脂道 (<b>Resin</b> <b>canal)</b> 及皮下組織を有せず。 2. 赤松の子葉の横斷面は常に正三角形を呈し, 其の腹面 (Central side) の頂點は比絞的鋭頭なれども, 黑松の子葉は正しく背面 (Dorsal side) を底とせる二等邊三角形を呈し, 背面の底の長さを 1 とせば腹面の二邊は各々略々 1. 2 の長さを有す, 尚黑松にありては腹面の頂點は赤松に比し著しく鈍頭なり。 3. 赤松の子葉の内皮組識 (Endoderm) は常に圓形なれども, 黑松の子葉にありては通常上下に稍々長き楕圓形を呈す。 4. 赤, 黑松の初生葉 (Primary leaf) は其發生當初に於ては樹皮下組識を有せざれども後 1 箇乃至數箇の皮下組織細胞を生ず, 然れども兩者の間に通常葉に於けるが如き明確なる差異無し。 5. 赤, 黑松の初生葉には常に 2 箇の樹脂道が葉の兩隅に近く, 稍々背面の方に偏寄り且つ表皮細胞 (Epiderm) に接觸して 1 箇宛存在せり。 6, 赤松の初生葉の樹脂道は常に表皮細胞に接觸せる部分には厚膜の樹脂道鞘細胞を缺除し居り, 2 - 4 箇の分泌細胞 (Secreting cell) は直接表皮細胞に接し居れり。然るに黑松の初生葉にありては同じく表皮細胞に接して樹脂道存すれども, 共の厚膜樹脂道鞘細胞は通常完全に連續して全周を圍繞し缺除する事無し, 極めて稀に表皮細胞に接觸する部分に於て 1 箇の樹脂道鞘細胞敏除し, 1 箇の分泌細胞が表皮細胞に直接接する事あり。即ち此事實は初生葉にありても通常葉 (Adult leaf) と同樣に, 黑松の樹脂道は赤松のそれよりも葉の内方に奧深く存するものなる事を示すものにして發生學上甚だ興味ある事と信ず。 7. 通常葉の皮下組織に於ける赤, 黑松の差異は種子發芽後滿 2 箇年を經過せざれば明瞭とならず。 8. 赤, 黑松の通常葉に於ける樹脂道の數は同一年齡の樹木と雖も其營養關係の良否に因りて多少増減する故一概には云はれ難きも, 多くのものは發芽當年より滿 3 年生位までは 2 箇を有し, 4 年生よりは之に 3 - 4 箇を有する葉を混じ來り, 20 年生以上となれば殆んど 5 箇以上となり之より次第に増加し通常 12 箇に達す, 然し稀には 15 箇を有するものもありたり。 9. 通常葉の基部より尖端に向つて同化組織中を縱貫せる樹脂道の長さも其樹木の營養の良否に因りて長短あるものの如く, 多くのものは葉の中央部以上に於て次第に減少すれども稀には中央以下に於て既に溝失せるものありたり。 10. 如何なる年齡の赤, 黑松に於ても, 其松が例へば約 8 箇の樹脂道を有するものならば春季僅かに 2 mm. 位伸長せしのみなる嫩葉に於ても既に完全に 8 箇の樹脂道を有し, 一年中の季節に依りて樹脂道數は變化せざるものの如し...|$|E

In this study, tracheid double wall thickness, lumen diameter, and wall to lumen ratio, numbers, sizes, and percentages of <b>resin</b> <b>canals,</b> and numbers of rays were correlated with ring, earlywood, and latewood widths and densities. The wood density correlated positively with the wall to lumen diameter ratio. Rapid growth decreased the number of rays independently of the clone. Furthermore, the effects of growth on the number and size of <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> depended strongly on the clone. C 332 had very thin tracheid walls in latewood, which decreased wood density. However, the high number of rays and <b>resin</b> <b>canals</b> increased it. Growth significantly influences wood anatomy and, consequently, wood density. Hence, wood anatomy should be considered in the selection of proper genotypes for forest cultivation in a changing growing environment...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To examine {{in vitro}} whether Profile or Hero 642 nickel-titanium rotary {{instrument}} systems substantially reduce the minimum canal wall thickness present following root-canal preparation. METHODOLOGY: The canal anatomy of 26 mesial roots from mandibular molars with separate buccal and lingual canals was evaluated {{before and after}} instrumentation using the Endodontic Cube. Following access, working lengths were determined and then samples invested within the cube using acrylic <b>resin.</b> <b>Canal</b> cross-sections were subsequently prepared. Samples were then instrumented within the cube and pre- and post-instrumentation images of the sections were compared to determine the minimum canal wall thickness remaining after preparation. RESULTS: Buccal and lingual canals within the sections from each level (coronal to apical) showed a reduction in minimum canal wall thickness after instrumentation. No statistically significant differences in canal wall thickness {{were found between the}} two systems at any level of the root. CONCLUSIONS: Instrumentation with either of the two systems under investigation did not compromise canal wall thickness. Pre-operative canal wall thickness was found to be the most significant factor determining the minimum canal wall thickness after preparation...|$|E
40|$|White {{pine weevil}} (Pissodes strobi (Peck)) damage was {{surveyed}} at three interior spruce (Picea glauca × engelmannii) fertilization research installations {{to document the}} effects of different fertilizer regimes and frequencies on weevil attack incidence. Weevil attack rates increased with fertilization intensity at a site with well-established and evenly distributed weevil populations. From 24 % (unfertilized) to 54 % (repeatedly fertilized) of trees were attacked at least once over the 6 -year study period. The longer, thicker leaders of fertilized trees likely increased the resources available for weevil feeding and oviposition. A dilution of the leader’s <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> defence system may have also contributed {{to higher levels of}} weevil attack in repeatedly fertilized trees. However, despite the more frequent weevil damage to fertilized trees, the height losses caused by weevil attack were less than the height gains due to fertilization. The other two sites had smaller, or less evenly distributed, weevil populations, reflected in much lower weevil attack rates and fertilizerstimulated attack impacts. Results indicate that the beneficial effects of fertilization on the growth of young interior spruce plantations likely outweigh the negative effects associated with increased incidence and severity of leader damage from the white pine weevil...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenicity of {{the pine}} wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, to Japanese larch, Larix kaempferi, {{seedlings}} was tested with inoculation experiments under nursery conditions. Water suspensions of nematodes (mixed stages cultured on Botrytis cinerea or dispersal fourth-stage juveniles (DJ 4) extracted from the adult Japanese pine sawyer, Monochamus alternatus) were injected into the stems of 2 - and 3 -year-old Japanese larch and Japanese black pine, Pinus thunbergii, seedlings growing in a nursery. In another treatment, Japanese pine sawyer adults holding DJ 4 were released under a net that covered {{the upper half of}} the seedlings. Regardless of nematode inoculation method, Japanese larch seedlings were as susceptible as Japanese black pine seedlings to B. xylophilus under nursery conditions. The rate of disease development was similar on larch and pine seedlings. Nematode population densities were lower in the stems of dead larch seedlings than in the stems of dead pine seedlings. Histopathological observations revealed that the distribution of nematodes in the stems of dead larch seedlings was mostly limited to the cortex, phloem and cambial zone. Traumatic <b>resin</b> <b>canal</b> formation {{was one of the most}} characteristic symptoms in larch seedlings which was dissimilar to that in pine seedlings...|$|E
