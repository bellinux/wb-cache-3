For $50 down and $500 in 30 days, Walker, Candler & Co. obtained all of the one-third interest in the Coca-Cola Company that Charley held, all while Charley still {{held on to the}} name. After the April 14 deal, on April 17, 1888, one-half of the Walker/Dozier interest shares were acquired by Candler for an additional $750.|$|E

40|$|In {{many areas}} of {{computer}} architecture design and program development, the knowledge of dynamic program behavior can be very handy. Several challenges beset the accurate and complete collection of dynamic control flow and memory reference information. These include scalability issues, runtime-overhead, and code coverage. For example, while Tallam and Gupta’s work on extending WPP (Whole Program Paths) showed good compressibility, their profile requires 500 MBytes of intermediate memory space and an average of 23 times slowdown to be collected. To address these challenges, this paper presents DEP (Detailed Execution Profile). DEP captures the complete dynamic control flow, data dependency and memory reference of a whole program’s execution. The profile size is significantly reduced due to the insight that most information can be recovered from a tightly coupled <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> flow and register value changes. DEP is collected in an infrastructure called Adept (A dynamic execution profiling tool), which uses the DynamoRIO binary instrumentation framework to insert profile-collecting instructions within the running application. DEP profiles user-level code execution in its entirety, including interprocedural paths and the execution of multiple threads. The framework for collecting DEP has been tested on real, large and commercial applications. Our experiments show that DEP of Linux SPECInt 2000 benchmarks and Windows SysMark benchmarks can be collected {{with an average of}} 5 times slowdown while maintaining competitive compressibility. DEP’s profile sizes are about 60 % that of traditional profiles...|$|E

Coupled with the importance of ADS-B in the air transportation system, these security issues make ADS-B an appealing target for attack by adversaries. This paper dismisses the need for encryption and focuses security strategies on location verification.

By monitoring all memory operations and control transfer instructions, our approach extracts the original hidden code which is written into the memory at run-time and constructs a binary based on the original DLL, the codes extracted and the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> transfers. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we implemented our prototype ReconPD based on QEMU. The experiments show that ReconPD is able to analyze the packed DLLs, yet practical in terms of performance.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} drinking water fluoridation of Capão Bonito, S P, Brazil, whose optimal fluoride concentration should be between 0. 6 to 0. 8 ppm F, considering the balance benefits/risks. Methods: Historical records (n= 1, 964) from 2005 to 2009 of the water treatment plant (operational control) were evaluated. Also, from July 2009 to June 2010, 120 samples of the network water were collected for analysis and the fluoride concentrations found (external control) were compared with <b>records</b> <b>of</b> operational <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the same period. Results: According to the historical records, 76. 3 % of the samples had acceptable fluoride concentration and this value was confirmed by the external control done during one year, which found that 80. 8 % of samples were within the optimal range. However, considering the samples out the optimal range, while the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the operational <b>control</b> showed values below the minimum, the results <b>of</b> the external <b>control</b> found higher percentage of samples above the maximum.

Information on Al outbreaks in Jigawa State were obtained through a questionnaire. A total of 480, 378 birds were lost in 34 outbreaks in the four states under study between the period of January and March 2006. Chickens {{accounted for more than}} 99 % of all the birds affected followed by guinea fowls and turkeys. More than 60 % of the birds affected were adults. The concentrations of poultry farms in Kano metropolis particularly along Gwarzo road where the epidemic was first noticed might have been responsible for the fast spread of the disease within Kano metropolis. It is a common practice to find geese, muscovey ducks and turkeys in one farm in the study area. This practice makes the chickens and turkeys more prone to the disease. From the tract of outbreaks It is possible that the disease spread from Jigawa State to Kano state and from Kano State to other States in the study area {{and other parts of the}} country through trade in live birds and poultry by products.

Thus, spatial theories propose that damage to the hippocampus, a structure thought to play {{a fundamental role in}} spatial behavior, should disrupt exploration. Exploration in rats is organized. The animals create home bases that are central to exploratory excursions and returns, and hippocampal formation damage alters the organization of exploration by disrupting returns. Mice do not appear to readily establish home bases in novel environments, thus, for this species, it is more difficult to establish the contribution of the hippocampus to exploration. The {{purpose of the present study}} was threefold: develop a task in which mice center their exploration from a home base, determine whether the exploratory behavior is organized, and evaluate the role of fimbria-fornix lesions on exploration.

40|$|Knowledge {{of strong}} {{predictors}} of mortality and longevity {{is very important}} for actuarial science and practice. Earlier studies found that parental characteristics as well as early-life conditions and midlife environment {{play a significant role in}} survival to advanced ages. However, little is known about the simultaneous effects of these three factors on longevity. This ongoing study attempts to fill this gap by comparing centenarians born in the United States in 1890 – 1891 with peers born in the same years who died at age 65. The records for centenarians and controls were taken from computerized family histories, which were then linked to 1900 and 1930 U. S. censuses. As a result of this linkage procedure, 765 <b>records</b> <b>of</b> confirmed centenarians and 783 <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> were obtained. Analysis with multivariate logistic regression found the existence of both general and gender-specific predictors of human longevity. General predictors common for men and women are paternal and maternal longevity. Gender-specific predictors of male longevity are occupation as a farmer at age 40, Northeastern region of birth in the United States, and birth in the second half of year. A gender-specific predictor of female longevity is the availability of radio in the household according to the 1930 U. S. census. Given the importance of familial longevity as an independent predictor of survival to advanced ages, we conducted a comparative study of biological and nonbiological relatives of centenarians using a larger sample of 1, 945 validated U. S. centenarians born in 1880 – 1895. We found that male gender of centenarian has a significant positive effect on survival of adult male relatives (brothers and fathers) but not female blood relatives.
