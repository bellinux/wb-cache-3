25|$|Within the {{national}} government responsibility for {{water supply and sanitation}} is shared between three Ministries. Urban water supply and sewerage is under the Ministry of Construction. Rural water supply is under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, while <b>rural</b> <b>sanitation</b> and hygiene are under the Ministry of Health. The structure of Ministries is mirrored at the provincial level, where each Ministry has branches. The 58 provinces have considerable autonomy in implementing policies. For example, some focus on public sector service provision, while others − especially in the South - promote the private sector.|$|E
25|$|Rural areas. There {{are about}} a 100,000 rural water supply systems in India. At least in some states, {{responsibility}} for service provision {{is in the process}} of being partially transferred from State Water Boards and district governments to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) at the block or village level (there were about 604 districts and 256,000 villages in India in 2002, according to Subdivisions of India. Blocks are an intermediate level between districts and villages). Where this transfer has been initiated, it seems to be more advanced for single-village water schemes than for more complex multi-village water schemes. Despite their professed role Panchayati Raj Institutions, play only a limited role in provision of rural water supply and sanitation as of 2006. There has been limited success in implementing decentralisation, partly due to low priority by some state governments. <b>Rural</b> <b>sanitation</b> is typically provided by households themselves in the form of latrines.|$|E

25|$|The Integrated Sanitation and Sewerage Infrastructure Project was {{approved}} in 2008 {{and is expected}} to end in 2014. Its main objective is the sustainable improvement of the sanitation and environmental conditions as well as the water quality in the three Delta Governorates of Beheira, Gharbia and Kafr El-Sheikh. Furthermore, a local result-based monitoring and evaluation system will be established in order to improve sanitation coverage and thus environmental and health conditions. The project also contains a component of institutional development and capacity building. According to the World Bank, the project is the first large scale effort to address <b>rural</b> <b>sanitation</b> in Egypt. The total cost of the project is 201.5 million USD, out of which the World Bank provides more than half (120 million USD).

25|$|Since 1998 USAID has {{provided}} {{technical assistance to}} INAPA to introduce what it calls a Total Community Participation approach in rural water supply and sanitation. The project served as a laboratory for INAPA, whose activities in rural areas had been limited to water supply, to engage in community participation, in <b>rural</b> <b>sanitation</b> and hygiene promotion. USAID first supported a pilot project for nine rural communities {{with a total of}} 700 families in Hato Mayor Province with the support of Catholic Relief Services and a Dominican NGO. From 2002 onwards, USAID and the NGO Family Health International supported INAPA in replicating the approach {{in other parts of the}} country. A 2006 evaluation showed that six of the nine pilot communities did not have working systems. The reasons include inappropriate design - pumps and inverters burned out - and the stealing of solar panels. However, the evaluation also showed that the community-based approach has been adopted by other stakeholders, such as CAASD for rural projects in the province of Santo Domingo, an INAPA project supported by Spanisch cooperation and the Peace Corps.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 a demand-driven and people-centered {{sanitation}} {{program was}} initiated {{under the name}} Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) which has some similarities with Community-led total sanitation (CLTS), but is not the same. It evolved from the limited achievements of the first structured programme for <b>rural</b> <b>sanitation</b> in India, the Central <b>Rural</b> <b>Sanitation</b> Programme, which had minimal community participation. The main goal of Total Sanitation Campaign is to eradicate the practice of open defecation by 2017. Community-led total sanitation is not focused on building infrastructure, but on preventing open defecation through self-awareness and shame. In Maharashtra where the program started more than 2000 Gram Panchayats have achieved [...] "open defecation free" [...] status.
