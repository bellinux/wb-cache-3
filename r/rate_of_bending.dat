40|$|Various {{hypotheses}} {{regarding the}} influence of ethylene on gravitropism in higher plant shoots were experimentally tested. It was found that ethylene at 1. 0 and 10. 0 cu cm/cu m decreased the rate of gravitropic bending in cocklebur stems, while 0. 1 cm/cu m of ethylene had little effect. Treating cocklebur plants with 1. 0 mmol aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG, an ethylene synthesis inhibitor) delayed stem bending compared with controls, but adding 0. 1 cu cm/cu m ethylene in the surrounding atmosphere partially restored the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> of AVG-treated plants. Virtually all newly synthesized ethylene appeared in bottom halves of horizontal stems, where ethylene concentrations were as much as 100 times those in upright stems or in top halves of horizontal stems. Auxin applied {{to one side of}} a vertical stem caused extreme bending away from that side; gibberellic acid, kinetin, and abscisic acid were without effect...|$|E
40|$|A {{program has}} been {{developed}} for digital computer simulation of the movement of a flagellar model consisting of straight segments connected by joints at which bending occurs. The program finds values for the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> at each joint by solving equations which balance active, viscous, and elastic bending moments at each joint. These bending rates are then used to compute the next position of the model. Stable swimming movements, similar to real flagellar movements, can be generated routinely with a 25 -segment model using 16 time steps/beat cycle. These results depend on four assumptions about internal flagellar mechanisms: (a) Bending is generated by a sliding filament process. (b) The active process is controlled locally by the curvature of the flagellum. (c) Nonlinear elastic resistances stabilize the amplitude of the movement. (d) Internal viscous resistances stabilize the wavelength of the movement and explain the relatively low sensitivity of flagellar movement to changes in external viscosity...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{deformation}} of a flexible fiber clamped to a spherical body and immersed in a flow of fluid moving with a speed ranging between 0 and 50 cm/s by means of three dimensional numerical simulation developed in COMSOL. The effects of flow speed and initial configuration angle of the fiber relative to the flow are analyzed. A rigorous analysis of the numerical procedure is performed and our code is benchmarked against well established cases. The flow velocity and pressure are used to compute drag forces upon the fiber. Of particular interest is the behavior of these forces {{as a function of}} the flow speed and fiber orientation. The Vogel exponents, which characterize the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> of a fiber in a flow, are found for the various configurations examined here and seem to display interesting variations. These exponents are then compared with our previously studied two-dimensional models...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{realization}} of slow-roll inflation in N = 1 supergravities where inflation {{is the result of}} the evolution of a single chiral field. When there is only one flat direction in field space, it is possible to derive a single-field effective field theory parametrized by the sound speed c(s) at which curvature perturbations propagate during inflation. The value of c(s) is determined by the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bend</b> <b>of</b> the inflationary path resulting from the shape of the F-term potential. We show that c(s) must respect an inequality that involves the curvature tensor of the Kahler manifold underlying supergravity, and the ratio M=H between the mass M of fluctuations ortogonal to the inflationary path, and the Hubble expansion rate H. This inequality provides a powerful link between observational constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity and information about the N = 1 supergravity responsible for inflation. In particular, the inequality does not allow for suppressed values of cs (values smaller than c(s) = 0. 4) unless (a) the ratio M/H is of order 1 or smaller, and (b) the fluctuations of mass M affect the propagation of curvature perturbations by inducing on them a nonlinear dispersion relation during horizon crossing. Therefore, if large non-Gaussianity is observed, supergravity models of inflation would be severely constrained...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical derivations are {{presented}} for {{the relations between}} maximum deflection and the corresponding maximum strain for some simple beams subject to elastic-plastic bending. Both elastic-perfectly plastic and. arbitrary stress-strain relations are considered. Where possible, explicit analytical solutions are given, but where th is is not possible numerical solutions are obtained by means of computer programmes. The calculations show that in elastic-perfectly plastic material short plastic zones may develop and cause large strains in the beam even though the deflection corresponding to first yield is not greatly exceeded. On the other hand, strain hardening elongates the plastic zones, so producing a more favourable strain distribution {{along the length of}} the beam than would exist without it. The more pronounced the strain-hardening charac-teristic, i. e. the greater the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> increase of stress with strain, the less Concentrated will be the strains. The mode of loading is important in that the higher the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> moment, in the region <b>of.</b> the maximum <b>bending</b> moment, the more concentrated will be the local strains...|$|R

Experimental results show that there was a significant reduction of the specific erosion rate for high particle concentrations. This reduction was considered to be {{as a result of the}} shielding effect during the particle impacts. An empirical model is given. Also a theoretical study of scaling on the shielding effect, and comparisons with some existing models, are presented.

Phototropic stimulation was made by a laser beam (457. 9 nanometers), allowing application of high-fluence pulses. The phototropic fluence-response curves for oats and maize revealed two peaks in the positive range, thus indicating the occurrence of two separable pulse-induced positive responses. The response at low fluences corresponded to the `first positive curvature. ' The response at high fluences was very small in oats, but was large in maize. Reciprocity was valid in this high-fluence response (tested only for maize), indicating that it is distinct from the so-called `second positive curvature. ' In oats, the trough between the two positive responses fell into the negative range. This negative response, corresponding to the `first negative curvature,' showed time courses distinct from those of `first positive curvature:' the negative response was induced after a longer time lag and developed with a more gradual increase of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending.</b> The maximal rate of the negative response was as high as one-half of that of first positive curvature. In maize, the trough between the two responses was in the positive range, and the time-course result revealed no apparent response counteracting the positive responses.

40|$|Ethylene at 1. 0 and 10. 0 cubic centimeters {{per cubic}} meter {{decreased}} the rate of gravitropic bending in stems of cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill), but 0. 1 cubic centimeter {{per cubic meter}} ethylene had little effect. Treating cocklebur plants with 1. 0 millimolar aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) (ethylene synthesis inhibitor) delayed stem bending compared with controls, but adding 0. 1 cubic centimeter per cubic meter ethylene in the surrounding atmosphere (or applying 0. 1 % ethephon solution) partially restored the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> of AVG-treated plants. Ethylene increases in bending stems, and AVG inhibits this. Virtually all newly synthesized ethylene appeared in bottom halves of horizontal stems, where ethylene concentrations were as much as 100 times those in upright stems or in top halves of horizontal stems. This was especially true when horizontal stems were physically restrained from bending. Ethylene might promote cell elongation in bottom tissues of a horizontal stem or indicate other factors there (e. g. {{a large amount of}} `functioning' auxin). Or top and bottom tissues may become differentially sensitive to ethylene. Auxin applied to one side of a vertical stem caused extreme bending away from that side; gibberellic acid, kinetin, and abscisic acid were without effect. Acidic ethephon solutions applied to one side of young seedlings of cocklebur, tomato, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) caused bending away from that side, but neutral ethephon solutions did not cause bending. Buffered or unbuffered acid (HCl) caused similar bending. Neutral ethephon solutions produced typical ethylene symptoms (i. e. epinasty, inhibition of stem elongation). HCl or acidic ethephon applied to the top of horizontal stems caused downward bending, but these substances applied to the bottom of such stems inhibited growth and upward bending—an unexpected result...|$|E

The torque generated under tensile load was recorded {{as well as the}} strand extension and rotation over a 600 mm gauge length. Wire tensions and bending moments in the outer layer of helical wires were determined at the mid-strand position from the outputs of strain gauges in groups of three with parallel grids and mounted parallel to the wire axis on the crown of each wire. The rate of strand extension under tensile load was found to be greater in tests with reduced torsional restraint, the greatest rate occurring in the free-end test. The strand rotation rate was also found to be greatest in the free-end test. The greatest difference from the theoretically predicted rates occurred in a free-end test with increasing load; predict-ed values of extension and rotation underestimated the test results by 12 and 23 per cent, respectively. Displacement of the load-torque plots occurred in the direction of reducing torque as testing proceeded. This appears to indicate the redistribution of the strand load between the layers of wires. Wire tensions showed a more even sharing of load in the fixed-end condition than in the free-end condition. The increase in rate of tension with strand load was less for most wires in tests with reduced torsional restraint, with the lowest tension rates developing in the free-end condition. For most wires, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> moment change with strand load was greater (in the sense tending to decrease tensile stress on wire crowns) in tests with reduced torsional restraint. However, the bending moment rates varied greatly between wires, the variation being greater in tests with reduced torsional restraint than in fixed-end tests. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{meandering}} {{river is}} one which exhibits a serpentine course, formed {{by a series}} <b>of</b> alternating <b>bends</b> connected by short, relatively straight reaches. Meandering behaviour {{has been found to}} be ubiquitous in alluvial streams and rivers. The tendency <b>of</b> the <b>bends</b> in meandering rivers to evolve and shift is a natural outcome of interactions between the flowing water, sediment in transport and the resistance to erosion of the boundary sediments. The resulting formation, evolution and shifting <b>of</b> <b>bends</b> is intrinsic to the morphological behaviour of meandering, alluvial streams. The need to understand and predict this behaviour stems not only from the desire to explain the morphodynamics of meandering rivers, but is also required to manage down the risks to property and infrastructure located along the course of meandering rivers, as well as the people who live, work or travel in the vicinity of alluvial streams with meandering planforms. In this context, the aim of this research is to develop an original, scientifically-based, and practical approach to the risk-based prediction of the hazard associated with bend migration that accounts for the uncertainty inherent to the morphological behaviour of rivers. A database compiled for the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) was used as the primary source of data. This includes data for 1, 505 bends taken from 125 locations on 89 rivers spread across 24 States. in the USA The rivers were classified into nine categories of meandering, based on a modified Brice Typology. Bend geometry data in the database were measured from aerial photographs and maps representing the bends in the 1930 / 40 s, 1950 / 60 s and 1990 s. It has long been recognised that the dimensionless <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>bend</b> migration (M/W) is related to the stage <b>of</b> <b>bend</b> evolution (initiation, growth, translation, termination) and that this can be represented by the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>bend</b> radius <b>of</b> curvature to the channel width (R/W). It was decided to analyse bend migration based on these parameters and use the dimensionless form <b>of</b> the <b>bend</b> radius as the independent variable in the probabilistic analysis. Using normal conditional density functions fitted to the data, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> meander migration were estimated corresponding to: 50 %, 60 %, 75 %, 80 %, 90 %, 95 %, 97 %, 98 %, and 99 % probabilities of not being exceeded. The risk associated with a hazard depends not only on the probability that it will occur but also the consequences should it do so. In selecting the acceptable level of probability that the predicted <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> migration will not be exceeded, care should therefore be exercised by the user in considering all the possible consequences should this occur...|$|R

Root gravitropism, for example, is the response {{by which the}} primary root orients its growth according to the gravity vector. There {{is a lot of}} genetic and molecular evidence that support the crucial role of the phytohormone auxin during root gravitropism. For example mutations in genes' encoding aux in synthesis, signalling and transport proteins resulted in agravitropic or partially agravitropic phenotypes. Two novel auxin biosensors, DII-VENUS and DR 5 :VENUS had been used to monitor auxin abundance and auxin response respectively in mutants affecting the above mentioned aux in processes, Results reflected the powers of these 2 reporters combined as they,,'ere able to reflect a tight relation between the root tip bending and the formation of an auxin gradient following a 90 ° gravistimulus, They were also able to uncover unexpected effects on auxin homeostasis in arj 7 arf 19 that were validated by gas chromatography- based studies. Despite the wealth of information describing a lot of auxin mutants, {{there are a lot of}} genes that had not been characterised yet. So, a transcriptomics approach was followed to discover some of these genes, Results showed thai over 500 genes were observed to be differentially expressed following a gravity stimulus over an 8 hours time course.

The qualitative difference between the bending modes excited in a spherical vesicle and that in a flat membrane is demonstrated. The shear elasticity of the CVs gives an essential contribution to the relaxation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bending</b> mode at small wave numbers.

The present paper {{deals with the}} deformation of stainless sheet in laser bending process under temperature gradient mechanism. Finite element simulation was carried out to determine the temperature field and deformation of the sheet metal for different laser powers. Bending angle was found to increase nonlinearly {{with the increase of}} laser power up to a certain value <b>of</b> the latter. <b>Bending</b> angles calculated by finite element method were found to be in good correlation, when compared with the analytical and experimental results. After a certain value of laser power, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> angle was decreased, which is called the saturation power. Laser bending process was also investigated beyond the surface melting temperature. After saturation zone, bending angle was seen to increase due to a further increase of laser power and surface melting. Temperature fields of the laser bent samples in different zones were investigated through numerical simulations. Metallurgical changes of the samples for different processing regions were also studied using the scanning electron microscopy and Vickers’ microhardness tester. For stainless steel samples, there was no microstructural change in the region before saturation. After saturation zone, surface microstructure got refined due to surface melting of a thin layer and subsequent rapid quenching. Microhardness of the samples at different processing zones was measured using Vickers’ microhardness tester. Average microhardness was found to increase from normal deformation zone towards the melting zone.

Rather than a buckling-like behavior we observe a transition between a regime of crack-like penetration {{in which the}} fiber only shows small fluctuations around a stable straight geometry and a bending regime in which the fiber fully bends and advances through series of loading/unloading steps. We show that the shape reconfiguration of the fiber is controlled by a single non dimensional parameter: L/Lc, {{the ratio of the}} length of the flexible beam L to Lc, a bending elasto-granular length scale that depends on the rigidity of the fiber and on the departure from the jamming packing fraction of the granular medium.

The primary driver of this migration is the flow field, which molds the sediment of the channel boundary and is in turn altered by the gradient, curvature, and bar forms of the channel. However, the <b>rate</b> and texture <b>of</b> the sediment supply, determined by the topography, lithology, climate, and vegetation cover of the drainage basin, play important roles in affecting the resultant <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> bank erosion, <b>bend</b> growth, and form of floodplain erosion that generate sinuosity and oxbow lake production. We illustrate this point with examples of our recent studies of channel mobility and floodplain erosion and sedimentation. The supply of bed material to a reach accelerates point bar growth that increases the cross-channel acceleration of flow and intensifies bank erosion. The vulnerability of floodplain surfaces to chute incision, which depends on point bar growth, floodplain texture, floodplain gradient, and vegetation cover, limits channel sinuosity and alters the average <b>rate</b> and length <b>of</b> oxbow lakes.

In the model the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the change in the lever arm (dz/dx) is accounted for, so that the shear resistant mechanism has been decoupled into two base components—the arch action and the beam action. The ratio (denoted by factor-α) of contribution to shear resistance by the tied arch action in a beam is numerically derived from the gross compatibility of deformations associated with the base actions. Then, the actual behavior of shear-critical beams is formulated by means of interpolating between the sectional approach and the tied arch approach using the value of the factor-α. The adequacy of the new approach has been briefly examined by some test results in literatures, and the results show an excellent agreement between the predicted and the measured. From the present study, it can be concluded that the factor-α is appeared to be the most crucial parameter for understanding the behavior of shear-critical reinforced concrete members.|$|R

However, whilst {{attention has been}} concentrated on automation and increasing the production <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bending</b> machines, it seems that with one exception very little {{work has been done}} in order to understand and therefore fundamentally improve the bending process. A new development for the process of draw-bending of tubes, in which the supporting mandrel is axially vibrated at an ultrasonic frequency, has been perfected. A research programme was undertaken to study the mechanics <b>of</b> tube• <b>bending</b> under both vibratory and non-vibratory conditions. For this purpose, a conventional tube-bending machine was modified and equipped with an oscillatory system. Thin-walled mild steel tubes of different diameter to thickness ratios were bent to mean bend radii having various values from 1. 5 to 2. 0 times the tube diameter. It was found that the application of ultrasonic vibration reduces the process forces and that the force reduction increases with increasing the vibration amplitude. A reduction in the <b>bending</b> torque <b>of</b> up to 30 per cent was recorded and a reduction in the maximum tube-wall thinning of about 15 per cent was observed. The friction vector reversal mechanism as well as a reduction in friction account for the changes of the forces and the strains. Monitoring the mandrel friction during bending showed, in some cases, that the axial vibration reverses the mandrel. mean force from tension to compression and, thus, the mandrel is assisting the tube motion instead of resisting it. A theory has been proposed to describe the mechanics of deformation during draw-bending of tubes, which embodies the conditions of both "with" and "without" mandrel axial vibration. A theoretical analysis, based on the equilibrium of forces approach, has been developed in which the basic process parameters were taken into consideration. The stresses, the strains and the bending torque were calculated utilising this new solution, and a specially written computer programme was used to perform the computations. It was shown that the theory is in good agreement with the measured values of the strains under vibratory and non-vibratory conditions. Also, the predicted bending 'torque showed a similar trend to that recorded experimentally...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} of curvature and <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> speed along the cell's growing region are studied during steady state phototropic bending. At the start, elemental bending speed parallels the known axial distribution <b>of</b> growth <b>rate.</b> Hence regional phototropic sensitivity is initially {{determined by the}} local growth rate, and unilateral visible light acts proportionally {{at all levels of}} the growth zone. In the later course <b>of</b> <b>bending,</b> the bending speed distribution shifts downward instead of progressing upward in step with the cell's elongation. Furthermore, during phototropic inversion reversed bending begins high in the growth zone and progresses downward while normal bending continues below. These spatial and temporal changes in the {{distribution of}} differential growth are considered to be due to a fixed <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> supply of material used in growth that is transported from lower regions of the cell and asymmetrically distributed within the growth zone. This paper examines the development <b>of</b> phototropic <b>bending</b> in the sporangiophore of Phycomyces exposed to unilateral illumination. Curvature of th...|$|R

Although other methods {{may be used to}} steer the bit to the desired target zone, they are more time consuming which adds to the cost of the well. Mud motors can be configured to have a bend in them using different settings on the motor itself. Typical mud motors can be modified from 0 degrees to 4 degrees with approximately six increments in deviation per degree <b>of</b> <b>bend.</b> The amount <b>of</b> <b>bend</b> is determined by <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> climb needed to reach the target zone. By using a measurement while drilling (MWD) tool, a directional driller can steer the bit to the desired target zone.|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{dynamics of}} a lowland river {{system can be}} defined as the whole of processes that involve erosion, transport or deposition of sediment in the system – including the floodplains – on every possible spatial and temporal scale. The sedimentary dynamics of the river Rhine in the Netherlands have been influenced by many human activities in the past. A major human intervention has been the embankment around 1300 AD, by which the so far free meandering river was confined between dikes. Previous studies analyzed the impact of human interventions in the period after the embankment. The present study focuses on the sedimentary dynamics of the natural river Rhine. We reconstructed the amount of sedimentation and erosion that is involved with lateral migration of the river, and estimated the residence time of the sediment on the floodplain. Lateral migration was reconstructed with a one-dimensional bank erosion model. Lateral migration <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> meander <b>bends</b> were modeled based on channel parameters (e. g. bend radius, discharge) and bank material, all derived from detailed borehole reconstructions of sub-recent channel belts from previous studies. Model results will be used to compare the sedimentary dynamics of the natural river Rhine, with dynamics in human-influenced periods, and hence to predict present and future sedimentation and erosion processes. Moreover, results of reworked sediment volumes can be included in existing large-scale sediment budgets of the river Rhine to evaluate the dynamics within these slice...|$|R

40|$|Planning <b>of</b> an {{appropriate}} <b>bending</b> sequence {{is one of}} the most important aspects in the processing of sheet metals as the appropriateness of the plan affects correct selection <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> tools and feasibility <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> processes. This study aims to propose a set of principles to be followed for the planning <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> sequences and selection <b>of</b> <b>bending</b> tools for 2. 5 D sheet metals. To this end, we first define basic bending patterns by characterizing each pattern with a set of operation rules.

In order to select the bending tools, we combine the contours <b>of</b> each <b>bending</b> operation, choose appropriate bending punches from the bending-tool database, and then undertake an interference check with the bending contours...|$|R
40|$|Bursts in {{pneumatic}} conveyor pipelines in industrial processes are a well-known hindrance to the smooth operation of any plant. Unanticipated stoppages can have serious financial implications for any company using pneumatic conveying technology, {{and health and}} safety factors are also paramount. This thesis describes an attempt to enable improved prediction <b>of</b> bend-wear and <b>bend</b> lifetime, so that more cost-effective survey work can be undertaken in anticipation of bursts. This work delivers a tool that allows bend lifetime prediction to be made according to: the bend geometry and material; the material conveyed and its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> transportation; and <b>bend</b> wall thickness. Firstly, a computational model based on the coupling of CFD and particle tracking techniques is created in order to encompass {{the mechanics of the}} erosion process. This erosion process is assumed to be dominated by impact damage, and predictions <b>of</b> <b>bend</b> lifetime are made using empirical erosion algorithms gleaned from laboratory experiments, commercial CFD code (PHOENICS, and GENTRA its particle tracking sister code), and custom erosion modelling code that employs a three-dimensional toroidal geometry. Secondly, matrices of predictions are built up using the mathematical modelling technology mentioned above. These predictions are collated behind a friendly interface to produce a far more accessible piece of PC software that an engineer can employ quickly and easily. More general bend-life predictions are interpolated from this fundamental dataset using behaviours established {{in the course of this}} work, according to the particular conveying conditions input by the user. Predictions in the desktop tool are calibrated to actual bend lives as established by experimentation on a full-scale {{pneumatic conveyor}}. This experimental work was an integral part of this EPSRC-funded project, and allows some estimation of error magnitude in the predictive tool...|$|R

Optical dating of a scroll-bar {{sequence}} on the Klip River, South Africa, {{to derive}} the lateral migration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> a meander <b>bend.</b> The Holocene, 15 (6), 802 - 811 Problems are often encountered in accurately establishing the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> processes associated with river channel change. In this study, optical dating {{was used to}} obtain the lateral migration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> an abandoned meander bend on the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Five samples were collected by augering along a transect across an approximately 200 -m-wide scroll-bar sequence on the inner meander bend, and an additional sample was collected from the channel fill of the related oxbow lake. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages were derived for each sample using the single-aliquot regenerativedose protocol on small aliquots of quartz. Incomplete bleaching was evident {{in some of the}} samples and thus the appropriate statistical analysis was performed using the 'finite mixture model' for the scroll-bar samples and the 'minimum age model' for the channel-fill sample. The ages calculated were in the correct chronological order for the depositional sequence, which was formed over the last 1 l 000 years. The average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> lateral migration across the scroll-bar sequence was found to be 0. 16 m/yr but with an apparent increase in the rate occurring during the early sixteenth century. Where quartz-rich alluvium exists, the methods used in this study can potentially be applied to other river systems, enabling <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> channel change processes to be determined.
