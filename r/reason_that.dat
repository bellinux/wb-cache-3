5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It {{is for this}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|However, Hanna biographer Clarence A. Stern {{suggested}} {{that while the}} industrialist admired McKinley's loyalty to Sherman, the principal <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he decided to promote McKinley's career was the congressman's advocacy of high tariffs, which he also favored.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{the set of}} {{vitamins}} skips directly from E to K is that the vitamins corresponding to letters F–J were either reclassified over time, discarded as false leads, or renamed because of their relationship to vitaminB, which became a complex {{of vitamins}}.|$|E

But, make no mistake, I am {{not the only one}} who is in danger. The Tsarnaev brothers drew inspiration from Feiz Mohammed's internet rants and decided to kill innocent onlookers at a marathon. Everyone is in danger.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which is the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Continental Freemasonry {{has no such}} problems. Le Droit Humain enjoys fraternal {{relations}} with the Grand Orient de France, the Grande Loge féminine de France, and the Grande Loge de France. The Grand Orient de France, in addition to recognising women's masonry, decided in 2010 {{that there was no}} <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> its lodges should not be able to initiate women, thus adding another strand to international co-masonry.|$|E

5|$|Having now gained {{experience}} with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), was much better than that of IV. He named this as the primary <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like IV, the discography of Final Fantasy V included an arranged and a piano album {{in addition to the}} main soundtrack album.|$|E
5|$|Heine's prose {{passage in}} De l'Allemagne tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves {{in the middle}} of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their path is forced to dance to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> they hate men.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Jerry {{finds out}} from his mother that Elaine knows about the stake out. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> she was angry was {{because it was the first}} time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to be able to talk more about their {{relationships}} if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E

5|$|New In Chess {{observed}} in its 2000 Yearbook {{that of the}} 731,740games in its database, White scored 54.8% overall; with the two most popular opening moves, White scored 54.1% in 349,855games beginning 1.e4, and 56.1% in 296,200games beginning 1.d4. The main <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> 1.e4 was less effective than 1.d4 was the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5), which gave White only a 52.3% score in 145,996games.|$|E
5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of ice crystals. The <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E

5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of his face.

5|$|With Justice Scalia {{breathing}} {{down the}} necks {{of anyone who}} peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports, {{the other members of}} the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs.

No one likes an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> stars such as Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
