50|$|The KE {{is easy to}} {{distinguish}} from the earlier KC, by different grilles, headlights, tail lights, body-side mouldings, bonnet, front guards, and on some models, wheels. The dashboard and instrument cluster received new graphics, and the interior was available in slightly different colour shades to the KC. In mid-1989, {{in preparation for a}} new ADR (Australian Design Rule) to come into effect in 1990, all models were fitted with a high-mount <b>rear</b> <b>stop</b> lamp as standard. When the redesigned KF Laser was introduced in March 1990, the wagon continued in a sole GL specification, with minor upgrades until 1994, when Australian production of the Laser ceased.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first model}} of FX4 was {{fitted with a}} 2178 cc Austin diesel engine and a Borg-Warner {{automatic}} transmission. In 1961, the manual transmission from the Austin Gipsy was available as an option. From 1962, the Austin 2199 cc petrol engine was available. However, almost all FX4 taxis were fitted with a diesel engine and, until the mid-1970s most had a manual transmission.In 1969, the cab was altered, to offer a new version {{in place of the}} abandoned replacement model and to amend some shortcomings of the original. The original Austins were provided with small <b>rear</b> <b>stop</b> and taillights and roof-mounted turn indicators, commonly known as [...] "bunny ears". On the revised model, the rear wings were modified to accept the taillights and turn indicators from the MkII Austin 1100/1300. Front indicators were also provided below the headlights and repeater indicators fitted to the front wings. The [...] "bunny ears" [...] were abandoned. The interior was also changed, with black vinyl seats and an altered partition to give the driver more legroom.|$|E

On livestock which respondents have <b>stopped</b> <b>rearing</b> due to climate variability, some respondents said they have <b>stopped</b> <b>rearing</b> cattle since they do not survive for many days without water, and the respondents also indicated that since cattle are heavy feeders and {{they could not afford}} to provide forage for the cattle, in particular during drought periods. Others indicated that they had <b>stopped</b> <b>rearing</b> sheep because they cannot survive for many days without water. A few stated they have <b>stopped</b> <b>rearing</b> chickens as they die en masse due to diseases such as Newcastle disease.|$|R

5000|$|Sales of the three-door {{began in}} the United States during {{the second quarter of}} 1989 under the Isuzu Amigo name. A 2.3-liter 4ZD1 {{inline-four}} engine, producing [...] came standard with the RWD while the 4WD was offered with the 2.6-liter 4ZE1 engine. The transmission was initially manual only. There were very limited options for the early Amigo including air conditioning, seating for two or four, and two trim levels to choose from, S or XS. Some of the model year changes throughout production included: small cosmetic alterations for 1991, the standardization of the 2.6-liter engine for 1992, and the added availability of a four-speed automatic transmission on the RWD version for 1992 and 1993. No major changes were made for 1993, but for 1994, a high mount <b>rear</b> <b>stop</b> light was added, power steering and mirrors were made standard. The Amigo was dropped by Isuzu in the US market in 1994. A limited number of XS-F editions (with the [...] "F" [...] standing for [...] "Frontera") were produced which had additional options such as power windows and locking, four-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS) (inactive in low-range 4WD mode, only active on the rear wheels in 4WD high-range). This version of the Amigo had only 49-state emissions (reasons unknown) and there are no official sales numbers, although most dealers agree there were fewer than 75 sold. The only badging that shows this model is a sport blue XS symbol with a sport-font [...] "F" [...] beside it (also sport blue).|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{distances}} between the minifixes and edges of member (front and rear stops) has been examinated on the bending moment of L-type dowel minifix corner joints in the cabinet-type ready-to-assemble furniture. For this purpose, dowel and minifix fasteners and melamine-coated fiberboard (MCF) and melamine-coated particle board (MCP) materials are used for test specimens. Front and rear stops were determined as 60 / 36, 60 / 60 and 48 / 48 mm. Test specimens which prepared were subjected to tension and compression tests. According to the results, the bending moment values of the stops have been obtained the maximum in 60 / 60 group, the minimum in 60 / 36 group, and the medium in 48 / 48 group. The bending moment values obtained that the fiberboard were obtained higher than particleboard, and the tension was obtained higher than compression. As a result, the front and <b>rear</b> <b>stop</b> values are recommended as equal and 60 mm for 228 mm deep furniture...|$|E

50|$|In the {{temperate}} zones, winter temperatures dip below 12 °C (54 °F) {{for extended}} periods. All brood <b>rearing</b> <b>stops</b> for some period during the winter. In early spring, brood rearing resumes inside the winter cluster when the queens starts to lay eggs again. Once a broodnest is established, the cluster must maintain a steady temperature between 34.5 to 36.7 °C (94.1 - 98.0 °F) inside the cluster. If {{the temperature in}} areas of the brood nest dips too low the brood dies - also called chilled brood.|$|R
50|$|If {{the wheels}} are not aligned in the {{direction}} of travel when traction is suddenly restored and the <b>rear</b> tire <b>stops</b> slipping, then a highside is likely, depending on how much the bike is turned across the direction of travel and how fast the bike is traveling when the <b>rear</b> tire <b>stops</b> slipping. If the angle is high enough, the bike is moving fast enough, and the rear tire slips and regains traction suddenly enough, the rider has no chance of preventing a highside.|$|R

Legget and his five redskins were running toward the narrow outlet in the gorge. The awkward and futile efforts of the Indians to remain behind the shield were almost pitiful. They crowded each other for favorable positions, but, struggle as they might, one or two were always exposed to the cliff. Suddenly one, pushed to the <b>rear,</b> <b>stopped</b> simultaneously with the crack of a rifle, threw up his arms and fell. Another report, differing from the first, rang out. A savage staggered from behind the speeding group with his hand at his side. Then he dropped into the brook.|$|R

60|$|The {{nature of}} this battle was such that cavalry {{could not be used}} in front; I {{therefore}} formed ours into line in <b>rear,</b> to <b>stop</b> stragglers--of whom there were many. When there would be enough of them to make a show, and after they had recovered from their fright, they would be sent to reinforce some part of the line which needed support, without regard to their companies, regiments or brigades.|$|R

5|$|The Hastings Diesels {{had almost}} {{completely}} replaced steam by June 1958. With {{the introduction of}} the Hastings Diesels, an hourly service was provided. This split at Tunbridge Wells, with the front portion running fast to Crowhurst and the <b>rear</b> portion <b>stopping</b> at all stations. The service ran every two hours on Sundays. The Hastings Diesels also worked services on the Bexhill West branch line until closure on 14June 1964. On 22December 1958, 6L unit 1017 collided with 6B unit 1035 at Tunbridge Wells Central.|$|R

50|$|Because the M2 was {{intentionally}} {{designed to}} operate in many configurations, it {{can be adapted to}} feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and <b>rear</b> cartridge <b>stops</b> (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch. The operator must also convert the top-cover belt feed slide assembly from left to right hand feed as well as the spring and plunger in the feed arm. This will take a well trained individual less than two minutes to perform.|$|R

Pairs of individually housed round headlamps were wider apart, with a winged Cadillac crest set between each pair. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the <b>rear</b> <b>stopping</b> where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Taillamps were of the same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. The Calais wheelbase was extended to 130 in.|$|R
50|$|By far {{the most}} common form of {{transport}} in Accra, tro tros (motor vehicles re-purposed for passenger transport) is the third biggest, and second most efficient and cost-effective way of getting around the city. The buses are typically minibuses or vans, with the most popular being Nissan Urvan 15-seaters and Mercedes Benz Sprinter or D 309 vans. Trotros are typically decorated with flags and stickers of various countries or (local and international) soccer teams, and with witty sayings, wisecracks, local proverbs (in English or local languages) or Bible verses printed on the bus's <b>rear.</b> Trotros <b>stop</b> at any bus stop or gathering of people, and can also be found at truck and taxi stations, such as the Neoplan station.|$|R
5000|$|The 500 Giardiniera (500 K on some markets) estate {{version of}} the Fiat 500 is the longest running model.

The roof on this model also {{stretches}} {{all the way to the}} <b>rear,</b> not <b>stopping</b> above the driver and front passenger as it does in other models of the same period. The Giardiniera also features [...] "suicide doors" [...] and was the only model to continue to use this door type into the 1970s. In 1966 production was transferred to Desio where the Giardiniera was built by Fiat subsidiary Autobianchi. A total of 327,000 Giardinieras were produced, later examples having Autobianchi rather than Fiat badging.|$|R

5000|$|The {{feature that}} grants the weapon its low recoil (compared to similar light machine guns) is the [...] "constant recoil" [...] principle. The overall design allows the bolt carrier group to travel {{all the way}} back without ever {{impacting}} the <b>rear,</b> instead <b>stopping</b> gradually along the axis of movement against the resistance of the return springs. Jane's International Defence Review correspondent — Andrew Tillman, in an exclusive invitation from ST Kinetics to participate in the Product Improvement Program (PIP, initiated in 1989) to test fire the gun, elaborated: This article began by praising the Ultimax for its ease of control, which allows accurate fire. A comment to the author by an experienced SEAL team leader aptly underlines the importance of having an accurate light machine gun: [...] "Men react one of two ways when they are shot at. If you just shoot at them, they will take cover and return fire, but if you start hitting them, they withdraw." ...|$|R
