For example, if we do the <b>recovery</b> under sustained attacks, in which condition the <b>recovery</b> can terminate? Is a synchronized clock necessary for distributed <b>recovery?</b> In this paper, we proposed a dead-lock free attack <b>recovery</b> algorithm for coordinated <b>recovery</b> and answered related questions.

40|$|Athletes spend a {{much greater}} {{proportion}} of their time recovering {{than they do in}} training. Yet, much attention has been given to training with very little investigation of <b>recovery.</b> The purpose of this review is to stimulate further research into this vital area of training. <b>Recovery</b> can be categorized in three terms: i) immediate <b>recovery</b> between exertions; ii) short-term <b>recovery</b> between repeats (e. g., between resistance sets or interval bouts); and iii) training <b>recovery</b> between workouts. The focus of this review is training <b>recovery.</b> Full training <b>recovery</b> is essential to optimal performance and improvement. This review includes an examination of extant research on <b>recovery</b> and a very brief review of some potential modalities and techniques for hastening <b>recovery</b> and the time course of <b>recovery</b> and responses to some treatments.

40|$|<b>Recovery</b> as {{a concept}} has gained {{increased}} attention {{in the field of}} mental health. There is an expectation that service providers use a <b>recovery</b> framework in their work. This raises the question of what <b>recovery</b> means, and how it is conceptualised and operationalised. It is proposed that service providers approach the application of <b>recovery</b> principles by considering systematically individual <b>recovery</b> goals in multiple domains, encompassing clinical <b>recovery,</b> personal <b>recovery,</b> social <b>recovery</b> and functional <b>recovery.</b> This approach enables practitioners to focus on service users' personal <b>recovery</b> goals while considering parallel goals in the clinical, social, and role-functioning domains. Practitioners can reconceptualise <b>recovery</b> as involving more than symptom remission, and interventions can be tailored to aspects of <b>recovery</b> of importance to service users. In order to accomplish this shift, practitioners will require effective assessments, access to optimal treatment and care, and the capacity to conduct <b>recovery</b> planning in collaboration with service users and their families and carers. Mental health managers can help by fostering an organisational culture of service provision that supports a broader focus than that on clinical <b>recovery</b> alone, extending to client-centred <b>recovery</b> planning in multiple <b>recovery</b> domains.
