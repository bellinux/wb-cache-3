Forty-six of sixty-two lettermen returned (74percent), which included ten offensive and six defensive starters. The 2008 team contained 31 seniors, which was the largest group since Friedgen became head coach in 2001. Important <b>returnees</b> on the defensive unit included cornerback Kevin Barnes, who recorded four interceptions in 2007; defensive end Jeremy Navarre, who had recorded 5.5 sacks; and linebacker Dave Philistin, who had recorded 124 tackles. The offense's returning statistical leaders included quarterback Chris Turner, who threw for 1,958passing yards in 2007; wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, who had 786receiving yards; and running back Da'Rel Scott, who had 135rushing yards.|$|E

On average, at least 12.3 % of total observations {{have at least}} one <b>returnee</b> manager with foreign experience though the number of <b>returnee</b> managers can be as high as 10. The means of <b>Returnee</b> work (0 / 1) and <b>Returnee</b> study (0 / 1) are 0.050 and 0.106, demonstrating that 5.0 % of firms have <b>returnee</b> managers with foreign work experience while 10.6 % of <b>returnee</b> managers have foreign study experience. The mean value of <b>Returnee</b> developed (0 / 1) is 0.122, demonstrating that nearly 99.2 % (0.122 / 0.123) of <b>returnee</b> managers gained their overseas experience in developed economies.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is devoted to}} exploring the adaptation experience of <b>returnee</b> children in Kazakhstani schools. Upon arrival, <b>returnee</b> children {{who have not been}} exposed to Kazakh culture encounter social and psychological challenges. Because of the absence of educational policies for migrant children, the Kazakhstani education system fails {{to meet the needs of}} <b>returnee</b> children as they are required to enroll into mainstream schools. Relying on the empirical evidence and literature on the integration of <b>returnee</b> children, this study attempts to understand the challenges <b>returnee</b> children face in Kazakhstani schools and how these children cope with the alleged challenges. In the course of the study, <b>returnee</b> children reported language, Kazakhstani education system and teacher attitudes to be the major challenges they have faced. One solution to this problem would be a reconsideration of the existing educational program in Kazakhstan on inclusive education which targets only disabled children. Kazakhstani policy makers should consider widening the scope of its meaning including culturally disadvantaged <b>returnee</b> children in its agenda...|$|R

The movement of <b>returnees</b> through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E

The number of displaced Serbs was 254,000 in 1993, dropping to 97,000 {{in the early}} 1995 and then increasing again to 200,000 {{by the end of}} the year. Most international sources place the total number of Serbs displaced at around 300,000. According to Amnesty International 300,000 were {{displaced from}} 1991 to 1995, of which 117,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2005. According to the OSCE, 300,000 were displaced during the war, of which 120,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2006. However, it is believed the number does not accurately reflect the number of <b>returnees,</b> because many returned to Serbia, Montenegro, or Bosnia and Herzegovina after officially registering in Croatia. According to the UNHCR in 2008, 125,000 were registered as having returned to Croatia, of whom 55,000 remained permanently.|$|E
30|$|A firm’s {{decision}} {{to engage in}} CSR may not be random. We adopt the Heckman two-stage sample selection method as a robustness check to control the potential self-selection bias (Heckman 1979). In the first step, we estimate a probit model with a binary <b>returnee</b> managers dummy (<b>Returnee</b> (0 / 1), which equals 1 if a firm {{has at least one}} <b>returnee</b> manager, 0 otherwise) as the dependent variable. Heckman’s estimator needs an exogenous variable that is correlated with a firm’s probability of employing <b>returnee</b> managers, but not correlated with CSR. We use Mean_Returnee (the mean percentage of hiring <b>returnee</b> managers by other firms in the same industry and year). The specification of the Probit model is the same as model (2) except for adding Mean_returnee. The untabulated first-stage regression shows that Mean_returnee is positively associated with <b>Returnee</b> (0 / 1). Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) is generated in the first stage and included in the second-step model to control for potential self-selection bias.|$|R
40|$|In an {{increasingly}} globalized business world, international human mobility and {{its association with}} entrepreneurship presents attractive opportunities for business research. One increasingly important phenomenon {{in the field is}} <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship, which is the reverse flow of migrants who acquired skills in developed countries back to their emerging-market home countries. In this way, knowledge from developed countries transfers back to, and fills technological and entrepreneurial gaps in, emerging countries. This thesis aims to explain <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship by examining what factors differentiate innovation, internationalization and business performance of <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firms. The empirical investigation uses a mixed method approach comprising a qualitative single case study and four quantitative studies of a recent sample of 200 Chinese <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firms, and focusses on factors such as knowledge and network relationships, which are two advantages that <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firms are thought to have. By distinguishing among types of knowledge from various sources, and network relationships from both international and domestic origins, the findings show that international opportunity knowledge and domestic business relationships influence the innovation performance of <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firms. The structural characteristics of the international network of a <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firm are related to that firm’s international networking capability, which in turn influence its opportunity-driven internationalization. Additionally, the international experiential knowledge of <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurs nurtures their firms’ international market knowledge, and these experiences also indirectly affect firm internationalization by being transmitted through that market knowledge. Finally, international networking capability and innovation performance positively influence the business performance of <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firms, whereas the international business knowledge has a negative impact on business performance. The thesis challenges the enthusiastic view of <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firms by refining the heterogeneity of both the <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurs themselves, and the performance variances of their ventures. Empirically, this thesis suggests a combination of knowledge and resources from both ‘worlds’ that can best benefit the performance of a <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurial firm. This thesis also contributes to theory by providing new insights into the combined effect of (1) an individual entrepreneur’s international experience, and (2) a new venture’s knowledge base and capabilities; furthermore it also describes what that combined effect will be on the new venture’s performance...|$|R
30|$|The {{hypothesis}} to {{be tested}} is that CSR {{is a function of}} managerial foreign experience. However, the results will be difficult to interpret when there is an endogeneity problem. For example, it might be possible that firms with better CSR performance are more attractive to <b>returnee</b> managers. We address the endogeneity problem by adopting propensity score matching (PSM). The primary advantage of using the PSM method is that we can compare firms with <b>returnee</b> managers to a control sample of observations with similar observable dimensions but without <b>returnee</b> managers. In this way, we can clearly attribute any observed effects to the hiring of <b>returnee</b> managers itself.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} year, Eberle {{was named}} to his second national junior team for the 2010 World Junior Championships in his hometown Regina, Saskatchewan. He was selected as an alternate captain to Patrice Cormier along with fellow <b>returnees</b> Colten Teubert, Alex Pietrangelo and Stefan Della Rovere. He was named player of the game against Switzerland {{in the second game}} of the round-robin—a 6–0 win—with a five-point game (one goal, four assists). Two games later, he notched two goals in regulation (one of which began a two-goal comeback late in the third period) and one in the shootout against the United States in the final game of the round-robin to earn his second player of the game honour of the tournament. Canada later met the United States again in the gold medal game. Down 5–3 with three minutes to go in regulation, Eberle scored twice to force overtime. His tying goal with 1:35 left made him Canada's all-time leading goal scorer in the tournament with 14 goals, passing John Tavares' mark set the previous year. Canada eventually lost in overtime, earning silver and ending their five-year gold medal streak.|$|E

30|$|We adopt two {{variables}} to gauge <b>returnee</b> managers: (1) <b>Returnee</b> (0 / 1), a dummy variable which equals 1 if firm i {{has at least}} one manager who has a previous study or work experience overseas in year t and 0 otherwise. Considering that CSR investment is part of corporate management decisions, we adopt a narrow definition of managers (i.e., CEO, vice CEO, CFO, COO and other top executives). The board of directors is not considered in this paper since directors play a relatively small monitoring and consulting role in corporations. (2) <b>Returnee</b> number, the number of managers who have a foreign study or work experience in year t. In further analyses, we distinguish the type of <b>returnee</b> managers into basically two categories: (1) <b>Returnee</b> study (0 / 1), a dummy variable which equals 1 if firm i {{has at least one}} manager who has previous study experience overseas in year t and 0 otherwise. (2) <b>Returnee</b> work (0 / 1), a dummy variable which equals 1 if firm i has at least one manager who has previous work experience overseas in year t and 0 otherwise. In addition, we further clarify the countries where managers obtained their foreign experience. Specifically, we define {{two variables}}: (1) <b>Returnee</b> developed (0 / 1) is a dummy variable which equals 1 if firm i has at least one manager who obtained his overseas experience from at least one developed economy 6 in year t and 0 otherwise. (2) <b>Returnee</b> number is the number of managers who obtained experience from advanced economies.|$|R

40|$|Research summary: We study <b>returnee</b> {{entrepreneurship}} {{through the}} lens of social influence. Contrary to the conventional view that treats <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship as discrete decisions by individuals, we examine the transmission of entrepreneurship through important peer networks-university dorm peers and ethnic association networks. We propose enduring effects from peer influence funnelling entrepreneurship entry in distant locations by shaping career aspirations and facilitating resource and information transfer. Using a unique dataset of overseas alumni of a top Indian university, we find strong evidence of the impact of peer influence on the likelihood of <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship. However, the effect of university peer influence does not extend beyond immediate peer groups in the same cohort. Managerial summary: The repatriation of highly skilled migrants has been viewed as important to the supply of entrepreneurial talent in emerging markets. Our study of the overseas alumni of a top Indian university points to the importance of peer influence in determining <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship. We find that peer ties formed {{in the early years of}} university study play a significant role in subsequent career choices and entrepreneurship entry in the home country. We also find co-ethnic professional networks facilitate engagement in <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship. While policies to encourage <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship have been geared largely toward promoting formal institutions and economic incentives, our work demonstrates a strong social amplification effect through networks and suggests that peer networks, especially those connecting alumni and ethnic professionals, are important channels to induce <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship...|$|R
30|$|With growing {{economic}} globalization, <b>returnee</b> {{managers who}} have obtained education or work experience overseas play {{a much more}} crucial role in corporations, especially in emerging economies. Using hand-collected managerial background data from a sample of firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2010 to 2014, this paper investigates the impact of <b>returnee</b> managers on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. We find that <b>returnee</b> managers can promote CSR performance. Further analyses show {{that the impact of}} <b>returnee</b> managers on CSR is more pronounced when managers have a foreign study background compared to managers with foreign work experience. The impact only holds when managers obtained their experience in developed economies. When enterprises face greater information asymmetry, <b>returnee</b> managers are more willing to use CSR as a tool to convey a positive image to stakeholders. CSR can help managers reduce information asymmetry and improve firm value. The results are robust through a series of robustness checks including a propensity score matching (PSM) procedure and a Heckman two-state sample selection model. This paper contributes to growing studies on the economic consequences of <b>returnee</b> managers and advances our understanding of the determinants of CSR at the individual level. The results also have implications for government and enterprises attracting talents with overseas experience.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we empirically {{explore the}} impact of <b>returnee</b> {{managers}} on CSR based on manually collected managerial background data over the period of 2010 to 2014.

We have {{conducted a series of}} robustness checks including propensity score matching (PSM), Heckman two-stage sample selection, alternative measure of CSR, and alternative definition of <b>returnee</b> managers and find that the results are robust. Further analyses show that this association is more pronounced if managers have foreign study experience compared with foreign career work experience. In addition, when firms face greater information asymmetry, <b>returnee</b> managers are more willing to use CSR as a tool to convey a positive image to outsiders. Further tests show that CSR can help managers reduce information asymmetry and improve firm value.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate how diaspora and <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurs use networks in the country of origin (COO) and country of residence (COR) and which benefits they gain from such networks. Research Design & Methods: In the face of the early state of research and the complexity of the subject, exploratory case study research was chosen. One case was conducted with a Ghanaian diaspora entrepreneur in Germany and the other with a Ghanaian <b>returnee</b> entrepreneur back from Germany. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews with both of the entrepreneurs were conducted to identify their network dynamics. Findings: Ghanaian diaspora entrepreneurs benefit mainly from networks in the COR and Ghanaian <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurs from networks in the COO. These findings are not fully consistent with the assumption of previous scholars that diaspora and <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurs intensively use both COO and COR networks. Implications & Recommendations: The network usage of diaspora and <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurs varies to a large extent depending on industry, personal background and human capital. It is necessary to research more intensively the heterogeneity within diaspora entrepreneurship. Contribution & Value Added: This paper contributes to the development of understanding of heterogeneity in diaspora and <b>returnee</b> entrepreneurship. The cases present that the degree and balance of mixed embeddedness of <b>returnee</b> and diaspora entrepreneurs in COO and COR may differ to a large extent and they influence how they benefit from different type of networks in both countries. This difference may arise from the physical absence/presence of entrepreneurs in the country or the structure of their business. We identified several dimensions to be considered in future research...|$|R

Economic globalization, together with the internationalization of Chinese enterprises, pushes the <b>returnee</b> manager issue even further to the forefront. Our findings are consistent with the notion that the presence of <b>returnee</b> managers has significance for corporate strategic decisions in terms of CSR, which supports the Chinese government’s recent efforts to recruit <b>returnee</b> managers.|$|R
