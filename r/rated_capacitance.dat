40|$|Metal {{displacement}} (cementation) {{reactions are}} usually diffusion controlled and conform to first order kinetics. When a displacement reaction {{is carried out}} in a batch reactor, positive deviations from a first order rate plot are commonly observed once the deposit becomes sufficiently thick. It {{has been suggested that}} these rate enhancements are the result of changes in deposit structure resulting in increases in surface area. Another theory argues that the rate enhancements are due to turbulence associated with increasing roughness of the deposit. In this paper, an attempt is made to discriminate between these two possibilities by measuring the capacitance of a copper electrode immersed in a silver(I) solution. It was found that no anomalous capacitance changes were observed corresponding to the region in which rate increases were observed. This suggests that turbulence effects, rather than area effects, are responsible for the increased reaction <b>rate.</b> <b>Capacitance</b> measurements were also conducted for the reaction between silver(I) and copper in the presence of cyanide which caused the silver to deposit in a thin uniform layer on the copper surface, thus blocking the displacement reaction.

Au NP-deposited Ni(OH) (2) (Au/Ni(OH) (2)) has been prepared by application of a conventional colloidal coating of Au NPs on the surface of 3 D-Ni(OH) (2) synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Compared with pristine Ni(OH) (2), Au/Ni(OH) (2) shows a 41 % enhanced <b>capacitance</b> value, excellent <b>rate</b> <b>capacitance</b> behavior at high current density conditions, and greatly improved cycling stability for supercapacitor applications. The specific capacitance of Au/Ni(OH) (2) reached 1927 F g(- 1) at 1 A g(- 1), which is close to the theoretical capacitance and retained 66 % and 80 % of the maximum value at a high current density of 20 A g(- 1) and 5000 cycles while that of pristine Ni(OH) (2) was 1363 F g(- 1) and significantly decreased to 48 % and 30 %, respectively, under the same conditions. The outstanding performance of Au/Ni(OH) (2) as a supercapacitor is attributed to the presence of metal Au NPs on the surface of semiconductor Ni(OH) (2); this permits the creation of virtual 3 D conducting networks via metal/semiconductor contact, which induces fast electron and ion transport by acting as a bridge between Ni(OH) (2) nanostructures, thus eventually leading to significantly improved electrochemical capacitive behaviors, as confirmed by the EIS and I-V characteristic data. close...|$|R
