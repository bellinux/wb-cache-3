5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} daughter. The {{loss of his}} wife had a {{profound}} effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a <b>rigger,</b> in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Clements {{worked as}} a <b>rigger</b> in the oil fields of east Texas. In 1921, however, his father's health began to fail, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky to help him on the farm and served as his deputy sheriff. As a hobby, he also coached football at his high school alma mater. One of his assistant coaches, Rodes K. Myers, {{would go on to}} be lieutenant governor under Keen Johnson. On January 18, 1927, Clements married Sara M. Blue. Their only child, Elizabeth (Bess) Hughes Clements Abell, became social secretary to Lady Bird Johnson and Walter Mondale.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with Mk. II's in May 1941 and Finucane {{was assigned}} serial P8038, formerly of No. 303 Squadron RAF, on 21 May. It {{was the first}} of four Spitfires to carry the Shamrock emblem as his personal insignia. Jimmy Firth, his airframe <b>rigger</b> and 'Speedy' Moore, a Canadian engine fitter, were attempting to put an outline of the design on. Poorly done, it attracted the attention of Maurice Pownhall a professional in Lithography. Using green dope he completed the emblem on the forward left part of the cockpit fairing panel. Finucane approved and the Shamrock stayed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graphical {{method of analysis}} for preliminary design of horizontally loaded tall buildings which are laterally supported by vertical trussed frames and horizontal off-set <b>riggers</b> which {{are located in the}} exterior or facade skeletal frame structures {{in the direction of the}} lateral loading. The interaction between the trussed frames and these facade <b>riggers</b> is through the two floor structures adjacent to the top and bottom cords of the <b>riggers.</b> The method of analysis requires the calculation of seven planar stiffness parameters: bending and shear stiffness of the vertical trussed frames, the horizontal off-set <b>riggers</b> and the floor structures in addition to the bending stiffness of the exterior skeletal frame structures which support the <b>riggers.</b> The method allows a graphical procedure for obtaining the optimum level of the facade <b>riggers</b> in addition to a rapid assessment of the influence of the floor structures and facade <b>riggers</b> on the performance of the high-rise structure such as the reduction in lateral deflection at the top and the overturning moment at the base of the trussed frames...|$|R
50|$|<b>Riggers</b> must {{navigate}} {{space by}} visualizing the intangible {{features of the}} Flux as an interactive landscape and adapting their flight patterns to the landscape. Although no two <b>riggers</b> will experience the same space {{in exactly the same}} way, a team of <b>riggers</b> must work together to create a shared vision of the Flux in order to successfully navigate their ship. The Flux has treacherous areas that can entrap a ship, manifesting themselves as whirlpools and eddies, or the more dangerous quantum flaws. Tales exist among the <b>riggers</b> of strange visions of dragons and ghost ships within the Flux.|$|R
5000|$|Only {{carpenters}} {{trained as}} <b>riggers</b> are trusted to do rigging (see fly crew). Often union houses and some larger theatres make distinctions between carpenters and <b>riggers,</b> but most smaller theatres do not, due to staffing limitations.|$|R
25|$|Riggers jump in to {{machines}} {{to control them}} with their mind. While jumped in {{they feel like they}} are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the <b>rigger</b> to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the <b>rigger</b> {{will have to deal with}} dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the <b>rigger</b> may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.|$|E
25|$|Most {{parachuting}} {{equipment is}} ruggedly designed and is enjoyed by several owners before being retired. Purchasers are always advised {{to have any}} potential purchases examined by a qualified parachute <b>rigger.</b> A <b>rigger</b> is trained to spot signs of damage or misuse. Riggers also keep track of industry product and safety bulletins, and can, therefore, determine if {{a piece of equipment}} is up-to-date and serviceable.|$|E

25|$|In the US {{and in most}} of {{the western}} world, skydivers are {{required}} to carry two parachutes. The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or not) by a certified parachute <b>rigger</b> (in the US, an FAA certificated parachute <b>rigger).</b> Many skydivers use an automatic activation device (AAD) that opens the reserve parachute at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level. Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.|$|E

His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam, <b>rigger</b> to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles.

It was at USC that Hensman met Conrad Buff. But prior to their collaboration with Straub, Buff and Hensman were designers of tract homes for a number of regional developers. He returned to teach architecture at his alma mater, USC from 1952 to 1963. He was eventually made assistant professor within USC’s design curriculum and was chairman of the joint USC/American Institute of Architects education committee. Hensman remained active in the Pasadena architectural community until his death in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The 1870 US Census was {{the first}} United States Census to count “Females engaged in each occupation” and {{provides}} an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in sweatshops. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory “operatives,” but teaching and the occupations of dressmaking, millinery, and tailoring played a larger role. Two-thirds of teachers were women. Women could {{also be found in}} such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship <b>rigger</b> (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), hunter and trapper (2).|$|E
