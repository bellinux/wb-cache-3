2500|$|The Kingdom of Hungary regained its {{constitutional}} independence through the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. Although the Catholic Church lost its privileged {{position in the}} Hungarian half of the [...] "Double Monarchy", {{the restoration of the}} religious laws of 1848 only resulted in the declaration of the equal status of the six [...] "received denominations". Despite a clerical and aristocratic counter-offensive, churchstate relations were reformed in 1894 and 1895. In those years civil marriage and a civil <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> and deaths were introduced, divorce, and conversion from Christianity to Judaism were legalized, and even the freedom of having no religious affiliation was enacted. In response, an essentially Catholic political organization pressing for the revision of these laws, the People's Party was organized by Count Nándor Zichy.|$|E

60|$|It is {{a matter}} of curiosity to observe the {{operation}} of this encouragement to disorder. I have before me the Paris paper correspondent to the usual <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>births,</b> marriages, and deaths. Divorce, happily, is no regular head of registry amongst civilized nations. With the Jacobins it is remarkable that divorce is not only a regular head, but it has the post of honor. It occupies the first place in the list. In the three first months of the year 1793 the number of divorces in that city amounted to 562; the marriages were 1785: so that the proportion of divorces to marriages was not much less than one to three: a thing unexampled, I believe, among mankind. I caused an inquiry to be made at Doctors' Commons concerning the number of divorces, and found that all the divorces (which, except by special act of Parliament, are separations, and not proper divorces) did not amount in all those courts, and in an hundred years, to much more than one fifth of those that passed in the single city of Paris in three months. I followed up the inquiry relative to that city through several of the subsequent months, until I was tired, and found the proportions still the same. Since then I have heard that they have declared for a revisal of these laws: but I know of nothing done. It appears as if the contract that renovates the world was under no law at all. From this we may take our estimate of the havoc that has been made through all the relations of life. With the Jacobins of France, vague intercourse is without reproach; marriage is reduced to the vilest concubinage; children are encouraged to cut the throats of their parents; mothers are taught that tenderness is no part of their character, and, to demonstrate their attachment to their party, that they ought to make no scruple to rake with their bloody hands in the bowels of those who came from their own.|$|E
