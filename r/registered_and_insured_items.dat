25|$|In {{the year}} 2001, the National Automobile Dealers Association {{conducted}} a study revealing {{the average age of}} vehicles in operation in the US.

According to this study the majority of vehicles, 60.6%, of vehicles were older than seven years in 2001. This relatively high age of automobiles in the US might be explained by unaffordable prices for comparable new replacement vehicles and a corresponding gradual decline in sales figures since 1998. Also, many Americans own three or more vehicles. The low marginal cost of <b>registering</b> <b>and</b> <b>insuring</b> additional older vehicles, many of which are rarely used, could cause the study to be skewed as these vehicles are still given full weight in the statistics.|$|R

40|$|Cryptarchi 2010 Hardware {{cryptographic}} systems must fulfill contradictory requirements: fast parallel structures implementing computationally extensive cryptographic functions must co-exist {{with complex}} sequential structures used to implement cryptographic algorithms such as cipher modes, key management operations and cryptographic protocols. Implementation of algorithms with sequential character necessitates employing many complex state machines {{that make the}} logic very instable and vulnerable. Most common solution consists {{of the use of}} a general-purpose processor with cryptographic co-processor. However, this solution brings some difficulties concerning the system security: first, the general-purpose processor manipulates the keys as ordinary data and modification (intentional or unintentional) of the program memory contents can enable reading the keys in clear outside the system; second, the use of general-purpose processors does not permit to isolate efficiently the red (unprotected) and black (protected) communication zones inside the device. In this context, our main objective is to propose a reconfigurable processor aimed at symmetric-key cryptographic applications with architecture dedicated to the common cryptography tasks: 128 -bit separated data <b>and</b> key <b>registers,</b> dedicated instruction set optimized for key generation and management, embedded cipher, etc. From the architecture point of view, the most important is the physical separation of data <b>and</b> key <b>registers</b> <b>and</b> buses, <b>insuring</b> that the confidential keys will never leave the system in clear.
