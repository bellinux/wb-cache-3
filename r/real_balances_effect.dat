The effect is absent from representative agent models as then net monetary wealth is always zero. With population growth, however, net monetary wealth is positive and a <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect</b> emerges much as Pigou predicted. Our main conclusion, however, is a Keynesian one: rather than eliminating {{the possibility of a}} trap, the framework generating the <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect</b> if anything makes a trap more likely due to the heightened constraints it imposes on the monetary authority. liquidity trap, <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect,</b> Pigou effect, monetary policy, Japan...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{advances}} {{an answer}} to a puzzle: Why is any lending or borrowing done in terms of money, when such money debt exposes the lenders’ wealth to inflation risk? The ‘received’ {{answer to this question}} is that money bonds are just proxies for real bonds, proxies born of insufficient appreciation, or a benign neglect, of inflation risk. As mere ‘proxies’, this answer implies that money bonds are redundant: anything a money bond could do, a real bond could do. The thesis of the paper is that money bonds are not redundant. Money bonds have a social benefit. That benefit lies in the reduction that money bonds secure in the unpredictability of consumption that arises from the operation of <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effects</b> in an environment of unpredictable money shocks. It is the very vulnerability of money bonds to inflation makes them useful in immunising the economy against unpredictable redistributions of purchasing power caused by <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effects.</b> <b>Real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect,</b> inflation risk, indexed bonds...|$|R
40|$|Federal Reserve System {{officials}} {{appear to}} have an on-going discussion concerning the appropriate target of monetary policy. In particular, should it be an interest rate, price level or quantity of money measure. We argue that some measure of the money supply should {{be used as a}} policy target in place of the federal funds rate. But which measure? Monetary theory suggests the most appropriate measure will be the one corresponding most closely to “outside money. ” Outside money, in contrast to inside money, generates a <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect.</b> An increase in outside money generates an increase in society’s net wealth, whereas an increase in inside money is an increase in both assets and liabilities, and hence does not create an increase in society’s net wealth. Commodity monies like gold or silver are outside money; likewise for fiat money such as the monetary base. An increase in the monetary base is an increase in net wealth, and should generate a large <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect.</b> In contrast, most of the M 2 money supply measure is interest-bearing debt, so an equivalent increase in M 2 should generate very little increase in net wealth, and a small <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect.</b> We demonstrate that there appeared to be a sizeable <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect</b> on aggregate spending from outside money, as the theory suggested, during the Greenspan era. In particular, when there was a slowdown in growth of the monetary base to nearly the same level as the growth of real output, the adverse <b>real</b> <b>balance</b> <b>effect</b> created economic and/or financial market dislocations either within or outside the U.

Using cointegration techniques and the Johansen procedure they first establish a desired long-run demand function for liquid assets depending on income, wealth and a set of interest rates. Deviations of liquidity from this desired level cause changes in consumption via intertemporal substitution but via its effect on disequilibrium liquidity. Consumption is modeled in an error-correction framework and is also found to depend on income and financial wealth. Both the disequilibrium liquidity and wealth terms may be picking up the effects of financial liberalization (e. g.
