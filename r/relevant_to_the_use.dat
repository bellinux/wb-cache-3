30|$|The {{performance}} analysis is most developed by simulations. This {{is a rather}} classical approach {{for this kind of}} problems, where the theoretical framework usually relies on a number of previous results (concerning modeling of the channel and the devices) that are suitably combined <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> specific scenario. Our aim is to apply such consolidated models taking into account the peculiarities of the tactical radio scenarios, most of them being <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>used</b> range of frequencies (in the VHF/UHF band). Our analysis aims at showing that, in this context, APSK can be advantageous with respect to more conventional modulation schemes, like QAM.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA novel {{optical sensor}} for the {{detection}} of ultrasonic motion has been recently developed. It allows to reach 25 μm displacement sensitivity with a large frequency range bandwidth 100 MHz. We will present a comparative study between various architectures of this ultrasonic detection system we have implemented. It uses InP:Fe or CdZnTe:V holographic crystals and operates with CW laser at 1. 06 μm. Two configurations called the direct detection and the anisotropic diffraction configurations work with either plane or speckled waves. A third discussed configuration works with depolarized speckled waves. We measured their relative detection limits {{as a function of the}} applied electric field that governs photorefractive efficiency of the materials.

50|$|The {{nature of}} murder and death, {{performed}} and as natural phenomena, is also questioned. Smith considers {{the decade of the}} play <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of hangings, murders, and near deaths throughout the play. Multiple characters are killed or nearly killed throughout the play. Horatio is hanged, Pedringano is hanged, Alexandro is nearly burnt at the stake, and Villuppo is assumed tortured and hanged. Kyd consistently refers to mutilation, torture, and death, beginning early in the play when the ghost of Don Andrea describes his stay in the underworld: “And murderers groan with never killing wounds, / And perjured wights scalded in boiling lead, / And all foul sins with torments overwhelmed” (I.i.68-70). He vividly describes in these lines as well as others the frequency {{of murder and}} torture in the underworld. Murder and death make up the tragedy theme that holds true through the last scene of the play.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The cost of {{emissions}} tests {{and other factors}} have discouraged nearly all but the largest product manufacturers from obtaining emissions data. Emissions data, where available, require toxicologic evaluation before design professionals and other potential purchasers can <b>use</b> them. <b>The</b> absence of health effects infonnation at the low exposures likely to occur from nonnal indoor uses of most products and materials increases the uncertainty in any such evaluation. The complex mixture emitted by most products poses an additional interpretation problem. A simple screening procedure to identify potentially problematic products has been developed, and preliminary experience indicates it may be suitable for screening or comparing products during selection by design professionals and other consumers. Commercial specimens are tested for emissions in a small, controlled, dynamic test container over a 24 -h period after initial screening by headspace analysis. The procedure allows identification of and quantification of dominant compounds that may then be reviewed for odor, irritancy, toxicity, and carcinogenicity. Only significant quantities of such substances likely to cause adverse effects are considered sufficient basis for rejecting a product. The screening procedure is <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> required fo...|$|R
