40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental work}} on the detection of <b>spurious</b> RF <b>emissions</b> of mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (mini-UAV). Many recent events have shown that mini-UAVs {{can be considered as}} a potential threat for civil security. For this reason the detection of mini-UAVs has become of interest to the sensor community. The detection, classification and identification chain can take advantage of different sensor technologies. Apart from the signatures used by radar and electro-optical sensor systems, the UAV also emits RF signals. These RF signatures can be split in intentional signals for communication with the operator and un-intentional RF signals emitted by the UAV. These unintentional or <b>spurious</b> RF <b>emissions</b> are very weak but could be used to discriminate potential UAV detections from false alarms. The goal of this research was to assess the potential of exploiting <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> in the classification and identification chain of mini-UAVs. It was already known that spurious signals are very weak, but the focus was on the question whether the emission pattern could be correlated to the behaviour of the UAV. In this paper experimental examples of <b>spurious</b> RF <b>emission</b> for different types of mini-UAVs and their correlation with the electronic circuits in the UAVs will be shown. Â© 2016 SPIE.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} is {{presented}} a useful and economic measuring principle with which radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> can be investigated {{under field conditions}} without disturbing {{the function of the}} radar in any way. The method presented here consists of two parts: In the time-domain parameter study is presented, how the radar antenna rotation produces radar pulses to the measuring receiver. Also is presented, how receiver parameters are defined by availability and use of radar pulses in the measurement. In the frequency spectrum measurement part a new sweep measurement system is presented. In this measurement the YIG filter presented by ITU [1] is replaced by a similar multistage tunable band-stop filter, which meets similar filtering characteristics, this is more easy to use and a less expensive filter. It is explained how the needed measurement dynamics are achieved and how the measurement time is determined and optimized in different situations. A two part measuring approach like this has not been reported before. ITU recommendations for attenuation of radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> are updated to 100 dB below the radar nominal frequency (NF) signal level. The fulfillment of these spurious level requirements sets a hard challenge for measuring dynamics: dynamics must be more than 110 dB. The author provides in this work a solution to this requirement. This measuring method produces results, with which one can conclude the relative power level of radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> and its effect on other radio services. In this work the spectrum produced by a 5 GHz weather radar has been studied and the results have been applied to study radar impact to terrestrial digital radio relay systems (TDRRS). The achieved result is both very important and current, and it can be utilized in the planning of new radar systems as also in the planning of new radio networks operating in the frequency ranges adjacent to radar frequencies. Possible radio networks in addition to TDRRSs that can be interfered from radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> are Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Area (WiMAX) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems. These systems also can interfere with radar frequencies...|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, a {{spectral}} mask, {{also known}} as a channel mask or transmission mask, is a mathematically-defined set of lines applied to the levels of radio (or optical) transmissions. The spectral mask is generally intended to reduce adjacent-channel interference by limiting excessive radiation at frequencies beyond the necessary bandwidth.
