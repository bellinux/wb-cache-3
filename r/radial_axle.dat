25|$|Based {{partly on}} {{contemporary}} British railway practice, {{the experience of}} Sir Charles Fox and Sons on the Queensland Railways, and Carl Abraham Pihl's work in Norway, the early rolling stock was intended to consist of short four-wheel boxcars, and longer six-wheel flat and passenger cars using Clark's <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> arrangement. The four-wheel boxcars were reliable and suited the traffic at first, but became {{too small for the}} increasing traffic, and were not added to after 1874. Many became wayside grounded tool vans after gauge standardisation. The first longer flatcars were built using imported sets of Clark's radial gear and put into service with the construction contractors. The intention was that they would go more easily around tight curves. Whether through bad design, poor assembly, or abuse and heavy uneven loading by the construction gangs, the six-wheel cars proved disastrously prone to derailment and were soon put aside in favour of cars re-equipped with two standard North American four-wheel trucks (bogies). The passenger cars were never used in six-wheel form due to safety concerns.|$|E
2500|$|The Manx Northern Railway's {{first two}} engines were {{provided}} by Sharp, Stewart and Company for the line's opening in 1879 and were 2-4-0 side tank locomotives bearing the names Ramsey and Northern. [...] J.I.C. Boyd in his [...] "Isle of Man Railway (Oakwood Press 1967) {{points out that the}} Sharpies were dimensionally similar to the Beyer Peacock locomotives built for the IMR. [...] However, in their use of a leading <b>radial</b> <b>axle,</b> rather than a Bissell truck, and other features, they were more conventional examples of mid-Victorian locomotive design than the Isle of Man Railway's Beyers. [...] Boyd mentions that they were tested at speed before their entry into service and officially restricted to 45mph. [...] There have been some suggestions that their shorter wheelbase, 11'6" [...] as opposed to 13'9" [...] for the Beyer Peacock locomotives, made their ride less than steady at higher speeds. [...] However, this {{does not seem to have}} limited their usefulness as both were reboilered in 1892/3, and McNabb ("Isle of Man Railway," [...] 1945) reports that they were both [...] "worn out" [...] by 1905. Ramsey was hired to IOMTEPCo by the MNR for construction work in the 19th century. Whilst there are very few photographs in existence, it is known that they survived the takeover by the Isle of Man Railway in 1905 but were never re-numbered as the other two Manx Northern locomotives were. [...] They saw very little use on the line after takeover (the railway having only just purchased Nos. 10 and 11 at this time) and were scrapped in 1923 and 1912 respectively. [...] Ramsey is reported to have been used to haul Permanent Way trains (Boyd, op. cit.) in the years before 1914. [...] Their fate other than these dates is not known and they have become part of the folklore of the island's railway network, lost in the mists of time. [...] It seems likely, however, that as non-standard locomotives, they were scrapped as soon as the traffic department regarded them as surplus to future requirements. [...] This probably occurred after the delivery of No. 13 Kissack in 1910. [...] There is some evidence (Boyd, op. cit.) that the Railway attempted to sell [...] "Ramsey" [...] in 1919, and again in 1920 as a contractors' locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The leading and {{trailing}} {{carrying wheels}} were fitted in F.W. Webb-type radial axleboxes. Webb's arrangement {{consisted of two}} <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> boxes joined by a curved casting, so that they moved in unison between curved steel plates bolted to the main frame. A bogie check spring, having a single spiral spring, was enclosed in a box secured to the curved plates. The arcs of the leading and trailing <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> boxes were struck from a centre midway between the coupled wheels.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>axles</b> {{were also}} used in {{locomotives}} designed by [...] F.W. Webb of the London and North Western Railway, and by William Stroudley and R. J. Billinton of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway.|$|R
50|$|Their rigidly mounted leading and {{trailing}} {{carrying wheels}} were also arranged as <b>radial</b> <b>axles</b> {{to allow for}} sideways motion of the wheels {{in relation to the}} locomotive frame, since the locomotive did not have separate bogie trucks. As on the Class Hd, this resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading carrying wheels were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|R
25|$|Stroudley’s {{successor}} R. J. Billinton {{continued the}} process of standardisation of locomotive parts {{until his death in}} 1904, thereby reducing maintenance costs. He introduced 8-wheeled designs in the form of 4-4-0 express locomotives and a very successful series of 0-6-2 tank engines with <b>radial</b> <b>axles.</b> D.E.

50|$|In 1865 the Society of Engineers, London, made direct {{comparison}} between the <b>radial</b> <b>axle,</b> invented by William Bridges Adams, and a bogie design with an india-rubber central bearing invented by William Adams: during trials on the North London Railway the laterally sprung bogie was thought superior to the <b>radial</b> <b>axle,</b> but when William Adams moved from the NLR to the London and South Western Railway he adopted the design of his rival William Bridges Adams; the locomotives now known as Adams Radials are named after the LSWR Locomotive Superintendent, but are famous for the axle invented by William Bridges Adams.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>axles</b> {{were widely}} used on {{carriages}} {{in the late}} 19th century before the adoption of bogies. They were also used on the leading or trailing carrying axles of locomotives, particularly tank locomotives. The idea was first tried successfully by William Bridges Adams on the London and South Western Railway in 1863 and {{was known as the}} Adams Axle. It was subsequently taken up by other engineers, notably his namesake William Adams, Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR, who introduced a class now known as [...] "Adams Radials".|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with Heusinger valve gear, piston {{valves and}} outside plate frames. Since {{they were to}} be used across the Namib Desert, they were equipped with dust covers to protect the motion from wind-blown sand. Their leading and trailing carrying wheels were not mounted in separate bogie trucks, but were rigidly mounted and arranged as <b>radial</b> <b>axles</b> to allow for sideways motion of the wheels in relation to the locomotive frame. This resulted in a rigid wheelbase of 17 ft, even though the leading carrying wheels were arranged to the rear instead of ahead of the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|Confusingly, one of {{the first}} railway {{companies}} to use his axle-box design widely was the London and South Western Railway where the Locomotive Superintendent, the creator of the Adams Bogie, was also named William Adams. By further coincidence he too had formerly operated a locomotive works in Bow, but this was not a private concern but the depot of the North London Railway. In 1865 the Society of Engineers, London, made direct comparison between the bogie with the india-rubber lateral bearing of William Adams and the <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> box of William Bridges Adams: during trials on the North London Railway the laterally sprung bogie was thought superior to the <b>radial</b> <b>axle,</b> but when William Adams moved to the LSWR he adopted the axle box designed by his rival Bridges Adams. The locomotives now known as Adams Radials are named after the Locomotive Superintendent, but they are famous for the axle invented by William Bridges Adams.|$|E
50|$|William Bridges Adams (1797 - 23 July 1872) was an author, {{inventor}} and locomotive engineer. He is {{best known}} for his patented Adams axle — a successful <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> design in use on railways in Britain until the end of steam traction in 1968 — and the railway fishplate. His writings, including English Pleasure Carriages (1837) and Roads and Rails (1862) covered all forms of land transport. Later he became a noted writer on political reform, under the pen name Junius Redivivus (Junius reborn); a reference to a political letter writer of the previous century.|$|E
50|$|The Adams axle {{is a form}} of <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> {{for rail}} {{locomotives}} that enable them to negotiate curves more easily. It was invented by William Bridges Adams and patented in 1865. The invention uses axle boxes that slide on an arc in shaped horn blocks, so allowing the axle to slide out to either side. This is similar to the movement of a Bissell truck, but with the notional centre point of the curve being where the pivot of the truck would be. This design, using slide bearings, is more expensive than one employing a shaft, but takes up less space.|$|E
50|$|In 1912, the German {{administration}} in Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika acquired three locomotives {{for use on}} the line from Swakopmund to Karibib. They were built by Henschel & Son and were designated Class Hd. The locomotives were superheated, with Heusinger valve gear, piston valves and outside plate frames. Since they did not have separate bogie trucks, the leading and trailing carrying wheels were arranged as <b>radial</b> <b>axles</b> to allow for sideways motion of the wheels with respect to the locomotive frame. After the First World War, they were taken onto the roster of the South African Railways (SAR) and later reclassified as Class NG5 along with the similar locomotives of 1922.|$|R

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{automatic detection}} system, {{which had the}} characteristic of transmitting data of ultrasonic inspection signal based on the Ethernet network, was presented in this paper. The system was composed of the detection computer and the operation computer. The detection computer was placed near the workpiece, gathering the ultrasonic probe signal and directly transforming the analog signal into the digital signal in the inspection process. Then the digital signal was transmitted to the operation computer through the network. The operation computer completed the ultrasonic digital signal analysis, processing, display and data storage. This system has high detection efficiency and strong noise proof capability in the work field. This paper also introduced {{the application of the}} network transmission method in the multi-channel automatic detection system, such as the entire steel pipe body detection and the <b>axle</b> <b>radial</b> direction flaw detection...|$|R
50|$|These 1B1-tender {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first of this class in The Netherlands, in fact the NRS employed the first passenger service tender locomotives with this type. The Westinghouse brake system was a first for the NRS; the additional hand brake was common. To obtain a stable ride at high speeds, inside cylinders were employed. The firebox was situated between the coupled axles. The front and rear axles were of the Webb type, already employed by the London North Western Railway. The <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> boxes were produced with very fine tolerances. Rubber bumpers were employed to move the axle back into position.|$|E
50|$|William Adams (15 October 1823 - 7 August 1904) was the Locomotive Superintendent of the North London Railway from 1858 to 1873; the Great Eastern Railway from 1873 until 1878 and the London and South Western Railway {{from then}} until his {{retirement}} in 1895. He {{is best known for his}} locomotives featuring the Adams bogie, a device with lateral centring springs (initially made of rubber) to improve high-speed stability. He should not be mistaken for William Bridges Adams (1797-1872) a locomotive engineer who, confusingly, invented the Adams axle - a <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> that William Adams incorporated in designs for the London and South Western Railway.|$|E
50|$|The Victorian Railways M {{class were}} the first tank {{locomotives}} for suburban passenger service ordered by the Victorian Railways in Australia. They were numbered 40 (the prototype engine), 210-240 (evens only) and 312-320 (also evens only). They were classed M in 1886. Due to their small water and coal bunker → coal bunker capacity, they were not satisfactory on the longer suburban runs, and between 1901 and 1905 all were rebuilt as 4-4-2T locomotives with the frames extended at the rear to accommodate a <b>radial</b> <b>axle</b> to support an enlarged bunker of 3 t capacity. As rebuilt, these locomotives were regarded as equal to the new E class 2-4-2T suburban engines, and the suffix E {{was added to the}} M. Although they were known as ME class the original M plates were not altered. None were preserved.|$|E
5000|$|In Ontario, the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway (TG&BR) and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway (T&NR), {{were the}} first public {{passenger}} carrying narrow-gauge railways on the continent of North America, coming into service {{in the summer of}} 1871. The gauge of [...] was chosen on the recommendation of Carl Abraham Pihl, Chief Engineer of the Norwegian State Railways, who had adopted this gauge in Norway in the early 1860s. Sir Charles Fox, engineer and constructor of the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London’s Hyde Park, was largely responsible for adoption of the gauge throughout the former British Empire and Colonies, it becoming commonly known as the ‘Colonial’ gauge. The objective of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was to open up the bush country north of Toronto to settlement and commerce. The lines were first surveyed by John Edward Boyd of St. John, New Brunswick who, as Railway Engineer of that colony in the 1860s, had advocated the construction of the New Brunswick Railway on the gauge of 3 ft 6 in. Boyd later became the Chief Engineer of the narrow-gauge Prince Edward Island Railway. The chief Engineer of both the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was Edmund Wragge, a former pupil and associate of Sir Charles Fox. Wragge returned to Britain between 1895 and 1905 and was honoured by the award of the Telford Gold Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers for his work on the approach to and construction of the London (Marylebone) terminus of the Great Central Railway. The Ontario lines were of substantial length, over 300 mi in aggregate, and both were built with the objective of connecting with a future Pacific railway, at Lake Nipissing {{in the case of the}} T&NR, and via steamers to the Lakehead in the case of the TG&BR. Only the latter was achieved. Although independent of each other financially, they were promoted and engineered by the same men and were in fact connected by a short length of third rail in the Toronto waterfront trackage of the Grand Trunk Railway. These Ontario railways attempted several innovations in addition to the adoption of the narrow gauge: the use of Clark’s six wheel <b>radial</b> <b>axles</b> for longer stock - a complete failure and never used; the use of four wheel boxcars for economy and flexibility - not entirely successful; the use of large Fairlie articulated 0-6-6-0 freight locomotives (see illustration) - found very powerful and useful initially, but heavy on maintenance and not pursued further; and the early use of powerful Avonside Engine Company 4-6-0 and Baldwin Locomotive Works 2-8-0 locomotives for freight haulage - very successful engines which remained in service with the Canadian Pacific Railway after gauge standardization. Initially very successful in stimulating trade, the two railways had difficulty carrying all the traffic offered in the early 1870s. Then, after they had bought large numbers of additional freight locomotives and boxcars, the traffic fell off due to the economic depression of the mid-1870s and was insufficient to support the heavy financial burden of the capital invested. A case of ‘too much, too late’. Like all smaller railways in central Canada in the early 1880s their financial difficulties made them vulnerable in the battle for feeder routes and traffic between the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The Toronto and Nipissing Railway was amalgamated into the Midland Railway of Canada in 1881 and made standard gauge as part of the Midland's plan to obtain direct access to Toronto; later the whole enterprise was absorbed by the Grand Trunk Railway. The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway was first acquired by the Grand Trunk Railway which converted it to standard gauge in 1881, but following its own financial embarrassment it was forced to cede control to the Ontario and Quebec Railway a proxy for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Much of the trackage has been abandoned and lifted but some remains in service. 20 mi of the T&NR from Toronto to Stouffville carries GO Transit commuter trains and a further 12 mi from Stouffville to Uxbridge, Ontario, is operated as a tourist line by the York Durham Heritage Railway. 26 mi of the TG&BR from Toronto to Bolton, Ontario, carries CPR freight trains, and about 3 mi from Melville Junction to Orangeville is operated by the Orangeville-Brampton Railway. Another tourist line, the Portage Flyer, operates at the Muskoka Heritage Place museum complex in Huntsville, and runs on [...]75 mi of [...] narrow-gauge track.|$|R
