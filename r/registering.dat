5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 <b>register</b> {{signalling}} variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone.

The origination end is called the outgoing <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the incoming <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The outgoing <b>register</b> transmits forward MF tones to the incoming <b>register.</b> The incoming <b>register</b> transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing <b>register.</b> The outgoing <b>register</b> detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming <b>register.</b> The incoming <b>register</b> detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing <b>register.</b> The outgoing <b>register</b> transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing <b>register</b> merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming <b>register.</b> (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing <b>register's</b> first push signal to the incoming <b>register</b> is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming <b>register's</b> pull signals, which request information from the outgoing <b>register,</b> are client-server, where the client is the incoming <b>register</b> and the server is the outgoing <b>register.)</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The whistle <b>register</b> (also {{called the}} flute <b>register</b> or whistle tone) {{is the highest}} <b>register</b> of the human voice, lying above the modal <b>register</b> and falsetto <b>register.</b> This <b>register</b> has a {{specific}} physiological production {{that is different from}} the other <b>registers,</b> and is so called because the timbre of the notes that are produced from this <b>register</b> {{is similar to that of}} a whistle.|$|R

Seven of the A <b>registers</b> {{were tied to}} their corresponding X <b>register.</b> Setting A1 through A5 read that address and fetched it into the corresponding X1 through X5 <b>register.</b> Likewise, setting <b>register</b> A6 or A7 wrote the corresponding X6 or X7 <b>register</b> to central memory at the address written to the A <b>register.</b> A0 was effectively a scratch <b>register.</b>|$|R
