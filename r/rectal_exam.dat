2500|$|The ileum is {{the last}} part of the small {{intestine}} that ends in the cecum. Ileal impaction can be caused by obstruction of ingesta. Coastal bermuda hay is associated with impactions in this most aborad (adj. [...] "In a direction away from the mouth".) segment of the small intestine, although it is difficult to separate this risk factor from geographic location, since the southeastern United States has a higher prevalence of ileal impaction and also has regional access to coastal Bermuda hay. Other causes can be obstruction by ascarids (Parascaris equorum), usually occurring at 3–5 months of age right after deworming, and tapeworms (Anoplocephala Perfoliata), which have been associated with up to 81% of ileal impactions (See Ascarids). Horses show intermittent colic, with moderate to severe signs and with time, distended small intestinal loops on rectal. Although most ileal impactions will sometimes pass without intervention, those present for 8–12 hours will cause fluid to back up, leading to gastric reflux, which is seen in approximately 50% of horses that require surgical intervention. Diagnosis is usually made based on clinical signs, presence of reflux, <b>rectal</b> <b>exam,</b> and ultrasound. Often the impaction can not be felt on rectal due to distended small intestinal loops that block the examiner. Those impactions that are unresponsive to medical management, which includes IV fluids and removal of reflux, may be treated using a single injection into the ileum with 1 liter of carboxymethylcellulose, and then massaging the ileum. This allows the impaction to be treated without actually cutting into the ileum. Prognosis for survival is good.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{reasons for}} African-American men to seek care for lower urinary care {{symptoms}} {{has not been}} determined due to sparse population-based data. OBJECTIVE: Our study examines the solicitation and receipt of medical care for urinary symptoms among racially oversampled elderly urban and rural cohort of African Americans and whites. DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses were conducted on five North Carolina counties through the Piedmont Health Survey of the Elderly Established Populations for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly. In 1994, the analytic cohort included 482 African Americans and 407 whites; by 1998, 249 and 222, respectively. RESULTS: In 1994, 49. 4 % of African Americans presented with lower urinary tract symptoms compared to 56. 8 % of whites. By 1998, these percentages increased to 60. 6 % and 70. 3 %, respectively. African Americans reported more interference with {{activities of daily living}} than whites. African Americans were less likely than whites to have regular digital <b>rectal</b> <b>exams</b> (DRE) and {{were more likely to have}} never received a DRE at all. Additionally, elders with less educational attainment, those who smoked, those who delayed care quite often and those who used less-experienced physicians were less likely to receive regular DREs.

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most {{frequently}} diagnosed cancer in men and {{the second most common}} cause of cancer related death in men. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood tests and digital <b>rectal</b> <b>exams</b> (DRE) are preliminary tests that can suggest the presence of prostate cancer. Following these tests, a needle biopsy is required to determine if a suspected tumor is benign or malignant. Currently, an ultrasound image is used to help guide a needle to the prostate and to the suspected region. However, ultrasound images are not of good enough quality to accurately hit a tumor. Too often, false negative results are returned because the tumor is missed. This can be prevented by using more accurate images, which can be obtained using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This presents a technical challenge because it requires robotic assistance since there is very limited access to a patient inside the bore. Additionally, the high magnetic fields prohibit the use of conventional actuators in the procedure. Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) are MRI compatible due to their entirely polymer construction. Studies show that DEAs must be actuated in a bistable manner to be reliable. In this thesis, bistable DEAs were used in the design of an MRI compatible robotic needle manipulator. (cont.) The concepts of elastic averaging and parallel mechanisms were applied to achieve high precision and adequate stiffness. The manipulator parameters were chosen to fit the specifications established with collaborators at Harvard Medical School's Brigham and Women's Hospital. A design to orient the needle has been developed, analyzed and built. This research shows that the design is feasible for development into a clinical device if manufacturing processes allow for fabrication of multi-layer actuators.

40|$|Background: Early {{screening}} for cancer is arguably {{one of the}} greatest public health advances over the last fifty years. However, many cancer screening tests are invasive (digital <b>rectal</b> <b>exams),</b> expensive (mammograms, imaging) or both (colonoscopies). This has spurred growing interest in developing genomic signatures {{that can be used for}} cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, progress has been slowed by heterogeneity in cancer profiles and the lack of effective computational prediction tools for this type of data. Results: We developed anti-profiles as a first step towards translating experimental findings suggesting that stochastic across-sample hyper-variability in the expression of specific genes is a stable and general property of cancer into predictive and diagnostic signatures. Using single-chip microarray normalization and quality assessment methods, we developed an anti-profile for colon cancer in tissue biopsy samples. To demonstrate the translational potential of our findings, we applied the signature developed in the tissue samples, without any further retraining or normalization, to screen patients for colon cancer based on genomic measurements from peripheral blood in an independent study (AUC of 0. 89). This method achieved higher accuracy than the signature underlying commercially available peripheral blood screening tests for colon cancer (AUC of 0. 81). We also confirmed the existence of hyper-variable genes across a range of cancer types and found that a significant proportion of tissue-specific genes are hyper-variable in cancer. Based on these observations, we developed a universal cancer anti-profile that accurately distinguishes cancer from normal regardless of tissue type (ten-fold cross-validation AUC > 0. 92). Conclusions: We have introduced anti-profiles as a new approach for developing cancer genomic signatures that specifically takes advantage of gene expression heterogeneity. We have demonstrated that anti-profiles can be successfully applied to develop peripheral-blood based diagnostics for cancer and used anti-profiles to develop a highly accurate universal cancer signature. By using single-chip normalization and quality assessment methods, no further retraining of signatures developed by the anti-profile approach would be required before their application in clinical settings.

40|$|Background: Insulin-like growth factor- 1 can act in both an {{autocrine}} and paracrine {{manner to}} promote normal growth and malignant cellular proliferation. The {{importance of this}} factor as a major regulatory peptide has been established for cells, in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels in the etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer has not received sufficient attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, and serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels. Methods: We collected blood samples from 68 individuals with prostate cancer (cases) and 68 individuals with benign prostatic hyperplasia (controls) who were patients at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Those with benign prostatic hyperplasia had normal prostatic specific antigen levels 0. 05). Mean serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels were 219 ng/ml for the case group and 133 ng/ml for the control group, which was significant (P= 0. 0009). We did not observe any correlation between age and insulin-like growth factor- 1 in the case group (P= 0. 83, r= - 0. 47), however there was a significant correlation in the control group (P= 0. 007, r= 0. 549). Although correlation between prostate volume and serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels was not statistically significant in the case group (P= 0. 38, r= 0. 213), therewas a positive correlation observed in the control group (P< 0. 008, r= 0. 537). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that insulin-like growth factor- 1 may have an etiologic role in prostate cancer. This interpretation is strengthened by the significant difference observed between serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer patients. These results also offer additional opportunities for evaluating patients who have abnormal digital <b>rectal</b> <b>exams</b> or prostate specific antigen levels, yet their biopsies are normal. Under these circumstances, measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 may assist with the decision for a second biopsy...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the report}} of a health needs {{assessment}} for the Oneida Indian Nation of New York (ONNY). This needs assessment was conducted in order to collect population-based data related to behavioral risks and reproductive health for Oneida males and females. The survey of the Oneida was initiated because {{there is almost no}} risk factor data available on Indian tribes of the northeast, and none available for the Oneida Nation of New York. There are four primary goals for the 1990 Oneida Nation Health Needs Assessment. They are 1) to collect behavioral risk factor and reproductive health data for adult Oneida Nation members living on or near Oneida Nation lands, 2) to assess the current basic health needs of the ONNY, 3) to document the medical providers and hospitals which are currently being utilized by the Nation members and. 4) to develop recommendations for use by health planners from this baseline data. The Oneida Nation Health Needs Assessment (ONHNA) was carried out among enrolled members of the Oneida Nation who were 18 years of age and older who lived in the six counties that are contiguous to the Oneida Nation lands. The Nation Enrollment List was used to identify the Oneida population located in the six-county area. The choice to interview only adults was made to avoid legal difficulties in interviewing minors. Interviewing was conducted in each household face-to-face rather than using mailed questionnaires or telephone contact. All interviewers were enrolled Oneida Nation members. Interviews were conducted by interviewers of the same sex as the respondent. All interviewers participated in one week of training {{prior to the start of}} the field work. Four types of data were collected. First, the behavioral risk factors surveyed were related to the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. Behavioral factors include seat belt usage, physical exercise, diet, cigarette and smokeless tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, and the existence of high blood pressure. The second data set included health needs. The survey questions dealt with the prevalence of current diseases and health problems among the Oneidas, and with whether the Oneida people have routine screening tests such as cholesterol, diabetes, and hypertension, and eye exams, pap smears, breast <b>exams,</b> and <b>rectal</b> <b>exams.</b> The third set of data questions focused on reproductive health factors. Questions covered topics such as fertility, contraception, and general maternal-child health conditions. The fourth and final set of questions gathered data on health care utilization. This data will be used to establish health provider contracts with physicians, dentists, pediatricians, and hospitals to provide quality health care for a more reasonable cost. For each risk factor, comparisons were made between the Oneida Nation and data from the 1988 New York State Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. The individual completion rates were 54 % for females and 69 % for males for a total of 211 respondents in all. The following is an abbreviated summary of selected data from the survey. Seat belt use was only slightly lower than for all New Yorkers. Non-use was highest among young drivers. Sixty percent of Oneida males and 78 percent of Oneida females reported having their blood pressure taken within a year of the survey. All Oneida members were more active physically than the general New York population. However, all Oneida members were more likely to be overweight by comparison Forty percent of all Oneida people are smokers compared to 25 percent of the New York population. Fifty-seven percent of Oneida males and 32 percent of Oneida females are classified as acute and heavy drinkers. Percentages for regular health checks across all factors vary considerably among the Oneida people. Several areas of concern were identified including cholesterol checks, diabetes screening, <b>rectal</b> <b>exams</b> and mammograms. The completed fertility of the Oneida women in this survey is 2. 1 children which is lower than that of all U. S. women surveyed in the 1980 census. Female sterilization is the most prevalent contraceptive method among Oneida women. as it is among the general U. S. population. With respect to behavioral risks, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are of major concern. This impacts on concerns for overall reproductive health. The task now is to identify the highest priority objectives and to secure resources needed to accomplish these tasks...|$|R
