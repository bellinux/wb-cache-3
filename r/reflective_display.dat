It's a low-power and low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better {{than or equal to}} other <b>reflective</b> <b>display</b> types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies. Instead of using red, green and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electro-wetting allows for a system in which one pixel can switch three different colors independently.|$|E

5000|$|A {{transflective}} {{liquid-crystal display}} is a liquid-crystal display (LCD) that reflects and transmits light (transflective is a portmanteau of transmissive and reflective). Under bright illumination (e.g. {{when exposed to}} daylight) the display acts mainly as a <b>reflective</b> <b>display</b> with the contrast being constant with illuminance. Only in dim and dark ambient situations is an auxiliary transmissive backlight needed.|$|E
50|$|In {{marketing}} literature, contrast {{ratios for}} emissive (as opposed to <b>reflective)</b> <b>displays</b> are always measured under the optimum condition {{of a room}} in total darkness. In typical viewing situations, the contrast ratio is significantly lower due to the reflection {{of light from the}} surface of the display, making it harder to distinguish between different devices with very high contrast ratios. How much the room light reduces the contrast ratio depends on the luminance of the display, as well as the amount of light reflecting off the display.|$|R

50|$|Because {{elements}} {{only use}} power {{in order to}} switch between on and off states (no power is needed to reflect or absorb light hitting the display once the element is either reflecting or absorbing), IMOD-based displays potentially use much less power than displays that generate light and/or need constant power to keep pixels in a particular state.
