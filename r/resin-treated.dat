40|$|International audienceThe main {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate the formaldehyde emission, some mechanical properties and bonding quality of oil palm trunk (OPT) plywood treated with low molecular weight phenol-formaldehyde (LmwPF), as affected by resin concentration. The mechanical properties are affected by different of amount resin solid contents used. The OPT veneer were treated at either 40 %, 32 %, 23 % or 15 % of resin concentration and 12 mm thickness of 3 -ply plywood panel were manufactured for each group. In this study the formaldehyde emission, modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and bonding quality (shear strength) of OPT plywood were determined. The results revealed that the resin-treatment method was tend to significantly improved the mechanical properties of the OPT plywood panel in which increased solid absorption gives better mechanical properties. Apparently, high mechanical properties were obtained for panel manufacturer from veneer treated with 32 % and 40 % resin content. The <b>resin-treated</b> OPT plywood provided superior mechanical strength with improvements at least 202 % MOE and 159 % MOR compared to commercial OPT plywood. Whereas, mechanical properties of the <b>resin-treated</b> OPT plywood were drastically decrease with increasing the water substitution.

40|$|The uniformly high {{potency of}} citrated plasma as {{compared}} with the limited capacity of serum to inactivate endotoxin in vitro was found to be a consequence of the anticoagulant employed in collecting the plasma. Addition of calcium to plasma suppressed the activity of its endotoxm detoxifying component (EDC) whereas the addition of calcium-binding anticoagulants rendered serum comparable to plasma. Dialysis of plasma resulted in a marked reduction of its EDC activity despite the concommittant elimination of calcium. EDC activity could then be fully restored upon the addition of calcium-binding anticoagulants. <b>Resin-treated</b> plasma, without added anticoagulant, had EDC activity equal to plasma obtained with calcium-binding anticoagulants. Following dialysis, <b>resin-treated</b> plasma also sustained a marked reduction in EDC activity which could be fully restored by calcium-binding anticoagulants. Restoration was also obtained with the dialysate even after ashing. These findings indicated that the suppression of EDC activity by calcium is not direct but is mediated through its effects on an anionic component of plasma which is required for inactivation of endotoxin by EDC...|$|E

30|$|Densification {{makes it}} {{possible}} for low-density woods to substitute for harder high-density species, so that the low-density wood species can be modified into high-performance and high-value products and gain commercial interest [9]. Several low-density wood species, such as spruce [10], radiata pine [11], oil palm [12], and poplar [13], have been extensively studied to be used as raw materials for producing compressed wood with a suitable manufacturing process, and the industrialization potentials of compressed wood made from these species are promising. However, the dimensional stability of the compressed poplar wood is still a challenging task, which limits its industrial application, specifically as an outdoor material. Compreg is a <b>resin-treated</b> compressed wood which is produced by treating solid wood or veneer with water-soluble phenol formaldehyde resin and compressing to the desired density and thickness [14]. The phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin impregnation at considerably high pressure is one of the cost-effective ways to improve the dimensional stability of poplar compregs and enhance resistance to biological attack by reducing hygroscopicity [15, 16].|$|E

40|$|Abstract ― It is {{commonly}} known that water repellency {{of the fabric}} treated with fluorocarbon resin brings about a decrease by the washing and recovers by the subsequent heat treatment. In this article, effect of the water repellency was investigated on the nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics treated with hydrocarbon and silicon resins. Hydrocarbon and silicon resins {{have been widely used}} in the textile finishing as the softening and water proofing agents. The fabrics were treated with hydrocarbon resins, Paragium JQ and RC (Ohara Paragium Chemical Co.) and a silicon resin, Poron MR (Shinetsu Chemical Co.), and then washed and subsequently heat treated. Although the water repellency increased by the resin treatment, it decreased by the washing apparently and recovered a little by the heat treatment. The effect of the heat treatment was small comparing with that of the fluorocarbon resin. Furthermore, as a mechanical property of the treated fabric, KES shearing and bending hysteresis parameters, modulus and hysteresis width of the hydrocarbon <b>resin-treated</b> nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics decreased by the heat treatment after washing. Therefore, the treatment is effective at improving the softening of the fabric in water repellent finish...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the course}} of our studies, we have learned that solid wood has {{significant}} deformability characteristics under specific conditions, resulting from slippage occurring among wood cells when wood treated with small-molecular resins is compressed under heat. Furthermore, the deformed shapes obtained are maintained when the resin introduced into the wood cells is cured. In this study, the lateral extrusion of thin discs of wood treated with thermosetting phenol resin is performed to apply this flowlike deformation behavior of wood to wood-forming techniques. <b>Resin-treated</b> thin discs of wood placed in a heating container were compressed by a punch, and under constant pressure the wood flowed into the cavity of a mold. Successful molding conditions were achieved by varying the pressure, temperature and wood fiber direction for the extrusion ratio of 42. The mechanical properties of the wood plastic composite (WPC) sheets obtained by this extrusion process are affected by the fiber direction of the wood in the extrudate, which is almost equivalent to the longitudinal direction of the cellulose crystals of wood. The maximum bending strength of the WPC sheets obtained was about 180 MPa, which is suitable for engineering plastics...|$|E
40|$|Methods were {{developed}} for detecting and concentrating enteric viruses in {{municipal solid waste}} landfill leachates. Poliovirus added to a leachate was not readily detectable, possibly because the virus was adsorbed to the leachate particulates. The masking effects associated with suspended solids in the leachate were overcome by adding a final 0. 1 M sodium (tetra) ethylenediaminetetraacetate concentration to the leachate. A sodium (tetra) ethylenediaminetetraacetate-treated leachate could be clarified by filtration at pH 8. 0 without a loss of virus. The clarified and sodium (tetra) ethylenediaminetetraacetate-treated leachate contained interfering materials of an anionic nature which prevented virus adsorption to epoxy-fiber glass filters. This interfering effect was overcome by treating the leachate with an anion-exchange resin. Viruses in the <b>resin-treated</b> leachate were concentrated by adjusting the leachate to pH 3. 5, adding AlCl 3 to a final 0. 005 M concentration, adsorbing the viruses to an epoxy-fiber glass virus adsorbent, and eluting the adsorbed viruses in a small volume.

30|$|The {{deformation}} {{behavior of}} {{low molecular weight}} phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin-impregnated wood under compression in the radial direction was investigated for obtaining high-strength wood at low pressing pressures. Flat-sawn grain Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) blocks with a density of 0.34 [*]g/cm 3 were treated with aqueous solution of 20 % low molecular weight PF resin resulting in weight gain of 60.8 %. Oven-dried specimens were compressed using hot plates fixed to a testing machine. The temperature was 150 °C and the pressing speed was 5 [*]mm/min. The impregnation of PF resin caused significant softening of the cell walls resulting in collapse at low pressures. The cell wall collapse was strain-dependent and occurred at a strain of 0.05 – 0.06 [*]mm/mm {{regardless of whether the}} wood was treated with PF resin. Thus, pressure holding causing creep deformation of the cell walls was also effective in initiating cell wall collapse at low pressure. Utilizing a combination of low molecular weight PF resin impregnation and pressure holding at 2 [*]MPa resulted in a density increase of PF <b>resin-treated</b> wood from 0.45 to 1.1 [*]g/cm 3. At the same time, the Young’s modulus and bending strength increased from 10 [*]GPa to 22 [*]GPa and 80 [*]MPa to 250 [*]MPa, respectively. It can be concluded that effective utilization of the collapse region of the cell wall is a desirable method for obtaining high-strength PF resin-impregnated wood at low pressing pressures.|$|E

We {{previously}} encapsulated hepatocytes in ultrathin shell microcapsules {{and showed them}} to have enhanced differentiated functions over cells cultured in monolayer. Here we have used these microencapsulated hepatocytes in a bioartificial liver-assisted device (BLAD) with a rat hepatectomy model. Primary rat hepatocytes were encapsulated in 150 - to 200 -μm microcapsules, using an electrostatic droplet generator. The microencapsulated hepatocytes exhibited good in vitro urea synthesis activity in plasma from rats with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). The ex vivo hemoperfusion was conducted in FHF rats by perfusing plasma {{at a rate of}} 1 - 2 mL/min through 1. 5 - 2 × 108 encapsulated hepatocytes packed into a packed-bed bioreactor. Hemoperfusion with the bioreactor was initiated 5 h after operative induction of liver failure and continued for 7 h. The BLAD-treated rats showed improvements over the control groups in survival time and metabolic indicators, including ammonia and total bilirubin levels. Furthermore, expanded bed adsorption (EBA) detoxification technology using Streamline-SP resin was explored to complement the bioreactor with microencapsulated hepatocytes. In vitro experiments indicated that serum ammonia could be specifically removed in dose-dependent manner, whereas the total serum proteins were unaffected by the resin.
