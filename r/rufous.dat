5|$|A. r. fusca, {{described}} by Edward William Nelson in 1897, {{is found in}} western Mexico from southern Nayarit to southwestern Jalisco, northern Colima, and Michoacan. It is darker and more <b>rufous</b> on its upperparts than A. r. australis. It also possesses a darker <b>rufous</b> crown which does not show a gray stripe down the middle.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is <b>rufous,</b> and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or <b>rufous</b> streak extending from each eye and a thick black malar streak.|$|E
5|$|Within its genus, the Iago sparrow {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 Check-list of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland <b>rufous</b> sparrows as the single species Passer motitensis. This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, and separation from the other <b>rufous</b> sparrows by about , are sufficient grounds for species status. Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested it may be a close relative of the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow and not the <b>rufous</b> sparrows.|$|E
5|$|A. n. melaschistos was {{described}} by Allan Octavian Hume in 1869. It breeds in mountains from Afghanistan through the Himalayas and southern Tibet to western China, and winters in the plains of South Asia. Larger and longer tailed than nisosimilis, it has dark slate-coloured upperparts, and more distinct <b>rufous</b> barring on the underparts.|$|E
5|$|A. r. boucardi was {{described}} by Philip Sclater in 1867, and it is found in eastern Mexico from southern Coahuila to San Luis Potosí, northern Puebla, and southern Oaxaca. This subspecies is darker than A. r. eremoeca and has dull brown, not <b>rufous,</b> streaking on the chest.|$|E
5|$|A. r. scottii, {{described}} by George Sennett in 1888, is found from northern Arizona to New Mexico south to northeastern Sonora and northwestern Coahuila. It {{appears to be}} a darker gray than A. r. eremoeca and has narrower and darker <b>rufous</b> streaks on its breast.|$|E
5|$|A. r. simulans was {{described}} by van Rossem in 1934, and it is found in northwestern Mexico from southeastern Sonora and southwestern Chihuahua to Nayarit and northern Jalisco. It has more <b>rufous</b> coloration on its back and is paler on its underbelly than A. r. scottii.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are {{generally}} small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and <b>rufous</b> plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches {{on their backs}} or shoulders. Most have heavy bills, which in many species are hooked at the tip.|$|E
5|$|Similar in appearance, all treecreepers {{are small}} birds with {{streaked}} and spotted brown upperparts, <b>rufous</b> rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long rigid tail feathers that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.|$|E
5|$|The puffbirds {{are related}} to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the {{iridescent}} colors of that family. They are mainly brown, <b>rufous,</b> or gray, with large heads and flattened bills with hooked tips. The loose abundant plumage and short tails makes them look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English common name of the family.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, {{although}} the male averages {{slightly larger than}} the female and has two prominent spurs on the legs, whereas the female is virtually unspurred. The female also has more <b>rufous</b> in its tail. The juvenile resembles the adults, but is duller, with buff barring, rather than streaking, on the underparts.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus madens, {{described}} by Ripley and Watson in 1963, {{is unusual in}} having some sexual dichromatism. If the Barbary falcon (see below) is considered a distinct species, it is sometimes placed therein. It {{is found in the}} Cape Verde Islands, and is non-migratory; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving. Males have a <b>rufous</b> wash on crown, nape, ears, and back; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown. Females are tinged rich brown overall, especially on the crown and nape.|$|E
5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler <b>rufous</b> rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{the female}} purple-throated cotinga {{is a dark}} brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts. The underparts are a buffy {{cinnamon}} with black barring. The throat is a deeper, unbarred <b>rufous</b> in coloration. The female's tail feathers are longer and more pointed at the tip {{than those of the}} male. The juvenile purple-throated cotinga resembles a paler, buffier female; the plumage of the immature is undescribed.|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the <b>rufous</b> fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and <b>rufous</b> fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
5|$|M. l. dulcis, {{commonly}} known as lavender-flanked fairywren, is found in Arnhem Land. It was described in 1908 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews, though this and subspecies rogersi were long considered forms of the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) until integrades were noted over a wide area of northern Australia with subspecies assimilis. Like subspecies rogersi, females are predominantly blue-grey rather than grey-brown and have white lores and eye rings rather than the <b>rufous</b> coloration of the other subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Other {{means are}} also used to garner prey. Some species such as the red-naped sapsucker sally into the air to catch flying insects, and many species probe into crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The <b>rufous</b> {{woodpecker}} specialises in attacking the nests of arboreal ants and the buff-spotted woodpecker feeds on and nests in termite mounds. Other species such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker feed wholly or partly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Several {{birds and}} other predatory organisms prey on the black-headed sugar ant. Birds {{such as the}} black-faced woodswallow, <b>rufous</b> treecreeper, noisy miner, jacky winter and {{southern}} scrub robin prey on this species, {{as indicated by the}} fact that workers body parts have been found in the birds' stomach contents. Other predators of the black-headed sugar ant include the rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was once}} thought to be most closely related to the <b>rufous</b> sparrows, a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar {{habitats}} on continental Africa. Though the Iago sparrow is closest to the <b>rufous</b> sparrows in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It may in fact be more closely related to the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago sparrow occurs in most habitats on available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago sparrow is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of antbirds is {{soft and}} not brightly coloured, {{although}} it is occasionally striking. The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, <b>rufous,</b> chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism – differences in plumage colour and pattern {{between males and females}} – is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, <b>rufous</b> and brown colours. For example, the male dot-winged antwren is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts. In some genera, such as Myrmotherula, species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male. Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in bluish-slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white patch is on the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin is {{generally}} encountered {{alone or in}} pairs, although groups of up to eight birds—a mated pair and their young—may be seen in autumn and winter. The species may join mixed-species flocks with other small insectivorous passerines; species recorded include the willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), <b>rufous</b> whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris) and black-faced woodswallow (Artamus cinereus) in Queensland, and the chestnut-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza uropygialis), buff-rumped thornbill (A.reguloides) or inland thornbill (A.apicalis) in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct <b>rufous</b> collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
5|$|There are {{at least}} 508 bird species. Most of Karnataka's five hundred species of birds are from the Western Ghats region. There {{are at least}} 16 species of birds endemic to the Western Ghats {{including}} the endangered rufous-breasted laughingthrush, the vulnerable Nilgiri wood-pigeon, white-bellied shortwing and broad-tailed grassbird, the near threatened grey-breasted laughingthrush, black-and-rufous flycatcher, Nilgiri flycatcher, and Nilgiri pipit, and the least concern Malabar (blue-winged) parakeet, Malabar grey hornbill, white-bellied treepie, grey-headed bulbul, <b>rufous</b> babbler, Wynaad laughingthrush, white-bellied blue-flycatcher and the crimson-backed sunbird.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included {{among the more than}} 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include <b>rufous</b> hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the <b>rufous</b> rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E
5|$|Glover's pika (Ochotona gloveri) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Ochotonidae. It was first {{described}} in 1922, by Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas. The summer dorsal pelage is grayish <b>rufous,</b> grayish brown, or tea brown in colour. The winter pelage {{is similar to the}} summer pelage, but is lighter in tone. Endemic to China, it is found in high altitudes of northeastern Tibet, southwestern Qinghai, western Sichuan, and northwestern Yunnan. It is a generalist herbivore, and is known to construct haypiles. It is rated as {{a species of}}least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature. It is also regionally red listed as least concern in China.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are compact {{birds with}} short legs, {{compressed}} wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, <b>rufous</b> or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, {{a long black}} eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, especially on the rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} {{surrounding}} areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange. Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon {{at the sides}} of the breast. The rear flanks and undertail-covert feathers are <b>rufous.</b> In worn plumage, the color may be uneven in the lower parts and lighter in hue. The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. The iris and legs are dark brown. Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the {{sympatric}} song thrush. In the western Himalayas {{it could be}} confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These {{are similar to the}} mistle thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more <b>rufous</b> above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White's thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.|$|E
5|$|The snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni) {{also known}} as the Celebes rail or Platen's rail is a large flightless rail, {{the only member of the}} genus Aramidopsis. It is an Indonesian endemic found in dense {{vegetation}} in wet areas of Sulawesi and nearby Buton. The rail has grey underparts, a white chin, brown wings and a <b>rufous</b> patch on the hindneck. The sexes are similar, but the female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and iris. The typical call is the snoring ee-orrrr sound that gives the bird its English name.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the <b>rufous</b> fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other <b>rufous</b> sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|Moroccan {{collections}} {{under the}} cork oak (Quercus suber) that were initially regarded as B.aereus {{were described as}} a separate species—Boletus mamorensis—in 1978, {{on the basis of}} a <b>rufous</b> chestnut cap and a rooting stipe, or stem, with a reticulation often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 however, molecular phylogenetic studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to B.aereus, likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist Harry Thiers reported Boletus aereus from California in 1975; however, a taxonomic revision of western North American porcini boletes in 2008 formally established them as a separate species, Boletus regineus. These differ from B.aereus by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (pileipellis), and belong in a different porcini lineage.|$|E
5|$|P. canariensis, the Canary Islands {{chiffchaff}} is a non-migratory species formerly occurring on {{the major}} Canary Islands, which is differentiated from P. collybita by morphology, vocalisations and genetic characteristics, and, of course, is not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs. The nominate western subspecies P. c. canariensis of El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria is smaller than common chiffchaff, and has shorter, rounder wings. It is olive-brown above and has a buff breast and flanks; it has a rich deep chip-cheep-cheep-chip-chip-cheep song, and a call similar to the nominate race. The eastern P. c. exsul of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less <b>rufous</b> below than its western relative, and had a harsher call; {{it might have been}} a distinct species, but it became extinct in 1986 at latest, probably much earlier. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, but it appears always to have been scarce and localised, occurring only in the Haria Valley of Lanzarote.|$|E
5|$|Several birds prey on meat ants. The masked woodswallow (A. personatus) and the white-browed woodswallow (Artamus superciliosus) {{will gather}} around meat ant nests and swoop at them, {{catching}} several ants before eating them. Pieces of meat ants {{have been found}} in the faeces of the red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii), <b>rufous</b> whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris), hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata) and the red-browed treecreeper (Climacteris erythrops). Meat ants that forage on Ventilago viminalis trees are often eaten by the apostlebird. Some large ground-feeding birds, such as currawongs, magpies and ravens dig out newly established colonies after a queen has found a suitable spot to nest. Small domes of excavated soil are present at such spots, revealing the queens' presence to these birds. As a result, many queens are consumed by birds, leaving many abandoned nest chambers.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male has a {{short and}} narrow black bib {{and a broad}} chestnut eye stripe that {{does not meet the}} mantle. The male has a grey crown and nape and a <b>rufous</b> lower back and rump. The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female house sparrow and the shoulder is darker chestnut. The female Dead Sea sparrow of the subspecies Passer moabiticus yattii is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head. The bill is black on the breeding male and pale brown on the non-breeding male and female. With a culmen length of , the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the house sparrow.|$|E
