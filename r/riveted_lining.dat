50|$|Though cutaway drawing are not {{dimensioned}} manufacturing blueprints, they are meticulously drawn {{by a handful}} of devoted artists who either had access to manufacturing details or deduced them by observing the visible evidence of the hidden skeleton (e.g. <b>rivet</b> <b>lines,</b> etc.). The goal of this drawings in studies can be to identify common design patterns for particular vehicle classes. Thus, the accuracy of most of these drawings, while not 100 percent, is certainly high enough for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The final {{batch of}} the class were later fitted with newly {{developed}} 'Coal Scuttle' bunkers. These bunkers consisted of a higher <b>rivet</b> <b>line</b> increasing the water capacity up {{to a total of}} 2,700 gallons allowing the locos to travel longer distances. The bunker was also designed to facilitate the movement of the coal towards the hatch in the cab, however ‘scuttle bunkers’ would only carry 5 tonnes of coal instead of 6. No.7200 is the only surviving loco {{of the class}} to carry one of these unique bunkers.|$|R
40|$|As {{and when}} {{aircraft}} aged, fatigue problems appeared {{and the necessity}} for detecting cracks in the lap joint parts became obvious. Numerous systems were then developed to follow up cracks appearance and growth in rivet holes. If most of the inspection used to be manual, it is now partially automated since AEROSPATIALE developed the System of Inspection Assisted by Microprocessor (SIAM) in which an EC probe slides on the <b>rivet</b> <b>lines</b> [1]. At present, our research {{is focused on the}} diagnosis, last phase of the inspection. In order to process the inspection data, to speed up the control, and to improve the detection performances, a neural network has been developed...|$|R
40|$|Guided waves using piezo-electric wafer active sensors (PWAS) {{is one of}} {{the useful}} {{techniques}} of damage detection. Sensor network optimization with minimal network hardware footprint and maximal area of coverage remains a challenging problem. PWAS sensors are placed at discrete locations in order to inspect damages in plates and the idea {{has the potential to be}} extended to assembled structures. Various actuator-sensor configurations are possible within the network in order to identify and locate damages. In this paper we present a correlation based approach to monitor cracks emanating from <b>rivet</b> <b>line</b> using a simulated guided wave signal whose sensor is operating in pulse echo mode. Discussions regarding the identification of phase change due to reflections from the crack are also discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|International audienceScanning laser {{systems are}} {{a class of}} {{ultrasonic}} guided wave systems that have shown great promise for the inspection of complex structures {{because of the high}} spatial resolution of their resulting data. In this study, the focus is on applying full-field signal processing techniques to automatically detect and characterize fastener damage in aircraft components with realistic structural complexity. The particular testbed being considered is a composite tail section with several <b>rivet</b> <b>lines.</b> Artificial damage was introduced into several of the rivets with different magnitudes and orientations. While trained users of the laser scanning system can often detect the damage modes by simply viewing the resulting images, a more automated and quantifiable approach is desired to increase the consistency and quantify the confidence of the inspection system. In order to characterize the state of each rivet, a polar wavenumber processing technique is proposed. First, the full-field data is transformed to a new polar coordinate system centered on a particular rivet. A 3 D Fourier transform then transforms the data to the frequency-wavenumber domain. Finally, the data is windowed to isolate the waves propagating in the positive radial direction. Analyzing the scattering pattern from each rivet in turn provides information on the health of each rivet. Damage detection may be accomplished either by comparison of the extracted scattering pattern with a model of the expected scattering pattern, or by an absolute reference-free method comparing rivets to one another to identify outliers. The results show that there is the potential to provide quantified damage detection and characterization for fastener damage using laser-excitation guided wave inspection systems...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a structural health monitoring {{system based on}} propagation of tuned Lamb waves and their interference with discontinuities. The dispersion curves are studied to determine the appropriate type and dimension of transducers and to select the optimum scanning frequencies and relevant propagation modes. A piezoelectric sensor network was implemented in an aluminum plate in order to generate and to sense the wave propagation and associated reflections. The algorithm developed for damage detection relies on the comparison of undamaged and damaged responses of the structure. Combinations of filters and statistical methods were applied to detect differences in the sensor signals acquired for the two different states (damaged and undamaged), corresponding to damage reflections. In order to eliminate the false positives due to noise, a probability analysis is performed to obtain the final damage position. The software designed for the current application allows the automatic calculation of dispersion curves, it executes the scans, performs data processing, executes the detection algorithm and presents the probable damages and their positions in a graphical form. Experiments were performed {{with the introduction of}} cumulative damages in the plate such as surface and through-the-thickness holes and cuts, ranging from 7 mm to 1 mm in diameter. Additionally, a stringer was attached to the plate by a single <b>rivet</b> <b>line</b> to simulate an aircraft skin structure. Cuts originating from rivet holes and connecting adjacent rivets, as well as loosened rivets were detected by the system. The introduction of the stringer resulted in a loss of precision in the determination of the radial position of the damages near it. Also, the network revealed significant difficulties in the detection of damages beyond the stringer...|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} the toys was variable, {{although}} the moulds were generally of better quality than required for a small diecast toy. Most models featured raised <b>rivets</b> or moulded-in <b>lines</b> and relatively robust 'dumbbell-type' metal wheels. Unfortunately, the rotors and clear parts of earlier helicopters (especially the Bell 47) were made from very brittle plastic that broke easily during play. Zee took action to fix this with later releases (e.g. the Kaman Seasprite) by changing the rotors to flexible vinyl.|$|R
50|$|In 1946 and 1947 Continental Steel {{sold off}} its Canton, Ohio and Indianapolis sheet mill facilities, having {{decided to focus}} on the {{manufacture}} of finished products at Kokomo. The 1950s witnessed considerable expansion: a new continuous rod mill started operations in 1953, in 1955 a welded fabric department was housed in a new facility; the mail mill was modernized and a new nail warehouse was built in 1957; 1959 saw the production of a new item, high carbon wire. By 1963 Continental Steel's open hearth capacity had grown to 420,000 net tons through the enlargement of existing furnaces. The prospering company was producing a wide range of products including fences, gates, posts, welded wire fabric, nails, a variety of wires, clothes <b>lines</b> <b>rivets,</b> and copper steel (Konik) sheets.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we generalise POWHEG next-to-leading order parton shower (NLOPS) {{simulations}} of vector boson production and vector boson production in association with a single jet, to give matrix element corrected MENLOPS simulations. In so doing we extend and provide, for the first time, an exact and faithful implementation of the MENLOPS formalism in hadronic collisions. We also consider merging the resulting event samples according to a phase space partition {{defined in terms of}} an effective jet clustering scale. The merging scale is restricted such that the component generated by the associated production simulation does not impact on the NLO accuracy of inclusive vector boson production observables. The dependence of the predictions on the unphysical merging scale is demonstrated. Comparisons with Tevatron and LHC data are presented. Comment: 41 pages, 19 figures.

5000|$|... "Nadine Sabra Meyer's Anatomy Theater is a {{powerful}} and harrowing book. In it the human figure is reduced to its primary elements--musculature, organs, bone--yet remains palable and present. The transcendent is completely exorcised, 'as thoughts decompose under anesthesia / then cease to exist.' This is a poetry {{without a trace of}} sentimentality or specious celebration, yet it remains grimly affirmative as it 'distills / from the stench of flesh, pure thought.' The language is <b>riveting,</b> and the <b>lines</b> have a sinuous complexity that is hypnotic. Meyer's unit of composition is the sentence, that is to say the thought, and she writes at a high level of tension. As the book unfolds the focus expands from the biological to the aesthetic, the personal and the historical, groping towards the possibility of escaping 'the body's domesticity for a sky both lightning struck and mute,' and of the transformation of anatomy into history. The Anatomy Theater is a stunning debut."- John Koethe ...|$|R
50|$|Brake {{shoes are}} {{typically}} made of {{two pieces of}} steel welded together. The friction material is either <b>riveted</b> to the <b>lining</b> table or attached with adhesive. The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking brake linkage and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the wheel cylinder is applied through the web to the lining table and brake lining. The edge of the lining table generally has three “V"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The primary shoe is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe. Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist heat fade, binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce brake noise.|$|R
40|$|In {{order that}} the results of these tests might be of the most {{practical}} value, the test specimens were made at the Douglas Company with the same material and methods used in present metal construction. The material used was 24 srt sheet with l 7 st rivets except in a few specimens that will be mentioned later. The first two test series were designed to determine the optimum edge distance and pitch in terms of the rivet diameter for a single riveted lap joint. The third test series was used to determine the ultimate bearing strength of 24 srt sheet for various sheet thickness. Tests were made for both lap and butt joints. The lap joint was tested for the following type rivets. 1. Round head rivets. 2. Countersunk rivets. 3. 3 's rivets with welded heads. Tests were also made showing the variation of bearing strength of the sheet in a lap joint {{with the head of the}} rivet. Test series No. 4 was devoted to the shear of rivets. An attempt was made to classify the following riveting methods by the shearing value of the driver rivet. 1. Hand Riveting. 2. Vibrators (Air Hammer). 3. Pneumatic Squeezers. 4. Spinners. 5. One shot Gun. 6. Automatic Riveter (Eccentric Press) These tests were made using a lap joint and covered the range of rivets from 3 / 32 " to 1 / 4 " in diameter. Shearing tests were also made using countersunk rivets and 3 s rivets with welded heads. Various diameter of 17 st rivets were tested in double shear and a test was made showing the variation of shearing value versus sheet thickness for both single and double shear. Also the effect of friction upon the ultimate shearing value of rivets was determined. Test series No. 5 was used to determine the shearing value of malleability of 17 st rivets for various times of ageing. Test series No. 6 gives the ultimate tensile strength of 24 srt sheet for various thickness of sheet from. 020 to. 128 ". Test series No. 7 [...] Because of some question as to the load taken by rivets when placed in line a series of specimens were made up with the number of <b>rivets</b> in a <b>line</b> varying from 1 to 12.
