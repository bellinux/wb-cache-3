In ravine six areas have been compared with six dumps with active primary succession (dump Radvesická, Obránců míru, Velebudická and Vršanská). All of these are situated to Severočeská hnědouhelná pánev. Acuelata insect is from three salvages (may, june, july). I have used technique traps of Moerick. Overall 176 kinds of Acuelta hymenoptera insect have been found out in both locations. They have classified according to taxanomic inclusion. There are three menials (apoidea, vespoidea, chrysidoidea). Some detected kinds of insect have been significant types which have been determined by Red List. Altogether 45 kinds of insect have been registred in both locations. 8 types have been registred in Střezovská Rokle and 37 kinds at dumps. They are compartmentalized to few categories by vulnerability. The biggest prevailing menial is Crabronidae. It reaches the biggest abundance in Střezovská Rokle (6 kinds) and in dumps as well.

40|$|Landscape {{architectural}} writers {{consider that}} there has been a ‘recovery’ of landscape design since the early 1990 ’s. This research found that ‘open-systems’ thinking has been centrally influential in this recovery and started to have a determining impact on landscape design by the end of the 1990 ’s, influenced by a series of explicitly open-systems-oriented writings. These writings contributed to the rise of ‘landscape urbanism’, now considered the dominant design approach and generally assumed to be the leading edge of the ‘recovery’. This tradition tended not to be interested in past landscape design practices, often positioning themselves against such practices. It originated from academia, promoted ambitious practice and made claims for landscape urbanism’s abilities to positively impact on the built environment. Results of initial fieldwork into how real landscapes function carried out by this researcher agree with these writings that open systems thinking is the best way to understand how landscapes function. However, this fieldwork led to a significantly different conception of how landscape function than found in the dominant conceptions. Gilles Deleuze’s open-systems notion of ‘affect’ has been found to best explain and most affirm this work. So, this research then undertook a theoretical examination of Deleuze’s notion of ‘affect’, how to understand it (‘expression’), and the process of its production (‘assemblage’). This study then informed further fieldwork. The results of these two studies were then used to examine a series of late 1990 ’s writings that I term the ‘empirical research’ tradition: produced by European landscape architects who, from a practice perspective, wanted to affirm how existing landscape design practice functioned. They were obsessed with the determining role of the pre-existing landscape in the design process and the ‘intuitive’ processes of the designer, and were not explicitly interested in open-systems. Their devotion to precisely understand the processes of practice, I would argue, led certain of these to develop conceptions that aligned strongly with Deleuzian open systems notions, and included a conception of practice which did not rely upon preconceptions or outside abstract notions to evaluate how a project proceeds – making their writings the first ‘immanent’ (Deleuze) conception of landscape design. All of these studies were then used to examine the conception of design process found in the explicitly open-systems-oriented design writings of the 2000 ’s, strongly associated with landscape urbanism, to understand and account for the negative tendencies these writings promoted: which including uncritical translations of architectural practices to landscape design and questionable theoretical conceptions of open-systems. These conceptions were also found to promote a series of dominating design preoccupations that deferred attention away from what the human landscape does and from the role of the pre-existing and how to engage with it. They also promoted deferral away from the development of landscape-specific critical tools and, hence, strongly tended to rely on preconceived and abstract notions and very ‘traditional’ visual means of evaluation. The findings of these studies were brought together to construct, for the first time an affirmative (immanent) open-systems landscape design assemblage aimed at redirecting the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>landscape...</b>|$|E

That recovery served as a corrective to modernism 2 ̆ 7 s construction <b>of</b> <b>landscape</b> as either abstract utopian space or retrogressive historical tableau. The primary catalyst for this renewed interest in landscape as a representation of human cultures and their complex relationship with the natural world was the essayist and critic John Brinckerhoff Jackson (1909 - 1996) and his magazine Landscape. During the years of Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s editorship (1951 - 1968), the magazine became a locus for intellectual exchange, a gathering place for a community of scholars from different disciplines who were drawn to Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s unique voice. Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s essays in the magazine used the term landscape {{in a way that was}} not common outside of the field of human geography. Here landscape did not describe a picturesque or painterly scene, nor did it describe a process of beautification. Jackson wrote <b>of</b> <b>landscapes</b> that seemed somewhat prosaic: the everyday, ordinary environments of city streets, rural farms, individual dwellings, highways and the commercial strip. He insisted that understanding how to read these places for their social, cultural and ecological content was a necessary [...] though too rarely employed [...] prelude to imagining new prototypes for the design and management of human environments. The mid-century intellectual milieu fostered by J. B.

40|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} (herps) are {{the most}} abundant and diverse vertebrate taxa in tropical ecosystems. Nevertheless, {{little is known about}} their role in maintaining and regulating ecosystems functions and, by extension, their potential value for supporting ecosystems services. Here, we review research on the ecological functions of Neotropical herps, in different sources (the bibliographic databases, book chapters, etc.). A total of 167 Neotropical herpetology studies published over the last four decades (1970 to 2014) were reviewed, providing information on more than 100 species that contribute to at least five categories of ecological functions: i) nutrient cycling; ii) bioturbation; iii) pollination; iv) seed dispersal, and v) energy flow through ecosystems and the mechanisms behind these, through the study of functional traits and analysis of ecological processes. Many of these functions provide key ecosystems, such as biological pest control, seed dispersal and water quality. By knowing and understanding the functions that perform the herps in ecosystems, management plans for cultural landscapes, restoration or <b>recovery</b> projects <b>of</b> <b>landscapes</b> that involve aquatic and terrestrial systems, development of comprehensive plans and detailed conservation of species and ecosystems may be structured in a more appropriate way.

40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{recorded}} glacier outburst floods (jökulhlaups) occurred in 1918, generated by the last major subglacial eruption of Katla volcano in southern Iceland. Using digitized historical topographic surveys and field observations from the main proglacial outwash plain (Mýrdalssandur), we document the reaction of Mýrdalssandur to the 1918 event and subsequent response and recovery. Our analysis highlights the longevity of elevated topography, over the recovery period, and the complete reorganization of the main perennial meltwater channel system, both of which will affect and condition the flow routing and impact of future jökulhlaups. The jökulhlaup deposited approximately 2 km 3 of sediment onto Mýrdalssandur immediately after the event and extended the coastline by several kilometers. However, 80 % of this material by volume has since been removed by surface and subsurface water flow on the main sandur and by marine reworking at the coast. By 2007, the surface elevation at specific locations on the outwash plain and {{the position of the}} coastline were similar to those in 1904, indicating near-complete <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>landscape.</b> Despite this, the Mýrdalssandur coastline has experienced net advance over the past 1000 years.

However, forest disturbance rates may not be stationary, i. e., may not fluctuate within a constant range of variability, due to climate change, population growth and changing land-use and resource demands, and this has consequences for forest and atmospheric carbon balance, climate feedbacks, and policies aiming to achieve particular atmospheric CO 2 concentration targets.

40|$|Landscape {{represents}} the &ldquo;sensory aspect&rdquo; {{of the land}} and as such it can be appreciated by all the five senses: sight, smelling, hearing, touch and taste. At the same time, landscape evolves over time and its value &ndash; ecological, economical and affective &ndash; changes as its constitutive elements change. Engineering can help &ldquo;to drive&rdquo; this evolution addressing it towards a condition of balance between individual and community requirements, especially referred to the effect of technological development on landscape. This effect can be referred to three dimensions: perceptive, functional and symbolic dimensions. The possible contribution to the management <b>of</b> <b>landscape</b> changes concerns all the three historic souls of Agricultural Engineering; in particular, Agricultural Hydraulics deals with the topic <b>of</b> <b>landscape</b> referring to both irrigation and the possible recreational use of canal systems; Agricultural Engineering determines plot form and size and woodland view; Rural Building deals with both the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> existing buildings and the design and making of new ones and their fitting in the landscape; moreover, the sector has developed new methods for the evaluation and the planning of rural land resources, especially about agriculture and forestry productivity, ecological stability and visual quality of rural land itself...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale peat {{extraction}} for fuel {{has probably been}} a feature <b>of</b> peat-dominated <b>landscapes</b> for many thousands of years. The cumulative scale and extent of this activity is often under-estimated, particularly in areas which are now remote parts <b>of</b> the <b>landscape.</b> A cut peat face acts as a one-sided drain and thus {{has a number of}} hydrological and morphological effects, including potentially the creation of weak zones within the peat which may trigger mass movement. This briefing note is part of a series aimed at policy makers, practitioners and academics to help explain the ecological processes that underpin peatland function. Understanding the ecology of peatlands is essential when investigating the impacts of human activity on peatlands, interpreting research findings and planning the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> damaged peatlands...|$|R
