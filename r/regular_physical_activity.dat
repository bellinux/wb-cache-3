Researchers studied the physical activity of 133 children over a three-week period using an accelerometer to measure each child's level of physical activity.

Korean court records going back to 1392 indicate that the average lifespan of eunuchs was 70.0 ± 1.76 years, which was 14.4–19.1 years longer than the lifespan of non-castrated men of similar socio-economic status.|$|E

Therefore, the goal of the present investigation was to study the effect of one –month <b>regular</b> moderate <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> on neurokinin B gene expression and reproductive axis hormonal changes. Materials and Methods: In the experimental study, fourteen adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control and one- month regular moderate exercise groups. After one - month <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> (20 m/min), the arcuate nucleus was isolated from brain and stored in - 80 refrigerators for neurokinin B gene expression assay by Real-time PCR method. In addition, serum samples were taken to assess the corticosterone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels by ELISA method. Data were analyzed by Independent t-test in SPSS. Results: Neurokinin-B gene expression level was lower in the group which received <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> than the control group(p< 0. 05). Also, corticosterone serum concentration was decreased in the <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> group(p< 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction. In {{the last}} two decades, an {{increase}} in obesity along {{with a number of}} co-morbidities has been recorded among children and adolescents. Objective. The aim was to investigate if there was a difference in nutritional status between adolescents who were active sportsmen {{and those who did not}} engage in sport <b>activities</b> other than <b>regular</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> at school and if active training could be an independent factor in the prevention of obesity. Methods. There were 117 male adolescents on average aged 15. 4 ± 1. 8 years. The subjects were divided into two groups; 32 active sportsmen engaged in regular training in football and a control group consisting of 85 adolescents engaged in no <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> except for that at school (two hours per week). In all subjects Body Mass Index (BMI) was determined. The percentage of the total body fat was estimated from the sum of values of skin fold thickness measured at four sites (according to Durnin and Womersley). Lean Body Mass (LBM) was estimated by deducting the triceps skin fold from the upper arm circumference and comparing it to the norms. All collected data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistical methods: χ 2 -test, t-test. Results. Adolescent sportsmen showed a statistically significantly lower BMI and percentage of total body fat than the adolescents in the control group (p< 0. 01). A significantly higher LBM was found in the sportsmen (p< 0. 01). Conclusion. Active participation in sports can be a contributing factor in the prevention of obesity, and it is therefore recommended to combine <b>regular</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> with an adequate diet. BMI screening of general population can indicate a high number of children and adolescents at risk for obesity or who are already obese...|$|R
