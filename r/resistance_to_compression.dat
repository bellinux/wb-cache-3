50|$|Hyaluronic acid is an {{important}} component of articular cartilage, where it is present as a coat around each cell (chondrocyte). When aggrecan monomers bind to hyaluronan in the presence of HAPLN1 (hyaluronanic acid and proteoglycan link protein 1), large, highly negatively charged aggregates form. These aggregates imbibe water and are responsible for the resilience of cartilage (its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression).</b> The molecular weight (size) of hyaluronan in cartilage decreases with age, but the amount increases.|$|E

It is usually found attached to proteins {{as part of a}} proteoglycan. A chondroitin chain can have over 100 individual sugars, each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities. Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage and provides much of its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression.</b> Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis.|$|E

The elastic strength of a polyhedron is determined by the cation occupying the central site. As the bond length of the cations and anions decreases the bond strength increases making the mineral more compact and dense. Substitution between ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+ would not have a great effect on the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression</b> while substitution of Si4+ would make it much harder to compress.

30|$|The {{buckling}} of thin cylinders under {{axial compression}} or external pressure {{has been studied}} for many years [1 – 20] and is now well-understood. Geometric imperfections {{play a major role}} in a shell’s <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> axial <b>compression</b> and, generally, a lesser role in its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> external pressure [21 – 37]. Fewer works can be found in the literature regarding the effect of plasticity on buckling [38 – 45]: plasticity plays an important role in the case of thicker cylinders and, coupled with initial imperfections, is often responsible for the significant decrease in the critical loads observed experimentally. This type of structure is also sensitive to the care with which the boundary conditions are applied [19, 46]. The effect of the model used for the boundary condition on the critical load is also well-known, but it is more difficult to determine, in each practical case, the exact boundary condition which should be chosen. The literature on the buckling strength under combined axial compression and external pressure is less extensive [47]. The objective of this work is to propose a metallic shell which can be manufactured easily and which, on the one hand, avoids the high sensitivity to imperfections of ordinary shells under axial compression while, on the other hand, having a much better <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> external pressure. This leads to an alternative to the shell defined in [48, 49] by optimizing a NURBS surface. NURBS shells have better <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> axial <b>compression,</b> but their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> external pressure has not been assessed. There is no theoretical study or experiment available for such shells when the material has the characteristic elastic-plastic behavior of metals.|$|R

A new algorithm of digital watermarking for still images which embeds digital watermark into a still image via modification of frequency coefficients for Hadamard discrete transformation is presented. The choice of frequency coefficients for embedding of a digital watermark {{is based on}} existence of sharp change of their values after modification at the maximum compression of JPEG. The choice of blocks of pixels for embedding {{is based on the}} value of their entropy. The new algorithm was subjected to the analysis of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> an image <b>compression,</b> noising, filtration, change of size, color and histogram equalization. Elham algorithm possessing a good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> JPEG <b>compression</b> was chosen for comparative analysis. Nine gray-scale images were selected as objects for protection. Obscurity of the distortions embedded in them was defined {{on the basis of the}} peak value of a signal to noise ratio which should be not lower than 43 dB for obscurity of the brought distortions. Resistibility of embedded watermark was determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient, which value should not be below 0. 5 for the minimum allowed stability. The algorithm of computing experiment comprises: watermark embedding into each test image by the new algorithm and Elham algorithm; introducing distortions to the object of protection; extracting of embedded information with its subsequent comparison with the original. Parameters of the algorithms were chosen so as to provide approximately the same level of distortions introduced into the images. Main Results. The method of preliminary processing of digital watermark presented in the paper makes it possible to reduce significantly the volume of information embedded in the still image. The results of numerical experiment have shown that the proposed algorithm keeps higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> JPEG <b>compression,</b> noising, Wiener filtering and brightness change. Practical Relevance. The proposed algorithm is applicable for copyright protection on the still images...|$|R
30|$|We {{found that}} vaults {{lead to a}} {{significant}} increase in the buckling strength under uniform external pressure and also improve the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> axial <b>compression.</b> This type of shell is relatively insensitive to initial imperfections. The choice of the number of vaults also plays a role. The effect becomes significant once the number of vaults equals twice the Fourier buckling mode of the smooth cylinder under external pressure. The question then arises of the optimal choice of the number and depth of the vaults with regard to buckling strength under combined loading. This is the subject of the next section.|$|R

50|$|The {{specifications}} for cables and housings rarely give any details other than dimensions {{and the purpose}} of the products. The specific <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression</b> or bending is never quoted, so there is much rhetorical evidence and comment as to the performance and durability of products, but little available science for the consumer's use. A particularly severe quality test for housings is at or near the hinge of a folding bicycle where a sharp bend is made repeatedly. The radius of curvature of cables on a folded bicycle can be as low as 1.5 inches, (4 cm); therefore it is advisable to shift to the gear with the lowest cable pressure before folding, to minimize any adverse effects on housings or derailleurs. This gear is usually the one with the highest index number on the gear shifter.|$|E
50|$|A {{description}} {{of the structure of}} reticulated foams is still being developed. While Plateau's laws, the rules governing the shape of soap films in foams were developed in the 19th century, a mathematical {{description of}} the structure is still debated. The computer-generated Weaire-Phelan structure is the most recent. In a reticulated foam only the edges of the polyhedra remain; the faces are missing. In commercial reticulated foam, up to 98% of the faces are removed. The dodecahedron is sometimes given as the basic unit for these foams, but the most representative shape is a polyhedron with 13 faces. Cell size and cell size distribution are critical parameters for most applications. Porosity is typically 95%, but can be as high as 98%. Reticulation affects many of the physical properties of a foam.

It is oriented towards Mecca, across the sea and has a range of 30 km. The minaret is said to enhance the visual alignment of the boulevard. It is square in shape thrusting skyward. The base to the top width ratio of 1 to 8 (between basement and the summit) has a marble covering on the exterior with austere decoration. The faces of the facade have carved ornamentation with different materials. There are stitches of roudani tracetine on a 100,000 MP surface. This decorative material (with chrome and green as dominant colours), is {{a substitute for the}} use of bricks, the material used in many other notable minarets, and has given the mosque an extraordinary elegance. Green tiles decorate the minaret for one third of the height from the top, and then changes colour to deep green or turquoise blue; it is said that in the Hassan II minaret, the designer had used his sea-foam green and God’s blue to celebrate the life of a king. The concrete used for the minaret was a special high-grade type, which could perform well under severe conditions of a combined action of strong wind and seismicity. This was achieved by the Science Department of the BouyguesGroup, the contractors for the project, who developed an extra-strength concrete four times stronger than ordinary concrete.

The study examined the characteristics of full bricks produced with mud cuttings from ornamental stone including, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> uniaxial <b>compression,</b> water absorption and apparent density of mud alone or when mixed with two types of clay at different firing temperatures. As temperature rose, the strength and density of the samples increased, while absorption decreased. The use of clay improved the sintering process during firing, giving a less porous and mechanically stronger material that normally used to produce full bricks for civil constructions. For the second type of product, aerated bricks, the study investigated porosity, density, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> uniaxial <b>compression</b> and the thermal insulation capacity of bricks made by adding lime and aluminium powder to trachyte mud at different sintering temperatures, ranging between 980 and 1040 °C. As temperature increased, it was observed that an increase in the resistance and density of the samples was accompanied by a reduction in the heat-insulating capacity. When compared with commercial aerated bricks, it was found that aerated bricks obtained from trachyte sludge cuttings and fired at temperatures below 1030 °C, have a greater thermal insulation capacity but a lower mechanical resistance, restricting their use to non-load-bearing masonry applications...|$|R

While there were curvilinear responses of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression</b> to FC and to mean fibre diameter, FC accounted for much more of the variance in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression.</b> Fibre type was an important determinant of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression.</b> The softest fibres were alpaca, mohair and cashgora and all of the fibres measured were softer than most Merino wool.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a method that {{simplifies}} the standard procedure to determine the yield point providing complementary information about changes in the behaviour of the materials under study. It is generally accepted that the yield point is determined by the inflection point of the curve of pressure versus apparent volume of the sample, P(V), from Hg porosimetry runs. Although compressible materials present an easily identifiable neat inflection point, in resilient materials, the inflection point is not easy to identify by simple visual inspection of the curve. A physical magnitude (K') is introduced to characterise the evolution of the material's compliance under isotropic pressure. The physical meaning of K' is the variation in the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> uniform <b>compression</b> with the pressure applied, helping to identify the yield point and the plastic mechanism beyond the yield point in a single run. © 2009 Académie des sciences.
