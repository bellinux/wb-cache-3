40|$|Cortical neurons {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{fluctuate}} spontaneously between two stable membrane potentials: a depolarized <b>UP</b> <b>state</b> and a hyperpolarized DOWN <b>state.</b> <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> temporally correspond with multineuronal firing sequences {{which may be}} important for information processing. To examine how thalamic inputs interact with ongoing cortical <b>UP</b> <b>state</b> activity, we used calcium imaging and targeted whole-cell recordings of activated neurons in thalamocortical slices of mouse somatosensory cortex. Whereas thalamic stimulation during DOWN states generated multineuronal, synchronized <b>UP</b> <b>states,</b> identical stimulation during <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> {{had no effect on}} the subthreshold membrane dynamics of the vast majority of cells or on ongoing multineuronal temporal patterns. Both thalamocortical and corticocortical PSPs were significantly reduced and neuronal input resistance was significantly decreased during cortical <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> – mechanistically consistent with <b>UP</b> <b>state</b> insensitivity. Our results demonstrate that cortical dynamics during <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> are insensitive to thalamic inputs...|$|R

40|$|The neocortex generates short epochs of {{persistent}} activity called <b>up</b> <b>states,</b> which {{are associated with}} changes in cellular and network excitability. Using somatosensory thalamocortical slices, we studied the impact {{of persistent}} cortical activity during spontaneous <b>up</b> <b>states</b> on intrinsic cellular excitability (input resistance) and on excitatory synaptic inputs of cortical cells. At the intrinsic excitability level, {{we found that the}} expected decrease in input resistance (high conductance) resulting from synaptic barrages during <b>up</b> <b>states</b> is counteracted by an increase in input resistance due to depolarization per se. The result is a variable but on average relatively small reduction in input resistance during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> At the synaptic level, <b>up</b> <b>states</b> enhanced a late synaptic component of short-latency thalamocortical field potential responses but suppressed intracortical field potential responses. The thalamocortical enhancement did not reflect an increase in synaptic strength, as determined by measuring the evoked postsynaptic current, but instead an increase in evoked action potential (spike) probability due to depolarization during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> In contrast, the intracortical suppression was associated with a reduction in synaptic strength, apparently driven by increased presynaptic intracortical activity during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> In addition, intracortical suppression also reflected a reduction in evoked spike latency caused by depolarization and the abolishment of longer-latency spikes caused by stronger inhibitory drive during <b>up</b> <b>states.</b> In conclusion, depolarization during <b>up</b> <b>states</b> increases the success of excitatory synaptic inputs to reach firing. However, activity-dependent synaptic depression caused by increased presynaptic firing during <b>up</b> <b>states</b> and the enhancement of evoked inhibitory drive caused by depolarization suppress excitatory intracortical synaptic inputs...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of subthreshold membrane potential {{provide insight into}} the organization of activity in neural circuits.

Here, we have used intracellular recordings to characterize the {{dynamics of}} membrane potential in the auditory cortex of awake rats. We find that long <b>up</b> <b>states</b> are rare in the awake auditory cortex, with only 0. 4 % of <b>up</b> <b>states</b> > 500 ms.

40|$|AbstractThe medial {{entorhinal cortex}} (mEC) {{is a key}} {{structure}} which controls the communication between the hippocampus and the neocortex. During slow-wave sleep, it stands out from other cortical regions by exhibiting persistent activity that outlasts neocortical <b>Up</b> <b>states,</b> decoupling the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal interaction from the neocortex. Here, we compared the mechanisms involved in {{the maintenance of the}} <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> in the barrel cortex (BC) and mEC using whole cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices. Bath application of an NMDA receptor antagonist abolished <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> in the BC, and reduced the incidence but not the duration of <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> in the mEC. Conversely, blockade of kainate receptors decreased <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> duration in the mEC, but not in the BC. Voltage clamp recordings demonstrated the presence of a non-NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic current, sensitive to the selective kainate receptor antagonist UBP- 302, in layer III neurons of the mEC, which was not observed in the BC. Moreover, we found that kainate receptor-mediated currents assist in recovery back to the <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> membrane potential following a current-induced hyperpolarisation of individual cells in the mEC. Finally, we were able to generate <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> activity in a network model of exponential integrate-and-fire neurons only supported by AMPA and kainate receptor-mediated currents.

40|$|In vivo, {{cortical}} neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) display robust subthreshold depolarizations (<b>Up</b> <b>states)</b> {{during which}} they are enabled to fire action potentials. In the cortex, <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> are believed to occur simultaneously in a neuronal ensemble and to be sustained by local network interactions. It is known that MSN are impelled into the <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> by extra-striatal (primarily cortical) inputs, but the mechanisms that sustain and determine the end of striatal <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> are still debated. Furthermore, {{it has not been}} established if brisk perturbations of ongoing cortical oscillations alter rhythmic transitions between <b>Up</b> and Down <b>states</b> in striatal neurons. Here we report that MSN <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> terminate abruptly when persistent activity in cortical ensembles providing afferents to a given striatal region is turned off by local electrical stimulation or ends spontaneously. In addition, we found that phase perturbations in MSN membrane potential slow oscillations induced by cortical stimulation replicate the stimulus-induced dynamics of spiking activity in cortical ensembles. Overall, these results suggest that striatal <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> are single-cell subthreshold representations of episodes of persistent spiking in cortical ensembles. A precise spatial and temporal alignment between episodes of cortical persistent activity and striatal <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> would allow MSN to detect specific cortical inputs embedded within a more general cortical signal...|$|R

40|$|Spiny neurons of amygdala, striatum, and {{cerebral}} cortex share four interesting features: [1] {{they are the}} most abundant cell type within their respective brain area, [2] covered by thousands of thorny protrusions (dendritic spines), [3] possess high levels of dendritic NMDA conductances, and [4] experience sustained somatic depolarizations in vivo and in vitro (<b>UP</b> <b>states).</b> In all spiny neurons of the forebrain, adequate glutamatergic inputs generate dendritic plateau potentials (dendritic <b>UP</b> <b>states)</b> characterized by (i) fast rise, (ii) plateau phase lasting several hundred milliseconds and (iii) abrupt decline {{at the end of the}} plateau phase. The dendritic plateau potential propagates towards the cell body decrementally to induce a long-lasting (longer than 100 ms, most often 200 – 800 ms) steady depolarization (~ 20 mV amplitude), which resembles a neuronal <b>UP</b> <b>state.</b> Based on voltage-sensitive dye imaging, the plateau depolarization in the soma is precisely time-locked to the regenerative plateau potential taking place in the dendrite. The somatic plateau rises after the onset of the dendritic voltage transient and collapses with the breakdown of the dendritic plateau depolarization. We hypothesize that neuronal <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> in vivo reflect the occurrence of dendritic plateau potentials (dendritic <b>UP</b> <b>states).</b> We propose that the somatic voltage waveform during a neuronal <b>UP</b> <b>state</b> is determined by dendritic plateau potentials. A mammalian spiny neuron uses dendritic plateau potentials to detect and transform coherent network activity into a ubiquitous neuronal <b>UP</b> <b>state.</b> The biophysical properties of dendritic plateau potentials allow neurons to quickly attune to the ongoing network activity, as well as secure the stable amplitudes of successive <b>UP</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

The influence of the <b>up</b> <b>state</b> on signal encoding, however, is not well investigated. Here we construct a one-dimensional bistable neuron model and calculate the linear dynamical response to noisy oscillatory inputs analytically. We find that with the appearance of an <b>up</b> <b>state,</b> the transmission function is enhanced by the emergence of a local maximum at some optimal frequency and the phase lag relative to the input signal is reduced.

40|$|Cortical {{networks}} spontaneously fluctuate between persistently active <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> and quiescent Down <b>states.</b> The <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> {{are maintained}} by recurrent excitation within local circuits, {{and can be}} turned on and off by synaptic input. GABAergic inhibition {{is believed to be}} important for stabilizing such persistent activity by balancing the excitation, and could have an additional role in terminating the <b>Up</b> <b>state.</b> Here, we report that GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition have distinct and complementary roles in balancing and terminating persistent activity. In a model of Up-Down states expressed in slices of rat entorhinal cortex, the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, gabazine (50 - 500 nM), concentration-dependently decreased <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> duration, eventually leading to epileptiform bursts. In contrast, the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, CGP 55845 (50 nM to 1 microM), increased the duration of persistent network activity, and prevented stimulus-induced Down state transitions. These results suggest that while GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition is necessary for balancing persistent activity, activation of GABA(B) receptors contributes to terminating <b>Up</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{synchronization}} of neuronal assemblies during cortical <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> {{has been}} implicated in computational and homeostatic processes, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain unknown. To investigate potential roles of astrocytes in synchronizing cortical circuits, we electrically activated astrocytes while monitoring {{the activity of the}} surrounding network with electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging. Stimulating a single astrocyte activates other astrocytes in the local circuit and can trigger <b>UP</b> <b>state</b> synchronizations of neighboring neurons. Moreover, interfering with astrocytic activity with intracellular injections of a calcium chelator into individual astrocytes inhibits spontaneous and stimulated <b>UP</b> <b>states.</b> Finally, both astrocytic activity and neuronal <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> are regulated by purinergic signaling in the circuit.

40|$|In the neocortex, neurons {{participate}} in epochs of elevated activity, or <b>Up</b> <b>states,</b> {{during periods of}} quiescent wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, and general anesthesia. The regulation of firing during and between <b>Up</b> <b>states</b> is of great interest because it can reflect the underlying connectivity and excitability of neurons within the network. Automated analysis of the onset and characteristics of <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> firing across different experiments and conditions requires a robust and accurate method for <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> detection. Using measurements of membrane potential mean and variance calculated from whole-cell recordings of neurons from control and postseizure tissue, the authors have developed such a method. This quantitative and automated method is independent of cell- or condition-dependent variability in underlying noise or tonic firing activity. Using this approach, the authors show that <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> frequency and firing rates are significantly increased in layer 2 / 3 neocortical neurons 24 hours after chemoconvulsant-induced seizure. Down states in postseizure tissue show greater membrane-potential variance characterized by increased synaptic activity. Previously, the authors have found that postseizure increase in excitability is linked to a gain-of-function in BK channels, and blocking BK channels in vitro and in vivo can decrease excitability and eliminate seizures. Thus, the authors also assessed the effect of BK-channel antagonists on <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> properties in control and postseizure neurons. These data establish a robust and broadly applicable algorithm for <b>Up</b> <b>state</b> detection and analysis, provide a quantitative description of how prior seizures increase spontaneous firing activity in cortical networks, and show how BK-channel antagonists reduce this abnormal activity...|$|R

Using a physiologically validated model of UP/DOWN state generation in mouse neocortical slices whereby the cholinergic tone present in vivo is reinstated, we show that the regular initiation of <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> is driven by an electrophysiologically distinct subset of morphologically identified layer 5 neurons, which exhibit intrinsic rhythmic low-frequency burst firing at 0. 2 – 2 Hz. This low-frequency bursting is resistant to block of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission but is absent when slices are maintained in a low Ca 2 medium (an alternative, widely used model of cortical UP/DOWN states), thus explaining the lack of rhythmic <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> and abnormally prolonged DOWN states in this condition. We also characterized the activity of various other pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons during UP/ DOWN states andfoundthat an electrophysiologically distinct subset of layer 5 regular spiking pyramidal neuronsfires earlier duringthe onset of network oscillations compared with all other types of neurons recorded. This study, therefore, identifies an important role for cell-type-specific neuronal activity in driving neocortical <b>UP</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|Even in {{the absence}} of sensory stimulation, the neocortex shows complex {{spontaneous}} activity patterns, often consisting of alternating “DOWN” states of generalized neural silence and “UP” states of massive, persistent network activity.

Each neuron displayed a virtually unique spike pattern during <b>UP</b> <b>states,</b> with diversity seen amongst both putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, reflecting a complex but stereotypically organized sequential spread of activation through local cortical networks.

A subset of <b>UP</b> <b>states</b> propagated as traveling waves, but waves passing a given point in either direction initiated similar local sequences, suggesting local networks as the substrate of sequential firing patterns.
