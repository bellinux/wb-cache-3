5|$|Haynes {{was offered}} a higher ranking {{position}} within Indiana Gas at the Chicago headquarters, but by then he had {{become aware of the}} business's connection to the corrupt and disgraced monopolist Charles T. Yerkes. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago leadership. After the pipeline became fully operational in 1892, Haynes moved to Kokomo where he was made a supervisor of the Indiana Gas's local operations. The Indiana General Assembly began attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas be used more conservatively. He specifically recommended that the flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a figure that shocked the company's leaders. Despite his support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly against other rules that <b>regulated</b> <b>pressure</b> and hindered productivity. He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate artificial increases in well pressure. The court case continued until 1896, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed, including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among other companies and the field's wells began to run dry by 1905modern experts estimate as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet (30km3) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or misused.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the <b>regulated</b> <b>pressure</b> increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E
50|$|Vapour phase {{injection}} systems {{also use}} a converter, but unlike the mixer system, the gas exits the converter at a <b>regulated</b> <b>pressure.</b> The gas is then injected into the air intake manifold via a series of electrically controlled injectors. The injector opening times are controlled by the autogas control unit. This unit works {{in much the same}} way as a petrol fuel injection control unit. This allows much more accurate metering of fuel to the engine than is possible with mixers, improving economy and/or power while reducing emissions.|$|E

5000|$|The RT was a {{great leap}} in the Automag line.

The RT also featured internal airlines, a stylized mainbody, and a reactive trigger. The reactive trigger enables the user to reach the RT's high BPS by resetting the trigger with air pressure after a shot has been fired. When a certain force is applied to the trigger, the marker will fire with a [...] "full-auto" [...] effect.|$|E

50|$|The last type of {{pneumatic}} airgun is the precharged pneumatic. This {{is both an}} old and a new design; some of {{the earliest}} airguns, such as the model carried by Lewis and Clark, were of this type, as are many new cutting edge models. The precharged pneumatic uses an external source of compressed air, either an external pump or a high pressure reservoir such as a SCUBA tank, to fill a reservoir. The reservoir can be a small, single-shot one, such as in the Brocock Air Cartridge system, or a large, multi-shot tank. The key to top accuracy in a precharged pneumatic is a consistent pressure. With multishot systems (as are most), the pressure in the reservoir will drop with each shot fired, so the best way to achieve consistency is with a pressure regulator, which provides a steady, but lower, pressure at the valve, {{for as long as the}} reservoir pressure remains higher than the <b>regulated</b> <b>pressure.</b> Regulators are also generally adjustable, so a low pressure setting will provide many shots of lower power, while a high pressure setting will provide a few high power shots.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{who suffer}} from severe {{incontinence}} can recover total continence {{by means of an}} artificial urinary sphincter (AUS). This prosthesis is a hydraulic system made up of three parts : a cuff placed around the urethra, a <b>regulating</b> <b>pressure</b> balloon exerting hydraulic pressure on the cuff and a pump allowing micturition by transferring liquid from the cuff to the balloon. This system is subject to mechanical breakdowns and the pressure applied on the urethra could induce urethral atrophies. The aim of this project is to replace the <b>regulating</b> <b>pressure</b> system (balloon and pump) by an electronic device which dynamically controls the pressure in the cuff according to real-time physiological and postural measures of the patient. The pressure applied on the urethra would then be reduced, avoiding atrophies, and an ergonomic control of the device would be possible as well...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of {{microinjection}} systems. The first is called a constant flow system {{and the second is}} called a pulsed flow system. In a constant flow system, which is relatively simple and inexpensive though clumsy and outdated, a constant flow of a sample is delivered from a micropipette and the amount of the sample which is injected is determined by how long the needle remains in the cell. This system typically requires a <b>regulated</b> <b>pressure</b> source, a capillary holder, and either a coarse or a fine micromanipulator. A pulsed flow system, however, allows for greater control and consistency over the amount of sample injected: the most common arrangement for intracytoplasmic sperm injection includes an Eppendorf [...] "Femtojet" [...] injector coupled with an Eppendorf [...] "InjectMan", though procedures involving other targets usually take advantage of much less expensive equipment of similar capability. Because of its increased control over needle placement and movement and in addition to the increased precision over the volume of substance delivered, the pulsed flow technique usually results in less damage to the receiving cell than the constant flow technique. However, the Eppendorf line, at least, has a complex user interface and its particular system components are usually much more expensive than those necessary to create a constant flow system or than other pulsed flow injection systems.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAutosomal-dominant {{polycystic kidney}} disease, the most {{frequent}} monogenic cause of kidney failure, is induced by mutations in the PKD 1 or PKD 2 genes, encoding polycystins TRPP 1 and TRPP 2, respectively. Polycystins are proposed to form a flow-sensitive ion channel complex in the primary cilium of both epithelial and endothelial cells. However, how polycystins contribute to cellular mechanosensitivity remains obscure. Here, we show that TRPP 2 inhibits stretch-activated ion channels (SACs). This specific effect is reversed by coexpression with TRPP 1, indicating that the TRPP 1 /TRPP 2 ratio <b>regulates</b> <b>pressure</b> sensing. Moreover, deletion of TRPP 1 in smooth muscle cells reduces SAC activity and the arterial myogenic tone. Inversely, depletion of TRPP 2 in TRPP 1 -deficient arteries rescues both SAC opening and the myogenic response. Finally, we show that TRPP 2 interacts with filamin A and demonstrate that this actin crosslinking protein is critical for SAC regulation. This work uncovers a role for polycystins in <b>regulating</b> <b>pressure</b> sensing...|$|R

40|$|The FluidFM {{technology}} uses microchanneled {{atomic force microscope}} cantilevers {{that are}} fixed to a drilled atomic force microscope cantilevers probeholder.

40|$|Development of a fluid {{infusion}} {{system was}} undertaken {{in response to}} a need for an intravenous infusion device operable under conditions of zero-g.

This scheme was not workable because of the varying bag contact area, and a major design iteration was made. A floating sensor plate in the center of the bag pressure plate was made to operate a pressure regulator built into the bellows assembly, effectively making liquid pressure the directly controlled variable. Other design changes were made as experience was gained with the breadboard. Extensive performance tests were conducted on both the breadboard and the prototype device; accurately regulated flows from 6 m 1 /min to 100 m 1 /min were achieved.

A good agreement with the experimental data was found in the evaluation of the effect of the flow force compensation. Once validated, the CFD code was used to study the influence of the deflector geometry on the opening force. Moreover it was also used for determining some proper data to be supplied as input to a lumped parameters model of the valve. The tuning of the 0 D model involved the discharge coefficient and the flow force. For the evaluation of the flow force compensation, a lookup table was calculated by the CFD code and then interpolated in the 0 D model as function of the poppet displacement and of the flow rate...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} efficient technique for improving the existing optimal pressure regulation and leakage minimization algorithms for supervisory water distribution networks. With the assistance of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) we have trained a Self-Organized Map (SOM), an unsupervised artificial neural network (ANN), to classify well <b>regulated</b> <b>pressure</b> cases for the water distribution network based on its actual values of flow meter readings which reflect the real network water demands or consumption. After training the SOM, a simulation step is used to classify the unregulated prssure cases into the different model classes. Based on these classifications the appropriate electrical moter valves setting of the well pressure regulation events are used for the unregulated ones. Regarding that all the available algorithms deal directly with the pressure regulation problem from an optimization point of view which required a computational time depending on the water network size and the used optimization method {{and in most cases}} requires also a network simplification method which is considered as another optimization problem. Using SOM as a pre-optimization method could prevent all errors resulting from applying optimization models, save its computational time and provides us with an on-line pressure regulation method. Computational results for Block 12 of Fukuoka City water distribution network using a short-term data set demonstrate the effectiveness of using SOM as a pre-optimization tool for regulating 74 % of events within the target pressure range...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel method of {{controlling}} liquid motion on a centrifugal microfluidic platform {{based on the}} integration of a <b>regulated</b> <b>pressure</b> pump and a programmable electromechanical valving system. We demonstrate accurate control over the displacement of liquids within the system by pressurizing simultaneously multiple ports of the microfluidic device while the platform is rotating at high speed. Compared to classical centrifugal microfluidic platforms where liquids are solely driven by centrifugal and capillary forces, the method presented herein adds a new degree of freedom for fluidic manipulation, which represents a paradigm change in centrifugal microfluidics. We first demonstrate how various core microfluidic functions such as valving, switching, and reverse pumping (i. e., against the centrifugal field) can be easily achieved by programming the pressures applied at dedicated access ports of the microfluidic device. We then show, for the first time, {{that the combination of}} centrifugal force and active pneumatic pumping offers the possibility of mixing fluids rapidly (~ 0. 1 s) and efficiently based on the creation of air bubbles {{at the bottom of a}} microfluidic reservoir. Finally, the suitability of the developed platform for performing complex bioanalytical assays in an automated fashion is demonstrated in a DNA harvesting experiment where recovery rates of about 70 % were systematically achieved. The proposed concept offers the interesting prospect to decouple basic microfluidic functions from specific material properties, channel dimensions and fabrication tolerances, surface treatments, or on-chip active components, thus promoting integration of complex assays on simple and low-cost microfluidic cartridges.
