40|$|Dextromethorphan (DM), a non-narcotic {{antitussive}} with anticon-vulsant activity, binds to high (Kd, 57 nM) - and low-affinity sites (Kd, 24 M) in the {{guinea pig}} brain. This work, done at physio-logical pH, expands previous results obtained at pH 8. 3. Phe-nytoin (PHT) produces an allosteric {{increase in the}} binding of [3 H]DM, which is more marked than that reported previously: PHT (1 00 zM,) at pH 7. 4, increased the binding affinity of [3 H] DM to brain homogenates 4 -foki, without changing the concen-tration of DM sites. Moreover, <b>ropizine</b> (SC-i 3504) an anticon-vulsant benzhydryl piperazine, also produced a marked concen-tration-dependent increase in the binding of [3 H]DM, which is mediated by {{a decrease in the}} dissociation rate of [3 H]DM. Importantly, the effects of <b>ropizine</b> are fully apparent at 10 M, i 0 -fold lower than those of PHT. The effects of PHT and ropizin...|$|E
40|$|Equilibrium binding {{analysis}} demonstrated that (+) -[3 H] 3 -(3 -hy-droxyphenyl) -N-(1 -propyl) piperidine [(+) -[3 H] 3 -PPP] binds in guinea pig brain homogenates to {{high and low}} affinity sites with Kd values of 25 nM and 0. 9 tM, respectively. Competition studies with dextromethorphan (DM) site ligands and other drugs against (+) -[3 H] 3 -PPP demonstrated that their K, values and rank order of potency are identical to those found previously against [3 H] DM. Most significant, <b>ropizine</b> produced a concentration-depend-ent increase in the binding of (+) -[3 H] 3 -PPP, with an inhibitory component at high concentrations, as described previously for [3 H]DM. Similarly, phenytoin increased the binding of (+) -[3 H] 3 -PPP {{in the same fashion}} as that of [3 H]DM. Computer-assisted analysis of equilibrium binding of (+) -[3 H] 3 -PPP in the presence of 1 0,M <b>ropizine</b> demonstrated that the binding increase pro-duced is due to a 3 -fold increase in the affinity for (+) -[3 H] 3 -PPP...|$|E
40|$|Novack, Gary D., Larry G. Stark and Steven L. Peterson: Anticonvulsant {{effects of}} benzhydryl piperazines on maximal {{electroshock}} seizures in rats. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 208 : 480 - 484, 1979. The anticonvulsant effects of four benzhydryl piperazines, SC- 1 3504 (<b>ropizine,</b> an anticonvulsant), hydroxyzine (HDX, an anxiolytic), chlorcyclizine (CCZ, an antihistaminic) and bucli-zine (BUC, an antihistaminic), were investigated utilizing a modified maximal electroshock seizure test in rats. In addition to detecting {{the presence or}} absence of tonic hindlimb exten-sion, the modified method quantified various phases of the seizure. All four benzhydryl piperazines exhibited anticonvul-sant activity in maximal electroshock seizure, but SC-i 3504 was similar in efficacy to phenobarbital and phenytoin, an...|$|E
40|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{potency of}} a series of structurally-dissimilar compounds which possess nanomolar affinities for high-affinity σ binding sites was examined in the Mg 2 +-free model of epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices. Extracellular field potential recordings in the CA 1 region were employed {{to examine the effects of}} test compounds on spontaneous epileptiform activity and multiple population spikes evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. Applied at σ site-selective (i. e. nanomolar) concentrations, dextromethorphan, ditolylguanidine, caramiphen and opipramol failed to modify Mg 2 +-free epileptiform activity; neither pro- nor anticonvulsant effects were observed. However, applied at micromolar concentrations, these and additional test compounds reversibly inhibited orthodromically-evoked epileptiform field potentials with a rank order potency (IC 50 values in μM) : dextrorphan (1. 5) >ifenprodil (6. 3) >dextromethorphan (10) >ditolylguanidine (15) >loperamide (28) >carbetapentane (38) >caramiphen (46) >opipramol (52). Micromolar concentrations of the same compounds also inhibited spontaneous epileptiform bursts recorded during perfusion with Mg 2 +-free medium. Co-application of <b>ropizine</b> (10 [*]μM), an allosteric modulator of dextromethorphan binding to high-affinity σ receptors, failed to endow dextromethorphan 10 [*]nM with anticonvulsant properties and did not modify the anticonvulsant potency of 10 [*]μM dextromethorphan. The effects of dextrorphan (10 [*]μM), ifenprodil (20 [*]μM), loperamide (50 [*]μM) and caramiphen (100 [*]μM) were examined in the presence of external Mg 2 + on field potential input/output (I/O) relationships and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Only caramiphen elicited effects on these parameters, affecting synaptic transmission at the point of synaptic transfer and depressing PPF ratios to below baseline values. The effects of caramiphen on I/O relationships mimicked those of the established anticonvulsant adenosine; in contrast, adenosine evoked an increase in PPF ratios. Because anticonvulsant activity was observed only at micromolar concentrations of the σ ligands tested, the results indicate that their anticonvulsant actions should not be ascribed to their occupancy, observed at nanomolar concentrations, of high-affinity σ binding sites. Rather, anticonvulsant activity more likely reflects functional NMDA receptor antagonism and/or blockade of high voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels, effects which are associated with micromolar concentrations of the test compounds. Modulation of GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms may also contribute to the anticonvulsant properties of caramiphen...|$|E
