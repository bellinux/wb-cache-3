40|$|The {{literature}} on Ichthyobodo necator is reviewed. The prevalence {{and intensity of}} Ichthyobodo infestations on farmed salmonids was investigated on three farms {{over a period of}} two years. The infestations were found to be markedly age dependent. Peak infestations and related mortalities occurred in the first eight weeks after first feeding. Both mortalities and infestations declined to zero shortly after this period with no chemotherapy. Ichthyobodo reappeared on 0 + and appeared {{for the first time on}} I+ fish after a drop of water temperatures to less than 10 *C. Many of the 1 + fish had started to mature. It is suggested that some form of host defence mechanism operates which limits the Ichthyobodo infestations in farmed salmonids. The sequential pathology of Ichthyobodo infestations of the skin of 0 + and 1 + salmon and rainbow trout was studied. Areas of greatest shelter from water currents were found to be most commonly infested and no parasites were found attached to the epidermis on the head of the fish. The parasite caused hyperplasia of the malphigian cells and exhaustion of the goblet cells below infestations, followed by spongiosis of the underlying epidermis. The epidermal plaque then sloughed off leaving a single layer of cells attached to the basement membrane. Cell kinetic studies showed that Ichthyobodo caused the cells immediately below infestations to divide, a markedly different pattern from that of normal teleost epidermal cell proliferation. The possibility that the parasite secretes some form of digestive enzyme is postulated. In areas where sloughing had occurred, the remaining malphigian cells were seen to be in the process of division. Various endocrinological aspects of Ichthyobodo infestations were investigated. Three corticosteroids and one androgen were injected or implanted into 1 year old rainbow trout. Implantations of hydrocortisone led to very heavy ichthyobodo infestations. <b>Radio</b> <b>immune</b> <b>assays</b> showed that the level of cortisol and testosterone in the serum of implanted fish was similar to that which would occur when salmonids mature. There appears to be a clear link between cortisol levels in the serum and Ichthyobodo infestation.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in three centers, Ribat University Hospital (Khartoum), Bahri Diabetic Center (Khartoum North) and ImtyazDiabetic Center (Omdurman). The main aims of this study were to {{investigate}} the presence of islet cell autoantibodies, differentiate between insulin dependence and insulin independence as well as to diagnose the prevalence of thyroid disorders among diabetes mellitus type two patients. Blood samples were taken from eighty eight(88) Sudanese type II diabetic patients (represented as 57. 2 % were female while 41. 8 % were males) and forty(40) apparently healthy individualsas control group as 50 % for both sexes. The mean age was (50. 3) and (48. 7) years for the patients and the control groups respectively ranged between (40 - 65) year. Out of the total patients, 69. 3 % have family history of diabetes. The duration of the disease ranged between 1 - 10 years. All of the patients received oral treatment (Insulin independence). Pancreatic autoantibodies were detected by using the Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbant Assay (ELISA). To estimate the level of the thyroid hormones (T 3 & T 4) and the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) among diabetic patients, <b>Radio</b> <b>Immune</b> <b>Assays</b> (RIA/ IRMA) techniques were used to determine the relation between diabetes mellitus and thyroid gland disorders. The FBG was measured colourimetrically. A significant increase (p= 0. 00) in FBG level was observed among the patients compared to the healthy subjects. Pancreatic autoantibodies were detected in 9 patients (10. 2 %), but no evidence of a relation between Fasting Blood Sugar IV (FBG) level and the pancreatic autoantibodies detected. Out of the 9 patients examined, 3 of them were shown to have thyroid disorders. When the thyroid disorders were screened, 24 patients (27. 3 %) were found to have clinical, subclinical, hypo or hyper thyroidism from all the patients. Furthermore, TSH level(0. 01) in patients with type II DM was significant low compared to the healthy group. There was a significant negative correlation between the FBG level and TSH hormone (0. 038) while no correlation observed between FBG level and the T 3 and T 4. This study concluded that patients with blood glucose disturbances should examine pancreatic autoantibodies to differentiate the type of DM in order to choose the appropriate treatment.

40|$|In this study, we {{combined}} a novel sequencing method, {{which can}} identify individual clonotypes {{based on their}} unique T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement, with existing <b>immune</b> <b>assays</b> to characterize antigen-specific T cell responses. We validated this approach using three types of assays routinely used to measure antigen-specific responses: pentamers which enable identification of T cells bearing specific TCRs, activation marker expression following antigen stimulation and antigen-induced proliferation to identify cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific clonotypes. In one individual, 8 clonotypes were identified using a pentamer reagent derived from the CMV pp 65 protein. The same 8 clonotypes were also identified following sequencing of cells that upregulated an activation marker following incubation with an identical peptide derived from pp 65. These 8 and an additional 8 clonotypes were identified using a more sensitive CFSE-based proliferation assay.

Pre-existing as well as therapy-induced immune responses against both AAV and the encoded transgenes have been described and may impact on safety and efficacy of gene-therapy approaches. Consequently, monitoring of vector- and transgene-specific immunity is mandated and may rationally guide clinical development. Next to the humoral immune response, the cellular response is central {{in our understanding of}} the host reaction in gene therapy. But in contrast to the monitoring of antibodies, which has matured over many decades, sensitive and robust monitoring of T cells is a relatively new development.

40|$|In {{ligand binding}} assays, the {{separation}} of bound and free fraction of the labeled ligand is very important. Dialysis is generally overlooked as separation technique since it requires large volumes and long analysis times. The availability of the ASTED-system (Automated Sequential Trace Enrichment of Dialysates) might open ways for a complete automation of <b>immune</b> <b>assays</b> including the separation step. A well-documented radio-immune assay for 3 -keto-desogestrel (Org 3236) {{was used to test}} the potentials of this system. The tritiated analog of Org 3236 not only served as label in the <b>immune</b> <b>assay</b> but was also used to trace this compound in the entire procedure. The dialysis efficiency increased with the dialysis time and with the flush rate of the recipient solvent (tris-HCl or phosphate buffer). Addition of methanol to recipient solvent had spectacular effects on the recovery. With tris-HCl buffer, 0. 18 mL/min and 1. 0 mL recipient solvent 2. 5 % of the label was collected. Addition of 50 % methanol resulted in a 5 -fold increase to 12 %. Replacement of buffer by 100 % methanol resulted in another 5 % increase in dialysis efficiency which was accompanied by a reduction in the antibody binding in the donor compartment due to denaturation of the antibody. The commercial availability of other types of membranes is essential to find optimal conditions for each analyte. A serious problem is the carry-over effect between subsequent samples. Roughly 0. 25 % of label was collected in the next run which may have a substantial impact on the accuracy and precision of the assay. Renewal of the dialysis membrane might exclude this carry-over effect but is not a serious option with the available instrumentation. Automated dialysis systems can be very valuable for ligand binding assays as soon as membranes become available for the analytes of interest which provide high recoveries (> 40 %) in 1 mL recipient solvent. Moreover their carry-over effect should be negligible or eliminated by more efficient rinsing procedures of the entire dialysis system.

The effect of Zn 2 + on the immunological activity of insulin indicated that the antigenic determinants of insulin were also altered. The apparent loss of immunological activity of monoiodotyrosylinsulin was demonstrated to be due to the loss of Zn 2 + rather than the substitution of iodine.

These parameters included routine haematology, weight and microscopy of lymphoid organs, bone marrow cellularity, total serum immunoglobulin levels, counts of splenic lymphocyte subsets, splenic natural killer cell activity, splenic lymphocyte responsiveness to mitogens, and primary and secondary antibody responses to red blood cells from sheep. The host resistance to Trichinella spiralis parasites was also studied. Several effects on the immunosystem were observed, but not seen in the non-functional <b>immune</b> <b>assays</b> of the immunosystem. However, some effects were observed with functional <b>immune</b> <b>assays,</b> i. e. a (statistically insignificant) reduction in NK-cell activity and an increased IgE response after infection with Trichinella spiralis. These results indicate that Diazepam is not a strong immunosuppressant under the conditions in this study. In retrospect, it would have been more advantageous to select a more potent immunosuppressant in carrying out these studies. Nonetheless, results do warrant further research for testing the usefulness of extending the current OECD 414 protocol through the introduction of immune parameters...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of introducing stratified medicine/personal health care {{have led to}} an increased demand for specific biomarkers. However, despite the myriads of biomarkers claimed to be fit {{for all sorts of}} diseases and applications, the scientific integrity of the claims and therefore their credibility is far from satisfactory. Biomarker databases are met with scepticism. The reasons for this lack of faith come from different directions: lack of integrity of the biospecimen and meta-analysis of data derived from biospecimen prepared in various ways cause incoherence and false indications. Although the trend for antibody-independent assays is on the rise, demand for consistent performance of antibodies (both in choice of antibody and how to apply it in the correct dilution where applicable) in <b>immune</b> <b>assays</b> remains unmet in too many cases. Quantitative assays suffer from a lack of world-wide accepted criteria when the <b>immune</b> <b>assay</b> is not ELISA-based. Finally, statistical analysis suffer from coherence both in the way software packages are being scrutinized for mistakes in the script and remaining invisible after small-scale analysis, and in the way appropriate queries are fed into the packages in search for output that is fit for the types of data put in. Wrong queries would lead to wrong statistical conclusions, for example when data from a cohort of patients with different backgrounds are being analysed, or when one seeks an answer from software that was not designed for such query...|$|R
30|$|The most {{commonly}} used tests to measure CMV-specific IgM or IgG levels are the enzyme-linked <b>immune</b> <b>assays</b> and anticomplement immunofluorescence assays. The presence of IgM antibodies indicates an acute CMV infection and can last for 4 – 6  months [42]. Because IgG seropositivity is long lasting, the measurement of IgG antibodies is not a reliable method to diagnose CMV infection. Critically ill patients may develop immune paralysis (anergy) that limits their ability to mount immune responses; therefore, {{it is important to}} note that negative serology does not exclude CMV infection. The main utility of serology testing at present is to screen for the potential of latent CMV reactivation [42].|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{constructed}} a cDNA library from Torpedo marmorata electric organ poly(A+) RNA in the lambda phage expression vector λgtll. This library has been screened with polyclonal anti-acetylcholinesterase antibodies. One clone, λAChEl, produced a fusion protein which {{was recognized by}} the antibodies and which prevented the binding of native acetylcholinesterase in an enzymatic <b>immune</b> <b>assay.</b> These results indicate that λAChEl contains a cDNA insert coding for {{a part of a}} catalytic subunit of Torpedo acetylcholinesterase. The 200 -base-pair cDNA insert hybridized to three mRNAs (14. 5, 10. 5 and 5. 5 kb) from Torpedo electric organs. These mRNAs were also detected in Torpedo electric lobes...|$|R
40|$|The work is {{dedicated}} to studies of interrelations between the cytokine contents in the liquid from anterior eye chamber (AEC), and development of systemic immune response to ocular tissue antigens, {{described in terms of}} an anterior eye chamber-associated immune disturbance (ACAID phenomenon). The <b>immune</b> <b>assays</b> were conducted in parallel, using multiplex cytokine analysis (flow cytometry technique), and leukocyte inhibition migration reaction. Twenty-six patients with different forms of ophthalmic pathology were examined, including cases of uveitis (18), keratouveitis (3), glaucoma (5). It is shown that the reduced TGF- β 1 levels and increased concentrations of proinflammatory, chemotactic cytokines in AEC liquid are associated with development of organ-specific immune sensitization.   </div...|$|R
