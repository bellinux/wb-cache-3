40|$|This survey empirically {{investigates the}} effect of {{accounting}} <b>records</b> <b>keeping</b> on Small scale enterprises. In line with the objectives of this study, a descriptive design such as personal interviews and questionnaire were employed as the major techniques for primary data collection. Data collected were analyzed using both the qualitative and quantitative methods. The descriptive statistics used were tables and percentages. Chi- square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed to analyze data through STATA 10 version with the coefficient of determination (R 2) 0. 8974 which implied that 89. 7 % {{of the variation in}} financial performance could be explained by the level of accounting <b>records</b> <b>keeping.</b> Following the outcome of this study, it is therefore concluded that that there is a strong positive relationship between accounting <b>records</b> <b>keeping</b> and performance of small scale enterprises. Accounting <b>records</b> <b>keeping</b> is essential for decision making which invariably affects performance of small scale enterprises. It is recommended that the owners and managers of the small scale enterprises should embrace proper accounting <b>records</b> <b>keeping</b> practices for effective financial performance in their business...|$|R
40|$|In my B. A. thesis, I {{focused on}} the issue of the {{transition}} of a fictitious business from tax <b>records</b> <b>keeping</b> (former "single-entry bookkeeping) to bookkeeping (i. e. "double-entry bookkeeping). In the theoretical part, I characterised briefly tax <b>records</b> <b>keeping,</b> bookkeeping and also the transition process. The bookkeeping is based on the cost-income principle, and the tax <b>records</b> <b>keeping</b> is based on the income-expenses principle. I primarily applied theoretical knowledge obtained from specialised literature. There is no general rule, which would determine that the bookkeeping is better for a particular person than the tax <b>records</b> <b>keeping</b> and vice versa. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. In selecting, an entrepreneur must examine the strengths and weaknesses, also in relation to a particular economic situation of a particular country. In the practical part, I applied the transition of a fictitious individual as of 1 January 2007. On the basis of stocktaking, it was found out that the entrepreneur has much stock available.

5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves.

5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef.

This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E

5|$|The sultanate of Oman, {{located on}} the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, {{regularly}} receives the impacts of tropical cyclones due to its long coastline along the Arabian Sea. On average, storms strike Oman once every three years, mostly between Masirah Island and Salalah, and usually before June or after October. From 1943 to 1967, tropical cyclones accounted for about 25% of Salalah's overall rainfall. About once every five years, a storm affects the Dhofar region of southern Oman, and Oman's capital of Muscat about once every ten years in. Between 1890 and 1996, 36storms struck Oman, although some landfalling storms might be excluded from the historical record {{due to the lack}} of population centers. In addition, storm intensities at landfall have only been accurately known since around 1979, and reliable <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> began around 1970.

5|$|Cyclone Megh {{continued}} to rapidly intensify while approaching {{the island of}} Socotra. It developed a small eye just 7.4km (4.6mi) in diameter by early on November8, along with a convective core just 280km (175mi) in diameter. At 03:00UTC that day, the IMD upgraded the system to an extremely severe cyclonic storm, and three hours later estimated peak 3minute winds of 175km/h (110mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). Since accurate <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> began in the basin in 1990, this {{marked the first time}} in the Arabian Sea that there were two cyclones in one season with 1minute winds of at least 185km/h (115km/h). Between 06:0012:00UTC on November8, the eye of Megh crossed the northern coast of Socotra, with the resulting land interaction causing the eyewall to disappear and for the winds to diminish. After exiting the island, the cyclone began weakening further due to cooler water temperatures and drier air from the Arabian Peninsula to the northwest. Early on November9, the center of Megh passed 57km (36mi) north of Cape Guardafui, and further land interaction with Somalia to the south increasingly degraded the storm's structure. At 00:00UTC that day, Megh weakened into a very severe cyclonic storm.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Darby turned west-southwestwards as it {{continued}} to weaken, but the shear diminished slightly on July21, allowing Darby to restrengthen to winds of 65mph (100km/h). The reprieve was short-lived, however, as an approaching upper-level low once again increased shear over the system the next day. Darby began to curve back to the west on July23 as it approached a weakness in the aforementioned subtropical ridge, all the while weakening slowly. Just after 00:00UTC on July24 (2:00p.m.HST on July23), Darby made landfall on the Big Island {{near the village of}} Pahala in the Kaʻū District, with winds of 40mph (65km/h). This marked only the fifth time that a tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity or higher made landfall on one of the major islands in the state of Hawaii since <b>record</b> <b>keeping</b> began in 1949, with the others being an unnamed tropical storm in 1958, Hurricane Dot in 1959, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, and Tropical Storm Iselle in 2014.
