But the examiner has an eye that has been in training; he is a picked man; he has at hand yesterday's photographs and last week's photographs, marked maps and all sorts of aids and records. If he is a Frenchman he is only too happy to explain his ideas and methods. Here, he will point out, is a little difference between the German trench beyond the wood since yesterday. For a number of reasons he thinks that will be a new machine gun emplacement; here at the centre of the farm wall they have been making another. This battery here--isn't it plain? Well, it's a dummy. The grass in front of it hasn't been scorched, and there's been no serious wear on the road here for a week. Presently the Germans will send one or two waggons up and down that road and instruct them to make figures of eight to imitate scorching on the grass in front of the gun. We know all about that. The <b>real</b> <b>wear</b> on the road, compare this and this and this, ends here at this spot. It turns off into the wood. There's a sort of track in the trees.

60|$|If, as some think, {{it be the}} purport of Christ's {{religion}} to teach men to live after a godlike fashion rather than to worship God after a peculiar form, then may we be allowed to say that Cicero was almost a Christian, even before the coming of Christ. If, as some think, an eternity of improved existence for all is to be looked for by the disciples of Christ, rather than a heaven of glory for the few and for the many, a hell that never shall be mitigated, then had Cicero anticipated much of Christ's doctrine. That he should have approached the mystical portion of our religion it would of course be absurd to suppose. But a belief in that mystical part is not essential for forming the conduct of men. The divine birth, and {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity, and the Lord's Supper, are not necessary to teach a man to live with his brother men on terms of forbearance and brotherly love. You shall live with a man from year's end to year's end, and shall not know his creed unless he tell you, or that you see him performing the acts of his worship; but you cannot live with him, and not know whether he live in accordance with Christ's teaching. And so it was with Cicero. Read his works through from the beginning to the end, and you shall feel that you are living with a man whom you might accompany across the village green to church, should he be kind enough to stay with you over the Sunday. The urbanity, the softness, the humanity, the sweetness are all there. But you shall not find it to be so with Cæsar, or Lucretius, or with Virgil. When you read his philosophical treatises it is as though you were discussing with some latter-day scholar the theories of Plato or of Epicurus. He does not talk of them as though he believed in them for his soul's guidance, nor do you expect it. All the interest that you have in the conversation would be lost were you to find such faith as that. You would avoid the man, as a pagan. The Stoic doctrine would so shock you, when brought out for <b>real</b> <b>wear,</b> as to make you feel yourself in the company of some mad Atheist--with a man for whose welfare, early or late in life, church bells had never been rung. But with a man who has his Plato simply by heart you can spend the long summer day in sweet conversation. So it is with Cicero. You lie down with him looking out upon the sea at Comæ, or sit with him beneath the plane-tree of Crassus, and listen while he tells you of this doctrine and the other. So Arcesilas may be supposed to have said, and so Carneades laid down the law. It was that and no more. But when he tells you of the place assigned to you in heaven, and how you are to win it, then he is in earnest.|$|E

Fretting wear {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on the wear behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare the wear behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of the <b>real</b> <b>worn</b> area in the wear scar, the change in the wear volume and the maximum wear depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of the wear tests showed that the wear volume and the maximum wear depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the wear scar, it is possible to separate the size of the wear scar from the <b>real</b> <b>worn</b> area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the wear volume has a linear relation with the <b>real</b> <b>worn</b> area rather than the size of the wear scar and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though the wear tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a wear resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the <b>real</b> <b>worn</b> area and the wear behavior at each spring shape...|$|R

Direct or in-situ observation of wear process is supposed to obtain some time-dependent changes and shed more light on the <b>real</b> <b>wear</b> and friction mechanisms. In this paper, X-ray imaging, one of the advanced tools for modern non-contact and non-destructive inspection, was applied to observe in-situ the fretting wear processes of a laser-alloyed coatings and plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings against stainless steel under unlubricated conditions. X-ray images clearly showed the contact nature, the wear process, the formation and compaction of wear debris, spallation of the coatings, large-scale removal of materials, crack formation and propagation, etc. According {{to the analysis of}} X-ray images, the fretting wear process of laser-treated specimens was a combination of adhesive, abrasive, oxidative and delamination wear; and the fretting wear mechanisms for the plasma-sprayed HA coating were mainly delamination and abrasive wear.

The results show that under dry sliding and SBF conditions, the friction coefficient declines with increasing applied load and keeps stable with prolonging sliding time. The friction coefficient of the alloy effectively decreases in SBF as compared to dry sliding due to lubrication caused by SBF. The <b>real</b> <b>wear</b> rates under SBF condition are lower than those under dry sliding condition for each parameter. Nevertheless, the nominal wear rates are higher in SBF which are attributed to the more mass loss caused by corrosion but not wear. Both the nominal wear rate in SBF and the dry sliding wear rate increase with increasing applied load, and they decline firstly and then keep stable with prolonging sliding time. It is concluded that the wear of the alloy is restricted by the SBF, but the corrosion of the alloy is aggravated by the wear...|$|E

The data was tested in Lotens’ model for foot skin temperature prediction. Field {{studies were carried out}} for evaluation of footwear and feet conditions in <b>real</b> <b>wear</b> situation. Heavy winter boots had lowest insulation in toe zone and thin boots had heel zone as the coldest region. Even low sweat rates (3 g/h) can reduce footwear insulation considerably (9 - 19 %). At higher sweat rates (10 g/h) the reduction could be up to about 36 %. Combined effects of sweating, walking and wind could reduce insulation up to about 45 %. Reduction was bigger in warm winter boots. Minimal amount of moisture evaporates from winter footwear during use. Insulation reduction levelled off over longer period of use. The reduction can be calculated by simple equations. The thermal foot model gave similar insulation values as measured on human subjects in thermal comfort. The results from thermal foot model give more useful information on footwear than does the present standard method. The influence of steel toe cap could be related to the "after effect" that probably depends on the thermal inertia of steel toe cap. Recommendations for footwear choice and use are given.

40|$|Ball mills, i. e. {{rotating}} cylindrical drums {{filled with}} a feed material and metal balls, {{also known as the}} charge, are a major category of grinding devices in mineral processing and cement production. Since the grinding process is excessively energy-intensive and aggressive in terms of wear, a profiled and wear-resistant liner is installed in the mill to transfer energy to the grinding charge more efficiently and to protect the mill shell. Because of the harsh environment inside of the mill and the relatively long lifespan of its liner, the optimization of the liner by the classical way, i. e. experimental testing, is a difficult and slow process. In this thesis, a procedure for predicting the charge motion and the power draw of a ball mill based on the discrete element method (DEM) is calibrated and validated by means of photographs of the charge, and power draw measurements of a 1 : 5 -scale laboratory mill, which were kindly provided by the company Magotteaux International S. A.. This computational method essentially renders future experimental testing unnecessary with respect to these characteristics. Based on this first method, a generic process for predicting the wear distribution and the progressive shape evolution of liner surfaces is developed and validated by the wear profiles of the shell liner in the first chamber of a 5. 8 m diameter cement mill monitored during a decade by Magotteaux International S. A.. The energy dissipated by tangential damping defined by the linear spring-slider-damper DEM contact law was found to be the best fitting wear model with respect to the <b>real</b> <b>wear</b> data.

40|$|Present {{standard}} on safety footwear (EN 344) checks the insulation only {{at one point}} in the shoes by means of measuring the temperature change. A method that uses thermal foot model allows to measure footwear insulation simultaneously at various locations and for whole footwear as well. In the present work the method of heated foot model was developed further. It is possible to simulate sweating and evaluate reduction of insulation of footwear due to wetting and evaporative heat loss. The conditions with various sweat rates, wear length and foot motion were tested. Footwear with various insulation levels (from thin rubber boots to thick winter boots) was evaluated. Some footwear was manufactured both with and without steel toe cap and this allowed to study the thermal effect of steel toe cap in different conditions. Comparative studies between various methods (thermal foot model, humans, EN 344) for evaluating footwear thermal properties/insulation were carried out. Field studies were carried out for evaluation of footwear and feet conditions in <b>real</b> <b>wear</b> situation. The insulation of footwear can vary depending on region and insulation level of the footwear. Heavy winter boots had lowest insulation in toe zone and thin boots had heel zone as the coldest region. Sweat rates of 3 g/h can reduce footwear insulation considerably (9 - 19 % depending on initial dry insulation). At higher sweat rates (10 g/h) the reduction could be up to 36 %. Combined effects of sweating, walking and wind could reduce insulation by about 45 %. Reduction was bigger in warm winter boots. Only small amount of moisture evaporates from winter footwear during use. Insulation reduction levelled off over longer periods of use. The reduction can be calculated by simple equations. The thermal foot model gave similar insulation values as measured on human subjects in thermal comfort. The insulation values were used for validation of a mathematical model for foot skin temperature prediction. The results obtained with a thermal foot model give more useful information on footwear than does the present standard for footwear thermal testing. Thus, the thermal foot method is recommended for use as a standard. A steel toe cap in a footwear seems to have no influence on insulation, but may modify the heat losses from the foot. The influence could be related to the “after effect” that probably depends on the mass of steel toe cap and its thermal inertia. Some recommendations for use and choice of footwear are given...|$|E
40|$|Wear is {{traditionally}} measured offline. A new methodology for online detection and monitoring of wear {{has been investigated}} in this thesis. This methodology consists of design of an online wear testing apparatus and development of techniques for online wear detection and monitoring using imaging methods. A simple, cost-effective, laboratory-use apparatus for online wear testing and monitoring was designed, which combines a simplified Pin-on-Disk wear tester and an imaging system. Using the designed wear apparatus, dry sliding wear test for three contact modes (point, line and conforming) can be conducted, meanwhile images of a surface in motion can be acquired in real time. Online wear detection and monitoring can be performed by analyzing a sequence of images of a wearing surface. This wear apparatus offers more accurate results than traditional offline wear measurement instruments {{in the sense of}} neither interrupting the dynamic wear process nor changing wear environment or conditions. Furthermore, it is fast, noncontact, cost effective and easy to operate. Considering the crucial role illumination plays in an imaging system, a fiber optic ring light, according to the choice of illumination strategy, was chosen as a proper illuminator for the imaging system, under which the wear features of interest were revealed. An illumination model and reflectance model were then developed for ring light illumination. Both models were numerically evaluated and validated by experiments. Good agreement was found between the models and measurements. A wear process alters surface parameters, and results in changes of surface radiance, image irradiance and image texture thereafter. The proposed models helped to interpret wear patterns present on the specimen’s surface images and provided theoretical basis for detection and monitoring of wear by analyzing image sequences. Wear detection on machined surfaces can be regarded as a texture segmentation problem. Two filtering approaches, namely unsupervised detection scheme using multichannel Gabor filters and supervised detection scheme using optimized filters were developed for online wear detection. Both approaches can successfully detect wear patterns present on textured surfaces, machined surfaces for instance. Experiments conducted on various <b>real</b> <b>wear</b> samples confirmed the usefulness of these two approaches. Monitoring of a dynamic wear process can be conducted by analyzing a sequence of images from a wearing surface. Wear behavior of an ad hoc dry sliding wear process was investigated under different operating conditions. Fractal analysis technique was also applied to estimate the state of wear in dry sliding situation. Experimental results showed that fractal values, namely fractal dimensions and vertical intercepts computed from power spectra of a sequence of images of a wearing surface are potential good indicators of state of wear...|$|E
