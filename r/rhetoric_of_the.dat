5|$|During Modi's {{second term}} the <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed {{the influence of}} Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution {{inspired}} many Irishmen {{to fight}} for similar principles of liberty, equality, and brotherhood in their own nation; liberty in this context largely meant independence from Great Britain. With these goals in mind, in 1791 Dublin lawyer Wolfe Tone founded the Society of United Irishmen. Allying itself with the French Republic, the society was suppressed by the British authorities and forced to go underground when war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793. Tone and other members secretly travelled to France to convince the French National Convention to invade Ireland. Such an invasion, they argued, could rely on support from large numbers of Irish irregulars, and if successful would strike a severe blow to the British war effort—perhaps even severe enough to force Britain to seek peace.|$|E

In this paper {{we are concerned}} only with <b>the</b> second <b>of</b> these arts, namely, <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> preaching. Though <b>the</b> perceptive treatises on <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> preaching, <b>the</b> so-called artes praedicandi, did not originate before the thirteenth century, pulpit rhetoric was very much alive in <b>the</b> earlier part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages and fine examples {{of this kind of}} eloquence can be quoted...|$|R

25|$|The {{painting}} has a chromatic harmony that {{is incredibly}} rich, expressive and radiant.

The Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story.

25|$|Revolutionary {{nationalism}} {{reflected the}} heritage and <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military reformist regimes of the past, {{as well as}} the spirit of the 1952 Revolution. It also showed the influence of the Peruvian government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. Many Bolivian officers believed that the military had to intervene in politics to lead the country toward reform because civilian governments had failed in that undertaking. They were convinced that it was in the main interest of the armed forces to end underdevelopment, which they saw as the cause of insurgency. The military would therefore fight on the internal frontiers against social injustice and economic dependence.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the fourth}} direct {{election}} for the President of the Republic of China. The two candidates were Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh and Kuomintang (KMT) nominee Ma Ying-jeou. The KMT ticket was officially formed as of June 23, 2007, with Ma announcing his choice for running mate to be former premier Vincent Siew. The DPP ticket was announced in August, 2007, with Frank Hsieh selecting former Premier Su Tseng-chang. Unlike the 2004 presidential election, the political <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaigns {{tended to focus on}} economic issues and government corruption rather than national identity and the political status of Taiwan, with both candidates endorsing the status quo in the short term. But much like previous elections, this election was also marked with island-wide mass rallies and much political mudslinging.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes {{freedom from}} many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E

25|$|While Dutch {{portrait}} painting {{avoids the}} swagger and excessive <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aristocratic Baroque portraiture current {{in the rest}} of 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting en masse, as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 1989, the Supreme Council of the Moldavian SSR adopted Moldovan as {{the only}} {{official}} language with Russian retained only for secondary purposes, returned Moldovan to the Latin alphabet, and declared a shared Moldovan-Romanian linguistic identity. As plans for major cultural changes in Moldova were made public, tensions rose further. Ethnic minorities felt threatened by the prospects of removing Russian as the official language, which served as the medium of interethnic communication, and by the possible future reunification of Moldova and Romania, {{as well as the}} ethnocentric <b>rhetoric</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Popular Front. The Yedinstvo (Unity) Movement, established by the Slavic population of Moldova, pressed for equal status to be given to both Russian and Moldovan. Transnistria's ethnic and linguistic composition differed significantly from {{most of the rest of}} Moldova. The share of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians was especially high and an overall majority of the population, some of them ethnic Moldovans, spoke Russian as a mother tongue. Ethnic Moldovans accounted for less than 40% of Transnistria's population in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft applies this feminist {{critique}} to Burke's language {{throughout the}} Reflections.

She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer.
