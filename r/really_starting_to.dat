500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman. Goldsman was [...] "attracted" [...] to the series because he believed that at the time, Fringes [...] "mythology was already <b>really</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> hum". [...] "Bad Dreams" [...] was his first writing credit for a television episode, and he wrote several hours of material before co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner helped him condense it. Every episode since [...] "Bad Dreams", Goldsman has been credited as a consulting producer. It marked the first episode with previous Fringe director Brad Anderson now also credited as a producer.|$|E
500|$|Abby West, of Entertainment Weekly, {{praised the}} {{interactions}} between characters {{as some of the}} highlights of the episode, stating [...] "Jim is the show's salt — he makes everyone else seem just a little better. He's the perfect straight man to showcase Michael's insanity..." [...] West also commented on the awkwardness of the relationship between Ryan and Kelly, stating that [...] "Speaking of weird love connections, I'm <b>really</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> worry about Ryan, who's now letting crazy Kelly force-feed him. What happened to him?" [...] Mat Brewster, of BlogCritics Magazine, felt that the episode didn't live up to the status set by the previous episode [...] "Gay Witch Hunt", stating [...] "this week’s episode, “The Convention,” {{failed to live up to}} my expectations." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} round of the competition, Berg {{attempted}} another jump but was not as fortunate this time: he fell out of the air, just as before, and crashed almost identically to Findeisen. One of Berg's skis, which had come loose after impact and was still attached to his foot, flailed around and hit him in the face – exposed due to his goggles detaching – as he was sliding to a stop. His injuries, including concussion and a broken ACL, were career-ending. At this point, Trautwig began calling into question the nature of the sport: [...] "Jeff, we talk about the fear and why the ski flyers are scared... I'm <b>really</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> ask, why we're here and why they're doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's <b>really</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd's rampant {{popularity}} intruded on Howarth's life. [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> frustrate {{me because}} I can't {{just go to}} work anymore," [...] he said. He stopped {{doing a lot of}} press interviews after female fans screamed [...] "Rape me, Todd" [...] at fan events, and because of his disagreement with Todd's redemption arc. His comings-and-goings from time to time throughout the years, even though the role of Todd had been re-cast with St. John, were greeted with anticipation, excitement, and speculation from the fans. At one point in 2000, Howarth returned for a week, accompanied by significant fanfare, in order to assist with the departure of Florencia Lozano (Teá). During the ten years he was on the show, rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by the soap opera press.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. TV Squad's Jane Boursaw called the episode's case [...] "an interesting premise" [...] and {{was pleased that}} [...] "things are really, <b>REALLY</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> {{come together in a}} big way, which is good, considering that the finale is fast approaching". Annalee Newitz of io9 declared it to be [...] "one of the most rewarding episodes ever for people who love the show's mythology," [...] and found Olivia's universe-hopping ability to be [...] "truly cool". Newitz concluded that [...] "this was a truly awesome episode with a lot of payoff {{for those of us who}} have been glued to the set every Tuesday night, looking for answers." [...] The website later listed [...] "The Road Not Taken" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. Television Without Pity graded the episode with a A-.|$|E

500|$|Ahsan Haque of IGN rated [...] "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] a 9/10, while rating [...] "Lois Kills Stewie" [...] a 9.4/10, saying [...] "For the {{hundredth}} episode of Family Guy, Seth McFarlane and friends tackle {{the subject of}} one of Stewie Griffin's greatest ambitions— his not-so-secret desire to kill his mother. For the disturbed fans waiting for some form of a matricidal manifestation, you can feel comfort knowing, without spoiling too much, that the youngest Griffin absolutely means business and ensures that he doesn't fail this time around. [...] There are some tense courtroom moments, a birthday celebration with the gift of Lionel Richie, a cruise ship, machine guns, and the reappearance of the Kool Aid Man that help round out this carefully crafted and well-told cohesive storyline. With the amount of cheap manatee jokes kept to a reasonable level, this episode also manages to find an excellent balance between comedy and storytelling. It's a fantastic way to celebrate the Family Guy one-hundredth episode milestone. [...] With the writers' strike in full effect, it seems {{that this might be}} the last new episode of Family Guy we'll be seeing for a while. It's a bittersweet way to end the abruptly short season as the quality is reminiscent of the series' brilliance from the early years and it seems like the show was <b>really</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> hit its stride for the season. Hopefully the series will be able {{to live up to the}} high bar set by this two-part classic upon its eventual return." ...|$|E

[...] "And once we jumped off the side, there was another explosion to a lesser degree." [...] At the very rear, passengers said they felt only a small jolt.

2500|$|In {{reaction}} to these hardships, Waits recorded Small Change (1976) which finds {{him in a}} much more cynical and pessimistic mood, with songs such as [...] "The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me) (An Evening with Pete King)" [...] and [...] "Bad Liver and a Broken Heart (In Lowell)". With the album, Waits asserted that he [...] "tried to resolve a few things as far as this cocktail lounge, maudlin, crying-in-your-beer image that I have. There ain't nothin' funny about a drunk ... I was <b>really</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> believe that there was something amusing and wonderfully American about being a drunk. I ended up telling myself to cut that shit out." [...] The album also included [...] "Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)"; it featured jazz drummer Shelly Manne and was heavily influenced by jazz, like his previous albums.|$|E
