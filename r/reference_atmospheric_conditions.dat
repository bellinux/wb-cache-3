40|$|From {{the health}} stand-point, {{atmospheric}} particulate matter (PM) is regulated through PM 10 and PM 2. 5 conventions by the Directive 2008 / 50 /EC. The Directive points out the negative impact on human health due to PM 2. 5 and recognizes that no threshold has been identified for such pollutant at which no risk is foreseen for the population. Then, {{the goal is to}} pursue a general reduction of PM 2. 5. Traditionally, the analytical techniques used to monitor the PM water-soluble inorganic ionic fraction involve filter-based procedures to collect, process, and analyze samples. Data obtained, while accurate, lack temporal resolution. Time resolution is required on the time-scale of the evolution of the planetary boundary layer to understand the processes that govern transport and transformation of atmospheric aerosol. In this paper, we investigated PM 2. 5 nitrite, nitrate, sulfate, chloride, sodium, ammonium, calcium, and magnesium ions using a URG 9000 -D aerosol ion monitor with 1 -h time-resolution and detection limit of 0. 1 µg/m 3.

Conventional flight-test calibration techniques are briefly reviewed and meteorological analysis methods for estimating calibration <b>reference</b> values of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> are described. There are cases where some conventional in-flight techniques are not entirely satisfactory for research aircraft because of added equipment requirements or flight envelope and location limitations. In these cases, atmospheric wind and pressure information can be used to complement conventional techniques. Accuracy of the atmospheric measurements and the variability of upper-air winds and pressure values are discussed. Results from several flight research aircraft show that wind reference calibration is generally less accurate than calibration accuracy standards for civil and research aircraft. Examples of pressure reference altimetry derived from meteorological analyses are also presented for a variety of flight research programs. These flight data show that the reference pressure accuracy provided by meteorological analyses is usually within civil aircraft and flight research airdata calibration accuracy standards. Meteorological analyses altimetry is particularly useful when it is not feasible to restrict the test airplane altitude, location, or maneuver envelope...|$|R

The ATCRBS antenna, which is typically mounted above the primary-radar antenna, has a fan-beam pattern with a horizontal beam width of 2 " to 3 ". The scan rate is 4. 8 s for a sensor used at an airport terminal, and 10 s to 12 s elsewhere. Civil ATCRBS transponders accept two types of interrogations. Mode A has an 8 -ps PPto-P 3 spacing and elicits a 20. 3 -ps reply that contains one of 4, 096 pilot-entered identity codes. Mode C has a 2 1 -ps PI-to-P 3 spacing and elicits a similar reply that contains the aircraft's barometric altitude <b>referenced</b> to standard <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions.</b> The purpose of the P 2 pulse is described in the following section. ATCRBS nansrnit Sidelobe Suppression At short ranges, an antenna's signal strength may be high enough that transponders are interrogated via leakage through the antenna sidelobes. For control of this phenomenon, aircraft in the antenna-sidelobe regions are prevented from replying by a technique known as transmit sidelobe suppression (SLS), illustrated in Fig. 2. In transmit SLS, the P 2 pulse of the interrogation is transmitted from an omnidirectional antenna at a slightly higher power level than the interrogator power produced by the antenna sidelobes. Transponders are designed to reply only if the received P, pulse is greater than the received P 2 pulse. Note that this condition is not satisfied in the antenna-sidelobe regions...|$|R
40|$|A problem exists when {{applying}} {{a set of}} ground training signatures determined under one <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> to the same area under another <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition.</b> Sometimes the training signatures need to be adapted to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> of the subject area before classification.

The model is a combination of a doubling I model, which describes the effects of molecular and aerosol scattering in the atmosphere, and a scaling-approximation absorption model which takes into account the gaseous absorption due to oxygen, ozone and water vapor in the LANDSAT- 1 spectral region. The model indicates that atmospheric effects can be approximated by linear transforms.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aerodynamic}} {{mechanisms that}} produce swing, and reverse swing in cricket are well understood and the phenomenon {{has often been}} measured in wind tunnel tests. However, {{it is widely believed}} throughout the cricketing community that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> can have a dramatic effect on a bowler's ability to make the ball swing, and this has perplexed the minds of sports engineers for decades. A sophisticated trajectory model was developed to investigate how different <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> affect the swing of a cricket ball, and similar to previous studies, humidity was found to have no effect. Previous studies have suggested that certain <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> may actually change the geometry of the cricket ball thereby exaggerating the asymmetric air flow around its body and thus increase the swing force. This hypothesis was tested by conditioning cricket balls inside an atmospheric chamber and then accurately measuring their geometry with a 3 D laser scanner. The mass of the balls were also measured through the range of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions.</b> It was found that the mass of a ball can change in different playing <b>conditions,</b> but no <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> could cause a significant change to the ball geometry. It was concluded {{that if there is a}} real effect of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> on cricket ball swing it must be caused by an entirely different mechanism.
