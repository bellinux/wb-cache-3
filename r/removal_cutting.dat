The research covered three types of treatment: late thinning, <b>removal</b> <b>cutting</b> in openings and clear cutting in openings. The average skidding distance was between 120 and 250 m. In the clear-cut stands, a mean duration of a skidding cycle accounted for 12 minutes, while in the thinned ones it was longer, lasting ca. 16 minutes. The investigators performed an estimate of parameters of multiple regression models, which revealed dependences between: Þ duration of skidding cycles and stand conditions, number of logs per load and skidding distance, and Þ productivity achieved in specific skidding cycles and the above-mentioned variables, as well as wood volume per load. The highest productivity within the productive work time of a skidder was recorded in the stand where <b>removal</b> <b>cutting</b> in openings was performed; it exceeded 14 m 3 ×h- 1. In other stands, the efficiency was lower, not greater than 9 m 3 ×h- 1.

40|$|This is an {{accepted}} manuscript {{of an article}} published by Taylor & Francis in Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research in 2014, available online: [URL] studied the effects of different cutting intensities (0 %, 5 - 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % basal area removal) on stand growth, structure, and net carbon storage in spruce-fir (Picea asperata Mast. -Abies fabri Mast. Craib) and broadleaf mixed forests on Changbai Mountain (Northeast China) over 19 years. At this site, inventory-based low-intensity selection cutting was used to maintain a continuous forest canopy. After two cutting events, results showed significant differences in growth, structure, and carbon storage among cutting intensities. When increasing cutting intensity, {{the growth rate of}} average diameter, basal area, and volume significantly increased, with the highest increment rates found in the plots with 20 % basal area removal. Tree diameters for all plots showed a roughly inverse J-shaped distribution before cutting and a left-skewed unimodal distribution after two cuttings. Volume ratio (the relative amount of volume contained in different diameter classes) for small (6 - 14 cm), medium (14 - 26 cm), large (26 - 36 cm), and very large (> 38 cm) diameters remained unchanged in the plots with 5 and 10 % basal area removal, but increased in the plots with 15 and 20 % basal area removal, reaching approximately a 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 ratio in the plots with 20 % basal area removal after two selection cuttings. Net carbon storage increased when increasing cutting intensity, reaching maximum storage in the plots with 20 % basal area <b>removal</b> (<b>cutting</b> intensity and net C storage increase: 0 %, 7. 21 Mg C ha- 1, 5 - 10 %: 11. 68 Mg C ha- 1, 15 %: 21. 41 Mg C ha- 1, 20 %: 26. 47 Mg C ha- 1).

40|$|Oriental {{bittersweet}} (Celastrus orbiculatus) is an introduced liana (woody vine) {{that has}} invaded {{much of the}} Eastern United States and is expanding west into the Great Plains. In forests, it can girdle and damage canopy trees. At Indiana Dunes, we have discovered that it is invading non-forested dune habitats as well. Anecdotal evidence suggests that fire might facilitate its spread, but the relationship between fire and this aggressive invader is poorly understood. We investigated four areas important to fire management of oriental bittersweet, each of which we will briefly summarize here. 1) What fire temperatures cause seed mortality? For seeds, temperatures above 140 °C for three minute or more kills the embryo. For fruits, temperatures above 140 °C kill the seeds inside after five minutes. While oriental bittersweet fruits ripen in October and November, the seeds are not dispersed until later {{in the early to}} mid December. Thus fall fires will not have any impact on the seeds unless perhaps if they are near the ground. Late winter and early spring fires are likely to kill seeds in the top litter at least. Thus spring fire can reduce the pool of seeds available to germinate. 2) Does fire modify habitat susceptibility to invasion? We found that post fire environment had no effect on the emergence and survival of oriental bittersweet, except that the tallest plants, after two years since sowing, were in the control plots. Highest establishment occurred in mesic silt loam prairie and oak forest. Survival was greatest in mesic prairie and greatest biomass occurred in the oak forest. 3) Both fire and cutting can cause oriental bittersweet to resprout and root sucker. Does the resprouting response differ between these two treatments and can a combination of cutting and pre- or post-fire treatment facilitate its <b>removal?</b> <b>Cutting</b> sometimes increased stem density between one and two times, but burning increased density by two or more times depending on the maximum fire temperature and duration. Cutting in early July reduced total nonstructural carbohydrates by 50 % from normal July levels and 75 % below dormant season levels. Thus burning established populations will only serve to increase their local density. 4) How does oriental bittersweet abundance vary with fire regime and can we predict the abundance of this species in a fire mosaic landscape based on fire return interval and time since last fire? At the landscape scale, we can predict the presence and abundance of oriental bittersweet, but have less success predicting its cover and distribution. The presence of oriental bittersweet was significantly negatively influenced by canopy closure, burn frequency, and distance to roads and railroads. In plots where C. orbiculatus was present, abundance was significantly greater in plots with low to moderate burn frequency, and marginally (p = 0. 056) lower in plots with greater canopy cover. Both cover and distribution of C. orbiculatus was not significantly affected by the measured variables. These results suggest the frequent fire may be effective in preventing the establishment of oriental bittersweet...|$|E

40|$|Bud <b>removal</b> of the <b>cuttings</b> at {{underground}} {{level has}} been claimed by cassava growers in Thailand {{as a method}} to increase cassava yield. This practise should be tested experimentally to explain the reason for yield increase. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of bud <b>removal</b> and <b>cutting</b> length on storage root yield and starch content of three cassava varieties. Field experiment was conducted in a split–split plot design with four replications in 2010 and 2011, under rainfed conditions. Three cassava varieties (KU 50, RY 9 and HB 60) were assigned as main plot. Two cutting lengths (15 cm and 30 cm) were assigned as sub plots, and two treatments of buds (buds cut and not cut) were assigned as sub–sub plots. The buds on the cuttings that were inserted into the soil were removed. In 2010, the plants from 15 -cm long cuttings subjected to bud removal had higher fresh storage root yield (88. 4 Mg ha− 1) than did plants from 30 -cm long cuttings subjected to bud removal (75. 8 Mg ha− 1). Cutting of buds also had higher fresh storage root yield (89. 1 Mg ha− 1) than did non bud-cutting (75. 0 Mg ha− 1). KU 50 had the highest fresh storage root yield (91. 4 Mg ha− 1), dry root yield (48. 4 Mg ha− 1) and starch yield (20. 1 Mg ha− 1). Cutting length of 15 cm had higher starch concentration in storage roots (25. 6 %) than did cutting length of 30 cm (24. 2 %). HB 60 had the highest starch concentration (27. 0 %) among cassava varieties tested. The data in 2011 were similar to the data in 2010.
