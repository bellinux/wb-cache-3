40|$|Retrotransposons are mobile genetic {{elements}} that populate chromosomes, where the host largely controls their activities. In plants and mammals, retrotransposons are transcriptionally silenced by DNA methylation, which in Arabidopsis is propagated at CG dinucleotides by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET 1). In met 1 mutants, however, mobilization of retrotransposons is not observed, despite their transcriptional activation. A post-transcriptional mechanism therefore {{seems to be}} preventing retrotransposition.

Evadé (EVD) <b>reinsertions</b> caused a series of developmental mutations that allowed its identification. Genetic testing of host control of the EVD life cycle showed that transcriptional suppression occurred by CG methylation supported by RNA-directed DNA methylation. On transcriptional reactivation, subsequent steps of the EVD cycle were inhibited by plant-specific RNA polymerase IV/V and the histone methyltransferase KRYPTONITE (KYP). Moreover, genome resequencing demonstrated retrotransposition of EVD but no other potentially active retroelements when this combination of epigenetic mechanisms was compromised. Our results demonstrate that epigenetic control of retrotransposons extends beyond transcriptional suppression and can be individualized for particular elements...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the first}} part of this thesis was to {{determine}} the optimal feeding strategy after pancreatoduodenectomy. The available nutritional guidelines give conflicting recommendations and are all based on studies after major gastrointestinal surgery for cancer in general. We systematically reviewed the available literature regarding five different feeding strategies after pancreatoduodenectomy; oral diet, enteral nutrition via either a nasoenteral-, gastrojejunostomy or jejunostomy tube and total parenteral nutrition. Based on the available literature there seemed to be no evidence to support routine enteral or parenteral nutrition after pancreatoduodenectomy. In addition, our retrospective cohort study demonstrated that each feeding strategy including enteral or parenteral nutrition is associated with specific complications such as tube dislodgement, bowel strangulation and infections. Based on these findings we concluded that early oral feeding may be the preferred routine feeding strategy after pancreatoduodenectomy and designed an observational cohort study to evaluate whether a change in the routine feeding strategy from nasoenteral tube feeding to early oral feeding improved clinical outcomes. No negative impact of early oral feeding on postoperative morbidity was seen, while the time to resumption of adequate oral intake and length of hospital stay significantly decreased. This led us to conclude that early oral feeding with on-demand tube feeding is the feeding strategy of choice after pancreatoduodenectomy. Our study in patients at high risk of requiring postoperative tube feeding (i. e. with preoperative symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction (i. e. vomiting, dysphagia, nausea, loss of appetite and postprandial complaints) also showed no benefits of routine tube feeding. Up to 50 percent of patients within an oral feeding strategy ultimately require postoperative tube feeding via a nasoenteral feeding tube on-demand, because they do not tolerate oral feeding. Nasoenteral feeding tubes are typically placed endoscopically by gastroenterologists, which is bothersome for both patients and caregivers. In the second part of this thesis we aimed to investigate whether the task of nasoenteral feeding tube placement can be shifted from gastroenterologists at endoscopy departments to nurses at the patient’s bedside through the use of an electromagnetic guided tube placement system. We systematically reviewed the literature regarding nasoenteral feeding tube placement and reviewed our own retrospective data and concluded that bedside electromagnetic guided placement did not differ from endoscopic placement regarding feasibility and safety in critically ill or surgical patients with an unaltered upper gastrointestinal anatomy. Our subsequent prospective pilot study in patients with an altered anatomy after pancreatoduodenectomy demonstrated decreased success rates for both electromagnetic guided and endoscopic feeding tube placement. In the CORE trial, a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we aimed to determine non-inferiority of electromagnetic guided placement in terms of efficacy and to objectify the suggested advantages (e. g. logistics, patient discomfort and costs) compared with endoscopic placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes in surgical patients. Our results established non-inferiority of electromagnetic guided placement in terms of <b>reinsertions</b> and demonstrated logistical advantages and reduced overall healthcare costs, which led us to conclude that electromagnetic guidance may be considered the preferred technique for nasoenteral feeding tube placement...|$|R
40|$|Many {{real world}} data {{naturally}} arrive as rapid paced and virtually unbounded streams. Examples of such streams include network traffic at a router, events observed by a sensor network, accesses to a web server and transactional updates {{to a large}} database. Such streaming data need to be monitored online to collect traffic statistics, detect trends and anomalies, tune system performance and help make business decisions. However, {{because of the large}} size and rapid pace of the data, as well as the online processing requirement, conventional data processing methods, such as storing the data in a database and issuing offline SQL queries thereafter, are not feasible. Data stream processing is a new diagram of massive data set processing and creates new challenges in the algorithm design and implementation. In this thesis, we consider time-decayed data aggregation for data streams, where the importance or contribution of each data element decays over time, since recent data are usually considered of more importance in applications, and therefore are given heavier weights. We design small space data structures and algorithms for maintaining fundamental aggregates of the streams if it is possible and otherwise show large space lower bounds. We consider the data aggregation over a robust data stream model called asynchronous data stream, motivated by the streaming data transmitted in distributed systems, including computer networks, where the asynchrony in the data transmission is inevitable. In asynchronous data stream, the arrival order of the data elements at the receiver side is not necessarily the same as the order in which the data elements were generated. Asynchronous data stream is a robuster and generalized model of the previous synchronous data stream model. In summary, this thesis presents the following results: 1. We formalize the model of asynchronous data stream and the notion of timestamp sliding window. We propose the first small space sketch for summarizing the data elements over timestamp sliding windows of multiple geographically distributed asynchronous data streams. The sketch can return accuracy guaranteed estimates for basic aggregates, such as: Sum, Median and Quantiles. 2. We design the first small space sketch for general purpose network streaming data aggregation. The sketch has the following properties that make it useful in communication-efficient aggregation in distributed streaming scenarios: (1) The sketch can handle multiple geographically distributed asynchronous data streams. (2) The sketch is duplicate-insensitive, i. e. <b>reinsertions</b> of the same data will not affect the sketch, and hence the estimates of aggregates. (3) The sketch is also time-decaying, so that the weight of each data element summarized in the sketch decreases over time. (4) The sketch returns accuracy guaranteed estimates for a variety of core aggregates, including the sum, median, quantiles, frequent elements and selectivity. 3. We conduct a comprehensive study on the time-decayed correlated data aggregation over asynchronous data streams. For each class of time decay function, we either propose space efficient algorithms or show large space lower bounds. We not only closes the open problem of correlated data aggregation under sliding windows decay, but also presents negative results for the case of exponential decay, which however is highly used in the non-correlated scenarios. 4. We propose the forward decay model to simplify the time-decayed data stream aggregation and sampling. Forward decay captures a variety of usual decay functions (or called backward decay), such as exponential decay. We design efficient algorithms for data aggregation and sampling under the forward decay model, and show that they are easy to implement scalably...|$|R
