50|$|A {{thriving}} {{3rd party}} market for AppleTalk devices {{developed over the}} next few years. One particularly notable example was an alternate adaptor designed by BMUG and commercialized by Farallon as PhoneNet in 1987. This was essentially a replacement for Apple's connector that had conventional phone jacks instead of Apple's <b>round</b> <b>connectors.</b> PhoneNet allowed AppleTalk networks to be connected together using normal telephone wires, and with very little extra work, could run analog phones and AppleTalk on a single four-conductor phone cable.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, Perilex {{connectors}} {{have been}} standardised by DIN. The 16-ampere version is DIN 49445 (socket) and DIN 49446 (plug) and the 25-ampere version is DIN 49447 (socket) and DIN 49448 (plug). It did replace an earlier flat 4-pin connector (3 phases and neutral) that was standardized in DIN 49450 / DIN 49451. The earlier flat connector did {{continue to exist}} in East Germany - after German reunification, all machinery was required to be rebuilt to <b>round</b> <b>connectors</b> until 1998.|$|R
50|$|In May 2011 CO2 Smart has {{completed}} a fast recharge network in test city Perth. Electromotive has provided 11 dual-headed IEC-compatible fast-charge stations at 32A {{to be used}} with the CO2 Smart of the test fleet. In the test drive the European connectors have been preferred over the American connectors since Australia (like Europe) does have three-phase power (at 415V) in most home locations. The fast-charge outlets connect with a special 8-pin IEC-compatible <b>round</b> <b>connector</b> integrating single-phase and three-phase power The project of the University of Western Australia was continued with 23 public charging stations available by September 2012 featuring Type 2 connectors at 32 A.|$|E
50|$|Tandy 1000 used a {{proprietary}} 6-pin female <b>round</b> <b>connector</b> for the joystick port {{that on the}} SX/TX was adjacent to the keyboard port {{in the front of}} the computer. As with the keyboard, it was compatible with the older TRS-80 and Tandy color computer models. It was not compatible with the IBM standard 15-pin male game port and required a Tandy 1000 compatible joystick. Some PC-DOS games would not work with it, but most games made to work with Tandy 1000 graphics and sound do work. The Tandy 1000 mouse also fit in the game port. The Tandy 1000 mouse is not compatible with 9-pin serial or PS/2 mouse port, and some DOS software will not work with it, though Tandy 1000 specific software like deskmate does work.|$|E
50|$|The VT1000 and VT1200 was {{packaged}} in a pizza box {{case with the}} monitor normally sitting on top and an LK400 series keyboard connected to it using a coiled cord and 4-pin modular connector. The three-button mouse was roughly puck-shaped, not unlike the original iMac mouse, and used a custom 7-pin <b>round</b> <b>connector.</b> The back panel included a coax connector for the monitor, mouse and keyboard ports, a Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) serial port for a printer, another MMJ serial port for host connections, and a thinwire Ethernet connector. It also included AC in and out connectors, the latter used to connect the monitor, allowing it to be turned on and off with the terminal using a single switch located {{on the side of}} the case beside the power connectors. The system supported a number of monochrome monitors, selected using a rotary switch beside the monitor port.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{screw-on}} <b>round</b> microphone <b>connectors,</b> {{there is}} little standardization among manufacturers, and even among different models from the same manufacturer, leading to significant interoperability problems when connecting non-OEM or homebrew microphones and other equipment.|$|R
50|$|The CARB {{regulation}} of 2001 mandated {{the usage of}} SAE J1772-2001 beginning with the 2006 model year. Later requirements asked for higher currents to be used than the Avcon connector could provide. This process led to the proposal of a new <b>round</b> <b>connector</b> design by Yazaki which allows for an increased power delivery of up to 19.2 kW delivered via single phase 120-240 V AC at up to 80 amperes. In 2008 the CARB published a draft amendment to section 1962.2 Title 13 that mandated the usage of the oncoming SAE J1772 standard beginning with the 2010 model year.; this was approved in 2012.The Yazaki plug that was built to the new SAE J1772 plug standard successfully completed certification at UL. The standard specification was subsequently voted upon by the SAE committee in July 2009. On January 14, 2010 the SAE J1772 REV 2009 {{was adopted by the}} SAE Motor Vehicle Council. The companies participating in or supporting the revised -2009 standard include Smart, Chrysler, GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Tesla.|$|E
40|$|In the cold-formed steel {{sections}} scope, {{the use of}} {{a composite}} steel and concrete solution is still premature, making necessary a higher degree of structural behaviour investigation and the adequacy of the theoretical solutions proposed. A non-conventional lightweight composite system was investigated. Formed by hat-shaped beams filled with concrete, the connection with the slab was done by means of two solutions: arc-shaped flat bars and arc-shaped <b>round</b> <b>connector</b> bars welded to the section. An analysis was conducted for evaluation of the structural behaviour in the steel and concrete interface by push-out tests, and tests in simple two points supported beams for evaluation of the bending strength. The shear connectors showed ductility and resistance compatible with the analysed composite beams and the stiffness and bending resistance responses for the given condition of full interaction showed that the full section plasticisation consideration describes with precision the structural behaviour of the proposed system...|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} models of contact {{problems}} about connectors of buttress and round threads of casing were established with the elasto-plastic FEM of ANSYS software. Under the three flank angles 30, 50 and 100 for the buttress casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. With the three tapers 1 / 14, 1 / 16 and 1 / 17, for the round casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. At the same time, the jump-out process of the buttress and round thread connectors was studied, respectively. The average jump-out force of the buttress connector is 594. 1 ton, and however, the average jump-out force of the <b>round</b> <b>connector</b> is 342. 5 ton. That is to say, under the same casing and the same casing size, the connector of the buttress thread {{is not so easy}} to jump out, but the connector of the round thread is very easy to jump out. It provides the theoretical supports for the selection of the casing connectors in the extra-deep well and complex well...|$|E
50|$|The LaserWriter {{was also}} the first {{peripheral}} to use the LocalTalk connector and Apple’s unified <b>round</b> AppleTalk <b>Connector</b> Family, which allowed any variety of mechanical networking systems to be plugged into the ports on the computers or printers. A common solution was the 3rd party PhoneNet which used conventional telephone cables for networking.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{original}} Apple Mouse IIc was compatible across all platforms, Apple renamed the mouse in 1985 and offered {{it as an}} optional purchase for all computers and separate from the Apple II interface card. It featured an updated mechanism and the new uniform <b>rounded</b> cable <b>connector.</b> Apple would briefly reuse this name later for a re-badged Apple Pro Mouse.|$|R
50|$|Tandy 1000, SX, TX used a {{proprietary}} 8-pin <b>round</b> Din <b>connector</b> for the keyboard port that was {{compatible with the}} older TRS computers but not compatible with the IBM PC/AT or PS/2 standard. The SL/TL series were more compatible with IBM PS/2 keyboard and mouse standard.There are some scanline codes that differed between the Tandy 1000 and IBM PC/XT and at that can result in compatibility issues. Northgate offered a Tandy 1000 compatible keyboard.|$|R

In typical connection, O-ring squeezed between two surfaces having inward-opening slants of 5 degrees or 10 degrees. Slanted surfaces force ring inward, compressing it around tube. Connector metal fitting, tightened by hand around O-ring, seals O-ring against tube {{as much as}} 1 / 16 in. out of <b>round.</b> Modified <b>connectors</b> seal glass or ceramic tubes against gas or vacuum leakage in furnaces, vacuum systems, and tubes for glassblowing equipment...|$|R
50|$|German {{companies}} have proposed the VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 standard as an implementation of IEC 62196 in IEC proposal 62196-2-X. It uses the <b>round</b> seven-pin Mennekes <b>connector</b> {{to deliver up}} to 63 A three-phase (at 400 V in Central Europe). This connector has been chosen by several European automakers for prototype electric vehicles. It will also be extended with DC wires into a Combo Coupler variant.|$|R
5000|$|In {{most moving}} magnet designs, the stylus itself is {{detachable}} {{from the rest}} of the cartridge so it can easily be replaced. There are three primary types of cartridge mounts. The most common type is attached using two small screws to a headshell which then plugs into the tonearm, while another is a standardized [...] "P-mount" [...] or [...] "T4P" [...] cartridge (invented by Technics in 1980 and adopted by other manufacturers) that plugs directly into the tonearm. Many P-mount cartridges come with adapters to allow them to be mounted to a headshell. The third type is used mainly in cartridges designed for DJ use and it has a standard <b>round</b> headshell <b>connector.</b> Some mass market turntables use a proprietary integrated cartridge which cannot be upgraded.|$|R
40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, <b>round</b> cable <b>connector.</b> The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking sleeve, a collet-locking nut, and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R
50|$|The Teleputer was a {{range of}} {{computers}} that were suffixed with a number. Only the Teleputer 1 and Teleputer 3 were manufactured and sold. The teleputer 1 was a very simple device and only worked as a teletex terminal, whereas the Teleputer 3 was a z80 based micro computer. It ran {{with a pair of}} single sided 5¼ inch floppy disk drive; a 20Mb Hard disk drive version was available {{towards the end of the}} product's life. The operating system was CP/M or a proprietary variant CP*, and the unit was supplied with a suite of applications, consisting of a word processor, spreadsheet, database and a semi-compiled basic programming language. The display supplied with the unit (both the Teleputer 1 and 3) was a modified Rediffusion 14 inch portable colour television, with the tuner circuitry removed and being driven by a RGB input. The unit had a 64Kb onboard memory which could be expanded to 128Kb with a plug in card. Graphics were the standard videotext (or teletext) resolution and colour, but a high resolution graphic card was also available. A 75/1200 baud modem was fitted as standard (could also run at 300/300 and 1200/1200), and connected to the telephone via an old style <b>round</b> telephone <b>connector.</b> In addition an IEEE interface card could be fitted. On the back of the unit there was a RS232 and Centronic connections and on the front was the connector for the keyboard.|$|R
40|$|Obtaining ideal {{prosthetic}} framework {{design is}} at times hindered by anatomical limitations in the posterior region that might {{increase the risk}} for zirconia restoration fracture. Modification such as increasing the bulk thickness especially in the connector region could result in strengthening the zirconia framework. Three-unit zirconia fixed partial dentures replacing mandibular molars were fabricated using the following two techniques: CAD/CAM technology and manual copy milling. Modified framework with unveneered full thickness connectors were designed and fabricated with the aforementioned methods. Conventional frameworks (0. 5 mm thick with <b>rounded</b> 3 mm <b>connectors)</b> served as control (N = 20). After cementation on epoxy dies, the frameworks were loaded to fracture in a universal testing machine. Fractured surfaces were prepared for examination using scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in fracture resistance between conventional and modified framework design for both fabrication techniques tested. SEM examination indicated that critical crack originated at the tensile surface of the connectors for conventional frameworks. The critical crack for modified frameworks occurred on the axial wall of the abutments. The modification of the zirconia framework design presented significant improvement of the fracture resistance compared to the conventional design...|$|R
50|$|The MessagePad 100 {{series of}} devices used Macintosh's {{proprietary}} serial ports - <b>round</b> Mini-DIN 8 <b>connectors.</b> The MessagePad 2000/2100 models (as {{well as the}} eMate 300) have a small, proprietary Newton InterConnect port. However, {{the development of the}} Newton hardware/software platform was canceled by Steve Jobs on February 27, 1998, so the InterConnect port, while itself very advanced, can only be used to connect a serial dongle. A prototype multi-purpose InterConnect device containing serial, audio in, audio out, and other ports was also discovered. In addition, all Newton devices have infrared connectivity, initially only the Sharp ASK protocol, but later also IrDA, though the Sharp ASK protocol was kept in for compatibility reasons. Unlike the Palm Pilot, all Newton devices are equipped with a standard PC Card expansion slot (two on the 2000/2100). This allows native modem and even Ethernet connectivity; Newton users have also written drivers for 802.11b wireless networking cards and ATA-type flash memory cards (including the popular CompactFlash format), as well as for Bluetooth cards. Newton can also dial a phone number through the built-in speaker of the Newton device by simply holding a telephone handset up to the speaker and transmitting the appropriate tones. Fax and printing support is also built in at the operating system level, although it requires peripherals such as parallel adapters, PCMCIA cards, or serial modems, the most notable of which is the lightweight Newton Fax Modem released by Apple in 1993. It is powered by 2 AA batteries, and can also be used with a power adapter. It provides data transfer at 2400 bit/s, and can also send and receive fax messages at 9600 and 4800 bit/s respectively.|$|R
