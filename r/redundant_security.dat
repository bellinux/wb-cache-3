40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays. The essay “Equilibrium Mispricing in a Capital Market with Portfolio Constraints” develops a general equilibrium, continuous time model where portfolio constraints generate mispricing between <b>redundant</b> <b>securities.</b> Constrained consumption-portfolio optimization techniques are adapted to incorporate <b>redundant,</b> possibly mispriced, <b>securities.</b> Under logarithmic preferences, we provide explicit conditions for mispricing and closed-form expressions for all economic quantities. Existence of an equilibrium where mispricing occurs with positive probability is verified in a specific case. In a more general setting, we demonstrate the necessity of mispricing for equilibrium when agents are heterogeneous enough. The construction of a representative agent with stochastic weights allows us to characterize prices and allocations, given mispricing occurs. ^ The essay “Nonlinear Taxation, Tax Arbitrage and Equilibrium Asset Prices” investigates the equilibrium implications {{of the presence of}} nonlinearly taxed, <b>redundant</b> <b>securities,</b> and of the resulting tax arbitrage opportunities. Heterogeneity in taxation leads to discrepancies in assets 2 ̆ 7 pre-tax market prices of risk. We show that this mispricing is set so that agents effectively cooperate to minimize aggregate taxes, even though individually each agent may not minimize his own tax bill. Unlike the bulk of the existing tax arbitrage literature, but consistent with empirical evidence, equilibrium in our model allows discrepancy between agents 2 ̆ 7 marginal tax rates. Equilibrium with a zero net supply derivative reveals financial innovation to alleviate taxation, in particular when the derivative is taxed linearly or is taxed less heterogeneously across agents than is the stock itself. In the presence of two <b>redundant,</b> positive supply <b>securities,</b> clientele effects arise, where one agent holds the aggregate supply of each risky security, and only the bond is traded across agents. Clientele effects are shown to arise when agents 2 ̆ 7 tax rates are highly heterogeneous and when the aggregate wealth is divided fairly evenly across agents. ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 114 - 120. According to Black-Scholes {{option pricing}} model, options are <b>redundant</b> <b>securities,</b> therefore have no {{importance for the}} allocation of wealth in the economy. This dissertation shows that options might be nonredundant when two factors are considered - nonnegative wealth and volatility risk. The {{first part of the}} dissertation empirically examines whether options are <b>redundant</b> <b>securities</b> or not in the context of volatility risk. It is documented that volatility risk, proxied by zero-beta at-the-money straddles, captures time variation in the stochastic discount factor. In relation to this, alternative explanations to size and value vs. growth anomalies are given. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation, a multiperiod securities market is considered, and a model where agents face nonnegative wealth constraints is developed. Individuals’ associated consumption-investment problem is solved under this constraint, and optimal sharing rules for each agent in the economy are derived, subsequently. The optimal consumption for the representative agent leads to a multifactor conditional C-CAPM, which is the main testable hypothesis of the theory. Overall the theory outlined, and the empirical findings documented have implications for asset pricing, portfolio management, and capital markets theories. Arısoy, Yakup EserPh. D...|$|R
40|$|Most {{existing}} dynamic term structure models {{assume that}} {{interest rate derivatives}} are <b>redundant</b> <b>securities</b> and can be perfectly hedged using solely bonds. We find that the quadratic term structure models have serious difficulties in hedging caps and cap straddles, even though they capture bond yields well. Furthermore, at-the-money straddle hedging errors are highly correlated with cap-implied volatilities and can explain a large fraction of hedging errors of all caps and straddles across moneyness and maturities. Our results strongly suggest the existence of systematic unspanned factors related to stochastic volatility in interest rate derivatives markets.

Using S&P 500 options, we find that sampled intraday (or interday) call (put) prices often go down (up) even as the underlying price goes up, and call and put prices often increase, or decrease, together. Our results are valid after controlling for time decay and market microstructure effects. Therefore one-dimensional diffusion option models cannot be completely consistent with observed option price dynamics; options are not <b>redundant</b> <b>securities,</b> nor ideal hedging instruments - puts and the underlying asset prices may go down together.

40|$|Frictional {{economies are}} {{fundamentally}} different from their frictionless counterparts. For example, in frictional economies, the price function is sublinear and thus there will be incentives to innovate. When decomposing existing securities and opening new markets, innovators serve important economic functions, such as allowing investors to obtain consumption at lower costs, enabling investors to achieve better risk sharing, and making the fundamental value of more payoffs observable. In particular, innovators serve these functions even when they introduce <b>redundant</b> <b>securities</b> that are not yet issued. Furthermore, in frictional economies, the replication-based arbitrage valuation approach tends to overprice certain securities while underpricing others.

40|$|I {{examine the}} effect of initial option listings on {{underlying}} stock prices during 1973 to 1995, and show that the price effect of option introductions is best described by a two-regime switching means model whose optimal switch date occurs in 1981. In accordance with previous studies, I find positive abnormal returns for options listed during 1973 to 1980. By contrast, I find negative abnormal returns for options listed in 1981 and later. Possible causes for this switch include the introduction of index options in 1982, the implementation of regulatory changes in 1981, and the possibility that options expedite the dissemination of negative information.

40|$|During {{the recent}} debt crisis in Europe, policy makers {{responded to the}} {{controversy}} surrounding CDS by implementing a series of policies that banned CDS trading. I use these bans as quasi-natural experiments to identify how derivative markets affect liquidity of the underlying cash market. I document that a temporary CDS ban increased bond market liquidity but a permanent ban instead decreased bond market liquidity. To explain these patterns, I build a dynamic search-theoretic model of over-the-counter bond and CDS markets that features an endogenous liquidity interaction between the two markets. My model shows that these opposing patterns are {{due to the fact}} that bond and CDS markets are substitute markets in the short run but are complementary markets in the long run. My results challenge existing theories of liquidity interaction among multiple markets and the common perception that the CDS market is a more liquid market than the bond market.

The increased need for more effective control of power electrical systems, turned the development of smart grids the main object of study for many researchers. This paper proposes a digital system for condition monitoring, diagnosis and supervisory control applied to smart grids. The system is based on hybrid network architecture, consisting of a Wired Infrastructure, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and a Power Line Communications (PLC). The system is based on three hardware topologies responsible for the signal acquisition, processing, and transmission: Remote Data Acquisition Units (RDAU’s), Intelligent Sensors Modules (ISM’s) and a PLC’s Modem.

40|$|Abstract—Developing secure {{software}} {{is still a}} software engineering challenge because {{of the complexity of}} software security. Yet integrating security engineering and software engineering is increasingly important, especially for serviceoriented applications, as they are exposed to new security challenges due to their open nature. Current security engineering approaches do not consider existing security architectures, leading to <b>redundant</b> development of <b>security</b> artifacts. Further, present security architecture approaches do not provide relevant information to a security engineering process. Using a service-oriented and security architecturecentric approach for security engineering supports the development of secure service-oriented applications, as existing security solutions can be reused. In this paper a model for service-oriented security architectures is presented, which provides apt information to different consumers, such as security engineering processes and business services, in the form of views to assist the consumers security goals. The architecture model is exemplified by specifying different views of a web service-based security architecture.

40|$|Abstract—Human-related {{information}} security breaches within organizations are primarily caused by {{employees who have}} not been made {{aware of the importance of}} protecting the information they work with. Information security awareness is accordingly attracting more attention from industry, because stakeholders are held accountable for the information with which they work. The authors developed an Information Security Retrieval and Awareness model – entitled “ISRA ” – that is tailored specifically towards enhancing {{information security}} awareness in industry amongst all users of information, to address shortcomings in existing information security awareness models. This paper is principally aimed at expounding a prototype for the ISRA model to highlight the advantages of utilizing the model. The prototype will focus on the non-technical, humanrelated information security issues in industry. The prototype will ensure that all stakeholders in an organization are part of an information security awareness process, and that these stakeholders are able to retrieve specific information related to information security issues relevant to their job category, preventing them from being overburdened with <b>redundant</b> information.

40|$|We analyze {{issues related}} to {{proprietary}} disclosures by specialized investment institutions such as hedge funds to their trading counterparties and creditors. In this paper, disclosure can be costly {{because of the potential}} for exploitation through competitive trade or "front-running". In chapter 1, we consider a model with a direct revelation mechanism between leveraged investors and their lenders. In this model, the investors need to borrow from lenders with heterogeneous risk-exposures in order to trade. Investors may obtain advantageous terms of borrowing by disclosing their investment strategy, thereby revealing its correlation to the lender's existing risk-exposure. Investors risk being "front-run" by their lender if they disclose, however. We show that in the presence of front-running, the "unraveling" result of full disclosure may not hold. Mandating disclosure has ambiguous welfare effects since it can not only lead to the matching of uncorrelated risks, but also to concentrations of risk. These results have implications for regulations on leveraged investors in financial markets. In chapter 2, we consider an indirect revelation made by an arbitrageur (e. g., hedge fund) to trading counterparties through traded securities. In this model, the arbitrageur has private information about the relative value of two or more securities. We conjecture that in a segmented dealer market, the arbitrageur trades each security with a different dealer so that each dealer sees only one piece of the total position. We show that this "break-up" strategy can be optimal and unique even if given an array of <b>redundant</b> strategies and <b>securities,</b> including "swaps" of the various securities. The analysis of this equilibrium has implications for the kinds of claims held by an arbitrageur's counterparties in a leveraged scenario and their resulting stability. by K. Jeremy Ko. Thesis (Ph.
