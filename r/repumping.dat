5000|$|A {{magneto-optical}} trap (MOT) {{is commonly}} used for cooling and trapping a substance by doppler cooling. In the process of doppler cooling, the red detuning light would be absorbed by atoms from one certain direction and reemitted at a random direction. The electron of the atoms would decay to an alternative ground states if the atoms {{have more than one}} hyperfine ground levels. There is the case of all the atoms in the other ground states rather than the ground states of doppler cooling, then system can't cool the atoms anymore. In order to solve this problem, the other <b>repumping</b> light would be incident into the system to repopulate the atoms to restart doppler cooling process. This would induced higher fluorescence reemitted from atoms and the fluorescence can be absorbed by atoms which would act as a repulsion force on atoms. Due to this problem, the doppler limit would increase and easy to meet. When there is a dark spot or lines on the shape of the <b>repumping</b> light, the atoms in the mid of the atomic gas would not be excited by the <b>repumping</b> light which can decrease the repulsion force from the previous cases.|$|E

40|$|Analogous to the {{extension}} of laser cooling techniques from two-level to three-level atoms, Doppler cooling of molecules with an intermediate electronic state is considered. In particular, we use a rate-equation approach to simulate cooling of SiO+, in which population buildup in the intermediate state is prevented by its short lifetime. We determine that Doppler cooling of SiO+ can be accomplished without optically <b>repumping</b> from the intermediate state, {{at the cost of}} causing undesirable parity flips and rotational diffusion. Since the necessary <b>repumping</b> would require a large number of continuous-wave lasers, optical pulse shaping of a femtosecond laser is proposed as an attractive alternative.

It {{is based on}} excitation of the 4 s 3 d 1 D 2 - 4 s 5 p 1 P 1 transition at 672 nm with an extended cavity diode laser. The effect of the <b>repumping</b> is approximately a factor of three increase in trap lifetime and a doubling of the trapping efficiency from a Zeeman slowed thermal beam. Added to this, the 672 -nm laser repumps atoms from an otherwise dark state to yield an overall increase in detected fluorescence signal from the magneto-optic trap (MOT) of more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we report isotope shift measurements of the 672 -nm transition, for the first time, for four naturally occurring even isotopes. Using available charge radii data, the observed shifts, extending up to 4. 3 GHz, display the expected linear dependence in a King plot analysis.

40|$|The {{observation}} of dark-resonances in the two-electron atom barium and {{their influence on}} optical cooling is reported. In heavy alkali earth atoms, i. e. barium or radium, optical cooling can be achieved using n^ 1 S_ 0 -n^ 1 P_ 1 transitions and optical <b>repumping</b> from the low lying n^ 1 D_ 2 and n^ 3 D_{ 1, 2 } states to which the atoms decay with a high branching ratio. The cooling and <b>repumping</b> transition have a common upper state. This leads to dark resonances and hence make optical cooling less inefficient.

We produce a molecular beam of BH and measure the branching ratios for the excited electronic state, A^ 1 Π(v_ 0 = 0), to decay to the various vibrational states of the ground electronic state, X^ 1 Σ. We verify that the branching ratio for the spin-forbidden transition to an intermediate triplet state is inconsequentially small. We measure {{the frequency of the}} lowest rotational transition of the X state, and the hyper fine structure in the relevant levels of both the X and A states, and determine the nuclear electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole coupling constants. We use a semiclassical model of the molecule-light interaction to investigate the expected cycling behaviour on the main cooling transition using light with modulated polarisation. The results of the model are compared with the effect of modulating the polarisation experimentally using an electro-optic modulator. In order to <b>repump</b> the population that leaks into the first vibrationally excited state, we have designed, built and tested a suitable <b>repump</b> laser and have demonstrated that we can drive the <b>repump</b> transition.

5000|$|Many atoms that do {{not contain}} closed optical loops can still be laser cooled, however, by using <b>repump</b> lasers which re-excite the {{population}} back into the optical loop after it has decayed to a state outside of the cooling cycle. The magneto-optical trapping of rubidium 85, for example, involves cycling on the closed [...] transition. On excitation, however, the detuning necessary for cooling gives a small, but non-zero overlap with the [...] state. If an atom is excited to this state, which occurs roughly every thousand cycles, the atom is then free to decay either the , light coupled upper hyperfine state, or the [...] "dark" [...] lower hyperfine state. If it falls back to the dark state, the atom stops cycling between ground and excited state, and the cooling and trapping of this atom stops.

In this respect rare-earth elements exhibit many transitions which are likely to induce noticeable leaks from the cooling cycle. In this work, to determine whether laser-cooling of singly-ionized erbium Er^+ is feasible, we have performed accurate electronic-structure calculations of energies and spontaneous-emission Einstein coefficients of Er^+, using a combination of ab initio and least-square-fitting techniques. We identify five weak closed transitions suitable for laser-cooling, the broadest of which is in the kilohertz range. For the strongest transitions, by simulating the cascade dynamics of spontaneous emission, we show that <b>repumping</b> is necessary, and we discuss possible <b>repumping</b> schemes.

40|$|We {{describe}} the apparatus of a dark-line two-dimensional (2 D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) of Rb- 85 cold atoms with high optical depth (OD). Different from the conventional configuration, two (of three) pairs of trapping laser beams in our 2 D MOT setup {{do not follow}} the symmetry axes of the quadrupole magnetic field: they are aligned with 45 degrees angles to the longitudinal axis. Two orthogonal <b>repumping</b> laser beams have a dark-line volume in the longitudinal axis at their cross over. With a total trapping laser power of 40 mW and <b>repumping</b> laser power of 18 mW, we obtain an atomic OD up to 160 in an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) scheme, which corresponds to an atomic-density-length product NL = 2. 05 x 10 (15) m(- 2). In a closed two-state system, the OD can become as large as more than 600. Our 2 D MOT configuration allows full optical access of the atoms in its longitudinal direction without interfering with the trapping and <b>repumping</b> laser beams spatially. Moreover, the zero magnetic field along the longitudinal axis allows the cold atoms maintain a long ground-state coherence time without switching off the MOT magnetic field, which {{makes it possible to}} operate the MOT at a high repetition rate and a high duty cycle.

50|$|Only certain {{atoms and}} ions have optical {{transitions}} amenable to laser cooling, {{since it is}} extremely difficult to generate the amounts of laser power needed at wavelengths much shorter than 300 nm. Furthermore, the more hyperfine structure an atom has, the more ways there are for it to emit a photon from the upper state and not return to its original state, putting it in a dark state and removing it from the cooling process. It is possible to use other lasers to optically pump those atoms back into the excited state and try again, but the more complex the hyperfine structure is, the more (narrow-band, frequency locked) lasers are required. Since frequency-locked lasers are both complex and expensive, atoms which need more than one extra <b>repump</b> laser are rarely cooled; the common rubidium Magneto-optical trap, for example, requires one <b>repump</b> laser. This is also the reason why, molecules are in general difficult to laser cool: in addition to hyperfine structure, molecules also have rovibronic couplings and so can also decay into excited rotational or vibrational states.
