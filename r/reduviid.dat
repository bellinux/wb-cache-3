40|$|International audienceHere we {{show that}} trying to rob prey (cleptobiosis) from a highly {{specialized}} predatory ant species is risky. To capture prey, Allomerus decemarticulatus workers build gallery-shaped traps on the stems of their associated myrmecophyte, Hirtella physophora. We wondered whether the frequent presence of immobilized prey on the trap attracted flying cleptoparasites. Nine social wasp species nest in the H. physophora foliage; of the six species studied, only Angiopolybia pallens rob prey from Allomerus colonies. For those H. physophora not sheltering wasps, we noted cleptobiosis by stingless bees (Trigona), social wasps (A. pallens and five Agelaia species), assassin bugs (Reduviidae), and flies. A relationship between {{the size of the}} robbers and their rate of capture by ambushing Allomerus workers was established for social wasps; small wasps were easily captured, while the largest never were. <b>Reduviids,</b> which are slow to extract their rostrum from prey, were always captured, while Trigona and flies often escaped. The balance sheet for the ants was positive vis-à-vis the <b>reduviids</b> and four out of the six social wasp species. For the latter, wasps began by cutting up parts of the prey's abdomen and were captured (or abandoned the prey) before the entire abdomen was retrieved so that the total weight of the captured wasps exceeded that of the prey abdomens.

50|$|The use of pesticide, like DDT, {{has also}} led to {{elimination}} of the Tunga penetrans, but this control/prevention strategy should be utilized very carefully, if at all, because of the possible side effects such pesticides can have on the greater biosphere. In the 1950s, there was a worldwide effort to eradicate malaria. As part of that effort, Mexico launched the Campaña Nacional para la Erradicación de Paludismo, or the National Campaign for the Eradication of Malaria. By spraying DDT in homes, the Anopheles a genus of mosquitoes known to carry the deadly Plasmodium falciparum was mostly eliminated. As a consequence of this national campaign, other arthropods were either eliminated or significantly reduced in number, including the <b>reduviid</b> bug responsible for Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis) and T. penetrans. Controlled, in-home spraying of DDT is effective as it gives the home immunity against arthropods while not contaminating the local water supplies and doing as much ecological damage as was once the case when DDT was first introduced.|$|E
50|$|After its {{discovery}} in elastic tendons in dragon flies and wing hinges in locusts, resilin {{have been found}} in many structures and organs in arthropods. Resilin is often found as a composite with chitin in insects cuticle, where chitin serves as the structural component. Resilin provides elasticity and possibly other properties. It was discovered in the salivary pump of assassin bugs, in the feeding pumps of rhodnius prolixus, tsetse flies, <b>reduviid</b> bugs, and honey bees, and in the resistance providing mechanism for the venom-dispensing pump of honey bee. Resilin was also found in the sound production organs of arthropods, such as the Cicadae family and Pyralidae family, where both high elasticity and high resilience of resilin play important roles due to the rapid stress-release cycles of tymbals. Besides these structures, resilin exists most widely in the locomotion systems of arthropods. It was discovered in wing hinges to enable recovery from deformation of wing elements, and to dampen the aerodynamic forces felt by the wing; in ambulatory systems of cockroaches and flies to facilitate rapid joint deformation; in jumping mechanism, resilin stores kinetic energy with great efficiency and release upon unloading. It is also found in the cuticles surrounding abdomen regions of ants and bees, which expand and swell to a great extent during feeding and reproduction process.|$|E

40|$|Adult triatomines {{occasionally}} {{fly into}} artificially lit premises in Amazonia. This {{can result in}} Trypanosoma cruzi transmission to humans either by direct contact or via foodstuff contamination, but the frequency of such behaviour has not been quantified. To address this issue, a light-trap was set 45 m above ground in primary rainforest near Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil and operated monthly for three consecutive nights {{over the course of}} one year (432 trap-hours).

Males were collected more frequently than females. The only month without any catches was May. Attraction of most of the known local T. cruzi vectors to artificial light sources is common and year-round in the Amazon rainforest, implying that they may often invade premises built near forest edges and thus become involved in disease transmission. Consequently, effective Chagas disease prevention in Amazonia will require integrating entomological surveillance with the currently used epidemiological surveillance...|$|R

5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} single contact points. [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of <b>reduviid</b> bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|E

The assay was species specific and was capable of detecting 1 / 20 th of T. cruzi and 1 / 4 th of T. rangeli cell equivalents without complementary hybridization. In addition, the PCR-based assay was robust enough for direct application to difficult biological samples such as <b>Reduviid</b> feces or guts and was capable of recognizing all T. cruzi and T. rangeli strains and lineages. Because the assay primers amplify entirely different target sequences, no reaction interference was observed, facilitating future adaptation of this assay to an automated format. Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas ’ disease, a fatal illness endemic to many Latin American countries. T. cruzi shares reservoirs and vectors with the related protozoan Trypanosoma rangeli, which is pathogenic to <b>Reduviid</b> bugs but apparently harmless to humans (1).

The rate of attack on P. solenopsis was quite low but fairly consistent, with the different life stages of the predator generally more effective. Further investigation of the biological control potential of R. longifrons against cotton pests under pot and controlled filed should be done due to the predator's ability to kill adult stages of all prey species evaluated.

40|$|International audienceInsects {{have evolved}} diverse methods of {{camouflage}} that have {{played an important}} role in their evolutionary success. Debris-carrying, a behavior of actively harvesting and carrying exogenous materials, is among the most fascinating and complex behaviors because it requires not only an ability to recognize, collect, and carry materials but also evolutionary adaptations in related morphological characteristics. However, the fossil record of such behavior is extremely scarce, and only a single Mesozoic example from Spanish amber has been recorded; therefore, little is known about the early evolution of this complicated behavior and its underlying anatomy. We report a diverse insect assemblage of exceptionally preserved debris carriers from Cretaceous Burmese, French, and Lebanese ambers, including the earliest known chrysopoid larvae (green lacewings), myrmeleontoid larvae (split-footed lacewings and owlflies), and <b>reduviids</b> (assassin bugs). These ancient insects used a variety of debris material, including insect exoskeletons, sand grains, soil dust, leaf trichomes of gleicheniacean ferns, wood fibers, and other vegetal debris. They convergently evolved their debris-carrying behavior through multiple pathways, which expressed a high degree of evolutionary plasticity. We demonstrate that the behavioral repertoire, which is associated with considerable morphological adaptations, was already widespread among insects by at least the Mid-Cretaceous. Together with the previously known Spanish specimen, these fossils are the oldest direct evidence of camouflaging behavior in the fossil record. Our findings provide a novel insight into early evolution of camouflage in insects and ancient ecological associations among plants and insects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Serious {{cases of}} {{systemic}} anaphylaxis {{are caused by}} hypersensitivity to salivary components of hematophagous in-sects of the genus Triatoma. A woman {{with a history of}} ana-phylaxis associated with Triatoma protracta bites began an im-munotherapy program using a salivary gland extract developed for that purpose. The success of that program was demonstrat-ed by T. protracta bite challenge and radioimmunoassay. Frequently diagnosed allergies caused by insects and other arthropods are those produced by in-halant antigens. Treatment is by way of whole-body extracts. That method has been inappropri-ately used to treat allergies to stinging and biting insects. Venom preparations are available for treat-ing allergies to Hymenoptera. Of less notoriety than the stinging Hymenoptera, but of perhaps greater importance from an etiologic standpoint, are the <b>reduviids</b> of the genus Triatoma Laporte. While an increasing number of cases of allergy to Triatoma are being recognized, previous to our study there was no easily obtainable, practical or successful antigen available. Triatoma bugs are exclusively blood feeders in both sexes and all developmental stages. Their preferred hosts in the United States are woodrats of the genus Neotoma. However, Triatoma bugs are quite catholic in their tastes and will feed on a va-riety of hosts, including humans. While usually maintaining a close association with woodrats in the nest, the bugs do exhibit cyclic seasonal flights. In southern California, T. protracta begins its dispersal in late spring, with flights con-tinuing through the summer while favorable tem-peratures and humidity permit.

40|$|Assassin bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Reduviidae) are venomous insects, most {{of which}} prey on invertebrates. Assassin bug venom has {{features}} in common with venoms from other animals, such as paralyzing and lethal activity when injected, and a molecular composition that includes disulfide-rich peptide neurotoxins. Uniquely, this venom also has strong liquefying activity that has been hypothesized to facilitate feeding through the narrow channel of the proboscisa structure inherited from sap- and phloem-feeding phytophagous hemipterans and adapted during the evolution of Heteroptera into a fang and feeding structure. However, further understanding of the function of assassin bug venom is impeded {{by the lack of}} proteomic studies detailing its molecular composition. By using a combined transcriptomic/proteomic approach, we show that the venom proteome of the harpactorine assassin bug Pristhesancus plagipennis includes a complex suite of > 100 proteins comprising disulfide-rich peptides, CUB domain proteins, cystatins, putative cytolytic toxins, triabin-like protein, odorant-binding protein, S 1 proteases, catabolic enzymes, putative nutrient-binding proteins, plus eight families of proteins without homology to characterized proteins. S 1 proteases, CUB domain proteins, putative cytolytic toxins, and other novel proteins in the 10 - 16 -kDa mass range, were the most abundant venom components. Thus, in addition to putative neurotoxins, assassin bug venom includes a high proportion of enzymatic and cytolytic venom components likely to be well suited to tissue liquefaction. Our results also provide insight into the trophic switch to blood-feeding by the kissing bugs (Reduviidae: Triatominae). Although some protein families such as triabins occur in the venoms of both predaceous and blood-feeding <b>reduviids,</b> the composition of venoms produced by these two groups is revealed to differ markedly.

40|$|The 16, 470 bp {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of an assassin bug from the <b>reduviid</b> subfamily Harpactorinae, Agriosphodrus dohrni, has been revealed. The entire genome encodes for two ribosomal RNA genes (rrnL and rrnS), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 13 protein-coding genes, and a control region. The nucleotide composition is biased toward adenine and thymine (A+T = 72. 2 %). Comparative analysis with two other <b>reduviid</b> species Triatoma dimidiata and Valentia hoffmanni, exhibited highly conserved genome architectures including genome contents, gene order, nucleotide composition, codon usage, amino acid composition, as well as genome asymmetry. All protein-coding genes use standard mitochondrial initiation codons (methionine and isoleucine), except that nad 1 starts with GTG. All tRNAs have the classic clover-leaf structure, except that the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of tRNA Ser(AGN) forms a simple loop. Secondary structure comparisons of the two mitochondrial ribosomal subunits among sequenced assassin bugs show that the sequence and structure of rrnL is more conservative than that of rrnS. The presence of structural elements in the control region is also discussed, with emphasis on their implications in the regulation of replication and/or transcription of the <b>reduviid</b> mitogenome.

40|$|By {{studying}} salticid spiders from East Africa I look at sociality from {{an unusual}} perspective. These particular salticids form mixed-species groups, {{with more than}} one species and even more than one genus routinely living together within any single nest complex. The primary occupants of these nest complexes are three species of Menemerus, two species of Pseudicius, Myrmarachne melanotarsa (Wesolowska and Salm, 2002), Parajotus cinereus (Wesolowska, 2004), and an unidentified species that I call the 'Nun'. Adult males and females, along with juveniles of different age classes, share nest complexes. The highly varied composition of these groups suggests that the benefits to the salticids of grouping extend beyond species boundaries. Relatedness may not be so critical for understanding the dynamics of these inter-spider relationships. This suggests a departure from how social spiders have been studied in the past. Often Portia africana (Simon, 1886) is also a part of the nest-complex community. Although solitary as an adult, P. africana has a social juvenile phase, and juveniles of P. africana sometimes even share prey. The cues that P. africana use when making decisions to join others and cooperate in prey ambush suggests at least rudimentary numerical ability in these spiders. Myrmarachne melanotarsa, a new species described during this study, is a myrmecomorphic salticid that lives in close proximity to the ant it mimics, a species of Crematogaster. Links between the biology of the ant the ant mimic are investigated. Access to honeydew and defence by collective mimicry appear to be unusual, but especially important, aspects of this species' biology. M melanotarsa is also routinely found living close to other salticid species, and it has a preference for juveniles of other salticids as prey. Clustering with reproductive groups of other salticids appears to be important as a means by which M melanotarsa gains access to this unusual prey. Yet another social salticid species, Menemerus sp. A, has a special relationship with ants. It steals prey from foraging ants. Besides ants, two assassin-bug species (Reduviidae), Scipinnia repax and Nagusta sp., associate with the social salticids. Both feed by preference on salticids. S. repax also singles out Nagusta sp. as prey. For the salticids, one advantage of living in nest complexes appear to be that the large silk edifice a group of salticids may build provides partial protection from predators such as ants and <b>reduviids.</b> Experiments show that social salticid species actively choose to group with other conspecifics and with social salticids from other species and genera. However, aside from M melanotarsa, all of the social salticid species are averse to joining nest complexes containing ants. The adaptive significance of the array of different relationships and interactions within the nest complexes is discussed...|$|R
30|$|A {{survey of}} the insect fauna of {{sugarcane}} fields in Upper Egypt referred to 13 insect genera as sugarcane feeders (Ezzat and Atries 1967). These are Aiolopsis and Locusta (Acrididae), Labia (Dermaptera), Phyllodromia (Blattidae), Geotomus (Cydnidae), Empoasca and Exitianus (Jassidae), Tropidocephala (Delphacidae), Chilo (Grambidae), Pelopidus (Hesperiidae), Leucania (Noctuidae), Dorylus (Formicidae), and Pentondon (Scaraebidae). The authors mentioned that although the apparent serious damage to sugarcane in Egypt is mainly due to the lepidopterous sugarcane and corn borer Chilo agamemnon Bles., all other pests in the aforementioned genera had different degrees of importance. However, the fauna included {{a considerable number of}} useful insects providing the bright aspect of the picture. The most reliable species in this beneficial group are concentrated in the orders Hemiptera, Neuroptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera. From Hemiptera, the anthocorid Orius sp.? niger is known as predator on insect eggs, mites, small insects, and aphids. Two <b>reduviids,</b> Oncocephalus notatus Klug and Pirates sterpitans rufipennis Lucas, were also reported as bloodsuckers of other insects. In Neuroptera, Chrysopa vulgaris (=Chrysoperla carnea) Steph. and Cueta variegata Klug were recorded. The former species is also known as predaceous on the sugarcane mealybug, Saccharicoccus sacchari Ckll., and other pests. Among Diptera, two syrphids were recorded, Syritta spinigera Loew and Syrphus corollae F., which are known to be predaceous upon aphids and nymphs of other homopterous insects. Also, the sarcophagid Sarcophaga rapax Walk. was recorded; it plays a role in controlling the sugarcane moth borer, Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius. Among the Hymenoptera, members of family Ichneumonidae include Diplazon laetorius Fabr. and Barylypa humeralis Branus (L.P.); the first is known as a parasitoid of syrphids and the second of Lepidoptera. A single parasitic species was reported for either Encyrtidae or Trichogrmmatidae, i.e., Homalitylioidae and T. evanescens, respectively. Since the 1980 s, great efforts have been carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture to utilize this parasitoid T. evanescens against C. agamemnon in sugarcane fields by mass rearing and inundative releases of the parasitoid through 14 mass-rearing units, covering all the sugarcane areas (300, 000 feddans[*]=[*] 120, 000  ha) (El-Samea and Saadia 2002). Through the implementation of this program, the infestation with C. agamemnon in sugarcane fields was reduced successfully from 17 to >[*] 3 % in almost all the sugarcane fields. In the above authors’ list, other hymenopterous species of known beneficial role are present, i.e., Myzine arabica Guer. (Scoliidae) that works as ectoparasitoid on larvae of Scarabidae; Chrysis sp. (Chrysididae) parasitizes certain caterpillars; Eumenes maxillosa F. (Eumenidae), Ammophila tyedi Guill., Liris praetermissa Rich, Phillanthus triangulum abdelkader Luc., and Sceliphron sprifex L. (Sphecidae) feeders on collected young lepidopterous larvae; and Paracyphononyx ruficrus Klug and Pompilus sp. (Pompilidae) known as predators of spiders. Among the Coleoptera, the coccinelids Chilomenes vicina Muls, C. undecimpunctata, and Scymnus syriacus (Goeze) are well known as predators in sugarcane fields {{in different parts of the}} world. The authors mentioned that the first coccinellid attacks different young insects; the second mainly attacks the mealybugs S. sacchari and Symicoccus bonsis, while the third feeds on coleopterous pests. The two staphylinids, Paederus alfierii Koch and Philonthus longicornis, were also reported; the first is a well-known predator of insect eggs and young larvae or nymphs or insect pest, and the latter most probably feeds on insect stages inhabiting the soil, e.g., pupae of Chilo. Five carabids, Calosoma levantinus leavistriatus Schatz., Broscus punctatus Dej., Calosoma rugosum chlorostictum Klug., Microlestes sp., and Tachys lucasi Duv., were included in the list. Their activity is restricted in feeding on various stages of insects inhabiting soil.|$|R
