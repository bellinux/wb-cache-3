5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical <b>remodeling</b> of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical <b>remodeling</b> of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this <b>remodeling</b> and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone <b>remodeling.</b> If the <b>remodeling</b> is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper <b>remodeling</b> occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E

40|$|Next to plaque formation, {{arterial}} geometric <b>remodelling</b> is {{an important}} determinant of luminal narrowing in atherosclerotic disease. Expansive <b>remodelling</b> retards, whereas constric-tive <b>remodelling</b> accelerates lumen loss by plaque formation. Expansive arterial <b>remodelling</b> is a double edged sword, however. While luminal area is preserved, the plaque {{beneath the surface of}} the lumen often reveals large atheroma with heavy inflammation in expansive <b>remodelling.</b> These characteristics have been associated with plaque rupture and subsequent myocardial infarction. Thus, in the long term expansive <b>remodelling</b> may lead to thrombosis of angiographically silent lesions while constrictive <b>remodelling</b> is often associated with stable coronary syndromes. The mechanisms of arterial <b>remodelling</b> are poorly understood. This is mainly due to lack of good in vitro and animal models which makes mechanistic studies difficult. J Cardiovasc Ris...|$|R

Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by <b>remodeling</b> carried out by chromatin <b>remodeling</b> complexes (see Chromatin <b>remodeling).</b> There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E

40|$|Bone <b>remodelling</b> is the {{adaptation}} of bone mass in response to localized changes in loading conditions. The nature of the mechanical signal governing <b>remodelling,</b> however, remains the subject of continued investigation. The aims {{of this study were}} to use an iterative finite element (FE) bone <b>remodelling</b> technique to explore the effect of different <b>remodelling</b> signals in the prediction of bone <b>remodelling</b> behaviour. A finite element model of the turkey ulna, following that of Brown et al., was analysed using the ABAQUS package. The model was validated against the static predictions of the Brown et al. study. A bone <b>remodelling</b> technique, based on swelling algorithms given by Taylor and Clift, was then applied to predict the dramatic change in loading conditions imposed. The resulting changes in FE mid-shaft bone geometry were compared with the <b>remodelling</b> observed experimentally and showed good agreement. The tensile principal stress was found to be the best <b>remodelling</b> signal under the imposed conditions. Localized sensitivities in the <b>remodelling</b> patterns were found, however, and the definition of the dead zone was modified as a result. <b>Remodelling</b> with the new dead-zone definition showed that both the tensile principal stress and the tensile principal strain produced the <b>remodelling</b> patterns that agreed most closely with experimen...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} plaque size and vessel <b>remodelling</b> to coronary artery stenosis and to assess the role of vessel shrinkage (negative <b>remodelling)</b> across {{a wide range of}} lesions.  DESIGN—Postmortem study of coronary <b>remodelling</b> in perfusion fixed hearts.  SUBJECTS— 24 men and 24  women who died suddenly with coronary artery disease.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Percentage stenosis, percentage plaque burden, percentage <b>remodelling,</b> and arc of normal vessel were measured and related to age, sex, smoking status, and history of hypertension.  RESULTS—There was a positive relation between percentage stenosis and percentage plaque burden (r =  0. 6, p    25 % versus 10  lesions with ⩽  25 % stenosis (p <  0. 0001). Lesions with negative <b>remodelling</b> had greater plaque burden and luminal stenosis and a reduced arc of normal segment.  CONCLUSION—Outward arterial <b>remodelling</b> negates the stenosing effect of increasing plaque size.

40|$|Targeted {{chromatin}} <b>remodelling</b> {{is essential}} for many nuclear processes, including the regulation of V(D) J recombination. ATP-dependent nucleosome <b>remodelling</b> complexes are important players in this process whose activity must be tightly regulated. We show here that histone acetylation regulates nucleosome <b>remodelling</b> complex activity to boost RAG cutting during the initiation of V(D) J recombination. RAG cutting requires nucleosome mobilization from recombination signal sequences. Histone acetylation does not stimulate nucleosome mobilization per se by CHRAC, ACF or their catalytic subunit, ISWI. Instead, we find the more open structure of acetylated chromatin regulates the ability of nucleosome <b>remodelling</b> complexes to access their nucleosome templates. We also find that bromodomain/acetylated histone tail interactions can contribute to this targeting at limited concentrations of <b>remodelling</b> complex. We therefore propose that the changes in higher order chromatin structure associated with histone acetylation contribute to the correct targeting of nucleosome <b>remodelling</b> complexes {{and this is a}} novel way in which histone acetylation can modulate <b>remodelling</b> complex activity...|$|R

40|$|SWI-SNF alters DNA-histone {{interactions}} {{within a}} nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. These alterations cause {{changes in the}} topology of a closed circular nucleosomal array that persist after removal of ATP from the reaction. We demonstrate here that a <b>remodeled</b> closed circular array will revert toward its original topology when ATP is removed, indicating that the <b>remodeled</b> array has a higher energy {{than that of the}} starting state. However, reversion occurs with a half-life measured in hours, implying a high energy barrier between the <b>remodeled</b> and standard states. The addition of competitor DNA accelerates reversion of the <b>remodeled</b> array by more than 10 -fold, and we interpret this result to mean that binding of human SWI-SNF (hSWI-SNF), {{even in the absence of}} ATP hydrolysis, stabilizes the <b>remodeled</b> state. In addition, we also show that SWI-SNF is able to <b>remodel</b> a closed circular array in the absence of topoisomerase I, demonstrating that hSWI-SNF can induce topological changes even when conditions are highly energetically unfavorable. We conclude that the <b>remodeled</b> state is less stable than the standard state but that the <b>remodeled</b> state is kinetically trapped by the high activation energy barrier separating it from the unremodeled conformation...|$|R
