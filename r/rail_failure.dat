This has increased the risk of surface cracks at curves because of rolling contact fatigue.

40|$|The {{probability}} of catastrophic <b>rail</b> <b>failure</b> {{as a result}} of the propagation of surface-initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks to form transverse defects (TDs) is of ongoing concern to the rail industry, especially since the Hatfield incident in the UK in 2000. The heavy haul sector is not immune to such concerns, as the combination of improved rail steels and optimisation of the wheel-rail interface has reduced the extent to which rail wear influences rail life. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the growth behaviour of gauge corner cracking (GCC), and in particular, the tendency for rails to break with a rapid fracture, under the high axle load conditions typical of those that exist in Australian heavy haul operations. Previous work has shown that the occurrence of tension spikes {{as a result of}} localised vertical and lateral head bending on the web were significant in the understanding of this behaviour, which is exacerbated with increasing rail head wear (HW), such that the occurrence of the rapid fracture associated with this behaviour correlates with the extent of rail HW. This behaviour was examined using finite element (FE) modelling, which had previously been validated by comparison with in-track measurements to verify the prediction of the tension spikes. The FE model used a single rail on a discrete elastic foundation to parametrically study the growth behaviour of RCF damage subjected to changes in the rail HW; the contact patch offset (CPO) from the rail centreline, the (UV) ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads, foundation stiffness and the thermal stresses. The FE results reveal that existing GCC, when subjected to high tensile stresses at the underhead radius (UHR) and the gauge corner region, can contribute to the development of rapid (unstable) fracture.

40|$|Rail {{infrastructure}} {{is a large}} and costly investment, and has a long life. To realize the benefits from this investment, effective maintenance is required. Railways {{are one of the}} prime modes of transportation in many countries and as they are closely associated with passenger and cargo transportation, they own high risk in terms of potential loss of human life and damage/destruction of assets. New technologies and stringent safety standards are constantly being introduced, but accidents still occur. There will always be some risk associated with derailments and collisions, but it can be reduced by elimination of the root causes by means of an effective maintenance strategy to govern optimization of inspection, lubrication and grinding frequency and/or improvement in skill and efficiency. A detailed study of the defects which emerge both in the rolling stock and the rail {{infrastructure is}} essential to identify the correct maintenance strategy. Detection and rectification of rail defects/degradations are major issues for all rail players around the world. Some of the rail degradations include worn out rails, weld problems, internal defects, corrugations and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) initiated problems such as surface cracks, head checks, squats, spalling and shelling. If undetected and/or untreated, these defects can lead to rail breaks and derailments. Efficient maintenance strategies can reduce potential risk of rail breaks and derailments. A potential risk is the risk which accumulates in the form of rail degradation {{over a period of time}}. In spite of continuous efforts made by all rail infrastructure operators around the world to reduce costs, a substantial proportion of railway budget is spent on rail maintenance. It is understood that the consequential costs due to derailment reduces with increase in inspection, lubrication, grinding and replacement costs. The challenge is to find a balance between the maintenance costs which consists of inspection, lubrication and grinding costs, and consequential costs due to derailments. The consequences of derailment in terms of loss of human life, damage/destruction of assets and loss of company trust and reputation justify maintaining stringent safety standards, which require massive rail maintenance investments in order to be met. Reduction in maintenance investments may increase the rate of rail degradation, which may increase the risk of derailments. The aim is to develop an approach to predict rail failures, which will help to optimize maintenance activities (inspection, grinding, rectification/replacement and/or welding). Generally, there is a trade-off between maintenance investment and the risk involved in rail degradation in order to develop a rail maintenance procedure. Failure prediction of rail sections undergoing degradation will help to estimate the risk of derailment. Thus, prediction of the <b>rail</b> <b>failure</b> rate is a requirement for the development of an effective rail maintenance procedure. Different types of rail degradation processes leading to various rail defects have been studied. The performed literature studies indicate a need for better prediction of <b>rail</b> <b>failure</b> over a period of time based on the factors influencing rail degradation. The maintenance strategy followed by the Swedish National Rail Administration (Banverket), Sweden's rail infrastructure operator, is described and the issues related to rail degradation and maintenance are outlined for further research in this area. <b>Rail</b> <b>failure</b> data has been extracted from different Banverket's databases, classified according to a classification framework developed and analyzed over a period of time based on Million Gross Tonnes (MGT) of traffic using Weibull distribution.

40|$|Thermally-induced {{longitudinal}} stress in continuously welded rail (CWR) is a recognized problem within the railroad industry {{in terms of}} both safety and maintenance. Daily and seasonal temperature cycles can lead to high longitudinal rail stress that can result in <b>rail</b> <b>failure.</b> Ultrasonic nondestructive techniques have been previously attempted to monitor this stress. These techniques have had many limitations such that alternative methods are of great interest. The research illustrated in this thesis is a novel attempt at a solution to address these needs. The technique is based on ultrasonic backscatter which results from the multitude of reflections that occur at grain boundaries due to the variation of the single-crystal elastic constants. The resultant backscatter has previously been theoretically modeled and is influenced by the materialâs stress state through the covariance of elastic moduli. This thesis aims to present experimental confirmation of the stress influence on ultrasonic backscatter. Backscatter results are presented for mechanically and thermally-induced uniaxial stresses in various samples. The results indicate that backscatter is a sensitive indicator of a materialâs stress state. The sensitivity leads to the belief that this technique may form the starting point for reliable stress measurement devices used on CWR and other structural components. Advisor: Joseph A.

These defects were reported to appear in several locations across the globe where the cost incurred for their removal leads to a major increase of track maintenance cost.

High longitudinal rail stresses contribute to many problems such as track buckling, <b>rail</b> joint <b>failure,</b> <b>rail</b> breakage and <b>failure</b> of turnouts. The direct and indirect costs of track buckling problems are very high. The influences of rail temperature, SFT and lateral misalignment of track on track buckling need comprehensive investigation. In this paper, an experimental design comprising strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress sensors has been implemented on the QR heavy haul 60 kg/m rail network. A new creep measurement technique using internal rail stress has been developed. The changes in rail neutral temperature due to the variation of actual rail temperature and the occurrence of rail creep in straight and curved track is quantified. Modes of differences of SFT in the two rails at a location, and of SFT in straight track and in curved track are discussed. The relationship of SFT to rail temperature is also presented. Daily variation in rail temperature due to ambient air temperature is presented. Field trials showed that SFT can vary by 2 - 30 C during the day. Based on this finding and the derivation of an equation for change of SFT, an improvement in utilising rail creep measurements for assessing track condition has resulted. This finding suggests {{that it is possible to}} determine the SFT throughout a day rather than just a single SFT value. This paper also presents a simple track stability management tool that is based on two major parameters, namely rail stress and track resistance.

40|$|In wheel/rail contact, rolling {{phenomenon}} on {{the curved}} track {{can be much}} more complicated than that on the straight track, especially on a sharp curved track. Due to the influences of super-elevation (also called track cant), angle of attack (AOA) and rail cant, stress states on the high rail are significantly different from that on the low rail. Therefore, the appearances of damages on the low and high rails are different as well. These damages can result in the <b>rail</b> <b>failures,</b> subsequently leading to the vehicle derailments. In this paper, a realistic finite element model using Australian wheel/rail profiles (ANZR 1 wheel and 60. kg rail) was developed to investigate the wheel/rail contact on the low and high rail of a curved track under high adhesion condition. Based on the datum of contact stress states, surface damage mechanisms of the rail in curved track was determined. The new and worn profiles were utilized in the simulation to examine different contact situations: new wheel/new rail, new wheel/worn rail, and worn wheel/worn rail contacts. The obtained results showed that the two-point contact might appear on the high rail of the curved track and the stress distributions at each contact location were varied depending on the contact location and AOA. Moreover, the response of material at the rail head was predicted to be ratchetting.
