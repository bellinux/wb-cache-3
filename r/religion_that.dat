5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Satanic Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science. These forces {{are said to be}} manipulable by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> has been compared with Christian Science and Scientology.|$|E

5|$|The {{figure of}} Joan of Arc {{represents}} both a common {{person and a}} child that was free from society's corruption. Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding of politics and religion began to change, and this {{is reflected in the}} changes of Joan of Arc for the second edition. Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having a more traditional form of <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> was provided to her during her youth.|$|E
5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity. His second {{purpose was to}} identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in <b>religion,</b> <b>that</b> conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.|$|E

50|$|Some {{scholars}} classify religions {{as either}} universal <b>religions</b> <b>that</b> seek worldwide acceptance and actively {{look for new}} converts, or ethnic <b>religions</b> <b>that</b> are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts. Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.|$|R

5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms. It was the <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-first century AD, Christianity {{took root}} in Egypt {{and it was}} {{originally}} seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> sought to win converts from Egyptian Religion and Greco-Roman religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out. In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples. Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed. As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak their language, {{the ability to read}} hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.|$|E
5|$|In {{the revival}} of neo-Platonism Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's {{greatest}} works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift {{took place in the}} way that intellectuals approached <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> was reflected in many other areas of cultural life. In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars {{for the first time since}} late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, would help pave the way for the Protestant Reformation.|$|E

5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species {{appeared}} human when having personal contacts with {{the descendants of the}} humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jackson {{was working with}} Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Films to {{purchase}} the film rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, while 20th Century Fox was trying to hire him for the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes. Jackson turned down Planet of the Apes and because Weinstein was taking longer than expected to buy The Lord of the Rings rights, Jackson decided {{to move forward on}} King Kong. Weinstein was furious, and, as a result, Jackson proposed a deal between Universal and Miramax that the two studios would equally finance King Kong with Jackson's production company Wingnut Films. Universal would receive distribution rights in the United States, while Miramax would cover foreign territories. Jackson was also warranted the right of final cut privilege, a percentage of the gross profits, as well as artistic control; Universal allowed all filming and visual effects to be handled entirely in New Zealand. The deal was settled in April 1996, and Jackson, along with wife Fran Walsh, began working on the King Kong script. In the original draft, Ann was the daughter of famed English archaeologist Lord Linwood Darrow exploring ancient ruins in Sumatra. They would come into conflict with Denham during his filming, and they would uncover a hidden Kong statue and the map of Skull Island. This would indicate that the island natives were the last remnants of a cult <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> had once thrived on Asia's mainland. Instead of a playwright, Jack was the first mate and an ex-World War I fighter pilot still struggling with the loss of his best friend, who had been killed in battle during a World War I prologue. The camera-man Herb is the only supporting character in the original draft who made it to the final version. The fight between Kong and the three V. rex also changed from the original draft. In the draft, Ann is actually caught in the V. rex jaws, where she becomes wedged, and slashed by the teeth; after the fight, Kong gets her out but she is suffering from a fever, from which she then recovers.|$|E

25|$|Another {{version of}} this {{objection}} argues that for every <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> promulgates rules, there exists another <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> has rules of the opposite kind. If a certain action leads one closer to salvation in the former religion, it leads one further away from it in the latter. Therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion could be negative. Or, one could also argue that there are {{an infinite number of}} mutually exclusive religions (which is a subset of the set of all possible religions), and that the probability of any one of them being true is zero; therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion is zero.|$|E
25|$|It also sets a {{paradigm}} {{for the study}} of <b>religion</b> <b>that</b> focuses on the need to realise the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right.
