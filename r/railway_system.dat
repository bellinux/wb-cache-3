40|$|Petri Nets is {{a formal}} {{modelling}} language for modelling distributed systems and, in particular, notions of concurrency, non-determinism, communication and synchronisation. We have shown how Petri Nets {{provide a good}} framework for modelling <b>railway</b> <b>systems,</b> which are large and complex concurrent systems. The thesis consists of three main parts: - Using Petri Nets to model <b>railway</b> <b>systems</b> with a component based approach, mostly focusing on the trackwork of the systems. - Defining an algebraic technique for specifying and automatically constructing large scale Petri Nets, {{in the domain of}} <b>railway</b> <b>systems.</b> - Implementing a tool using this technique. In the thesis, Oslo subway is modelled using Petri Nets and the benefits of using formal analysis methods on <b>railway</b> <b>systems</b> are shown...|$|R

5|$|A <b>railway</b> <b>system</b> {{formerly}} known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the Interior Division to the port in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu) during the British occupation. The railway line connects Tanjung Aru in Kota Kinabalu to Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only <b>railway</b> <b>system</b> operating in East Malaysia. Today, the railway line is known as the Western Line and managed by the Sabah State Railway, providing daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the North Borneo Railway, which caters mainly for tourists. This antique steam train service only running on Saturday and Wednesday mornings from Tanjung Aru station to Kinarut station before returning back to the former station. In 2016, the Tanjung Aru railway station was moved to Aeropod with a new terminal and more public facilities.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the rapid {{development}} in <b>railway</b> <b>systems,</b> the need of formal methods in modelling such systems come into question day after day. The most important issue in <b>railway</b> <b>systems</b> is to provide safe transportation because no errors can be tolerated in <b>railway</b> <b>systems</b> and errors can sometimes result in fatal accidents. From this point of view, it is an obligation to use reliable signalization and interlocking systems to provide safety. In this study, supervisory control approach by inhibitor arcs is applied for signalization and interlocking design of a railway yard...|$|R
