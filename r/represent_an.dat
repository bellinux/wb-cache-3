5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E

This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, {{as shown by the}} preserved alveoli.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} Tribal Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it was}} a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested.

Many historians are convinced that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E

Two other teeth {{have been identified as}} upper premolars of Ferugliotherium; as with the jaw fragment, they may also <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> indeterminate multituberculate. One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps, of which one contains four and the other at least two cusps. The other is more poorly preserved, but may represent the same tooth position. These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars.|$|E

In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. LACM 149371, an enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> upper molar of an animal related to Ferugliotherium.

5|$|Acrocanthosaurus may {{be known}} from less {{complete}} remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. A tooth from southern Arizona has {{been referred to}} the genus, and matching tooth marks have been found in sauropod bones from the same area. Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> eastern representative of the genus. Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most of these have been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

5|$|As the Osiris myth first {{appears in}} the Pyramid Texts, most of its {{essential}} features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story {{by the time of}} the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain maat, and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> early tradition of ritualized mourning.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać {{entered a}} {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK {{came close to}} capturing the town from the Bosniak-dominated ARBiH. Bihać {{was seen as a}} strategic area by the international community. It was thought that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war, widening the division between the United States on one side and France and the United Kingdom on the other (advocating different approaches to the area's preservation), and feared that Bihać would become the worst humanitarian disaster of the war. Furthermore, denying Bihać to the Serbs was strategically important to Croatia. Brigadier General Krešimir Ćosić expected the VRS and the ARSK would threaten Karlovac and Sisak once they captured Bihać, while Chief of Croatia's General Staff General Janko Bobetko believed the fall of Bihać would <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E
5|$|P. l. mesopotamica or Mesopotamian lion, flourished {{during the}} Neo-Assyrian Period (approximately 1000–600 BC).

Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> extinct sub-species.
