5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies.

He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was <b>reported</b> <b>at</b> 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
