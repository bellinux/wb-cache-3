25|$|X-ray photons carry {{enough energy}} to ionize atoms and disrupt {{molecular}} bonds. This makes it a type of ionizing radiation, and therefore harmful to living tissue. A very high radiation dose over {{a short period of}} time causes radiation sickness, while lower doses can give an increased risk of <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancer.</b> In medical imaging this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination. The ionizing capability of X-rays can be utilized in cancer treatment to kill malignant cells using radiation therapy. It is also used for material characterization using X-ray spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the linear}} no-threshold model, any {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation, even at doses {{too low to}} produce any symptoms of radiation sickness, can induce cancer due to cellular and genetic damage.

25|$|There are {{two major}} {{databases}} that track radiation accidents: The American ORISE REAC/TS and the European IRSN ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of acute radiation syndrome, of which 127 were fatal. ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period. The two deliberate bombings {{are not included in}} either database, nor are any possible <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers</b> from low doses. The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a pre-existing condition undergoing radiotherapy. There may be multiple causes for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers</b> as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if they had any symptoms of ARS.

5000|$|The primary {{long-term}} health hazard associated with exposure to ionizing radiation {{as a result}} of nuclear fallout is an increased risk for cancers of the thyroid, other solid tumor cancers, and leukemia. The relationship between radiation exposure and subsequent cancer risk is considered [...] "the best understood, and certainly the most highly quantified, dose-response relationship for any common environmental human carcinogen", according to report by the National Cancer Institute. Overall, men in the United States develop cancer at a rate 22% higher than that of women. However, women develop cancer from radiation at a rate from 37.5% to 52% higher than that of men. In recent years, studies conducted by both the National Research Council and the EPA have confirmed that compared to men, women are at a significantly higher risk of <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers,</b> such and that women’s sensitivity to <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers</b> is much higher than was previously estimated.

40|$|ABSTRACT Interventional {{cardiology}} procedures {{can involve}} potentially {{high doses of}} radiation to the patients. Stochastic effects of ionising radiation – <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers</b> {{in the long term}} – may occur. We analysed clinical characteristics and dosimetric data in a population of patients undergoing interventional cardiology. In all, 1 591 patients who had undergone coronarography and/or angioplasty {{in the course of a}} year at the Saint-Gatien Clinic in Tours (France) were included. Information on patients’ individual clinical characteristics and Dose-Area Product values were collected. Organ doses to the lung, oesophagus, bone marrow and breast were mathematically evaluated. The median age of patients was 70 years. Their median cumulative dose-area product value was 48. 4 Gy. cm 2 for the whole year and the median effective dose was 9. 7 mSv. The median organ doses were 41 mGy for the lung, 31 mGy for the oesophagus, 10 mGy for the bone marrow and 4 mGy for the breast. Levels of doses close to the heart appear to be rather high in the case of repeated interventional cardiology procedures. Clinical characteristics should be taken into account when planning epidemiological studies on potential <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{radiation}} exposure for a mammogram is low. A study [15] reported that undergoing repeated mammograms over a time period of 34  years (annual from age 40 to 55  years and biennial from 56 to 74  years) entails {{a risk of}} <b>radiation-induced</b> breast <b>cancer</b> equal to 1 in every 1000 women screened. The {{risk of breast cancer}} in the female population of western countries is equal to at least one in every ten women. The first risk is 100 times smaller than the second, while the reduction in breast cancer mortality thanks to early detection with screening mammography is about 40  % [4]. Another study [16], applying a mortality reduction rate of 43  % as an effect of screening mammography, also considering the “minimal” risk of <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers,</b> found that biennial screening mammography performed in 100, 000 women age 50 – 69 saves 350 lives. However, for the 40 – 49 age range, the problem of radiation effects depends on the estimated magnitude of radiation-induced BCs in this younger age interval and must be more carefully considered. Importantly, even in the rare case of <b>radiation-induced</b> breast <b>cancer,</b> in a screening setting most of these will be detected early and treated. In symptomatic women, when a mammogram is necessary, the advantages always outweight the disadvanges, independently from the patient age.|$|R
30|$|For each dose, {{the risk}} varies greatly {{depending}} on the age (lower in the elderly) and gender (about 38 % higher in women than in men at all ages of life) [2]. Children are at substantially higher risk than adults because they have more rapidly dividing cells and a greater life expectancy. Thus, an infant or child patient has a longer lifetime risk for developing <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers</b> than adult patients. A recent study has reported that the average child in the US receives seven medical imaging tests involving radiation {{by the time he}} or she reaches the age of 18 [7].|$|R

40|$|There is a {{consensus}} that Chernobyl accident has induced thyroid cancer increase in children and adolescents.

A hypothesis is discussed in this paper that the increase of thyroid cancer was caused predominantly by the screening, overdiagnosis, and registration of nonirradiated persons as Chernobyl victims. A mechanism of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis is described that can be active even today, causing hypertherapy. Older neglected tumors found by the screening shortly after the Chernobyl accident or brought from noncontaminated areas were misclassified as aggressive <b>radiation-induced</b> <b>cancers.</b> Therefore, supposed markers of the <b>radiation-induced</b> thyroid <b>cancer,</b> such as the RET rearrangements, are probably associated with disease duration and tumor progression.
