50|$|Essentially, Rivière {{created a}} system in which he placed silhouettes of figures, animals, {{elements}} of landscapes, and so forth, within a wooden framework at three distances from the screen: the closest created an absolutely black silhouette, and the next two created gradations of black to gray, thus suggesting <b>recession</b> into <b>space.</b> Silhouettes could be moved across the screen on runners within the frame.|$|R
50|$|These early {{paintings}} have figures {{that are much}} more simplified than the realistic and detailed figures of his later stages. His signature use of brocade designs, gilding {{and the use of}} architectural spaces within painting are present, but the <b>recession</b> of <b>space</b> and use of perspective looks awkward and his figures look less realistic than the figures in his third stage after he refines his style.|$|R
5000|$|The {{foremost}} {{artists of}} the Muromachi period are the priest-painters Shūbun and Sesshū. Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of Shōkoku-ji, created in the painting [...] (1446) a realistic landscape with deep <b>recession</b> into <b>space.</b> Sesshū, unlike most {{artists of the}} period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. Landscape of the Four Seasons (Sansui Chokan; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.|$|R
50|$|Jan {{developed}} on the formula {{he learned from}} his father of arranging country figures traveling a road, which recedes into the distance. He emphasized the <b>recession</b> into <b>space</b> by carefully diminishing the scale of figures in the foreground, middle-ground, and far distance. To further the sense of atmospheric perspective, he used varying tones of brown, green, and blue progressively to characterize the <b>recession</b> of <b>space.</b> His landscapes with their vast depth are balanced through {{his attention to the}} peasant figures and their humble activities in the foreground.Like his father, Jan Brueghel also painted various village landscapes. He used the surrounding landscapes as the stage for the crowds of anecdotal, colorfully dressed peasants who engage in various activities in the market, the country roads and during the rowdy kermesses. Jan Brueghel's landcape paintings with their strong narrative elements and attention to detail had a significant influence on Flemish and Dutch landscape artists in the second decade of the 17th century. His river views were certainly known to painters working in Haarlem, including Esaias van de Velde and Willem Buytewech, whom Brueghel may have met there when he accompanied Peter Paul Rubens on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic in 1613.|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Tongue thrust and/or its {{consequent}} swallowing pattern are {{amongst the}} parafunctional habits that {{have always been}} considered as etiological factors for dental disorders by different investigators. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of tongue thrusting and the incidence of periodontal disorders associated with this habit among patients referred to the Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Material and Methods: Two hundred and eighty patients, undergoing first phase of periodontal therapy, were selected. Among them, those who had tongue thrusting were diagnosed and periodontal indices (probing depth, gingival <b>recession,</b> <b>spacing</b> and gingival enlargement) were measured. Also, crown-root ratio was assessed for each anterior tooth. Results: Tongue thrusting was seen in 27. 3 %of patients, whereas 29. 8 % and 33. 8 % of them showed an increase in periodontal pocket depths in their upper and lower jaws,respectively. Gingival recession was found in the upper jaw in 12. 98 % and in the lowerjaw in 49. 35 % of the cases. Crown to root length ratio in 24. 6 % of the upper incisors and 35. 1 % of the lower incisors were found to be higher than normal. Spacing was observed between the incisors in 31. 2 % and 41. 6 % of the patients in the upper and lower jaws, respectively. Finally 31. 2 % of the patients showed gingival enlargement. Conclusion: The results of the present study revealed a considerable increase in the prevalence of various periodontal diseases among these subjects. To minimize the clinical problems of such patients, prevention of periodontal diseases through excellent oral hygiene and regular dental visits are suggested...|$|R
2500|$|Shahn’s biographer Soby notes [...] "the {{composition}} of the mural at Roosevelt follows the undulant principle Shahn had learned from Diego Rivera: deep <b>recession</b> of <b>space</b> alternating with human and architectural details projected forward." [...] Moreover, the montage effectively intimates the amalgamation of peoples and cultures populating the urban landscape in the early 20th century. Multiple layers and perspectives fuse together to portray a complex industrialized system. Still, the mural maintains a sense of humanity; Shahn gives his figures a monumental quality through volume and scale. The urban architecture does not dwarf the people; instead, they work with the surroundings {{to build their own}} structure. Shahn captured the urgency for activism and reform, by showing gestures and mid-steps and freezing all the subjects in motion. This pictorial incorporation of [...] "athletic pose and evocative asymmetry of architectural detail" [...] is a Shahn trademark. While exemplifying his visual and social concerns, the mural characterizes the general issues of Shahn's milieu.|$|R
30|$|Agenesis of {{the upper}} lateral incisor occurs in roughly 2 % of the {{population}} [1]-[4] and comprises 20 % of all cases of agenesis [5]. The choice of treatment is influenced {{by a series of}} parameters linked to the patient's profile, the type of malocclusion, the shape and size of the teeth and the periodontal biotype [6]-[9]. There are two major treatment options for upper lateral incisor patients, namely space closure and canine substitution of the missing lateral incisor, or space opening and filling with a prosthetic implant. However, in the anterior sector, the prosthetic option {{may not be the best}} solution and cannot be considered a permanent treatment. Indeed, although single implants have relatively long lifespan, they may give rise to biological complications in the long term, for instance, an increase in infraocclusion progression rate [10]-[14], blue colouring of the labial gingiva [15], abutment exposure [12] and distal papilla <b>recession</b> [15],[16]. Hence, <b>space</b> closure is the preferred option for many dentists.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{sampling}} regimes rely on predetermined time or flow-weighted intervals {{at which}} to collect samples. During periods of high flow, such as storm events, automated samplers may {{run out of}} sample bottles {{before the end of}} the hydrograph, resulting in the loss of data and inaccurate load calculations. In this research, real-time monitoring sensor networks with automated samplers were used to monitor the flowrate in agricultural tile-drains and ditches. By characterizing site specific hydrographs, a model was developed that enabled the datalogger to create storm-specific sampling regimes, resulting in approximately 20 samples for each storm event that resulted in a significant hydrograph. The model uses a power-law relationship for defining each hydrograph’s <b>recession</b> curve and <b>spaces</b> sampling events at flow-weighted intervals over the expected recession. The model’s performance was found to be satisfactory when either average or best-fit values of the two model parameters were used to predict the recession curves. The average error in the cumulative flow represented by each recession sample in the six hydrographs analyzed was less than 10 %. The use of this model to create a storm-specific sampling regime eliminated the uncertainty in determining the flow-weighted sampling interval and led to the optimal usage of the sample bottles available in the automated sampler. ...|$|R
