While {{there are plenty of}} <b>routing</b> metrics and broadcast <b>routing</b> schemes in current literature, it remains an unsolved problem as to which metrics are compatible to a specific broadcast <b>routing</b> scheme. In particular, in the wireless broadcast <b>routing</b> context where transmission has an inherent broadcast property, there is a potential danger of incompatible combination of broadcast <b>routing</b> algorithms and metrics. This paper shows that different broadcast <b>routing</b> algorithms have different requirements on the properties of broadcast <b>routing</b> metrics. The metric properties for broadcast <b>routing</b> algorithms in both undirected network topologies and directed network topologies are developed and proved.

40|$|<b>Routing</b> {{management}} {{is an integral}} aspect of network management. <b>Routing</b> implements connectivity, the core functionality of networks. It {{is also one of}} the most complex network functionalities. The high complexity of <b>routing</b> results from the distributed calculation of network routes, the need to accommodate network policies when calculating routes, and the requirement for <b>routing</b> to be robust to network dynamics. Given this complexity, <b>routing</b> operations are challenging, time-consuming, and errorprone. In this thesis, we focus on two major problems that operators face in <b>routing</b> management, namely the <b>routing</b> visibility and the <b>routing</b> stability. <b>Routing</b> visibility refers to the knowledge of the routes that are used in data traffic forwarding, and <b>routing</b> stability refers to the frequency with which these routes change. <b>Routing</b> operations differ significantly according to the type of <b>routing</b> (intradomain vs. interdomain <b>routing)</b> and the type of network (enterprise vs. backbone network). We investigate these two problems in the following three operational environments: intradomain <b>routing</b> for enterprise networks, intradomain <b>routing</b> for backbone networks, and interdomain <b>routing</b> for backbone networks. We propose operationally viable solutions for <b>routing</b> visibility and <b>routing</b> stability in each network environment...|$|R
