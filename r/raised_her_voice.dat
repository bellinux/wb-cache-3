500|$|President Obama {{was visiting}} Australia and Indonesia when the {{discovery}} was made. Michelle Obama {{had returned to}} the White House on the morning of November 15, going to sleep shortly after arriving. An usher went to check on her later that day and began talking about the shooting, assuming she already knew about the incident. According to Leonnig, the first lady was [...] "furious", wondering why the director of the Secret Service, Mark J. Sullivan, who had accompanied her on her flight back to Washington, had not told her about it. Leonnig also stated that Sullivan was subsequently summoned to a meeting with the first lady, during which she [...] <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> so loudly she could be heard through the closed door. Sullivan disputes this report, though he declined to give any details regarding the conversation. A detailed inspection of the White House for evidence or damage and interviews with key witnesses began later that afternoon. Leonnig also stated that president Obama was angered over the flawed response and the failure to notify the first lady. According to one presidential aide, [...] "the shit really hit the fan" [...] when Obama returned from his travels five days later.|$|E
60|$|Marie <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> {{and called}} Miss Ophelia, {{from the other}} room.|$|E
60|$|We {{were now}} near the gate {{opposite}} the theatre. She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aweel! aweel! Ellangowan,' {{said the}} lady, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> as the Laird left the room, 'I wish ye may {{understand}} them yoursell, that's a'!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dont know." [...] Then, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{so as to}} be overheard, {{she exclaimed}} [...] "Here is a stupid man coming into our carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He might eat all {{the cake}} {{in the house}} for what I care," [...] said Mrs. Chinnery, turning very red, and <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little.|$|R
60|$|The wife <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to that wild, animal-like pitch a woman uses when desperate.|$|E
60|$|Josephine laughed. Then she saw Phipps {{standing}} {{in the background and}} she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little.|$|E
6000|$|... "Silly old Concertina! Hark at him, George!" [...] She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Don't sing that, you old Walrus, you! Sing 'I'm afloat!'" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{saw that}} her mother wished to speak, and leaned down over her, for Madame Duchesne could not as yet <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> above a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "'They are poets still--incorrigible!' {{answered}} the lady; then slightly <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> of silver, as a beautiful appearance in a toga drew near, she cried 'Catullo mio!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we don't want them," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Kybird, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "and I don't {{want any}} of your impudence. Get up out of our chair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{only the}} words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,' {{answered}} the old woman; and she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and went on: ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> at each entreaty {{until it}} almost reached a shriek, {{and then her}} whole frame seemed to sink down into the bed from exhaustion.|$|E
60|$|The child nodded, gratefully. Then, {{leaning against}} {{the face of the}} cliff, she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and warbled clearly the bit of song that served as the signal to her father.|$|E
6000|$|The hymn {{died away}} in its low cadence, and then, ere Eustacie had {{had time to}} think of the {{consequences}} of thus <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> the new-comer demanded: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho! carn’t I?" [...] {{said the}} lady, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little. [...] "You go an’ {{tell him that}} his lawful wedded wife, what he deserted, is aboard." ...|$|R
60|$|She did not <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> above <b>her</b> breath, or address us, {{but said}} this to the night sky; then stood profoundly quiet, looking at the gloomy water.|$|R
60|$|She had <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little, {{thinking}} the man might be asleep. But no sound answered her, save {{from outside the}} cry of a bird frightened by some midnight prowler.|$|E
60|$|Madam <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{in saying}} this, and nodded significantly; but a mild snore {{from the other}} room seemed to assure her that it was a waste of shot to fire in that direction.|$|E
60|$|Hall {{tried to}} convey {{everything}} by grimaces and dumb show, but Mrs. Hall was obdurate. She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> So Hall and Henfrey, rather crestfallen, tiptoed {{back to the}} bar, gesticulating to explain to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember, I want {{to belong}} to your society--remember," [...] she added, having to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little, and {{shutting}} the door upon {{the rest of her}} words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be careful. That {{woman is}} a cat. Stay and talk to me. Please don't bother, Mr. Lessingham. Won't you ring the bell instead?" [...] she continued, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{there was a}} loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> in a wail of expostulation and dismay.|$|R
60|$|Inside the cab {{the spell}} of silence, {{in which the two}} women had endured {{shoulder}} to shoulder the jolting, rattling, and jingling of the journey, had been broken by Stevie’s outbreak. Winnie <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
60|$|Laura {{stretched}} out her hands for the box, and standing upon the rock shelf, with one shoe burst and her skirt badly rent, <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{as she had}} done in that spot once before.|$|E
60|$|Yet, so {{were her}} words accented, that the entreaty sounded like command, and the command like entreaty. They {{remained}} still and stubborn, until she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to a height which argued at once impatience and absolute command.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] she said, {{quite in}} a whisper; and, indeed, {{she could hardly}} <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> above a whisper, fearing that tears would fall from her {{tell-tale}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Annie's," [...] said Jane, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{above the}} din. [...] "I don't know which has {{improved}} the most. I'm sure {{the way they}} both drink their tea now--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time we started," [...] said Mrs. Banks, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{above the}} din. [...] "Cap’in Barber, you and Mr. Gibson {{and the other}} gentlemen had better get to the church." ...|$|R
60|$|She had <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> boldly accusing him, {{inwardly}} {{knowing that}} the accusation was groundless, yet wishing to goad him now into passion, into explanation, above all into acquiescence if it still lay in her power to force it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Micawber having now <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> into {{a perfect}} scream, I was so frightened that I {{ran off to}} the club-room, and {{disturbed}} Mr. Micawber {{in the act of}} presiding at a long table, and leading the chorus of ...|$|E
6000|$|One of the {{fugitive}} maidens appeared reconnoitring in the distance. When she observed her mistress {{in the arms}} of one of her own people, her courage revived, and, desirous of rallying her scattered companions, she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> and sang: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George!" [...] cried Mrs. Fillson, {{who was a}} fine woman, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{almost to}} a scream {{in the effort to}} make herself heard above the winch of a {{neighbouring}} steamer.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{in a tone}} {{of gentle}} pleading, she said, [...] "I came over the sea. I am hungry, and so is the child. Will you not give us some milk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had to drop}} {{behind a}} little," [...] said Miss Nugent, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Aunt and Dr. Murchison will talk about their {{complaints}} to each other! They have been exchanging prescriptions." ...|$|R
