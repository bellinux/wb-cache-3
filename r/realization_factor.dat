40|$|Perturbation <b>realization</b> <b>factor</b> is an {{important}} concept in perturbation analysis of both queueing systems and Markov systems. A perturbation <b>realization</b> <b>factor</b> measures {{the effect of a}} perturbation on the system performance. This concept is important for the performance sensitivity and performance optimization of these systems. Since the perturbations in queueing systems are continuous in nature and those in Markov systems are discrete, it is not straightforward to establish the relationship between these two types of fundamental concepts. This note solves this long-standing problem. We find a formula that links these two types of perturbation realization factors in Gordon-Newell and open Jackson networks together. The results enhance our understanding of perturbation analysis and lead to new research directions...|$|E
40|$|Grid {{computing}} is {{the federation}} of pooling resources {{so as to}} solve large-scale problems. Scheduling is the main issue in grid computing and {{is the process of}} making scheduling decisions over multiple grid resources. In this paper, we propose a scheduling technique which classifies the subtasks based on the priority assigned by the user. This is mainly applicable in places where the high priority critical subtasks may need to be scheduled prior to other low priority subtasks. We thus segregate the subtasks into three queues based on their priority. Subtasks within each queue are reordered based on two new parameters, viz. complexity factor and <b>realization</b> <b>factor,</b> with computational complexity defined as the time of computation of a process. We evaluate the <b>realization</b> <b>factor</b> as the product of number of operations per cycle per processor and the speed of the processor. The subtasks are assigned high priority when both complexity factor and <b>realization</b> <b>factor</b> are high. Once the processes are classified into three queues we make use of a technique similar to round robin that reduces starvation of low and medium priority subtasks. The effectiveness of Starvation free (SF) Scheduling algorithm is evaluated through simulation results...|$|E
40|$|We study a {{fundamental}} {{feature of the}} generalized semi-Markov processes (GSMPs), called event coupling. The event coupling reflects the logical behavior of a GSMP that specifies which events can be affected by any given event. Based on the event-coupling property, GSMPs can be classified into three classes: the strongly coupled, the hierarchically coupled, and the decomposable GSMPs. The event-coupling property on a sample path of a GSMP can be represented by the event-coupling trees. With the event-coupling tree, we can quantify {{the effect of a}} single perturbation on a performance measure by using <b>realization</b> <b>factors.</b> A set of equations that specifies the <b>realization</b> <b>factors</b> is derived. We show that the sensitivity of steady-state performance with respect to a parameter of an event lifetime distribution can be obtained by a simple formula based on <b>realization</b> <b>factors</b> and that the sample-path performance sensitivity converges to the sensitivity of the steady-state performance with probability one as the length of the sample path goes to infinity. This generalizes the existing results of perturbation analysis of queueing networks to GSMPs...|$|R

40|$|After the {{intensive}} studies of queueing {{theory in the}} past decades, many excellent results in performance analysis have been obtained, and successful examples abound. However, exploring special features of queueing systems directly in performance optimization {{still seems to be}} a territory not very well cultivated. Recent progresses of perturbation analysis (PA) and sensitivity-based optimization provide a new perspective of performance optimization of queueing systems. PA utilizes the structural information of queueing systems to efficiently extract the performance sensitivity information from a sample path of system. This paper gives a brief review of PA and performance optimization of queueing systems, focusing on a fundamental concept called perturbation <b>realization</b> <b>factors,</b> which captures the special dynamic feature of a queueing system. With the perturbation <b>realization</b> <b>factors</b> as building blocks, the performance derivative formula and performance difference formula can be obtained. With performance derivatives, gradient-based optimization can be derived, while with performance difference, policy iteration and optimality equations can be derived. These two fundamental formulas provide a foundation for performance optimization of queueing systems from a sensitivity-based point of view. We hope this survey may provide some inspirations on this promising research topic. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Sewoon complex {{which has been}} the icon of modern development in Seoul, South Korea. The Sewoon complex was built in the late 1960 s under the Military Government with new propaganda ‘Life revolution’ that forced fast development of economy and breaking away from the tradition. This mighty modern icon, 1 kilometer long and 50 meter wide, showed a modern utopia that was expressed by mega structure, complex functions, roads system only for vehicles, and elevated pedestrian deck. This paper describes the backgrounds of the Sewoon complex through 10 <b>realization</b> <b>factors</b> which influenced the birth of this complex both directly and indirectly; new propaganda for development, dictatorship and personalities invested with power, the site, the first ideas to redevelopment, aiming mega structure, attractive design as urban infrastructure, slum clearance & relocation, unofficial process, construction by private capital, and extended new modern vision. These 10 <b>realization</b> <b>factors</b> show a coincidence and an inevitability of development that came from social, economic, political and spatial aspects. The architectural ideas which were connected with international trends of modern architectures and inspirations from an architect were partly realized by private capital and the Military government. The first plan of the Sewoon complex included modern idealism to change radically old inner area and transform Seoul to a modern city, but it have been functioning reversely to protect inner city from the huge development pressure. The transplant of mega structure under the propaganda ‘ife revolution’ has made different rules and relationships with neighborhood area that implies limitations of modern idealism and possibilities of self-organization with neighborhood. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previous}} works, {{we have shown}} that policy iteration algorithms in performance optimization follow directly from performance difference formulas. In this paper, we show that based on this idea, we can develop policy iteration type of optimization algorithms for "policies" that depend on system parameters.

First we establish the performance difference formula. Then we show that a service rate-based policy iteration algorithm can be developed using the aggregation of perturbation <b>realization</b> <b>factors.</b> The algorithm can be used to optimize the customer-average performance, which is another important performance metric compared with the traditional time-average performance.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show the {{possibilities}} of spatial modelling and analysing of assumptions of tourism development in the Czech Republic with the objective to make decision-making processes in tourism easier and more efficient (for companies, clients as well as destination managements). The development and placement of tourism depend on the factors (conditions) that influence its application in specific areas. These factors are usually divided into three groups: selective, localization and realization. Tourism is inseparably connected with space – countryside. The countryside can be modelled and consecutively analysed by the means of geographical information technologies. With the help of spatial modelling and following analyses the localization and realization conditions in the regions of the Czech Republic have been evaluated. The best localization conditions have been found in the Liberecký region. The capital city of Prague has negligible natural conditions; however, those social ones are on a high level. Next, the spatial analyses have shown that the best realization conditions are provided by the capital city of Prague. Then the Central-Bohemian, South-Moravian, Moravian-Silesian and Karlovarský regions follow. The development of tourism destination is depended not only on the localization and <b>realization</b> <b>factors</b> but it is basically affected by the level of local destination management.
