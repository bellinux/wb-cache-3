40|$|Compared to the pre-launch measurements, the {{in-orbit}} {{noise levels}} of the Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) detectors show a significant increase, considerably lowering the overall sensitivity. Cosmic ray impacts on the detectors and/or on the instrument electronics {{play an important role}} in the noise levels and consequently many observations of faint sources are affected by this increased noise. However, by taking advantage of the high <b>read-out</b> <b>frequency</b> of 24 Hz and the redundancies provided by the observing strategy, it is possible to significantly improve the quality of the data. Here, we present the concept of self-calibration and additional algorithms, which are successfully applied to recover the weak signals of molecular hydrogen lines undetectable in a standard data reduction. 1. Introduction The SWS AOT 2 grating observing mode (de Graauw et al. 1996) is designed to observe spectral lines and a small range of the surrounding continuum with a spectral resolution =Δ ar [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Wide {{dynamic range}} (WDR) CMOS imaging sensors (CIS) are being {{designed}} for new portable, implantable and sensory applications, which demand low power consumption. Compared to normal CISs, high quality WDR CISs generally consume much more power Up to now, the power consumption of a WDR CIS {{has never been}} formally studied. This paper focuses to model and analyze the power consumption of two major WDR CIS designs Analytical equations are derived for the WDR CIS power. and are verified with HSPICE simulations. The analysis indicates that the power consumption of WDR CISs {{is dominated by the}} column bus driving power for large imaging array, while photocurrent related power is negligible. Hence, the WDR CIS power is heavily dependent on the load of the column bus and the <b>read-out</b> <b>frequency.</b> A new partial quantization scheme is developed to acquire WDR images with greatly reduced react-out frequencies. Its power consumption is also analytically derived and verified with HSPICE simulations. A 256 x 256 partial quantization column consumes about 124 0 nW/pixel in the 035 mu m CMOS process for 16 -bit dynamic range and 30 Hz frame rate. The power analysis is further verified by experimental measurements of a proof-of-concept 32 x 32 partial quantization imaging sensor in the 0 35 mu m CMOS process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} demonstrated that superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs) behave as weak-links due to longitudinally induced superconductivity from the leads with higher Tc. In this work we study {{the implication of}} this behaviour for TES-based bolometers and microcalorimeter under ac bias. The TESs are <b>read-out</b> at <b>frequencies</b> between 1 and 5 MHz by a Frequency Domain Multiplexer based on a linearised two-stage SQUID amplifier and high- Q lithographically made superconducting LC resonators. In particular, we focus on SRON TiAu TES bolometers with a measured dark Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) of 3. 2 · 10 ^- 19 W/Hz^ 1 / 2 developed for the short wavelength band for the instrument SAFARI on the SPICA telescope.

40|$|Rydberg atom-based {{electrometry}} enables traceable {{electric field}} measurements with high sensitivity {{over a large}} frequency range, from gigahertz to terahertz. Such measurements are particularly useful for the calibration of radio frequency and terahertz devices, {{as well as other}} applications like near field imaging of electric fields. We utilize frequency modulated spectroscopy with active control of residual amplitude modulation to improve the signal to noise ratio of the optical readout of Rydberg atom-based radio frequency electrometry. Matched filtering of the signal is also implemented. Although we have reached similarly, high sensitivity with other <b>read-out</b> methods, <b>frequency</b> modulated spectroscopy is advantageous because it is well-suited for building a compact, portable sensor. In the current experiment, ∼ 3 μ V cm^- 1 Hz^- 1 / 2 sensitivity is achieved and is found to be photon shot noise limited. Comment: 18 Pages, 6 Figure...|$|R

In addition, the capability to detect concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as 2, 6 dinitroluene (DNT) as low as 1. 5 ppb (4. 7 ag/μm 2) is experimentally verified...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} read-out circuit {{analysis of}} the VCO based APS CMOS image sensor is presented in this paper. According to the mathematic analysis and simulation results, the read-out speed should be decreased when reducing the bias current. Moreover, the feature of the device gain factor and the source follower's threshold voltage are investigated, showing important effects with respect to not only the read-out time but also the energy consumption. The proposed VCO based <b>read-out</b> circuit and <b>frequency</b> counter consist an equivalent bandpass filter. According to the transfer function analysis of this equivalent filter, the noise cancellation efficiency is jointly determined by the bias current, device gain factor and source follower's threshold voltage, which constitute the basic principles for high-speed low-noise CMOS APS image sensor design. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} theoretical {{study for}} {{the operation of the}} surface-acoustic-wave diode storage correlator is presented. A circuit model describing the device is developed which is used to analyze the signal storage characteristics and the different read-out modes of operation for both p-n and Schottky diode structures. The calculated predictions of the proposed theory are in excellent agreement with experimental data published by independent researchers. The theory presented is self consistent and takes into account, for the first time, the minority carrier lifetime in the dynamics of charging the p-n diode structures which was neglected in previous theories. A straightforward transmission line theory approach is developed for finding the surface-wave amplitude excited by the diode potential during the <b>read-out</b> process. The <b>frequency</b> response characteristics predicted for these structures is a fairly slowly varying function of frequency; hence such correlators are essentially bandlimited by the input and output surface-wave transducers...|$|R
40|$|The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a {{dedicated}} 10 -meter diameter telescope optimized for mm-wavelength {{surveys of the}} Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with arcminute resolution. The first instrument deployed at SPT features a 960 element array of horn-coupled bolometers. These devices consist of fully lithographed spider-web absorbers and aluminum-titanium bilayer transition edge sensors fabricated on adhesive-bonded silicon wafers with embedded metal backplanes. The focal plane is cooled using a closed cycle pulse-tube refrigerator, and <b>read-out</b> using <b>Frequency</b> Domain Multiplexed Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs.) Design features were chosen to optimize sensitivy in the atmospheric observing bands available from the ground, and for stability with the frequency domain multiplexed readout system employed at SPT, and performance was verified {{with a combination of}} laboratory tests and field observations. In 2008 the SPT surveyed 200 square-degrees at 150 and 220 GHz. These data have been analyzed using a cross-spectrum analysis and multi-band Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter fitting using a model that includes lensed primary CMB anisotropy, secondary thermal (tSZ) and kinetic (kSZ) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich anisotropies, unclustered synchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. In addition to measuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, the data primarily constrain a linear combination of the kSZ and tSZ anisotropy contributions (at 150 GHz and ell= 3000) : D tSZ 3000 + 0. 5 D kSZ 3000 = 4. 5 ± 1. 0 &mu K 2, and place the lowest limits yet measured on secondary anisotropy power...|$|R
