5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the different ethnic groups of the Dutch East Indies– modern day Indonesia– began to feel a sense of national unity, as eventually formulated in the 1928 Youth Pledge. These native groups founded political parties to further their goals and <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> political ideologies, including the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian National Party.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, NMP Paulin Tay Straughan {{has argued that}} NMPs, being non-partisan, do not replace either PAP or {{opposition}} MPs. During general elections, Singaporeans still continue to elect MPs who best <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> interests, and NMPs do not feature in the equation. In other words, the NMP scheme has never compromised the democratic process of free elections.|$|E

Rodríguez was one {{of several}} Major League Baseball players that committed to <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> birthplaces before the organization of the tournament.

5|$|The {{character}} has been criticised by police detectives {{who felt that}} Marsden's habit of discussing investigation details with suspects (as her colleagues accepted bribes) did not properly <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> profession. In response, the BBC said it had sought advice from a police consultant for storylines involving Marsden.|$|E

50|$|This {{is done by}} a very {{elaborate}} stage design, {{whereby the}} stage is divided {{into a number of}} different areas, each containing its own part of the action. In addition, each of the major characters - Orpheus, Euridice and Aristaeus - appear in three forms: as a singer who <b>represents</b> <b>their</b> human forms; as a mime, <b>representing</b> <b>their</b> heroic selves; and as a puppet, <b>representing</b> <b>their</b> myths. Also, individual events may occur within the opera on several occasions, as they are being predicted, as they happen, and as they are being remembered.|$|R

5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to {{pledge not to}} <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E
5|$|District councils are chiefly {{responsible}} for waste management and construction projects within their respective districts. They each maintain their own budgets, although the metropolitan mayor reserves {{the right to}} review district decisions. One-fifth of all district council members, including the district mayors, also <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> districts in the Municipal Council. All members of the district councils and the Municipal Council, including the metropolitan mayor, are elected to five-year terms. Representing the Justice and Development Party, Kadir Topbaş has been Mayor of Istanbul since March 2004.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown {{has many}} {{additional}} groups representing national, ethnic, and linguistic interests. Georgetown's has {{the second most}} politically active student body in the United States according to the Princeton Review. Groups based on local, national, and international issues are popular, and political speech is protected on campus. Student political organizations are active on campus and engage their many members in local and national politics. The Georgetown University College Republicans <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> party, while the Georgetown University College Democrats, the largest student organization on campus in 2008, represent theirs.|$|E

5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E
5|$|More than 50 {{national}} {{governing bodies}} regulate and organise their sports in Wales. Most {{of those involved}} in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympics Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team.|$|E

With the Xindi superweapon about to be armed and time running out, Captain Jonathan Archer tries to persuade the Xindi-Aquatics to help destroy it. Sato's kidnapping, and Archer's promises {{to shut down the}} 70-plus known spheres, finally convinces the Aquatics into believing that the Sphere Builders, and not the humans, may indeed <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> true enemy.|$|E
5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most basic level of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid {{were again}} victorious when Hampden Park hosted the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final, {{defeating}} Bayer Leverkusen, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the winning goal with a left-foot volley. Hampden has since hosted the 2007 UEFA Cup Final {{and was one}} of the venues for football at the 2012 Summer Olympics. One of the 2012 Olympics matches was delayed after the North Korean team protested against the flag of South Korea being used to <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> players. Later in 2012, a Scotland women's national football team game was played at Hampden for the first time, when it hosted the first leg of a European Championship qualifying playoff against Spain.|$|E

5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{consists}} of a gold torch that represents liberty and enlightenment; the rays around the torch <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> far-reaching influence. The nineteen stars represent Indiana's place as the nineteenth state to join the United States. The thirteen stars in the outer loop symbolize the original Thirteen Colonies, the five inner stars represent the next five states added to the Union, and the one large star above the torch represents Indiana.|$|E
5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to <b>represent</b> <b>their</b> concerns and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E
