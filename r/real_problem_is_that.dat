To fight this abusive misogynistic culture, a number of Moroccan women have stood up to their abusers. There is also a demand to uphold the law {{to ensure the safety of}} women, and to punish the abuser. Despite the fact that there is a law that protects women from abuse, the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no tangible intention to pursue apply it.|$|E

He objects to the 'blaming ourselves' habit of the Dutch, even quoting the queen's Christmas message after the Van Gogh murder in which she said on equal terms that 'extremism in both word and deed' was dividing the country. As long as people didn't call for violence you should allow them their speech. He agreed however with interviewer Boudewijn Geels that one could expect politicians {{to be a little}} more careful.

5000|$|The University of the North was {{established}} in 1959 under the apartheid regime's policy of separate ethnically-based {{institutions of higher learning}} policy. The university was sited at Turfloop farm about 40 km east of Pietersburg. The town that grew around the university was named Sovenga, for the three ethnic groups (Sotho, Venda, Tsonga) that Apartheid ideology intended to study there. In reality, most inhabitants refer to the town as Mankweng, after one of the chiefs of the area. Under later apartheid, the University of the North served as a [...] "model" [...] university where dignitaries were brought to show the [...] "viability" [...] of the separate facilities. As such, it received heavy government subsidies, but the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the students that the university supposedly served were so under-resourced in their standard education that the quality of instruction was placed under incredible demands.|$|R
50|$|Bankers {{felt the}} <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the United States {{was the last}} major country without a central bank, which might provide {{stability}} and emergency credit in times of financial crisis. While segments of the financial community were worried about the power that had accrued to JP Morgan and other 'financiers', most were {{more concerned about the}} general frailty of a vast, decentralized banking system that could not regulate itself without the extraordinary intervention of one man. Financial leaders who advocated a central bank with an elastic currency after the Panic of 1907 included Frank Vanderlip, Myron T. Herrick, William Barret Ridgely, George E. Roberts, Isaac Newton Seligman and Jacob H. Schiff. They stressed the need for an elastic money supply that could expand or contract as needed. After the scare of 1907 the bankers demanded reform; the next year, Congress established a commission of experts {{to come up with a}} nonpartisan solution.|$|R

5000|$|Figure 5 is {{an example}} of using both the IIR hilbert (...) {{function}} and the FIR approximation. In the example, a sine function is created by computing the Discrete Hilbert transform of a cosine function, which was processed in four overlapping segments, and pieced back together. As the FIR result (blue) shows, the distortions apparent in the IIR result (red) are not caused by the difference between hn and hNn (green and red in Fig 3). The fact that hNn is tapered (windowed) is actually helpful in this context. The <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's not windowed enough. Effectively, M = N, whereas the overlap-save method needs M < N.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} Brentano’s theory of {{judgment}} {{is not the}} idea that all judgments are existential judgments (though it is sometimes a very complex enterprise to transform an ordinary judgment into an existential one), the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Brentano made no distinction between object and presentation. A presentation exists as an object in your mind. So you cannot really judge that A does not exist, {{because if you do}} so you also judge that the presentation is not there (which is impossible, according to Brentano’s idea that all judgments have the object which is judged as presentation). Twardowski acknowledged this problem and solved it by denying that the object is equal to the presentation. This is actually only a change within Brentano’s theory of perception, but has a welcome consequence for the theory of judgment, viz. that you can have a presentation (which exists) {{but at the same time}} judge that the object does not exist.|$|E

[...] Levy's remarks about Russians produced accusations of racism from such as Eddie Zhensker, executive director of the Russian advocacy NGO Morashtenu, who accused Levy of [...] "brute and coarse prejudices". Immigrant Absorption Minister Sofa Landver demanded <b>that</b> Levy <b>be</b> placed on trial.

5000|$|The Looking Glass War (Columbia, 1968-69) - Clayton was {{originally}} attached {{to direct the}} screen adaptation of the John le Carré novel, with a script by his friend Mordecai Richler. Richler later claimed that he and Clayton walked off the project due to interference from Columbia Pictures (thereby earning Clayton {{a reputation for being}} 'difficult'.). Richler's biographer Reinhold Kramer suggested <b>that</b> the <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Clayton <b>was</b> unable to raise enough money to get the movie into production, but Neil Sinyard asserts that Columbia cancelled the film after Clayton refused to accede to changes the studio had ordered to Richter's script, and he and Richeler resigned from the production. Clayton himself also opined (in a letter to Le Carré) that he suspected <b>that</b> Columbia <b>was</b> short of money after the expensive failure of Casino Royale, and that the studio had bought the rights to the novel without realising <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> [...] "not James Bond". The project was eventually revived under director Frank R. Pierson, who jettisoned Richler's screenplay and made the film from his own adapted script, although <b>that</b> proved to <b>be</b> a critical and commercial flop.|$|R

However, Robinson goes on to write [...] "She's a fantasy wish-fulfillment character with outsized skills, an inhuman reaction time, and a clever answer to every question—but so are the other major Star Wars heroes". Other outlets have argued that the term carries an inherent gender bias, and that categorizing Rey as a [...] "Mary Sue" [...] holds her to a double standard as the male characters from the original trilogy did not face comparable criticism. Caroline Framke of Vox wrote [...] "While my kneejerk reaction to criticism of Rey was that it's absolutely in the wrong, I have to admit that questioning her merits isn't inherently misogynistic.
