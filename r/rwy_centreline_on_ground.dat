40|$|Rubber-modified {{materials}} show {{a complex}} fracture behaviour. In a previous paper {{the influence of}} a rigid PMMA circular inclusion with a rubber ring surrounding it embedded in a PMMA matrix, on the dynamic fracture mode was investigated. In the present experimental study, the same model system was used to investigate the effect of eccentricity of the initial crack path from the specimen <b>centreline</b> <b>on</b> which the complex inclusion centre is located, on the dynamic crack propagation mode. This effect was studied by using high-speed photography and dynamic caustics. It was shown that the eccentricity of the initial crack path largely determines both the crack propagation delay observed as the crack approaches the complex inclusion and the bifurcation of the crack. It was also found that the maximum crack propagation velocity, the length of the crack path along the interface, as well as the angle of incidence with which the propagating crack meets the interface, increase as the eccentricity increases. © 1990 Chapman and Hall Ltd...|$|R
