40|$|There {{were two}} {{goals of the}} present study: (1) to revise and improve <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> of two {{learning}} disability subtypes, namely Basic Phonological Processing Disorder (BPPD) and Nonverbal Learning Disabilities (NLD); and (2) to validate those <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> by differentiating children classified as BPPD and NLD through comparisons of their psychosocial functioning. The first goal {{of the study was}} addressed using a sample of 207 clinic-referred children with a learning disability. The <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> of BPPD and NLD were refined and changes made in order to improve the utility of the rules and render them easier to use. Subsequently, the second goal was met when the revised <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> were applied to a new sample of 617 clinic-referred children with a learning disability, forming two groups whose differing patterns of psychosocial functioning on two separate measures were used to provide validation <b>for</b> the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification.</b> Additional information was also obtained with regard to the patterns of psychosocial functioning characteristic of these two groups. For BPPD, that pattern was consistent with a normal degree of psychosocial adjustment. Psychosocial dysfunction was of low severity, when present. The BPPD group also demonstrated a trend towards an increasing incidence of somatic concerns with advancing age. For the NLD group, the characteristic pattern of psychosocial functioning was suggestive of internalized psychopathology with a severe degree of dysfunction, when present. The NLD group also demonstrated an increasing incidence of severe and internalized forms of psychosocial dysfunction with age. These findings confirm the idea that an individual 2 ̆ 7 s psychosocial functioning is tied to his or her particular pattern of neuropsychological assets and deficits, which allows predictions to be made for these two learning disability subtypes.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{development of}} data mining techniques for {{the discovery of}} knowledge from training samples <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> problems in industrial engineering is necessary in applications, such as group technology. This paper proposes a learning algorithm, which {{can be viewed as}} a knowledge acquisition tool, to effectively discover fuzzy association <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> problems. The consequence part of each rule is one class label. The proposed learning algorithm consists of two phases: one to generate large fuzzy grids from training samples by fuzzy partitioning in each attribute, and the other to generate fuzzy association <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> problems by large fuzzy grids. The proposed learning algorithm is implemented by scanning training samples stored in a database only once and applying a sequence of Boolean operations to generate fuzzy grids and fuzzy rules; therefore, it can be easily extended to discover other types of fuzzy association rules.

40|$|International audienceClassification through Graph-based semi-supervised {{learning}} algorithms can {{be viewed}} as a diffusion process with restart on the labels. In this work, we exploit this equivalence to introduce a novel algorithm which relies on the formulation of a non-local diffusion process, fueled by the γ-th power of the standard Laplacian matrix Lγ, with 0 < γ < 1. This approach allows to jump in one step between far apart nodes and such long-range transitions, called Lévy Flights, entail a wider exploration of the graph. In the present contribution, we embed such mechanism in graph based semi-supervised algorithms to improve the classification outcome, even in settings traditionally poorly performing such as unbalanced classes, and we derive a theoretical <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> decision...|$|E

The CMM classifier has been tested on several benchmarks and, comparing with a simple k-NN classifier, it gave less than 1 % lower accuracy and over 4 and 12 times speed-ups in software and hardware respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a flexible statistical pattern recognition approach to the transient stability evaluation of electric power systems. This approach is based on statistical decision theory. The classifier that is used implements the Bayes decision <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification.</b> A flexible point-estimates method is used to provide accurate values of the statistics that are required in the classification procedures. The method makes its prediction by using the machine's initial rotor acceleration after the occurrence of a large disturbance. The results that can be obtained from the application of the developed method are illustrated by the analysis of a synchronous machine connected to an infinite bus through a power system. The method is able to provide stability evaluations both for large electric power systems and for the industrial ones. © 1991...|$|E
40|$|Of crucial {{importance}} to the successful use of artificial neural networks for pattern classification problems is how the appropriate network size can be automatically determined. We address this issue by formulating the process as an automatic search {{in the space of}} functions that corresponds to a subclass of multilayer feedforward networks. Learning is thus a dynamic network construction process which involves adjusting both the network weights and the topology. Adding new hidden units corresponds to extracting higher-level features from the original input features for reducing the residual classification errors. It can be shown that the resultant network approximates a Bayesian classifier that implements the Bayesian decision <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification.</b> This paper also reports the empirical results of several pattern classification experiments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{challenge}} {{three of the}} underlying principles of CART, a well know approach {{to the construction of}} classification and regression trees. Our primary concern is with the penalization strategy employed to prune back an initial, overgrown tree. We reason, based on both intuitive and theoretical arguments, that the pruning <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification</b> should be different from that used for regression (unlike CART). We also argue that growing a treestructured partition that is specifically fitted to the data is unnecessary. Instead, our approach to tree modeling begins with a nonadapted (fixed) dyadic tree structure and partition, much like that underlying multiscale wavelet analysis. We show that dyadic trees provide sufficient flexibility, are easy to construct, and produce near-optimal results when properly pruned. Finally, we advocate the use of a negative log-likelihood measure of empirical risk. This is a more appropriate empirical risk for non-Gaussian regression problems, in contrast to the sum-of-squared errors criterion used in CART regression...|$|E
40|$|This article proposes the multiclass {{proximal}} {{support vector machine}} (MPSVM) classifier, {{which extends}} the binary PSVM to the multiclass case. Unlike the one-versus-rest approach that constructs the decision rule based on multiple binary classification tasks, the proposed method considers all classes simultaneously and has better theoretical properties and empirical performance. We formulate the MPSVM as a regularization problem in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and show that it implements the Bayes <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>classification.</b> In addition, the MPSVM can handle equal and unequal misclassification costs in a unified framework. We suggest an efficient algorithm to implement the MPSVM by solving a system of linear equations. This algorithm requires much less computational effort than solving the standard SVM, which often requires quadratic programming and can be slow for large problems. We also provide an alternative and more robust algorithm for ill-posed problems. The effectiveness of the MPSVM is demonstrated by both simulation studies and applications to cancer classifications using microarray data...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of distributed speech recognition {{has been shown}} to be very sensitive to errors occurring during transmission. One reason for this is that the classifier, usually trained under error free conditions, is unable to cope with the mismatch between an error free and error prone channel.

To achieve this, the classical Bayesian speech recognition approach has been reformulated for the server side, where the observation is known only to the extent, as is given by its a posteriori density function. We present a method to estimate the a posteriori density which is based on a Markov model of the source, which captures correlations of both static and dynamic features.
