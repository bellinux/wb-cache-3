2500|$|The Hadean Earth {{is thought}} to have had a {{secondary}} atmosphere, formed through degassing of the rocks that accumulated from planetesimal impactors. At first, it was thought that the Earth's atmosphere consisted of hydrogen compounds—methane, ammonia and water vapour—and that life began under such reducing conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining. According to later models, suggested by study of ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of water vapour, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and sulfur compounds. As Earth lacked the gravity to hold any molecular hydrogen, this component of the atmosphere would have been rapidly lost during the Hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases. The solution of carbon dioxide in water {{is thought to}} have made the seas slightly acidic, giving it a pH of about 5.5. The atmosphere at the time has been characterized as a [...] "gigantic, productive outdoor chemical laboratory." [...] It may have been similar to the mixture of gases <b>released</b> <b>today</b> by volcanoes, which still support some abiotic chemistry.|$|E

2500|$|Multimodality in the 21st {{century has}} caused {{educational}} institutions to consider changing {{the forms of}} even its traditional aspects of classroom education. According to Hassett and Curwood, authors of Theories and Practices of Multimodal Education, “Print represents only one mode of communication…” and with a rise in digital and Internet literacy, other modes are needed, from visual texts to digital e-books. Other changes occur by integrating music and video with lesson plans during early childhood education; however, such measures are seen as augmenting and increasing literacy for educational communities by introducing new forms, rather than replacing literacy values. In several children’s books <b>released</b> <b>today,</b> written language is no longer the most important factor while producing these books. According to Miller and McVee, authors of Multimodal Composing in Classrooms, “These new literacies do not set aside traditional literacies. Students still {{need to know how to}} read and write, but new literacies are integrated." [...] The main purpose of early childhood education is still evident but the form that is now being presented to children is different. Some learning outcomes include – but are not limited to – reading, writing, and language skills. For example, “Multimodal Composing In Classrooms,” written by Miller and McVee, advocates storyboarding as an assignment and says that it “is multimodal in that there is the visual and audio of a film clip, the drawing representation of the film’s images, as well as the written analysis of the scene." [...] According to Roger Essley in his article, [...] "Visual Tools for Differentiating Reading & Writing Instruction," [...] storyboarding is “the origin of all written language. Teachers are able to use storyboards for visual organization to strengthen writing skills and help the writing process. They can be used in brainstorming sessions, problem solving, planning, and much more.|$|E
