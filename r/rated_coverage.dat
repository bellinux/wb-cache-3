To address this problem, the Low Power Subframes (LPSF) are encouraged to be applied in macro-cell center region by the Further-enhanced Inter-cell Interference Coordination (FeICIC). However, the residual power of the LPSF which interferes the CRE UEs, and the proportion of the LPSF affect the downlink throughput together. To achieve a better <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> probability, appropriate LPSF power and proportion are required. In this paper, the analytical results of the overall Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) coverage probability and the <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> probability are derived under the stochastic geometric framework. The optimal region bias ranges for maximizing the <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> probability are also analysed. The results show that the ABSF still outperform the LPSF in terms of rate with the optimal range expansion bias, but lead to a heavier burden on the back-haul of the pico-cell. However, with a static range expansion bias, the LPSF provide better <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> than the ABSF.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel and {{effective}} approach to optimizing the load balancing in a millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular heterogeneous network (HetNet) with a macro-tier and a micro-tier. The unique characteristics of mmWave transmission {{are incorporated into}} the network by adopting the Poisson point process (PPP) for base station (BS) location, the line-of-sight (LoS) ball model for mmWave links, the sectored antenna model for key antenna array characteristics, and Nakagami-$m$ fading for wireless channels. To reduce the load of macro-tier BSs, we consider a bias factor $A_{s}$ in the network for offloading user equipments (UEs) to micro-tier BSs. For this network, we first analyze the loads of macro- and micro-tier BSs. Then we derive a new expression for the <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> probability of the network, based on which the optimal $A_{s}$ maximizing the <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> probability is found.

Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of various network parameters, e. g., the densities and the beamwidths of BSs, on the <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> probability and the optimal $A_{s}$, offering valuable guidelines into practical mmWave HetNet design.

40|$|Abstract – The {{concept of}} {{relaying}} is a promising {{solution for the}} challenging throughput and high data <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> requirements of future wireless cellular networks. In this paper, we demonstrate that the area that a single BS (base station) can provide high data <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> can significantly be increased by the employment of digital fixed relays (deployed by the service provider) without any penalty in capacity. This network architecture which allows two-hop links (when necessary) is expected to facilitate cost-efficient high data <b>rate</b> <b>coverage</b> in beyond- 3 G cellular wireless networks. In particular we considered the downlink of a non-CDMA network where 6 digital fixed relays are placed around each BS in a hexagonal layout. A user equipment (UE) chooses to receive the transmitted signal either directly (in single hop) from the BS or via one of the relays (in two hops). Whenever a relay is used, a second channel is needed as the relays cannot receive and transmit at the same channel. We propose a "pre-configured " relaying channel selection algorithm which incurs minimal overhead due to its fixed nature. In this algorithm, relays further reuse the already used channels in the network; but this reusing is done {{in a controlled manner}} in order to prevent the co-channel interference from increasing to unacceptable levels. Therefore, the benefits of relaying are achieved without any loss in capacity (bandwidth). The improved two-hop links are exploited to yield higher throughput through the use of adaptive modulation and coding. We consistently observed that the throughput is increased and the outage is decreased in the relay-augmented network, which is converted to range extension without any capacity penalty, for the realistic range of values of the propagation and other system parameters investigated.

While this clearly alleviates congestion on the over-loaded cellular network, the ultimate potential of such offloading and its effect on overall system performance is not well understood. To address this, we develop a general and tractable model that consists of M different RATs, each deploying up to K different tiers of access points (APs), where each tier differs in transmit power, path loss exponent, deployment density and bandwidth. Each class of APs is modeled as an independent Poisson point process (PPP), with mobile user locations modeled as another independent PPP, all channels further consisting of i. i. d. Rayleigh fading. The distribution of rate over the entire network is then derived for a weighted association strategy, where such weights can be tuned to optimize a particular objective. We show that the optimum fraction of traffic offloaded to maximize SINR coverage is not in general the same as the one that maximizes <b>rate</b> <b>coverage,</b> defined as the fraction of users achieving a given rate.
