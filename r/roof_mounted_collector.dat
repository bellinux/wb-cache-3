40|$|A pre-package {{prototype}} unit having domestic {{hot water}} and room solar heating capability that uses air as the collector fluid is described. This system {{is designed to be}} used with a small single-family dwelling where a <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>collector</b> array is not feasible. The prototype unit is an assemble containing 203 square feet of effective collector surface with 113 cubic feet of rock storage. The design of structure and storage is modular, which permits expansion and reduction of the collector array and storage bed in 68 square feet and 37 cubic feet increments respectively. The system is designed to be transportable. This permitted assemble and certification testing in one area and installation in another area without tear down and reassemble. Design, installation, operation, performance and maintenance of this system are described...|$|E

However, {{arrays of}} wall-mounted steep collectors can sometimes produce more useful energy because gains in used energy in winter can offset {{the loss of}} unused (excess) energy in summer.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{situation}} the district heating system supplies the 32 % of the total thermal consumption in the City of Velika Gorica. The main issue in the district heating system is the utilization of 14 small and distributed heat plants, each providing heat to a separate and individually disconnected heating grid. Reduction of costs and CO 2 emissions can be reached with a high penetration of renewable sources. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate and design the integration of a Central Solar Heating Plant with Seasonal Storage into the district heating system of the City. An economic assessment was made with a pessimistic and an optimistic prediction of the solar heat cost for ground <b>mounted</b> <b>collectors</b> and <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>collectors.</b> The seasonal storage was chosen to be pit thermal energy storage; the system was modeled as a low-temperature district heating system with the real thermal demands of a district heating plant...|$|R

40|$|The {{thermal losses}} to the ambient from a {{building}} surface or a <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> solar <b>collector</b> represent an important {{portion of the}} overall energy balance and depend heavily on the wind induced convection. In {{an effort to help}} designers make better use of the available correlations in the literature for the external convection coefficients due to the wind, a critical discussion and a suitable tabulation is presented, on the basis of algebraic form of the coefficients and their dependence upon characteristic length and wind direction, in addition to wind speed. Finally, simple average correlations are produced from the existing ones, useful for quick, gross estimates. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

USQ has also made commitment to green energy by [...] "taking action to offset its energy requirements with the construction of overhead solar panelling over one of the University’s largest carparks on its Toowoomba campus."

50|$|Traditional {{solar thermal}} panels were {{designed}} to heat domestic hot water and were generally <b>roof</b> <b>mounted.</b> Space heating accounts for the largest energy usage for buildings in cold climates especially where snow accumulation is common. It was {{decided to have a}} solar collector that would not freeze, thus air became the heat transfer medium instead of water or antifreeze; a wall mount orientation was selected to eliminate any snow buildup associated with <b>roof</b> <b>mounted</b> panels and the vertical orientation was found to increase winter solar gain as it was more perpendicular to the low winter sun angle and the snow on the ground was found to reflect in as much as 50% more solar energy. An additional bonus with utilizing the wall and a building integrated design has been much lower costs.|$|R
