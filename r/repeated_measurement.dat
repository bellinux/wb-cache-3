5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as <b>repeated</b> <b>measurement</b> of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E

A linear mixed model (LMM) is a powerful method for analyzing <b>repeated</b> <b>measurements</b> data. It is made up of two components.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Clinic blood {{pressure}} (BP) {{is only an}} approximate measure of the true {{blood pressure}}. It tends to decrease towards the true value on <b>repeated</b> <b>measurements.</b> The aim of this analysis was to identify the factors related to the change in systolic and diastolic BP on <b>repeated</b> <b>measurements.</b> METHODS: Data on BP and other clinical characteristics {{were obtained from the}} National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. In 2007 - 8, there were 4943 participants aged 20 years or over with <b>repeated</b> BP <b>measurements.</b> <b>Repeated</b> <b>measurements</b> analysis of variance was used to identify variables related to the change in BP with time. RESULTS: As expected, BP was significantly related to age, gender, and body mass index (all P < 0. 001). Systolic and diastolic BP both decreased significantly with time (all P < 0. 001), but was not related to body weight, arm dimension, triceps skinfold thickness, cuff size, and consumption of food, coffee and tobacco in the preceding 30 minutes. For systolic BP, the decrease was also negatively related to the pulse rate (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Older persons and those with high systolic BP had a larger fall in BP on <b>repeated</b> <b>measurements.</b> Therefore, adequate inflation of cuff and <b>repeated</b> <b>measurements</b> in the elderly are key factors for accurate measurement of clinic BP...|$|R

50|$|Another {{way to test}} {{causation}} in criminology is {{with the}} use of longitudinal data. Longitudinal data has the goals of quantifying trends in behavior, describe progression of life events, examine patterns of behavioral change, and begin to apply theories to such data. This type of data allows for the examination of causal research. It helps to evaluate programs such as intervention or rehab and also in regards to methods in reducing crime. Longitudinal research designs are ones that involve <b>repeated</b> <b>measurement</b> over time of one or more groups of subjects. This helps because it is research over time and is useful in determining causal relationships between variables. There are four specific types of designs that can be used, which include trend studies, cohort studies, panel designs, and time-series designs.|$|E

[...] The symptom assessment of the 79 exposed and 27 unexposed subjects comprised interviews before the shift began and then at regular hourly intervals for the next six hours of the shift, four days in a row. Exposures were monitored concurrently with a personal real time aerosol monitor. Two different exposure profiles, a daily average and short term (15 minute) average, were used in the analysis.

It means that the randomly chosen respondents within a limited area are asked about their closest friends/relatives/co-workers (sometimes also about the closeness of this particular relationships) and about their possible political orientations.

5000|$|... === Limitations of ESM === ESM {{has several}} {{disadvantages}}. One of the disadvantages of ESM is it {{can sometimes be}} perceived as invasive and intrusive by participants. ESM also leads to possible self-selection bias. It may be that only certain types of individuals are {{willing to participate in}} this type of study creating an unrepresentative sample. Another concern is related to participant cooperation. Participants may not be actually fill out their diaries at the specified times and concern has been raised difference in diary format may be influential in compliance. However recent research found that research that focuses on mean levels, between-person differences, and correlations among variables {{are less likely to be}} impacted by the difference between electronic and paper diary methods. Research reported that some participants experience the repeated assessments as taxing. Further concerns are related to the fact that ESM may substantively change the phenomenon being studied. Reactivity or priming effects may occur, such that <b>repeated</b> <b>measurement</b> may cause changes in the participants' experiences. This method of sampling data is also highly vulnerable to common method variance.|$|E
