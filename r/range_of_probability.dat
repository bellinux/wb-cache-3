It has happened, as far as I can ascertain, in every race, and every age, and every grade of civilisation. It is happening round us now in every region of the globe. Always and everywhere, it seems to me, have poor human beings been tempted to eat of some [...] "tree of knowledge," [...] that they may be, even for an hour, as gods; wise, but with a false wisdom; careless, but with a frantic carelessness; and happy, but with a happiness which, when the excitement is past, leaves too often--as with that hapless pair in Eden-- depression, shame, and fear.

60|$|A day or {{two later}} there came a letter from Mrs. Dornell to her husband, written before she knew of his stroke. She related the {{circumstances}} of the marriage in the gentlest manner, and gave cogent reasons and excuses for consenting to the premature union, which was now an accomplished fact indeed. She had no idea, till sudden pressure was put upon her, that the contract was expected to be carried out so soon, but being taken half unawares, she had consented, having learned that Stephen Reynard, now their son-in-law, was becoming a great favourite at Court, and that he would in all likelihood have a title granted him before long. No harm could come to their dear daughter by this early marriage-contract, seeing that her life would be continued under their own eyes, exactly as before, for some years. In fine, she had felt that no other such fair opportunity for a good marriage with a shrewd courtier and wise man of the world, who was at the same time noted for his excellent personal qualities, was within the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability,</b> owing to the rusticated lives they led at King's-Hintock. Hence she had yielded to Stephen's solicitation, and hoped her husband would forgive her. She wrote, in short, like a woman who, having had her way as to the deed, is prepared to make any concession as to words and subsequent behaviour.|$|E

In the first place, he must have had accomplices. The man who spoke to the nurse and the cabman who drove the child away must both have been employed by him, and I have no doubt whatever that the child has been placed with some persons who are probably altogether ignorant of his identity. Walter was a lovable child, and as soon as he got over his first grief he would no doubt become attached to the people he was with, and although these might be willing to take a child who, they were told, had lost its parents, and was homeless and friendless, without inquiring too closely into the circumstances, it is unlikely in the extreme that they would connive at any acts of violence. It is by no means easy to murder and then to dispose of the body of a child of seven, and I should doubt whether this man would attempt such a thing. He would be perfectly content that the boy would be out of his way, that all traces of him should be lost, and that it would be beyond the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> that he could ever be identified, and, lastly, even the most hardened villains do not like putting their necks in a noose. Moreover, if in the last extremity his confederates, believing that he had made away with the child, tried to blackmail him, or some unforeseen circumstance brought home to him the guilt of this abduction, he would be in a position to produce the child, and even to make good terms for himself for doing so. You yourself, whatever your feelings might be as to the man whom you believe to be the murderer of your uncle, would still be willing to pay a considerable sum and allow him to leave the country, on condition of his restoring Walter. Therefore I think that you may make your mind easy on that score, and believe that whatever has happened to him, or wherever he may be, there is no risk of actual harm befalling him." ...|$|E

There were a number of versions, from about 1985, including optimization and a data area for storing data separately from models. IFPS seems to have been an important inspiration for the Javelin financial modeling application. Some parts of the IFPS approach were later used by Lotus's Improv- like the separation of model logic and data.Difference to spreadsheet software (Lotus 1-2-3 and later Excel): Mainframe and PC/Mac versions of IFPS completely separated the logic model (connections between variables) and the data. Both were bound together by data placeholder (like [...] "earnings in Year1" [...] in the logic model - to easily run scenarios [...] (Spreadsheet) columns were represented by Name1, Name2, name3 etc. The model logic was written in lines with placeholder- oriented text ( [...] "earnings=sales-costs" [...] etc.).

5000|$|In this decision, the Court {{compared}} and contrasted {{the various}} Burden of proof (law) against the [...] "benefit of the doubt" [...] rule. In criminal law, {{the burden of}} proof used is beyond a Reasonable doubt. Next in the spectrum would be Clear and convincing evidence, followed by the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] standard used in Civil litigation. Last in stringency order would be the [...] "reasonable doubt standard" [...] which is defined regulatorily as: It is the defined and consistently applied policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. By reasonable doubt is meant one which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim. It is a substantial doubt and one within the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> as distinguished from pure speculation or remote possibility. It is not a means of reconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the evidence. Mere suspicion or doubt as to the truth of any statements submitted, as distinguished from impeachment or contradiction by evidence or known facts, is not justifiable basis for denying the application of the reasonable doubt doctrine if the entire, complete record otherwise warrants invoking this doctrine. The reasonable doubt doctrine is also applicable {{even in the absence of}} official records, particularly if the basic incident allegedly arose under combat, or similarly strenuous conditions, and is consistent with the probable results of such known hardships. (Emphasis added)The Court, in explaining how this applies to the weighing of evidence in Veterans claims, used a rule used in Baseball sandlot folklore that the Tie goes to the runner. In other words, when the evidentiary value of the negative evidence against the Veteran's claim is the same as the evidentiary value of the positive evidence for the Veteran's claim, reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionIndeterminate {{pulmonary}} nodules (IPNs) lack clinical or radiographic {{features of}} benign etiologies and often undergo invasive procedures unnecessarily, suggesting potential roles for diagnostic adjuncts using molecular biomarkers. The primary {{objective was to}} validate a multivariate classifier that identifies likely benign lung nodules by assaying plasma protein expression levels, yielding a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>probability</b> estimates based on high negative predictive values (NPVs) for patients with 8 to 30 [*]mm IPNs. MethodsA retrospective, multicenter, case-control study was performed using multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, a classifier comprising five diagnostic and six normalization proteins, and blinded analysis of an independent validation set of plasma samples. ResultsThe classifier achieved validation on 141 lung nodule-associated plasma samples based on predefined statistical goals to optimize sensitivity. Using a population based nonsmall-cell lung cancer prevalence estimate of 23 % for 8 to 30 [*]mm IPNs, the classifier identified likely benign lung nodules with 90 % negative predictive value and 26 % positive predictive value, as shown in our prior work, at 92 % sensitivity and 20 % specificity, with the lower bound of the classifier's performance at 70 % sensitivity and 48 % specificity. Classifier scores for the overall cohort were statistically independent of patient age, tobacco use, nodule size, and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} diagnosis. The classifier also demonstrated incremental diagnostic performance in combination with a four-parameter clinical model.
