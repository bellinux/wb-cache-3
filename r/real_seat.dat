At the time, the members were bound together by their goal of building a prosperous nation. On 9 March the NCRC released Lu'ay al-Atassi from jail, promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general, appointed him commander-in-chief and NCRC chairman, the de facto head of state. Hariri was appointed chief of staff. While Atassi and Hariri held powerful posts, they did not possess enough personal or political power to threaten the NCRC. The Nasserist officers were also given notable offices with Muhammad al-Sufi becoming Minister of Defence and Rashid al-Qutayni becoming deputy chief of staff. However, the Military Committee, which had expanded its membership with five new members, ensured that the Ba'athists controlled the real levers of powers. The committee decided state policies before the sessions of the NCRC, and by doing so became the <b>real</b> <b>seat</b> of power.|$|E

Jethro talked to Cynthia--or rather, Cynthia talked to Jethro upon innumerable subject's; they looked upon the statue of a great statesman in the park, and Cynthia read aloud the quotation graven on the rock of the pedestal, [...] "The People's Government, made for the People, made by the People, and answerable to the People." [...] After that they went into the state library, where Wetherell was introduced to the librarian, Mr. Storrow.

60|$|He {{praised the}} vigour and {{the greatness of}} the speech they had heard from their {{colleague}} Moreau. Above all he praised its wisdom. Moreau's words had {{come as a surprise}} to them. Hitherto they had never known him as other than a bitter critic of their projects of reform and regeneration; and quite lately they had heard, not without misgivings, of his appointment as delegate for a nobleman in the States of Brittany. But they held the explanation of his conversion. The murder of their dear colleague Vilmorin had produced this change. In that brutal deed Moreau had beheld at last in true proportions the workings of that evil spirit which they were vowed to exorcise from France. And to-day he had proven himself the stoutest apostle among them of the new faith. He had pointed out to them the only sane and useful course. The illustration he had borrowed from natural history was most apt. Above all, let them pack like the wolves, and to ensure this uniformity of action in the people of all Brittany, let a delegate at once be sent to Nantes, which had already proved itself the <b>real</b> <b>seat</b> of Brittany's power. It but remained to appoint that delegate, and Le Chapelier invited them to elect him.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they speak}} of the People they {{certainly}} mean something more than the whole mass of individuals in a country lumped together. That is the people, a mere varied aggregation of persons, moved by no common motive, a complex interplay. The People, as the believer understands the word, is something more mysterious than that. The People is something that overrides and {{is added to the}} individualities that make up the people. It is, as it were, itself an individuality of a higher order--as indeed, its capital [...] "P" [...] displays. It has a will of its own which is not the will of any particular person in it, it has a power of purpose and judgment of a superior sort. It {{is supposed to be the}} underlying reality of all national life and the <b>real</b> <b>seat</b> of all public religious emotion. Unfortunately, it lacks powers of expression, and so there is need of rulers and interpreters. If they express it well in law and fact, in book and song, they prosper under its mysterious approval; if they do not, it revolts or forgets or does something else of an equally annihilatory sort. That, briefly, is the idea of the People. My modest thesis is that there exists nothing of the sort, that the world of men is entirely made up of the individuals that compose it, and that the collective action is just the algebraic sum of all individual actions.|$|E

60|$|It is, Sir, because I wish to {{keep this}} {{business}} of subordinate treasuries as much as I can together, that I brought the ordnance office before you, though it is properly a military department. For the same reason I will now trouble you with my thoughts and propositions upon two of the greatest under-treasuries: I mean the office of paymaster of the land forces, or treasurer of the army, {{and that of the}} treasurer of the navy. The former of these has long been a great object of public suspicion and uneasiness. Envy, too, has had its share in the obloquy which is cast upon this office. But I am sure that it has no share at all in the reflections I shall make upon it, or in the reformations that I shall propose. I do not grudge to the honorable gentleman who at present holds the office any of the effects of his talents, his merit, or his fortune. He is respectable in all these particulars. I follow the constitution of the office without persecuting its holder. It is necessary in all matters of public complaint, where men frequently feel right and argue wrong, to separate prejudice from reason, and to be very sure, in attempting the redress of a grievance, that we hit upon its <b>real</b> <b>seat</b> and its true nature. Where there is an abuse in office, the first thing that occurs in heat is to censure the officer. Our natural disposition leads all our inquiries rather to persons than to things. But this prejudice is to be corrected by maturer thinking.|$|E

5000|$|An {{increased}} {{questioning of}} international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, {{find it hard}} to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests.

For instance, in 2008, Germany adopted new regulations on the GmbH (Limited Liability Company), allowing the incorporation of Limited Liability Companies without a minimum capital of EUR 25,000 (though the earnings have to be retained until this threshold is reached).|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of 3 D-CAD-systems integrating computer based man models {{make it possible to}} evaluate the design of the man machine interface in an early state. The interaction of human and seat is not simulated in a satisfying way yet due to the extreme complexity of the task. At the Lehrstuhl fiir Ergonomic, Technische Universitiit Miinchen an experimental setup has been developed to investigate this interaction systematically. With the help of this setup upholstered seats can be pammeterized by their spring character-istics and geometry to be simulated as physical representation of the seat with the same setup. Pressure dis-tributions and deflection profiles can be measured with integrated sensors. The simulated seat also provides the possibility to vary the seat characteristics systematically. The experimental setup consists of two cushion units, adjustable in size and angle. Each unit consists of 9 by 9 adjustable positioning units, technically realized as programmable springs. Tests with selected positioning units have shown that the accuracy of positioning, as well as the accuracy of the measured and simulated spring characteristics is sufficient. Ex-isting seat cushions have been simulated. Based on mathematical indices the similarity of measured pressure distributions on the simulated cushions and the corresponding seats were compared. Based on this results it can be stated that the characteristics of <b>real</b> <b>seats</b> can be simulated with sufficient accuracy.

Looting took place the next morning with rioters carting off furniture, blankets, rugs, files and air-conditioning devices among others.

The <b>real</b> <b>seat</b> doctrine is considered protective, because it safeguards the rights of stakeholders such as minority shareholders and creditors.

Second, in the same situation such a transfer may no longer result in companies being killed off at the border.
