25|$|The Jaffe {{reaction}} is a colorimetric method used in clinical chemistry to determine creatinine levels {{in blood and}} urine. In 1886, Max Jaffe (1841–1911) wrote about its basic principles in the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäure in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins in which he described the properties of creatinine and picric acid in an alkaline solution. The color change that occurred was directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine, however {{he also noted that}} several other organic compounds induced similar reactions. In the early 20th century, Otto Folin adapted Jaffe's research into a clinical procedure. The Jaffe reaction, despite its nonspecificity for creatinine, is still widely employed as the method of choice for creatinine testing due to its speed, adaptability in automated analysis, and cost-effectiveness, and is the oldest methodology continued {{to be used in the}} medical laboratory. It is this nonspecificity that has motivated the development of new <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for creatinine analysis into the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{candidate}} <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> {{is described}} for coupled sodium-water determination based on ion-exchange sodium {{separation from the}} serum matrix followed by gravimetry as Na 2 SO 4, and serum water determination by means of microwave evaporation. For sera with normal sodium and water contents, the mean relative standard deviation is 0. 6 % (0. 8 mmol/l). Mean inaccuracy for the coupled sodium-water determination is — 0. 3 % (0. 4 mmol/ 1). The candidate <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> {{can be considered a}} <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> because the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> value did not differ significantly from the definitive value, there is no known source for interferences or bias, and misinterpretation due to abnormal protein or lipid levels is excluded because serum sodium is determined on a plasma water basis. Sodium concentrations determined by the candidate <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> are used for comparing field methods with the candidate <b>reference</b> <b>method.</b> If the resulting regression equation is used in the calibration procedure, good correlation between all (in) direct field methods and the candidate <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> is ensured, and accurate results are produced.

40|$|Summary: The {{reliability}} of {{the determination of the}} most common substrates with the Ektachem 700 was evaluated. Accuracy control was performed in various ways including the comparison of results with <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values. The influence of protein concentration was investigated systematically using sera containing varying amounts of protein obtained by ultracentrifugation. Bilirubin. Deviation from the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values was within limits of the guidelines (Dt. Ärztebl. 85 (1988) B 517 — B 532). The influence of protein concentration was negligible. Cholesterol. The results agreed well with the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values. The method was not influenced by different protein concentrations. Creatinine. The results were in good agreement with <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values, when the method was calibrated with the primary assigned values of the calibrators. At high protein concentrations, the results were higher than those of the comparative method. Glucose. The mean deviation from the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values was 1. 0 %.

40|$|Our aim was {{to provide}} a {{meta-analysis}} of the literature concerning the validation of thoracic impedance cardiography (TIC) and to explain variations in reported results from differences in the studies. One hundred fifty-four studies (164 Fisher's Z-transformed correlation coefficients) comparing measurements of cardiac output or related parameters from TIC and a <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> were analyzed. Papers were classified according to differences in TIC methodology, <b>reference</b> <b>method,</b> and subject characteristics. Pooling using the random-effects method yielded an overall correlation of r = 0. 82 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 80 - 0. 84).

In cardiac patients, the correlation was significantly decreased. No influence of the applied TIC methodology was found.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the Haemoglobin Colour Scale developed by WHO for estimating haemoglobin concentration and {{to compare the}} results obtained using it and the HemoCue assay with those determined using a <b>reference</b> <b>method,</b> the Technicon H 3 analyser. METHODS: The Colour Scale and HemoCue assay were used to test 408 blood samples. Subsequently, Bland-Altman plots were determined and {{the proximity of the}} test results to those obtained using the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> was determined. FINDINGS: The mean difference between the Haemoglobin Colour Scale and the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> was 0. 19 g/dl (95 % confidence interval: 3. 50 g/dl below to 3. 11 g/dl above); the corresponding value for the HemoCue assay was 0. 50 g/dl (1. 16 g/dl below to 0. 16 g/dl above). Only 46. 08 % of the results obtained by means of the Colour Scale were within 1. 0 g/dl of the <b>reference</b> <b>method,</b> whereas 95. 34 % of the HemoCue results fell within this limit; 22. 79 % of the Colour Scale results but none of the HemoCue results lay more than 2. 0 g/dl from the <b>reference</b> <b>method.</b> CONCLUSION: The Haemoglobin Colour Scale test is too inaccurate for general use, particularly if devices such as the HemoCue are available...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} automated leucocyte (white blood cell; WBC) counting by comparison with manual counting. METHODS: The number of WBC was determined in heparinized synovial fluid samples {{by the use of}} (i) a standard urine cytometer (Kova) and a microscope (<b>reference</b> <b>method)</b> and (ii) a haematology analyser (Sysmex XE- 2100; WBC/BASO and DIFF channels). Imprecision within and between days was determined by replicate analysis of a low (level A; WBC approximately 0. 560 x 10 (9) /l) and a high (level B; WBC approximately 1. 081 x 10 (9) /l) dedicated synovial fluid control (Quantimetrix). RESULTS: The WBC count of the DIFF channel was highly correlated with the WBC count of the microscopic <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> (r = 0. 99; WBC analyser = 0. 870 x WBC <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> + 0. 413). In contrast, no agreement existed between WBC counts generated by the WBC/BASO channel of the analyser and the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> (r = 0. 52; WBC analyser = 0. 008 x WBC <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> + 0. 079). Within-day imprecision (4 - 7 %) and between-day imprecision (10 %) of the haematology analyser were smaller than the within-day imprecision (12 %) and the between-day imprecision (20 - 22 %) of the manual <b>reference</b> <b>method.</b> For manual counting, inter-observer coefficients of variation were 35. 9 % (control level A) and 21. 0 % (control level B).
