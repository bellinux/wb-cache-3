5|$|Jaz Rignall of USgamer {{revisited}} Titanfall in late 2015 {{and found}} the game still worthy of its original praise, though he noted that its technical details—namely graphics and framerate—showed some age. He felt that the game's content issues, apart from the light campaign, were <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> free additional maps. Overall, Rignall said that Titanfall {{had been replaced by}} newer shooter games.|$|E

5|$|By the 1860s, {{failure of}} the policy became apparent, leading to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and {{creation}} of a personal union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary.

The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while Rijeka retained the status of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779.|$|E

5|$|Congregation is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band The Afghan Whigs, released on January 31, 1992, by Sub Pop. After touring {{for two years in}} support of their 1990 album Up in It, the band received $15,000 advance from Sub Pop to record a follow-up album. It was primarily recorded at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville and Buzz's Kitchen in Los Angeles during July to August 1991. The band's frontman Greg Dulli produced the album entirely with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. The album's production and release were hindered by Sub Pop's financial difficulties, which were eventually <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> massive commercial success of Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Minnesota state {{government}} shutdown was a government shutdown affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota. The shutdown {{was the result}} of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature, that was not <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts, and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases, while Dayton demanded some tax increases. The shutdown started at midnight on July 1, and ended after a budget bill was passed and signed on July 20.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners {{ultimately}} accepted {{all but one}} of {{the task}} force's recommendations in 1979.

Citing concerns over conflicting federal and district court decisions which had not yet been <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Supreme Court, the school board voted to make City a coeducational school. The board's action followed trends at the time at all-male colleges and universities like Harvard University, Yale University, and nearby Johns Hopkins University, which admitted women during the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance {{began in}} times of {{religious}} turmoil. The late Middle Ages {{was a period of}} political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Council of Constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism and fathering four children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.|$|E

The environmental concerns were <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> developer for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year; in return, the environmental groups agreed not to appeal the court decision.

5|$|There were {{charges of}} vote fraud in Texas and Illinois, both states won by Kennedy; Nixon refused to {{consider}} contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States {{in the eyes}} of the world, and the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests.

5|$|Traditional {{narratives}} depict Scotland as largely converted by Irish missions {{associated with}} {{figures such as}} St. Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries, {{but many of these}} figures were later constructs or founded monasteries and collegiate churches in areas to which Christianity had already spread. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were more significant than bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed, and there were significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mid-seventh century.|$|E
5|$|V. I. Lenin's policy, {{the right}} of nations to {{self-determination}} aimed at preventing the disintegration of Russia {{during the period of}} military weakness. He assumed that in war-torn, splintering Europe, the proletariat of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions and unite with Soviet Russia later. The majority of the Finnish labor movement supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia. The question of annexation, in the aftermath of World War I, was <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> defeat of Red Finland and weakness of Russia.|$|E
5|$|After the 1917 Finnish {{independence}} and the Civil War, the other Scandinavian countries {{would have been the}} best candidates for a political alliance. Swedo-Finnish cooperation represented a rich vein of shared history in the culture of both nations, and the Swedish-speaking Finns had a common language with Swedes. During the Civil War, however, Sweden briefly occupied the Åland Islands and later supported the local movement that wanted to secede from Finland and join the islands to Sweden. The dispute was <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> League of Nations in 1921 and the Åland remained Finnish, but were granted autonomy. Other obstacles to closer relations were the ongoing language strife on the status of the Swedish language in Finland. Sweden had also opposed the upper-class resistance movement against Russification. As a result, young Finnish men received their military training in Germany, generating the Jäger Movement. Nevertheless, Finnish–Swedish relations improved considerably before the Winter War.|$|E

5|$|Burchard, {{along with}} Marshal {{and other members}} of the chapter, were often opposed to the actions of their {{archbishop}}. They objected to the archbishop having given a large part of York's treasury towards Richard's ransom, and to some of the archiepiscopal appointments in the church of York. Burchard and the others charged Geoffrey with simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties and the archbishop in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. The disputes flared up in 1192, with Burchard facing an effort by Geoffrey to replace him in the treasurership with Hamo, but the dispute was <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gift of a church to Hamo by Burchard and Hamo's relinquishing of any claim to the treasurership. At another dispute, Geoffrey had confiscated the revenues of Burchard's offices, along with the revenues of Marshal, Peter de Ros the Archdeacon of Carlisle, and the canons Hugh Murdac and Adam of Thornover. Geoffrey refused to restore the incomes unless the offenders came barefoot into York Minster and begged for the archbishop's forgiveness. This all but Marshal did and they had their official revenues restored.|$|E
5|$|By late April, British {{attention}} {{had shifted}} to the Middle East due to the Anglo-Iraqi War, although the situation was <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of May. A greater concern was that German and Italian forces had intervened in Iraq, using bases in Vichy Syria. With Germans and Italians threatening to gain full control of the French territory, thus jeopardising the British position in the Middle East, the Allies invaded Syria (Operation Exporter) on 8 June. In the face of stiff resistance from the Vichy French, the British realised that reinforcements were needed. On 13June, the 6th Infantry Division (with two infantry brigades) was ordered to reinforce the effort. The leading elements of the 16th Infantry Brigade arrived on 17June and captured Kuneitra. The 23rd Infantry Brigade arrived on 28 June. The division then {{took part in the}} Battle of Damascus. The campaign ended on 14July and the division remained in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Christianity in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all aspects of}} Christianity in the modern borders of Scotland in the Middle Ages. Christianity was probably introduced {{to what is now}} Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the fifth century, Christianity is presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced. Scotland was largely converted by Irish missions associated with figures such as St Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions founded monastic institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were more significant than bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed and there were significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been <b>resolved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mid-seventh century. After the reconversion of Scandinavian Scotland in the tenth century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom.|$|E
