5|$|British forces {{landed at}} Calvi on 19 June, and {{immediately}} began moving guns ashore {{to occupy the}} heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July Nelson was {{at one of the}} forward batteries early in the morning when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in his <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August. However, Nelson's <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> had been irreparably damaged and he eventually lost all sight in it.|$|E

5|$|William D. Haywood {{was born}} in 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. His father, a former Pony Express rider, died of {{pneumonia}} when Haywood was three years old. His maternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in the Orange Free State in 1820. At age nine, he injured his <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> while whittling a slingshot with a knife, permanently blinding his <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> Haywood never had his damaged eye replaced with a glass eye; when photographed, he would turn his head to show his left profile. That same year, he began working in the mines, never having received much formal education. After brief stints as a cowboy and a homesteader, he returned to mining in 1896. High-profile {{events such as the}} gradual demise of the Molly Maguires, the Haymarket Massacre in 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894 fostered Haywood's interest in the labor movement.|$|E

40|$|A mirror {{symmetry}} in the aberrations {{between the}} left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> has previously been found foveally, but while a similar symmetry for the peripheral visual field is likely, {{it has not been}} investigated. Nevertheless, the peripheral optical quality is often evaluated in only one eye, because it is more time efficient than analyzing the whole visual field of both eyes. This study investigates the correctness of such an approach by measuring the peripheral wavefront aberrations in both eyes of 22 subjects out to 40 horizontally. The largest aberrations (defocus, astigmatism, and coma) were found to be significantly correlated between {{the left and}} <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> when comparing the same temporal or nasal angle. The slope of the regression line was close to 1 (within 0. 05) for these aberrations, with a negative slope for the horizontally odd aberrations, i. e. the left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> are mirror symmetric. These findings justify that the average result, sampled in one of the two eyes of many subjects, can be generalized to the other eye as well...|$|R

At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness).

Although his wound was serious enough to warrant hospitalisation, there was no permanent damage to his vision.

40|$|AbstractHow is {{a single}} visual {{direction}} assigned to a binocular feature for which the left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> are signaling different directions? According to geometrical principles, binocular visual direction is {{the average of the}} visual directions measured from the left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes.</b> Contrary to this prediction, we have found that the relative visual direction between two Gabor targets presented at different stereoscopic depths could be manipulated by varying the contrast ratio between the left and right images. This finding is consistent with a new model in which the relative alignment of depth features is determined from a maximum-likelihood combination of the direction signals from the left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes.</b> In a second experiment we provide support for this model, showing that the magnitude of the contrast-dependent bias in visual direction is predicted by the uncertainty for spatial localization in the left and right images. Lastly we show that visual direction and stereopsis have different dependencies on interocular contrast differences, suggesting that the computation of stereo depth and visual direction are mediated via different mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Background. To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} corneal glyceraldehyde CXL on the rabbit bullous keratopathy models established by descemetorhexis. Methods. Fifteen rabbits were randomly divided into five groups. Group A (n= 3) is the control group. The <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> of animals in Groups B,C, D, and E (n= 3, resp.) were suffered with descemetorhexis procedures. From the 8 th day to the 14 th day postoperatively, the <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> in Groups C and D were instilled with hyperosmolar drops and glyceraldehyde drops, respectively; the <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> in Group E were instilled with both hyperosmolar drops and glyceraldehyde drops. Central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal transparency score, and histopathological analysis were applied on the eyes in each group. Results. Compared with Group A, statistically significant increase in CCT and corneal transparency score was found in Groups B, C, D, and E at 7 [*]d postoperatively (P< 0. 05) and in Groups C, D, and E at 14 [*]d postoperatively (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. Chemical CXL technique using glyceraldehyde improved the CCT and corneal transparency of the rabbit bullous keratopathy models. Topical instillation with glyceraldehyde and hyperosmolar solutions {{seems to be a}} good choice for the bullous keratopathy treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{developed}} a 3 D display using an LCD display panel and a grating film for stereoscopic viewing. The display screen is divided in half {{in order that}} left and right regions provide the stereoscopic images for left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes.</b> Because both stereoscopic images {{are not in the}} same position, it is difficult for the observer to view the 3 D image by the stereoviewing.

As the result, the observer can watch overlapped stereoscopic images for left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes.</b> Index Terms— 3 D imaging, 3 D adapter, optical grating film, overlapping stereoscopic images, stereoscope I...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Aspects of the {{biomechanics}} {{and surface}} topography of fellow human corneas {{are known to}} exhibit midline symmetry, but the structural basis of these observations is poorly understood. The mechanical performance of the cornea is strongly influenced by the organization of stromal collagen fibrils. The present {{study was designed to}} examine and compare the organization of collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma of left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes.</b> METHODS. Wide-angle x-ray scattering was used to map in detail the orientation and distribution of fibrillar collagen across the cornea, limbus, and adjacent sclera of three normal human eyes, including a fellow pair, and the central 9 -mm corneal region of a further four eyes. RESULTS. Fibrillar collagen in the human cornea and limbus is arranged anisotropically, and in a highly specific manner. Left and right corneas are structurally distinct. In general, the mass distribution of preferentially aligned fibrils in the cornea appears to exhibit a degree of midline symmetry between left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes.</b> CONCLUSIONS. Structural information, such as that presented herein, will enable a better understanding of corneal biomechanics and shape. Midline symmetry in the distribution of aligned, mechanically reinforcing collagen fibrils between left and <b>right</b> <b>eyes</b> may relate to the biomechanical and topographical enantiomorphism reported in the literature...|$|R
