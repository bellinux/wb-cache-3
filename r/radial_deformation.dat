For radial frequencies above two cycles, thresholds {{were found to be}} a constant fraction of the mean radius across a four-octave range of pattern radii and peak spatial frequencies (mean Weber fraction: 0. 003 – 0. 004). At low radial frequencies, thresholds were unaffected by contrast reduction. In 167 ms presentations, subjects were able to identify radial frequencies of six cycles and below with an accuracy of over 90 % correct even when phase was randomized. The extreme sensitivity of subjects to these <b>radial</b> <b>deformations</b> (as low as 2 – 4 s of arc) cannot be explained by local orientation or curvature analysis, and points instead to the global pooling of contour information at intermediate levels of form vision...|$|R
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{axisymmetric}} deformation response of unsymmetrically laminate cylinders loaded in axial compression by known loads. A geometrically nonlinear analysis is used. Though buckling is not studied, the deformations can {{be considered to be}} the prebuckling response. Attention is directed at three 16 layer laminates: a (90 sub 8 / 0 sub 8) sub T; a (0 sub 8 / 90 sub 8) sub T and a (0 / 90) sub 4 s. The symmetric laminate is used as a basis for comparison, while the two unsymmetric laminates were chosen because they have equal but opposite bending-stretching effects. Particular attention is given to the influence of the thermally-induced preloading deformations that accompany the cool-down of any unsymmetric laminate from the consolidation temperature. Simple support and clamped boundary conditions are considered. It is concluded that: (1) The <b>radial</b> <b>deformations</b> of an unsymmetric laminate are significantly larger than the <b>radial</b> <b>deformations</b> of a symmetric laminate, although for both symmetric and unsymmetric laminates the large deformations are confined to a boundary layer near the ends of the cylinder; (2) For this nonlinear problem the length of the boundary layer {{is a function of the}} applied load; (3) The sign of the <b>radial</b> <b>deformations</b> near the supported end of the cylinder depends strongly on the sense (sign) of the laminate asymmetry; (4) For unsymmetric laminates, ignoring the thermally-induced preloading deformations that accompany cool-down results in load-induced deformations that are under predicted; and (5) The support conditions strongly influence the response but the influence of the sense of asymmetry and the influence of the thermally-induced preloading deformations are independent of the support conditions...|$|R

To improve BTRRC design, the optimum control-based probabilistic optimization of turbine casing <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> was implemented using time-varying least square support vector machine (T-LSSVM) by considering nonlinear material properties and dynamic thermal load. First the T-LSSVM method was proposed and its mathematical model was established.

Thirdly, through the numerical experiments, the T-LSSVM method is demonstrated to be a promising approach in reducing additional design samples and improving computational efficiency with acceptable computational precision. Through the optimum control-based probabilistic optimization for nonlinear dynamic radial turbine casing deformation, the optimum <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> is 7. 865 × 10 − 4 [*]m with acceptable reliability degree 0. 995 [*] 6, which is reduced by 7. 86 × 10 − 5 [*]m relative to that before optimization.

40|$|The <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> {{design of}} turbine disk seriously {{influences}} {{the control of}} gas turbine high pressure turbine (HPT) blade-tip radial running clearance (BTRRC). To improve the design of BTRRC under continuous operation, the nonlinear dynamic reliability optimization of disk <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> was implemented based on extremum response surface method (ERSM), including ERSM-based quadratic function (QF-ERSM) and ERSM-based support vector machine of regression (SR-ERSM). The mathematical models of the two methods were established and the framework of reliability-based dynamic design optimization was developed. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed optimization methods have the promising potential in reducing additional design samples and improving computational efficiency with acceptable precision, in which the SR-ERSM emerges more obviously. Through the case study, we find that disk <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> is reduced by about 6. 5 × 10 – 5 m; δ= 1. 31 × 10 – 3 m is optimal for turbine disk <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> design and the proposed methods are verified again.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} analysis {{of the effect of}} <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> on the atomic and electronic structure of zigzag and armchair single wall carbon nanotubes using the first principle plane wave method. The nanotubes were deformed by applying a radial strain, which distorts the circular cross section to an elliptical one. The atomic structure of the nanotubes under this strain are fully optimized, and the electronic structure is calculated self-consistently to determine the response of individual bands to the <b>radial</b> <b>deformation.</b> The band gap of the insulating tube is closed and eventually an insulator-metal transition sets in by the radial strain which is in the elastic range. Using this property a multiple quantum well structure with tunable and reversible electronic structure is formed on an individual nanotube and its band-lineup is determined from first-principles.

40|$|Abstract—Mathematical and {{statistical}} modeling of biological growth {{is an important}} problem in medical diagnostics. Here, we seek tools to analyze changes in anatomical parts using images collected over time. We introduce a structured model, called Growth by Random Iterated Diffeomorphisms (GRID), that treats a cumulative growth deformation as a composition of several elementary deformations. Each elementary deformation applies to a small region by capturing deformation local to that region and {{is characterized by a}} seed and a <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> pattern around that seed. These GRID variables—seed locations and <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> patterns—are estimated from observed images in two steps: 1) estimate a cumulative deformation over an observation interval; 2) estimate GRID variables using maximum-likelihood criterion from this estimated cumulative deformation. We demonstrate this framework using an MRI image data of a rat’s brain growth. For future statistical analysis, we propose a time-varying Poisson process for the seed placements and a random drawing from a predetermined catalog of deformations for the <b>radial</b> <b>deformation</b> patterns.
