First, normality of latent variables has been checked through the Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q plots of residuals of variables. As none of the variables are normally distributed, the Satorra-Bentler rescaling method has been employed for SEM estimation, as suggested by Rosseel (2012). Validity and reliability statistics of the conceptual model (proposed in Section 2) are then performed. After validation and <b>reliability</b> <b>check,</b> the final SEM and multi-group SEM are presented.|$|E

The check failure leads to the reimplementation of the software. This paper designed a software reliability model that performs its working in two phases. First phase of the model is completed before the coding after the design phase. In this phase the design is checked against the requirements. The {{second phase of the}} model is placed after the implementation phase. The model is analyzed and results towards optimization...|$|E

30|$|To this end, {{we first}} propose a {{deterministic}} scheme where the fixed number of data symbols {{at the half}} band edges are not used in the interference reconstruction because they themselves undergo very high interference in FADAC-OFDM, and thus, they are less reliable. In order to further improve the cancelation performance, we propose a method which instantaneously measures {{the reliability of the}} soft detected symbols [12] at each iteration and then exclude the unreliable symbols in the estimated interference generation. We jointly employ two <b>reliability</b> <b>check</b> measures: (1) square error of the decision variable from the corresponding constellation point and (2) the detection consistency for two consecutive iterations.|$|E

Although the <b>reliability</b> <b>check</b> was conducted between only two coders, three different types of reliability indexes showed all moderate to substantial agreement.
