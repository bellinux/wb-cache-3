40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) has {{the potential}} to transform the discovery of viruses causing unexplained acute febrile illness (UAFI) because it does not depend on culturing the pathogen or a priori knowledge of the pathogen's nucleic acid sequence. More generally, it {{has the potential}} to elucidate the complete human virome, including viruses that cause no overt symptoms of disease, but may have unrecognized immunological or developmental consequences. We have used NGS to identify RNA viruses in the blood of 195 patients with UAFI and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy (i. e., no overt signs of illness) control individuals, all from communities in southeastern Nigeria. Among UAFI patients, we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses, such as HIV- 1, hepatitis, and Lassa virus. In our cohort of healthy individuals, however, we detected the nucleic acids of two novel <b>rhabdoviruses.</b> These viruses, which we call Ekpoma virus- 1 (EKV- 1) and Ekpoma virus- 2 (EKV- 2), are highly divergent, with little identity to each other or other known viruses. The most closely related <b>rhabdoviruses</b> are members of the genus Tibrovirus and Bas-Congo virus (BASV), which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever. Furthermore, by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort, we find evidence for remarkably high exposure rates to the identified <b>rhabdoviruses.</b> The recent discoveries of novel <b>rhabdoviruses</b> by multiple research groups suggest that human infection with <b>rhabdoviruses</b> might be common. While the prevalence and clinical significance of these viruses are currently unknown, these viruses could have previously unrecognized impacts on human health; further research to understand the immunological and developmental impact of these viruses should be explored.

Consequently, many public health diagnostic laboratories in the United States are now actively testing dead birds for WNV. We describe two new <b>rhabdoviruses</b> that {{were isolated}} from birds during surveillance studies for WNV and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) activity in the northeastern United States.

[...] SNRV was isolated by virologist W. Wattanavijarn from a snakehead murrel, Channa striata (formerly Ophicepahalus striatus), a species of snakehead fish, which exhibited signs of epizootic ulcerative syndrome following an outbreak of this syndrome in Thailand. [...] The new viral isolate {{was identified as a}} <b>rhabdovirus</b> based on images and measurements taken via transmission electron microscopy and biochemical test results.

40|$|Insects are host to {{a diverse}} range of {{vertically}} transmitted micro-organisms, but while their bacterial symbionts are well-studied, {{little is known about}} their vertically transmitted viruses. The sigma virus (DMelSV) is currently the only natural hostspecific pathogen to be described in Drosophila melanogaster. In this thesis I have examined; the diversity and evolution of sigma viruses in Drosophila, their transmission and population dynamics, and their ability to host shift. I have described six new <b>rhabdoviruses</b> in five Drosophila species — D. affinis, D. obscura, D. tristis, D. immigrans and D. ananassae — and one in a member of the Muscidae, Muscina stabulans (Chapters two and four). These viruses have been tentatively named as DAffSV, DObsSV, DTriSV, DImmSV, DAnaSV and MStaSV respectively. I sequenced the complete genomes of DObsSV and DMelSV, the L gene from DAffSV and partial L gene sequences from the other viruses. Using this new sequence data I created a phylogeny of the <b>rhabdoviruses</b> (Chapter two). The sigma viruses form a distinct clade which is closely related to the Dimarhabdovirus supergroup, and the high levels of divergence between these viruses suggest that they may deserve to be recognised as a new genus. Furthermore, this analysis produced the most robustly supported phylogeny of the Rhabdoviridae to date, allowing me to reconstruct the major transitions that have occurred during the evolution of the family. This data suggests that the bias towards research into plants and vertebrates means that much of the diversity of <b>rhabdoviruses</b> has been missed, and <b>rhabdoviruses</b> may be common pathogens of insects. In Chapter three I examined whether the new sigma viruses in Drosophila affinis and Drosophila obscura are both vertically transmitted. As is the case for DMelSV, both males and females can transmit these viruses to their offspring. Males transmit lower viral titres through sperm than females transmit through eggs, and a lower proportion of their offspring become infected. I then examined natural populations of D. obscura in the UK; 39...|$|R

To further investigate the U 1 –U 3 region, we conducted the first large-scale evolutionary analysis of a member of the Hart Park serogroup by analyzing over 100 spatially and temporally distinct FLAV isolates.
