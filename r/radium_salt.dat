25|$|As {{a result}} of the lawsuit, the adverse effects of {{radioactivity}} became widely known, and radium-dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear.

5000|$|The {{spinthariscope}} {{was invented}} by William Crookes in 1903.

Upon inspecting the zinc sulfide screen under a microscope, he noticed separate flashes of light created by individual alpha particle collisions with the screen.

5000|$|As Branson was a {{scientific}} instrument maker {{and had a}} keen interest in the scientific developments of the day, he closely followed new discoveries in science. Marie Curie had discovered radium. In June 1903, the Curie couple were invited to present a talk on radioactivity at the Royal Institution in London. Pierre Curie made the presentation, as women were prohibited from speaking engagements at the Royal Institution. In July 1904, Branson gave a presentation titled Radium and its Properties and made a demonstration with radium before members of the Leeds Geological Society and the Leeds Naturalist Club.Radium and its Properties."The Leeds Law Institute was, on the 23rd ult., crowded to the door on the occasion of a lecture by Mr. F. W. Branson, F.I.C., on that mysterious subject known as radium. The Leeds Geological Society and the Leeds Naturalist Club were also represented, and Mr. E. Hawkesworth was in the chair."The new metal, which Professor Pierre Curie discovered, has, as demonstrated by Mr. Branson, some wonderful properties and a probable great future."Mr. Branson first showed that radium is an element having the highest atomic weight known, and has a characteristic spectrum, by which it can be easily identified, and that it falls into the group of metals: barium, calcium, and strontium. He then showed the difference between atmospheric (sound) waves and ether waves (heat, light, and electrical), and alluded to the emanations given off by radium as consisting of electrons negatively charged, and also much larger particles of matter termed ions positively charged. The former have very penetrative powers as regards metals and opaque bodies, and are identical with the kathode rays that are given off in an ordinary X-ray tube."The positively charged particles are not so penetrative; indeed, they are easily stopped by such substances as cardboard. When a fragment of <b>radium</b> <b>salt</b> is held near to a zinc blende screen, the positively charged particles given off by radium salts bombard it and render the surface of the screen full of rapidly changing brilliant points. This phenomenon was shown by means of an instrument called the [...] "Spinthariscope.""With regard to the heat rays, the emanations of there from a tube of radium bromide, which had previously photographed itself on a photographic plate in the dark room, was shown by Bunsen's Ice Calorimeter, which instrument not only proves that heat is given out continuously by the salt, but measures accurately the amount generated. The reducing effect on chemical substances was alluded to, also the destruction of living tissues, and bacteria by radium emanations, and the general aspects of radio-activity were also dealt with and illustrated by numerous experiments, limelight views, and in other ways."The address was necessarily technical in its character, but sufficient properties of the metal were indicated to create a degree of sustained interest, and many eminent scientists {{from all parts of the}} country were present. A very hearty vote of thanks, proposed by Mr. Gilbert Middleton (president of the Leeds Photographic Society), seconded by Mr. Dreweryhouse (Leeds Geological Society), terminated probably the most interesting demonstration ever given before the society." ...|$|E
50|$|As with radium emanation, {{solutions}} of free <b>radium</b> <b>salts</b> {{were also}} placed in tubes; in this case, the tubes {{were made from}} platinum.

40|$|Despite its importance, a {{comprehensive}} {{history of the}} use of radioactive sub-stances for medical purposes, especially in the early years, still has to be written. This research note—based on the original literature in French, Italian, and Ger-man—covers the first experiments on the bactericidal effect of radioactive sub-stances from 1897 to 1901, a topic that has rarely been covered in the litera-ture,[e. g., 1; 2 : 188 ff; 3 : 215; 4 : 92] and never completely and with correct refer-ences to all the original publications. As is quite well-known, the immediate interest in Henri Becquerel’s (1852 – 1908) discovery of radioactivity in 1896 was much less impressive than the one shown in Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen’s (1845 – 1923) discovery of X-rays a few months ear-lier. [4 : 5] As far as medical therapy is concerned, the first attempts with X-rays were made by Victor Despeignes (1866 – 1937) in Lyon and Leopold Freund (1868 – 1943) in Vienna already in 1896,[5; 6] whereas the earliest treatments using radi-oactivity, in the form of <b>radium</b> <b>salts,</b> had to wait until 1901,[7] more than two years after the discovery of radium by Marie Skłodowska-Curie (1867 – 1934) and Pierre Curie (1859 – 1906) in Paris. [8] However, research on one aspect of radioactivity did begin earlier—and earlier than has hitherto been assumed: the possible bactericidal nature of the Becque-rel rays. In his 1903 textbook on radiology Freund mentions about 20 studies on the effects of X-rays on bacteria, many from 1896 to 1898,[9 : 251 ff] so it should not be surprising that at least some people at that time also tried to find out whether Becquerel rays might be bactericidal...|$|R
40|$|Radium {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic {{elements}} and its concentration in different human activities and migration from man-made wastes provokes a strong interest in environmental science. To be able to model the migration process, reliable experimental thermodynamic data of radium compounds are needed. In this work details of the safe radium source disassembly which were previously used in brachytherapy are described and different methods for conversion of RaSO 4 into aqueous solution are reviewed. The method of choice included three cycles of RaSO 4 heating in 1. 5 M Na 2 CO 3 up to 85 ºC, cooling and subsequent removal of supernatant. X-ray diffraction studies showed that the method allows the synthesis of amorphous RaCO 3, which can be dissolved in mineral acid. Gamma spectrometric measurements showed that most of the initial RaSO 4 was converted into solution and that 7 ± 1 % of the initial 210 Pb was co-precipitated with RaCO 3. Synthesized RaCO 3 was dissolved in HCl to prepare a radium stock solution. The radium stock solution was used to determine the solubility of pure RaSO 4 and RaCO 3 from oversaturation using Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 CO 3 as a source of sulfate and carbonate ions. The solubility was determined at 25. 1 ºC as a function of ionic strength using NaCl media. The concentration of radium was measured by gamma spectrometry after separation of the aqueous phase from the solid phase using ultracentrifugation. The extended specific ion interaction theory was used to extrapolate solubility product constants to zero ionic strength (log 10 Ksp° = - 10. 16 ± 0. 05 for RaSO 4 and log 10 Ksp° = - 7. 73 ± 0. 56 for RaCO 3) and to calculate ion interaction coefficients. A comparison of the shapes of the radium solubility curves for both anions with the shapes of corresponding barium solubility curves demonstrates the similarity of the behaviour of <b>radium</b> and barium <b>salts</b> in saline solutions. It can be supposed that due to the similarity of the radium and barium effective ionic radii, and the same charge, these ions undergo similar specific ion interactions in NaCl media...|$|R
