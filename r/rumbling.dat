5|$|Davis, Hill, and Mitchell {{find him}} <b>rumbling</b> {{around in the}} power plant. Davis tries to kill him, but Steiner resists his bullets, so Hill again tries to persuade Steiner {{to return to the}} laboratory. Steiner is {{eventually}} convinced, so he goes with them, but when he arrives, he tricks them and begins destroying things. With the laboratory on fire and the projection device wildly out of control, Steiner is hit by the projection device's laser, causing him to disappear as the fire rages on.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a <b>rumbling</b> roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E

25|$|A 2015 Federal Highway Administration study {{evaluated}} {{the application of}} shoulder <b>rumble</b> strips and centerline <b>rumble</b> strips in combination by analyzing geometric, traffic, and crash data obtained at treated two-lane rural road locations in Kentucky, Missouri and Pennsylvania. The results suggested {{that the effect of}} combining centerline and shoulder <b>rumble</b> strips further reduces run-off-road crashes compared to shoulder <b>rumble</b> strips alone and both total and fatal+injury crashes compared to centerline <b>rumble</b> strips alone. However, it appeared that shoulder <b>rumble</b> strips do not further reduce head-on+sideswipe-opposite-direction crashes than applying centerline <b>rumble</b> strips in isolation.|$|R

As they drive on the highway, the agents are surrounded by Jeeps carrying soldiers led by a Man in Black named Morris Fletcher (Michael McKean). A <b>rumbling</b> noise is heard as a mysterious craft flies overhead and a bright light from the object passes over them. Mulder and Fletcher find that their minds have been swapped into each other's bodies, but nobody else present is aware of this. Fletcher and Scully depart, watched by the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, <b>rumbling</b> and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a <b>rumbling</b> or {{cracking}} noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a <b>rumbling</b> triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.|$|E
25|$|Contracting muscles produce {{vibration}} and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions {{per second}} (equivalent to 10 to 30Hz sound frequency). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70Hz sound frequency). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound {{can be heard}} by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a <b>rumbling</b> sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this <b>rumbling</b> sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The <b>rumbling</b> sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when yawning deeply.|$|E

25|$|Royal <b>Rumble</b> (2016) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced by WWE. It took place on January 24, 2016, at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. It was the 29th event in the Royal <b>Rumble</b> chronology. The event also was the fifth Royal <b>Rumble</b> pay-per-view {{to be held in}} the state of Florida (1990, 1991, 1995, and 2006), the second (1990) to be held in Orlando, and the first pay-per-view event at the Amway Center.

25|$|A mid-diastolic <b>rumbling</b> murmur with presystolic {{accentuation}} will {{be heard}} after the opening snap. The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-five {{distinct}} vocalisations are recognised, many {{of which}} are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation. Sounds classified as grunts and barks are heard most frequently while traveling, and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members. They may also be used during social interactions when discipline is required. Screams and roars signal alarm or warning, and are produced most often by silverbacks. Deep, <b>rumbling</b> belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods. They are {{the most common form of}} intragroup communication.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} in the mid 1500s, the already ancient MacLeod castle in Stornoway 'fell victim to the cannons of the Duke of Argyle'. By the early 1600s <b>rumbling</b> trade wars came to a head, and all further {{government}} attempts to curtail traditional shipping rights were firmly resisted by the islanders, as was an attempt by James VI, King of Scotland, to establish on the island the Scottish trading company known as the Fife Adventurers around 1598.; as a result, in 1610, James VI transferred Lewis to the MacKenzies of Seaforth.|$|E
30|$|Coffee and tea {{was served}} during the event. After {{presenting}} themselves {{to each other}} the discussion started by asking the group: “What is your thoughts about <b>rumble</b> strips?” The interview guide was only used when needed and it consisted of in total six areas of questions: experience from first time driving on <b>rumble</b> strips, influence of <b>rumble</b> strips on their driving behaviour, 2  +  1 road with barrier compared to <b>rumble</b> strips, acceptance among drivers, {{the design of the}} <b>rumble</b> strips and future recommendation.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal <b>Rumble</b> {{match is}} usually {{located at the}} top of the card, though there have been {{exceptions}} such as the 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2006, and 2013 events. [...] Due to the <b>Rumble</b> match taking up a large amount of time (most <b>Rumble</b> matches last roughly one hour), the <b>Rumble</b> event tends to have a smaller card than most other pay-per-view events, which routinely have six to eight matches per card. The 2008 Royal <b>Rumble</b> was the first WWE pay-per-view to be available in high-definition.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} vocalization of the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, is the <b>rumble,</b> {{but there is}} no {{consensus}} as to how many <b>rumble</b> subtypes exist. From the standpoint of social function, many types of <b>rumble</b> have been proposed. From a structural standpoint, however, few studies have examined detailed acoustic measurements {{of a large number of}} calls. We analysed 270 <b>rumbles</b> from six adult female African elephants housed at Disney’s Animal Kingdom (Lake Buena Vista, Florida, U. S. A.). Subjects wore collars outfitted with microphones and radiotransmitters that allowed recording of vocalizations from identified individuals. <b>Rumble</b> vocalizations were digitized and both source and filter features were measured for each call. Behavioural and endocrine data were collected so that acoustical data could be placed into the context of ongoing social behaviour and reproductive state. Multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that, from a structural standpoint, <b>rumbles</b> from this captive setting could not be divided into distinct subtypes, but there was extensive acoustic variation across <b>rumbles.</b> Discriminant function analysis and MANOVA were employed to further explore this variation. First, acoustic characteristics varied according to the individual identity of the caller. Second, <b>rumbles</b> varied as a function of negative emotional arousal. When associating with dominant animals, subordinate females produced <b>rumbles</b> with lower cepstral coefficients, suggesting low tonality and unstable pitch in the voice, compared to <b>rumbles</b> produced outside of the presence of dominant animals. <b>Rumbles</b> as a whole did not cluster into distinct acoustic types, but structural variation in <b>rumbles</b> reflected the individual identity and emotional state of callers...|$|R
