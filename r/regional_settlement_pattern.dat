40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a method to deal with poorly dated site {{inventories}} for purposes of (supra-) <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> analysis. We created a site database for the Roman period in the Dutch River Area {{on the basis of}} existing digital inventories, and analyzed the quality of dating information provided in those inventories in order to better understand the development of settlement patterns during the Roman period. We did this by applying principles of aoristic analysis, dividing the time spans assigned to each registered artefact over the archaeological periods considered, and then simulating the probability of finds belonging to a specific archaeological period. Using this method, it is possible to judge the quality of dating information per site, and to analyze patterns of settlement density and site location while taking into account the uncertainty of dating information. Our analyses broadly confirm earlier studies, but they also provide a more solid, quantitative basis to previous work. Furthermore, they highlight the limitations of using the currently available information for settlement pattern analysis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the initial {{allocation}} of immigrants to Sweden 1967 - 2005 by age in a regional perspective. Vacancies, unemployment and labour market participation as well as geographical areas with many previous immigrants are included in the analysis as pull-factors. A multivariate cross-section OLS regression model will be used to estimate the relative initial regional distribution of immigrants in Sweden in 1967, 1975, 1990 and 2005 by age. The chosen method enables to control for a subset of explanatory variables and examine the effect of a selected independent variable when estimating the regional pull-factors to immigration. This study uses data collected from Statistics Sweden (SCB) and the National Labour Market Board (AMS). The data used is regional macro data, which does not contain information on single individuals.

Censuses and recent American Community Survey data, I ask to what extent differences in language skills drive this. I find they are important. I estimate that the response of immigrants’ relative wages to immigration is concentrated among immigrants with poor English skills. Similarly, immigrants who arrive at young ages, as adults, both have stronger English skills and exhibit greater substitutability for native-born workers than immigrants who arrive older. In U. S. markets where Spanish speakers are concentrated, I find a “Spanish-speaking” labor market emerges: in such markets, the return to speaking English is low, and the wages of Spanish and non-Spanish speakers respond most strongly to skill ratios {{in their own language}} group. Finally, in Puerto Rico, where almost all workers speak Spanish, I find immigrants and natives are perfect substitutes.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{deliberate}} {{observation of}} contemporary northern hunters {{is one way}} of enhancing the interpretation of the archaeological record in the western Canadian Subarctic. This paper is based on six months of archaeological ethnography at a residential hunting camp in the mid-Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories, Canada, followed by archaeological excavations at the same camp of Dene hunters. The conceptual framework of this research is ethnoarchaeology, which encompasses the theoretical and methodological aspects of a comparing ethnographic and archaeological data. A model for identifying tepee remains in the absence of surficial architectural remains is pre ented, based on the excavation of a currently occupied tepee at the hunting camp. This model consists of a number of attributes, ranging from a central hearth to subterranean storage facilities. The probability that tepee architecture is present increases with every attribute that can be documented archaeologically. The presence or absence of architectural remains is essential in the identification of site function, and site function is the key to reconstructing the <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> in pre-ethnographic times. There is a certain urgency in integrating first-hand accounts of northern hunters with the archaeological record, as opportunities to do so continue to dwindle {{with the passage of time}} and the ever-increasing pace of culture change in the western Canadian Subarctic...|$|E
40|$|The Hongshan {{societies}} of northeastern China are among East Asia’s earliest complex societies. They {{have been known}} largely from elaborate burials with carved jades in ceremonial platforms. The most monumental remains are concentrated in a “core zone” in western Liaoning province. Residential remains are less well known and most investigations {{of them have been}} in peripheral regions outside the core zone. Recent <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> research around the well known ceremonial site of Dongshanzui has begun to document the communities that built and used Hongshan core zone monuments and to assess their developmental dynamics. The core zone, like the Hongshan periphery, appears to have been organized into a series of small chiefly districts within which ceremonial activities were important integrative forces. Their estimated populations of less than 1, 000 are not much larger than those of districts in the periphery, and the evidence does not suggest that these districts were integrated into any larger political entity. The greater elaboration of core zone monumental architecture is thus not attributable to demographically larger communities or to larger-scale political integration. Future research should focus on documenting the organization of statuses and economic activities within these core zone communities to assess potential differences from peripheral communities in these regards...|$|E
40|$|Recent archaeological explorations {{elsewhere}} in the northern Maya lowlands have provided enough evidence to state that social complexity emerged in this region {{as early as the}} second half of the Middle Preclassic period (approximately 1000 - 400 / 300 BC). This has reformulated our understanding about northern Maya lowlands that had been considered as a peripheral place regard as the emergence of sociopolitical organization. Nowadays, the debate is concerned about the nature and level of sociopolitical organization of societies in northern Maya lowlands. That is whether they were at the level of chiefdom or state. I approach this problematic from the analysis of a public building, which I consider as embodying and expressing asymmetrical social relations. That is it is identified as architecture of power. A public building, Structure 1714, provides the means to test the models of political organization. Structure 1714 is located at Xamán Susulá, a middle-rank site in the three-tiered settlement pattern hierarchy of northwestern Yucatán, México. This building is the most largest and impressive of the site. It is characterized by the presence of the earliest throne reported in the entire Maya lowlands. The analysis of Structure 1714, in conjunction with the plan of the site and the <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern,</b> indicates that Xamán Susulá was organized at the level of chiefdom. Most importantly, I state that this society was an individualizing chiefdom that employed an exclusionary or network strategy of political integratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{political}} and economic strategies of Philippine chiefs are examined {{in the context of}} trade interactions with mainland Asian states in the late first millennium and early second millennium A. D. Archaeological evidence from the Bais Region in the central Philippines is used to document the relationship between emerging political complexity and reliance on foreign trade as an external source of politically manipulable wealth. Shifts in <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns,</b> increasingly "standardized" ceramics, and an expanded volume of coastal-interior trade provide evidence for the emergence of more centralized production and distribution systems within the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Bais Region chiefdom.

40|$|The geographical, ethnical and {{environmental}} diversity of Cisalpine Gaul before Roman conquest – {{starting with the}} foundation of the Latin colony of Ariminum in 268 BC – makes synthetic approaches to the Padan region difficult, if not impossible. Raffaele C.

This is illustrated by archaeological examples from the Po Plain and the Val Camonica and Friuli regions. Late Iron Age Cisalpine habitation sites show common morphological and technical features that can be defined as multicultural due to their common occurrence in Venetian, Ligurian, Rhaetian, Celtic and Etruscan contexts. This observation limits the value of habitation sites as cultural markers. Consequently, the concepts of métissage (hybridization), integration and cohabitation will form the basis of this archaeological inquiry...|$|R
40|$|The Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) {{region of}} {{southwest}} Florida contains extensive prehistoric shell middens and mounds called shell works. Though shell work sites comprise {{some of the}} largest and most complicated prehistoric shell constructions in the world, prior to this study, none had been thoroughly examined in their spatial, temporal and functional contexts, and shell work sites remain very poorly understood. This thesis aims to define the archaeological characteristics of shell work sites within the TTI region, including their spatial patterns, function, geographic extent, and temporal affiliation. Though shell work sites are complex, complicated sites that are analogous to palimpsests, I argue that shell work sites are more than just large shell midden accumulations, amalgamations of shell mounds, or assemblages of features; they are distinct, socially constructed prehistoric landscapes. In order to understand these complex histories, I contend that they need to be examined on several complementary temporal and spatial scales, and I incorporate a multi-scalar landscape approach. This includes examining shell work sites as individually constructed features and sites, as human centered social landscapes, and within a larger, <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> context. Central to my thesis is the hypothesis that shell work sites reflect changes in social complexity. I posit that shell work sites throughout the region are arranged in spatially similar patterns, ranging from small, simple shell midden rings, to massive islands completely constructed out of complex arrangements of shell. I test the theory that similarity or diversity in site layouts, and the presence or absence of certain architectural features reflects changes in community and social organization over time, and thus, social complexity.

40|$|Intensive survey {{over the}} last several decades has {{detailed}} an archaeological surface record in the Mediterranean that Cherry (1983 : 395, emphasis in original) describes as 2 ̆ 2 likely to consist of a virtually continuous spatial distribution of material over the landscape, but a distribution extremely variable in density. 2 ̆ 2 In addition, geoarchaeological work, often coupled with survey, has demonstrated just how dynamic Mediterranean surfaces have been. Both of these field practices, intensive survey and geoarchaeology, were carried out in part to enable <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> studies, to collect accurate, reliable, and precise data about past settlements and their location with respect to each other and with respect to aspects of the landscape (Cherry and Shennan 1978). As a result of intensive surface survey and geoarchaeological work, a paradox has become apparent. This paradox is that the surface archaeological record is of such a quality that the settlement mode of interpretation, the impetus for the high quality work undertaken in the Mediterranean, may be inappropriate. That is, it demonstrates that rather than a record of settlements awaiting discovery and definition by the archaeologist, the archaeological record is better considered a record of places with different material histories, both cultural and natural. Viewed in this way, the surface record, currently interpreted in terms of settlements and using empirical, historical conventions, instead becomes a source of information on the human condition at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Below, I make the case for this paradoxical situation (see also Holdaway and Wandsnider n. d.; Wandsnider 2004; Wandsnider and Holdaway n. d.). Archaeologists working elsewhere and not explicitly concerned with the archaeological landscape have come to a similar realization, concluding that a metaphysical shift in the approach to archaeological deposits appears warranted. Given this shift, how should interpretation of Mediterranean archaeological landscapes proceed? Two additions to the archaeological tool kit are suggested: a library of potential multi-temporal processes and a series of three interpretative tools...|$|E
40|$|Planners of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, {{the first}} {{large-scale}} urban rail project {{built in the}} U. S. since {{the early part of}} this century, hoped BART would encourage compact and orderly growth, and spawn a multi-centered settlement pattern. The initial BART impact study, conducted a few years following the system's 1973 opening, concluded that BART played a fairly modest, though not inconsequential, role in shaping metropolitan growth and land-use patterns. This paper summarizes findings from an update of the original BART impact study, examining BART's influences on urban development patterns 20 years after services started. In general, our findings are similar to those of the original impact study. Over the past 20 years, land-use changes associated with BART have been largely localized, limited to downtown San Francisco and Oakland and a handful of suburban stations. Elsewhere, few land-use changes have occurred, either because of neighborhood opposition or a lackluster local real estate market. While BART appears to have helped bring about a more multi-centered <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern,</b> such as inducing midrise office development near the Walnut Creek and Concord stations, it has done little to stem the tide of freeway-oriented suburban employment growth over the past two decades. Indeed, recent office additions near East Bay stations pale in comparison to the amount of floorspace built in non-BART freeway corridors. Near several suburban stations, the most notable change has been the addition of multi-family housing. In most instances, local redevelopment authorities helped leverage these projects by providing various financial incentives and assistance with land assemblege. Statistical analyses reveal that the availability of vacant and developable land is an important predictor of whether land-use changes occurred near stations. BART, in and of itself, has clearly not been able to induce large-scale land-use changes, though under the right circumstances, it appears to have been an important contributor. If the Bay Area is to achieve the compact, multi-centered built form that was originally envisaged, we conclude that stronger public policy initiatives will be needed to channel future regional growth to BART corridors. ...|$|E

40|$|During the mid- 1980 s, {{visitors}} and staff at Pettigrew State Park in Washington County, North Carolina discovered {{a series of}} prehistoric dugout canoes and associated artifacts in and around Lake Phelps. Beginning in 1985, archaeological investigations were undertaken at Lake Phelps to locate and identify prehistoric canoes. They also {{conducted a series of}} surveys aimed at collecting and identifying prehistoric artifacts. The work in these areas led to the discovery of 23 canoes, 19 of which have been radiocarbon dated, and the recovery of 5829 prehistoric artifacts. After these initial investigations, few archaeological investigations have been undertaken at Lake Phelps. Over the next 25 years the lake was only revisited five times, and all of this work focused primarily on the canoes.   	This changed in 2007 when low lake levels again led to the discovery of a significant amount of cultural material. This caused a renewed interest in the prehistory of Lake Phelps, and it was the catalyst for this thesis project. At the request of the North Carolina Department of Parks and Recreation, I conducted a research project focused on the prehistoric occupation of Lake Phelps. This project had four main objectives. The first was to locate and integrate all of the previous research from the lake. These documents were held by a variety of agencies, many of which were unaware of the existence of outside documents. With the data from the Lake Phelps archaeological investigations spread about in this manner, it prevented an accurate and inclusive evaluation of the work done at Lake Phelps. The consolidation of these data in this thesis allows for a complete and detailed evaluation of the prehistoric occupation of the lake. This thesis also presents materials collected during fieldwork designed to fill in gaps in the data. This fieldwork consisted of a survey of portions of site 31 WH 12. This survey completed the controlled collection of the entire site that was begun in the 1980 s. The material from the survey was analyzed and integrated with that of the previous work. All of the data from Lake Phelps are used to define spatial and temporal patterns in the prehistoric occupation of Lake Phelps. These patterns are used to generate a culture history for Lake Phelps. The final step of the project uses this model to generate a context for future work on the lake.   	The results of the re-examination of the Lake Phelps data reveal a prehistoric occupation that began in the Late Paleoindian and lasted until the Late Woodland period, with the lake being abandoned before Europeans reached the region in the Eighteenth century. Archaeological investigations also show reveal four distinct areas of prehistoric occupation on the northern and western shores of Lake Phelps. An examination of the artifacts and canoes found in these occupational areas shows that they were used differentially throughout time, in many cases reflecting the larger <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> trends seen across the rest of the North Carolina coastal plain.   M.

The aim is not only to determine the timing of that recolonisation, but also to propose a general model of hunter-gatherer colonisation at a sub-continental scale. The question is addressed of how long the period of abandonment of northern Europe during the Würm/Weichsel glaciation may have lasted, and when it both started and came to an end. A series of questions is asked concerning the processes and mechanics of recolonisation and the sequences for specific areas are examined. AMS radiocarbon dating shows that a two stage process was involved, which has important implications for our analysis of <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> and the changing scale of Lateglacial hunting systems. Recolonisation was a dynamic process, integral to, and internally driven by, the social life of Lateglacial hunters.

D. 900 to 1200) were tested using a multidisciplinary scientific approach that includes osteological and bioarchaeological data in conjunction with available archaeological data. The archaeological theories are derived from broad patterns of evidence based on reconstructions of the paleoenvironment, <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns,</b> site construction, and local contexts. This complex analysis of violence is accomplished through the examination of human remains from three pre-Columbian sites in the American Southwest, La Plata (LA 37592 and LA 37593) and Peñasco Blanco. Through the use of taphonomic science, marks on the skeletal material were identified as either abiotic or biotic and their causes discussed. Those marks produced from violence and warfare were examined in association with the complex social and cultural interactions that can lead to violence. Violence and warfare are both defined, and the idea of violence as a cultural performance is advocated through the concept of the Politicization of the Dead. This work revises recently proposed patterns of violence in the prehistoric Southwest and offers an alternative hypothesis for the multiple types of cultural taphonomic processing seen on the various human skeletal assemblages throughout the prehistoric American Southwest. ...|$|R
40|$|The Prehistoric Stones of Greece {{set out to}} {{quantify}} and collate in as much detail as possible, information about Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites in Greece, and to describe the field survey projects {{which resulted in the}} discovery of the majority of these. Neolithic sites discovered during field survey were also recorded. Material culture including tools and other objects, structures and features, along with fauna and flora were documented, including those from later periods when from palimpsests or multi period sites. The aim was to create an overview of the results of many years of intensive field survey and to create a searchable archive with which to investigate <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> and to identify likely areas for future research. The dataset includes information about sites and findspots including location, elevation, chronology, and the types of artefacts and ecofacts recovered. These have been standardised as far as possible to allow region wide comparisons and analysis of variability. The dataset is predominantly based on published accounts and occasionally grey literature from unpublished reports. In a small number of cases it has benefited from the results of our own research in Greece. New field survey projects continue to be set up and sites and findspots discovered, investigated and published. We endeavour to make the dataset as up to date as possible and continue to refine the records and to add new information as it becomes available...|$|R
40|$|We explore {{settlement}} {{structures and}} hierarchy found in different archaeological periods in northern, specifically the Khabur Triangle (KT), and southern Mesopotamia (SM) using a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) {{modeling and simulation}} method. <b>Regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> are investigated {{in order to understand}} what feedback levels for settlement benefits, or incentives, and abilities to move or disperse between sites in a landscape and period could have enabled observed settlement structures to emerge or be maintained. Archaeological and historical data are then used to interpret the best results. We suggest that in the Late Chalcolithic (LC) and first half of the Early Bronze Age (EBA), the KT and SM appear to have comparable urban patterns and development, where settlement advantage feedbacks and movement are similarly shaping the two regions for those periods. Within period variations, such as restrictions to population diffusion or movement in the EBA, are possible. In the KT during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA), multiple centers begin to emerge, suggesting a lack of social cohesion and/or political fragmentation. This is similar to SM in the MBA, but we also see the emergence of a single, dominant site. In the Iron Age (IA), movement in the KT likely becomes the least constrained in all assessed periods, as socio-political cohesion facilitates this process, with small sites now the norm and dominance by one state over the region is evident. For the same period in SM, a single site (Babylon) obtains significant settlement advantages relative to its neighbors and easy movement enables it to become far larger in size and likely socially, economically, and politically dominant. Overall, the results demonstrate that the method is useful for archaeologists and social theorists in allowing them to compare different archaeological survey results, with varied spatial dimensions and diachronically, while providing a level of explanation that addresses empirical <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{upon which}} this dissertation is based was collected over a four year period. The research included studies in ethnohistory, geography, paleobotany and cultural ecology, conducted {{within the context}} of an archaeological survey of the lower Connecticut River valley. The primary objectives of the research were to construct a regional culture history of the lower valley, and to document changes in <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> through time. ^ Over 350 prehistoric sites were located through a combination of field surveys and informant interviews. Located sites ranged in age from 8, 000 B. C. to A. D. 1700. ^ Based upon excavations at over 60 of these sites, nine distinct phases were identified in the lower Connecticut River Valley, from the Archaic (ca. 2500 B. C.) through the Contact Periods (ca. A. D. 1600). Two major changes in aboriginal <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> were detected. The first, beginning around 1000 B. C., indicates a trend toward a more logistically oriented settlement system, with large seasonal occupations located along the Connecticut River and smaller temporary and task-specific locations in the uplands. This trend continued throughout the Woodland Period, where it culminated in sedentary villages around A. D. 1000. ^ The second major change in <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> began around A. D. 1500, when the settlement system was characterized by the presence of small seasonal upland camps, demonstrated to be associated with small extended or nuclear families. This orientation towards smaller economic units indicates some important changes in aboriginal socio-economic systems during this period. ^ Several potential explanations for these settlement shifts are examined in this thesis. The initial settlement shift to riverine areas {{may be the result of}} increased reliance on wetland resources, or developing trade networks with the upper Hudson valley. The second settlement change to smaller subsistence units could be the result of either intensification of horticulture, or early contact with Europeans. ^ Data on site distributions and site types are presented and discussed for each defined phase. The data for each phase are then assessed with respect to current models of settlement and subsistence in southern New England. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} synthesis of <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> in the central coastal plain of modern Israel from {{the onset of the}} Middle Bronze Age {{to the end of the}} Iron Age (ca. 2000 – 539 B. C. E.). The ancient mound of Jaffa, situated on the southern Levantine coast south of the outlet of the Yarkon River, was the closest maritime outlet for Jerusalem and other highland centers in ancient times. Jaffa has the distinct status of being one of the few ports on the southern Levantine coast featuring an almost continual occupation history from the Middle Bronze Age through the modern era. Yet a lack of inclusion for Jaffa and other hinterland sites in archaeological and historical studies of the coastal plain is evident. In light of renewed excavations on the ancient mound of Jaffa, new analyses of the site’s and region’s material culture recovered from excavations conducted over the last sixty years necessitate the current examination of <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> and systems to elucidate the potential economic and cultural connections between the port and inland sites, both urban and rural in nature by providing a regional perspective for material culture recovered at Jaffa. Additionally, a reconstruction of the variety of local terrestrial, aquatic, and anthropogenic biomes of the Bronze and Iron Ages as represented in the archaeological record is presented. It is argued here that the fundamental connections between all the sites in various periods can be interpreted through the framework of a maritime cultural landscape. Thus situated, Jaffa served as a gateway for the coastal plain and the highlands, connecting inland sites with materials from the coast and acting as a transit point for commodities produced inland that would be transshipped to other gateways in the eastern Mediterranean. Despite fluctuations in Jaffa’s prominence resulting from changes in political control, shared material culture with inland sites illustrates the strong connections that Jaffa forged with its hinterland as a unique central place within the settlement system of the coastal plain...|$|R
40|$|Using {{detailed}} plant- {{level data}} from the 1988 and 1993 Surveys of Manufacturing Technology, this paper examines the impact of skill mix in U. S. local labor markets on the use and adoption of automation technologies in manufacturing. The level of automation differs widely across U. S. metropolitan areas. In both 1988 and 1993, in markets with a higher relative availability of lessskilled labor, comparable plants – even plants in the same narrow (4 -digit SIC) industries – used systematically less automation. Moreover, between 1988 and 1993 plants in areas experiencing faster less-skilled relative labor supply growth adopted automation technology more slowly, both overall and relative to expectations, and even de-adoption was not uncommon. This relationship is stronger when examining an arguably exogenous component of local less-skilled labor supply derived from historical <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> of immigrants {{from different parts of}} the world. These results have implications for two long-standing puzzles in economics. First, they potentially explain why research has repeatedly found that immigration has little impact on the wages of competing native-born workers at the local level. It might be that the technologies of local firms—rather than the wages that they offer—respond to changes in local skill mix associated with immigration. A modified two-sector model demonstrates this theoretical possibility. Second, the results raise doubts {{about the extent to which}} the spread of new technologies have raised demand for skills, one frequently forwarded hypothesis for the cause of rising wage inequality in the United States. Causality appears to at least partly run in the opposite direction, where skill supply drive s the spread of skill-complementary technology. Technological change, immigration, local labor market...|$|R
40|$|The Crib Mound Site (12 Sp 1 - 2) is a shell mound that {{contains}} a major Mid-Late Archaic element. This site has been largely destroyed {{over the past few}} decades as a result of erosion by the Ohio River, development, artifact collecting and blatant looting. Collections of artifacts from the mound, and much of the relevant information about the site, are located in the private sector. Only minimal artifact representations from Crib Mound reside in universities or museums. This site has received little in-depth professional investigation or study. Although it is one of several significant multi-component archaeological sites in the Lower Ohio Drainage with an indication of a significant Mid-Late Archaic component, it has not been accurately incorporated into discussions of Mid-Late Archaic settlement systems. The underlying reason for this omission relates to the information from the site not having been systematically recorded or synthesized into a usable format for archaeological research. This thesis analyzes, documents and evaluates the chronologically sensitive data from Crib Mound as a means of defining the mound's relationship to other (already documented) Mid-Late Archaic sites that are found in the region of theLower Ohio River Basin. This research also explores the relationship between tradition and phase (as it existed in this area), perhaps identifying an earlier phase or phases that can be distinguished from within the tradition. All information from the Crib Mound Site is integrated into the regional prehistory by either expanding on the anomaly of the mound or by clarifying and supporting the mound's relationship with the current <b>regional</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns.</b> Department of AnthropologyThesis (M.
