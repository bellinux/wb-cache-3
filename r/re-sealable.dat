50|$|Pulling {{from her}} {{knowledge}} of pulp and paper, Corbett designed a bottle that combines a rigid outer pulp shell (made mainly from old corrugated cardboard boxes or “OCC”) with a thin inner plastic liner and <b>re-sealable</b> cap. She patented her technology and began to explore the market opportunity for her innovation. The bottle evolved into an eco-friendly replacement for milk, juice, laundry detergent, household cleaning products and other high volume liquid categories.|$|E
50|$|The Ecologic bottle uses {{proprietary}} technology to combine a rigid molded pulp outer shell {{with a thin}} plastic inner liner and <b>re-sealable</b> cap. The molded fiber shell is made from 100% post-consumer recycled material and is 100% compostable or re-recyclable with paper. The inner liner is made of #2 or #4 BPA-free plastic and uses up to 70% less plastic than comparable plastic jugs. The Ecologic bottle can be customized to a brand's specifications. Bottles are disposed by pulling open the shell to separate the two components.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} box {{is filled}} with 10 pouches of juice, and each pouch is 200 ml. In the U.S., Capri-Sun pouches are now 6 fluid ounces previously they were 8 fl. oz. (240 ml). [...] The pouch is trapezoidal in profile when filled and rectangular when flat, with a flared bottom that makes the pouch able to stand upright when placed on a horizontal surface. A straw is supplied with each individual pouch. Other sizes, such as the 330ml pouch with a <b>re-sealable</b> cap, are available in some countries.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 Mayfield's Athens {{plant was}} the first in the {{industry}} to successfully implement in-plant blow-molding for production of plastic milk jugs. In 1988 Mayfield {{was the first}} dairy to use an opaque plastic milk jug that protects milk from ultraviolet light. In 1995, Mayfield launched the single-serve Chug milk bottle for Dean Foods. The single-serve bottle increased milk consumption by letting milk compete with single-serving soft drinks. In 2002 its Clik-Top <b>re-sealable</b> ice cream carton, including a break-seal that makes the package easier to open and a locking tab to keep the carton closed during storage, was greeted as a packaging first.|$|E
50|$|An {{atmospheric}} railway uses differential {{air pressure}} to provide power for propulsion of a railway vehicle. A {{static power source}} can transmit motive power to the vehicle in this way, avoiding the necessity of carrying mobile power generating equipment. The air pressure, or partial vacuum (i.e. negative relative pressure) can be conveyed to the vehicle in a continuous pipe, where the vehicle carries a piston running in the tube. Some form of <b>re-sealable</b> slot is required to enable the piston to {{be attached to the}} vehicle. Alternatively the entire vehicle may act as the piston in a large tube.|$|E
50|$|The Towne Club {{brand is}} now {{controlled}} by Intrastate Distributors, Inc., known as IDI, Inc. Within {{a couple of}} years, the Towne Club brands switched to plastic <b>re-sealable</b> bottles and new labeling. IDI also bottles other beverages, including Orange Crush, Frostie Root Beer and Stewart's Root Beer. As of 2013, Towne Club products are available in glass bottles with screw-top caps. Current flavor offerings include Orange, Peach, Cola, Grape, Tropical Punch, Strawberry, City Rush (Their version of M.Mist/M.Dew), Vanilla Cream, Michigan Cherry, Strawberry Melon, Mango Orange, Root Beer, Honolulu Blue, Pineapple Passionfruit, and Gingerale along with the three recently introduced new flavors Michigan Berries, Tiger Citrus Punch and Lion Energy.|$|E
40|$|Introduction As {{a result}} of the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations and Tobacco Products Directive, all packs of {{cigarettes}} (factory-made and hand-rolled) in the United Kingdom must be drab brown, display pictorial warnings on the principal display areas, and contain no less than 20 cigarettes or 30 grams of tobacco. The legislation was phased in between May 2016 and May 2017. Our objective was to monitor pack, brand and product changes pre- and post-implementation.   Methods Our surveillance of the cigarette market involved a review of the trade press, a monthly monitor of online supermarkets, and regular visits to stores, from May 2015 to June 2017.   Results Pre-standardised packaging there were changes to the pack graphics (e. g. redesigned packs and limited-editions) and pack structure (e. g. <b>re-sealable</b> inner foil), and the issue of a number of re-usable tins. Post-standardised packaging, changes included newer cigarette pack sizes for some brand variants (e. g. 23 and 24 packs). Changes to the branding pre-standardised packaging included brand extensions, and post-standardised packaging included brand and/or variant name change, often with the inclusion of colour descriptors, and brand migrations. Product changes pre-standardised packaging included the introduction of novel filters (e. g. filters with two flavour-changing capsules, tube filters, firmer filters, and filters with granular additives). There was non-compliance with the legislation, with slim packs, which are not permitted, on sale after standardised packaging was implemented.   Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to monitor developments in markets introducing standardised packaging, and have policy implications for countries considering this measure...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of milli and micro litre bioreactors to accelerate process {{development has been}} successfully demonstrated in traditional biotechnology. However, for regenerative medicine present smaller scale culture methods cannot cope with {{the wide range of}} processing variables that need to be evaluated. Existing microfabricated culture devices, which could test different culture variables with a minimum amount of resources (e. g. expensive culture medium), are typically not designed with process development in mind. We present a novel, autoclavable, and microfabricated scale-down device designed for regenerative medicine process development. The microfabricated device contains a <b>re-sealable</b> culture chamber that facilitates use of standard culture protocols, creating a link with traditional small-scale culture devices for validation and scale-up studies. Further, the modular design can easily accommodate investigation of different culture substrate/extra-cellular matrix combinations. Inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEF) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC) colonies were successfully seeded on gelatine-coated tissue culture polystyrene (TC-PS) using standard static seeding protocols. The microfluidic chip included in the device offers precise and accurate control over the culture medium flow rate and resulting shear stresses in the device. Cells were cultured for two days with media perfused at 300 µl. h(- 1) resulting in a modelled shear stress of 1. 1 × 10 (- 4) Pa. Following perfusion, hESC colonies stained positively for different pluripotency markers and retained an undifferentiated morphology. An image processing algorithm was developed which permits quantification of co-cultured colony-forming cells from phase contrast microscope images. hESC colony sizes were quantified against the background of the feeder cells (iMEF) in less than 45 seconds for high-resolution images, which will permit real-time monitoring of culture progress in future experiments. The presented device is a first step to harness the advantages of microfluidics for regenerative medicine process development...|$|E
