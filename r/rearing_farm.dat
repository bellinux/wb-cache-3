The infections include not only the Australian cricket species but the New Zealand cricket, Pteronemobius nigrovus, as well as the European house cricket, Acheta domesticus. CrPV does not appear to infect locusts. It is a commonly detected virus in honeybees as an inapparent infection. The strain CrPVbrk was isolated from the cricket A. domesticus ca.1980 following a major population collapse at a cricket <b>rearing</b> <b>farm</b> in Georgia. A related virus from Arkansas, initially called Pseudoplusia includens virus and redesignated CrPVark, was recorded in the mid-1980s. The brk and ark strains are closely related serologically but appear to be very distantly related to the other CrPV isolates so, despite their physical and chemical similarities, it remains speculative that these two American isolates are actually strains of CrPV. Reported detections and/or isolations of CrPV have been made in Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Indonesia. CrPV has one of the widest host-ranges, if not the widest, of any virus, insect or not. The potential for the use of CrPV as a biological control agent for insects has been suggested.

40|$|Background: The {{focus of}} {{management}} in many complex systems is shifting towards facilitation, adaptation, building resilience, and reducing vulnerability. Resilience management requires {{the development and}} application of general heuristics and methods for tracking changes in both resilience and vulnerability. We explored the emergence of vulnerability in the South African domestic ostrich industry, an animal production system which typically involves 3 - 4 movements of each bird during its lifetime. This system has experienced several disease outbreaks, and {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate whether these movements have contributed to the vulnerability of this system to large disease outbreaks. Methodology/Principal Findings: The ostrich production system requires numerous movements of birds between different farm types associated with growth (i. e. Hatchery to juvenile <b>rearing</b> <b>farm</b> to adult <b>rearing</b> <b>farm).</b> We used 5 years of movement records between 2005 and 2011 prior to an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H 5 N 2). These data were analyzed using a network analysis in which the farms were represented as nodes and the movements of birds as links. We tested the hypothesis that increasing economic efficiency in the domestic ostrich industry in South Africa made the system more vulnerable to outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H 5 N 2). Our results indicated that as time progressed, the network became increasingly vulnerable to pathogen outbreaks. The farms that became infected during the outbreak displayed network qualities, such as significantly higher connectivity and centrality, which predisposed them to be more vulnerable to disease outbreak. Conclusions/ Significance: Taken in the context of previous research, our results provide strong support for the application of network analysis to track vulnerability, while also providing useful practical implications for system monitoring and management...|$|E

Isolate species were identified {{with a combination of}} phenotypic tests, hipO colony blot hybridization, and multiplex lpxA PCR. Breakpoint resistance to four antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, and doxycycline) was determined by agar dilution. Campylobacter jejuni was the most frequent species isolated (34. 1 %), followed by Campylobacter coli (7. 7 %) and other thermophilic campylobacters (1. 5 %). The most frequently detected resistance was to doxycycline (42. 3 % of 350 isolates). Isolates from calf rearer facilities were more frequently doxycycline resistant than isolates from other farm types. C. jejuni was most frequently susceptible to all four of the antimicrobial drugs studied (58. 8 % of 272 isolates).

40|$|International audienceRice is {{cultivated}} in 114 countries worldwide, with {{nearly half of}} the world's waterfowl species being directly or indirectly relying on this production during at least one stage of their life cycle. The literature on wild ducks in rice fields is disproportionately represented by studies in North America (although less than 1 % of the world's rice fields), while studies in Asia (90 % of the worldwide rice production) are mainly focused on the agronomic benefits of breeding farm ducks in Integrated Rice–Duck Farming Systems. In the present literature review we compile knowledge on the interactions between rice farming and ducks, considering positive and negative interactions between the two entities, strategies to alleviate the problems as well as triggers and management options to promote the beneficial relationships. In particular, we focus on (1) the way rice-production areas could be managed in a waterfowl-friendly way, and (2) the agronomic consequences that rice farmers could in return receive from attracting wild ducks or <b>rearing</b> <b>farm</b> ducks in rice fields. For the farmers, the main constraints seem to be associated with duck damages to rice as well as flooding costs. For the ducks, the major issues are habitat loss, homogenization, disturbance and potential disease transmission. However, the present literature review suggests that duck–rice farming is a mutually beneficial association and demonstrates that relatively simple management such as winter flooding can be taken to improve the usability of these habitats to waterfowl, the farmers in turn benefitting from waterfowl ecosystem services...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify how farmers learn how to farm using pluriactive lifestyle block ostrich farmers who are part of the New Zealand ostrich industry as a case study. Ostrich farming is comparatively new to New Zealand farmers and the industry has attracted innovative individuals who have developed informal learning strategies. Ostrich farmers use other farmers as their main resource which is mainly facilitated through events organised by the New Zealand Ostrich Association (NZOA) and aimed at lifestyle block farmers. Ostrich farmers' community of practice is centred around their membership to the Association which enables farmers to come together to learn and socialise. For learning to effectively take place the key is social interaction, where ideas can be transferred between farmers. This thesis illustrates the important events and structure of the industry and how this has shaped farmer learning. Through semi-structured interviews and participant observation on a chick <b>rearing</b> <b>farm</b> I was able to gain a picture of how lifestyle block farmers balance full time off-farm employment while running stock, in an attempt to satisfy their version of the rural idyll.

As SFP can also be influenced by housing conditions on the <b>rearing</b> <b>farm,</b> we included effects of housing system and litter availability in the analysis. Forty-seven rearing flocks, originating from ten PS flocks were followed. Behavioral and physiological parameters related to anxiety and SFP were studied in the PS at 40 weeks of age and in the rearing flocks at one, five, ten and fifteen weeks of age. We found that PS had an effect on SFP at one week of age and on anxiety at one and five weeks of age. In the white hybrid, but not in the brown hybrid, high levels of maternal corticosterone, maternal feather damage and maternal whole-blood serotonin levels showed positive relations with offsprings ’ SFP at one week and offsprings ’ anxiety at one and five weeks of age. Disruption and limitation of litter supply at an early age on the rearing farms increased SFP, feather damage and fearfulness. These effects were most prominent in the brown hybrid.

Livestock waste, from Sus domesticus, pig, and Gallus domesticus, poultry, were employed as substrates in the study which uses water from a fish <b>rearing</b> <b>farm</b> as the matrix medium to simulate wastewater pool/river environment. A substrate to fish-water ratio of 1 : 3 by mass was used in developed laboratory-size digesting reactor system with U-tube water displacement, to facilitate volumetric readings of gas production, for each mix of the livestock waste. Volumetric readings from these, at ambient temperature conditions in the retention time of 32 days, follow the Normal probability density function, in accordance with Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit criteria. These readings showed that CH 4 -containing gas as high as 67. 3 × 10 - 3 dm 3 was produced on the 14 th day from the pig and 86. 8 × 10 - 3 dm 3 on the 13 th day from the poultry substrates. The overall CH 4 -containing gas productions of 255. 4 × 10 - 3 dm 3 /kg and 323. 58 × 10 - 3 dm 3 /kg were observed for the pig and the poultry substrates, respectively. A 70 % scale-up analysis, modelled from these results, for the nation yield potential emission of about 4 kg CH 4 (that could be as potent as 84 kg CO 2 -equivalent) annually.

40|$|AbstractHealthy {{replacement}} heifers {{are one of}} {{the foundations}} of a healthy dairy herd. Farm management and rearing systems in Switzerland provide a wide variety of factors that could potentially be associated with intramammary infections (IMI) in early lactating dairy heifers. In this study, IMI with minor mastitis pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), contagious pathogens, and environmental major pathogens were identified. Fifty-four dairy farms were enrolled in the study. A questionnaire was used to collect herd level data on housing, management and welfare of young stock during farm visits and interviews with the farmers. Cow-level data such as breed, age at first calving, udder condition and swelling, and calving ease were also recorded. Data was also collected about young stock that spent a period of at least 3 months on an external <b>rearing</b> <b>farm</b> or on a seasonal alpine farm. At the quarter level, teat conditions such as teat lesions, teat dysfunction, presence of a papilloma and teat length were recorded. Within 24 h after parturition, samples of colostral milk from 1564 quarters (391 heifers) were collected aseptically for bacterial culture. Positive bacteriological culture results were found in 49 % of quarter samples. Potential risk factors for IMI were identified at the quarter, animal and herd level using multivariable and multilevel logistic regression analysis. At the herd level tie-stalls, and at cow-level the breed category “Brown cattle” were risk factors for IMI caused by contagious major pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). At the quarter-level, teat swelling and teat lesions were highly associated with IMI caused by environmental major pathogens. At the herd level heifer rearing at external farms was associated with less IMI caused by major environmental pathogens. Keeping pregnant heifers in a separate group was negatively associated with IMI caused by CNS. The odds of IMI with coagulase-negative staphylococci increased if weaning age was less than 4 months and if concentrates were fed to calves younger than 2 weeks. This study identified herd, cow- and quarter-level risk factors that may be important for IMI prevention in the future...|$|E

In {{order to}} better {{assess the impact of}} two {{environmental}} factors on milk production for corrective action, the effects of the <b>rearing</b> <b>farm</b> and grazing time on milk production of Borgou cows in Benin were studied. To this end, the experiment was conducted on a total of 167 Borgou cows including 27 cows; 56 cows and 84 cows respectively reared in Samiondji, Bétécoucou and Okpara Breeding farms. These three farms apply semi-improved breeding system. As part of the evaluation of grazing time, two lots of Borgou cows were formed in Okpara breeding farm. Cows of lot 1 (64 cows) grazed daily during six hours (10 am to 16 pm) and those of lot 2 (20 cows) during nine hours (9 am to 18 pm). Lactating cows were each beforehand identified by their numbers, the farm they belong to or their breeding lot. Milk collection was made once a week per cow. As a result, the average daily production (0. 9 ± 0. 2 l) of Samiondji Borgou cows was higher than those obtained respectively by Okpara cows (0. 8 ± 0. 1 l) and Betecoucou cows (0. 7 ± 0. 1 l), although the differences were not significant. However, significant differences (p< 0. 05) were observed between total milk production on 11 months of lactation for Samiondji cows (273 ± 47 l) followed by those of Okpara (246. 4 ± 24. 8 l) and Betecoucou (230. 4 ± 33. 1 l). The Borgou cows that grazed 9 hours a day produced significantly more milk (1 ± 0. 2 l) (p< 0. 05) than those grazing for six hours a day (0. 8 ± 0. 1 l). The same trend was recorded for the cumulative production of 11 months of lactation. Overall, considering the differences between rearing farms, Samiondji farm is more profitable followed by Okpara and Betecoucou farms. Similarly, the rearing of Borgou cows that have benefited from the long grazing time is more profitable.
