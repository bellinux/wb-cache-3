Nektonic utilization of the upper Houston Ship Channel (HSC) was assessed through characterization of species composition, abundance and community structure of finfish and macroinvertebrate populations. Impact of basic water quality trends on utilization was evaluated. seine, gillnet and <b>revolving</b> <b>screen</b> collections from two deep-water and six shoreline sampling stations in upper HSC stream segments 1006 (downstream) and 1007 (upstream) during May 1988 through July 1989 yielded 33, 042 nektonic organisms comprising 84 taxa. Spatial and temporal trends in catch statistics, species diversity, and hydrological variables were assessed for each sampling gear type. Seasonal composition by dominant taxa was determined and effect of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen on catch statistics examined. Mean surface (shoreline) water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were similar between segments and followed expected seasonal trends. Mean bottom dissolved oxygen levels in segment 1007 during May through September were consistently 1 to 1. 5 mg/l lower than segment 1006 and exhibited hypoxic conditions. Significantly greater catch and biomass were observed in segment 1007 as compared to those of segment 1006. Species diversity and number of taxa were comparable between segments. Distinct reductions in catch, number of taxa and species diversity characterized winter seine collections in segment 1006. Surface water temperatures appeared to exert the greatest hydrological influence on shoreline catch statistics. <b>Revolving</b> <b>screen</b> catches were greatest in Segment 1007 during November through March when bottom dissolved oxygen levels peaked and water temperatures ebbed. Significantly reduced catches in segment 1007 during May through October coincided with highest water temperatures and near-anoxic dissolved oxygen levels. By contrast, catch statistics from segment 1006 were highest during summer and early fall when mean bottom temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were highest and lowest, respectively. Cumulative number of taxa was highest in both segments during winter. HSC segment 1006 maintains healthy shoreline and bottom nekton communities year-round. Low dissolved oxygen in bottom waters restrict nekton utilization of segment 1007 during summer. Richness and abundance in segment 1007 during winter equaled or exceeded that of segment 1006...|$|E
50|$|The Great Extended Mill was {{developed}} {{in conjunction with the}} Great Extended Mine. A rich assay in 1885 influenced £11,500 expenditure on an elaborate treatment plant which was completed in 1888. It consisted of three 54 h.p. steam engines, six Jordan and Cummins patent jiggers, a Black and Marsden stone breaker, winding and pumping gear, six <b>revolving</b> <b>screens,</b> two Linkenbach round buddles, classifier, elevators, picking tables, grizzly and spitzcasten.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, The Gallery of Fine Art {{opened a}} new branch at the newly opened Changi Airport. It was claimed as the world's first art gallery {{to be found in}} an airport. The Gallery was unique as it had no walls, and the {{paintings}} were displayed on mobile <b>revolving</b> <b>screens.</b> She also held exhibitions on board the luxury cruise ship, The Princess Mahsuri (now known as Spirit of Adventure) in 1984. Della's reputation grew to be {{known as one of the}} first local art dealers who promoted Singapore art overseas, and to declare that Singapore art were on par with [...] "international standards".|$|R
5000|$|Probably Radok's most monumental {{project was}} the [...] "kinetic mosaic" [...] which he {{designed}} for the Universe of Energy pavilion at Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center theme park, which opened on October 1, 1982. Working with WED Enterprises (Walt Disney Imagineering), Radok created a pre-show film for the pavilion that was projected onto a 90-foot wide screen by five synchronized 35-mm projectors. The projection surface was composed of some 100 revolving prism-shaped modules arrayed in four horizontal rows, 25 modules in each row. Each module had two white projection surfaces and one matte black surface, each 3 ½ feet square. Each module revolved independently via its own interior servo-motor. Synchronized by computer, the modules could create one large flat screen, but were also programmed to revolve {{in a variety of}} displays, combining into patterns of triangular wedges, flat panels, and black panels, all of which was precisely coordinated with the changing film images. The rippling movement of the units gave a unique [...] "third dimension" [...] to the projection surface. The theater accommodated 500 spectators. Due to mechanical complications, the <b>revolving</b> <b>screens</b> were not operational until 1984, two years after the park's opening. The display, which required constant mechanical maintenance, was eventually replaced in 1996 with five conventional movie screens.|$|R
40|$|Direct-touch {{interaction}} on {{mobile phones}} <b>revolves</b> around <b>screens</b> that compete for visual attention with users ‟ realworld tasks and activities. This paper investigates {{the impact of}} these situational impairments on touch-screen interaction. We probe several design factors for touch-screen gestures, under various levels of environmental demands on attention, in comparison to the status-quo approach of soft buttons. We find that in the presence of environmental distractions, gestures can offer significant performance gains and reduced attentional load, while performing as well as soft buttons when the user‟s attention is focused on the phone. In fact, the speed and accuracy of bezel gestures {{did not appear to be}} significantly affected by environment, and some gestures could be articulated eyes-free, with one hand. Bezel-initiated gestures offered the fastest performance, and mark-based gestures were the most accurate. Bezel-initiated marks therefore may offer a promising approach for mobile touch-screen interaction that is less demanding of the user‟s attention...|$|R
50|$|In the past, when {{sandblasting}} {{was performed}} as an open-air job, the worker {{was exposed to}} risk of injury from the flying material and lung damage from inhaling the dust. The silica dust produced in the sandblasting process would cause silicosis after sustained inhalation of the dust. In 1918, the first sandblasting enclosure was built, which protected the worker with a viewing <b>screen,</b> <b>revolved</b> around the workpiece, and used an exhaust fan to draw dust away from the worker's face. Silicosis is still a risk when the operator is not completely isolated from the sandblasting apparatus.|$|R
50|$|As the buckets {{pass over}} the top tumbler they {{discharge}} into a hopper from where a chute directs the dredged material into a <b>revolving</b> (or trommel) <b>screen.</b> Here it is washed by high pressure water jets, the fine ore-bearing material passing through the perforations (normally about 10 mm in size) and proceeding to the treatment plant and the oversize material continuing over the screen. The undersize from the screen is passed to ore concentrating and recovery equipment, consisting at Nettle Creek {{of a series of}} pulsating jigs. The concentrate is removed for further treatment while the tailings are discharged down a sluice at the stern of the dredge.|$|R
50|$|The channel's {{original}} identity <b>revolved</b> {{around the}} <b>screen</b> split in half horizontally with two objects {{coming together to}} form one object. Examples of these idents include an ornament added {{on top of a}} flower and still retains that image, wine pouring into a glass, with the base of glass formed out of pouring paint from a tin and a boater hat forming the bowl for some strawberries and cream. These idents were accompanied by a logo consisting of 'UK' inside a box and the channel name 'Style' written after on a line in upper case. The channel also had a digital on-screen graphic (DOG) of the same logo.|$|R
5000|$|Nations with an {{official}} {{presence at the}} fair included Australia, Canada, West Germany, Iran, Japan, Taiwan, Republic of Korea, United States and the USSR. Architectural critics were intrigued by the Australian Pavilion with its 36 <b>screen</b> <b>revolving</b> audio visual platform and {{a model of the}} newly completed Sydney Opera House. (The artistic director for the project was film director Jonathan Dawson). However, writer Calvin Trillin tartly commented that the exhibits of several other countries seemed designed to demonstrate their nation's lack of environmental care. [...] "While other world's fairs had introduced the telephone, the escalator, and the Belgian waffle, Spokane's Expo '74 would be associated forever with the 'institutionalized mea culpa,'" [...] Trillin wrote in The New Yorker.|$|R
5000|$|On June 28, 2010, it was {{confirmed}} that the seventh season would be Steve Carell's last on the show, as his contract expires. NBC {{confirmed that the}} series would continue after his departure, and would welcome any return appearances by Carell. Actor and writer/co-executive producer B. J. Novak renewed his contract with Universal Media Studios through an eighth season and was promoted to full executive producer halfway through the seventh season. As of this season, Zach Woods, who plays Gabe Lewis on the show, has been promoted to a series regular. Executive producer/writer/actor Paul Lieberstein confirmed that Amy Ryan, who portrays Holly Flax, would appear in eight episodes of the season. He also confirmed Kathy Bates would return as Jo Bennett in the season premiere. Melora Hardin returns as Jan Levinson. Timothy Olyphant guest starred in two episodes as rival salesman, Danny Cordray, who previously went on two dates with Pam. Jack Coleman appears in a new recurring role as Senator Robert Lipton, who is dating Angela. Amy Ryan made her first return appearance as Holly in a voice-only role in [...] "Sex Ed", and finally returned to Dunder Mifflin in the hour-long Christmas episode; and she is now billed among the rest of the starring cast. The episode titled [...] "Threat Level Midnight", which aired February 17, 2011, <b>revolved</b> around the <b>screening</b> of Michael's film where all the office employees portray the characters in the film. The episode featured Melora Hardin as Jan, and the return of Rashida Jones as Karen and David Denman as Roy. During NBC's TCA press tour, it {{was confirmed}} that Steve Carell would depart with three episodes left to go in the season, with the remaining episodes focusing on the search for (and selection of) his replacement as office manager. Executive producer Greg Daniels, who wrote Carell's farewell, stated the top candidates are Andy, Dwight, and Darryl, or possibly a newcomer. He also stated that whoever becomes the new manager would not become the main focus of the show like Michael was, and that two new regular cast members would join the cast during the eighth season. Ricky Gervais reprised his role as David Brent from the original British series in a cameo appearance in the episode [...] "The Seminar" [...] that aired January 27, 2011. Will Ferrell appeared in four episodes as Deangelo Vickers, Michael Scott's temporary replacement. Ferrell's character proved to be just as inept as Michael when it came to managing a business. Steve Carell finished filming his final scenes for the show on March 4, 2011. Ricky Gervais returned as David Brent in the season finale, along with Will Arnett who played a new character. Gervais also contributed to the script for the season finale. Ray Romano, James Spader, Catherine Tate, Warren Buffett and Jim Carrey also appeared in the season finale.|$|R
