5|$|Among Alaska Natives, the <b>Rampart</b> Dam project {{encouraged}} {{organization and}} the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose <b>Rampart</b> Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline. Only after Native land claims were recognized in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act did the pipeline progress.|$|E

5000|$|The {{composition}} {{and design of}} <b>ramparts</b> varied from the simple mounds of earth and stone, known as dump <b>ramparts,</b> to more complex earth and timber defences (box <b>ramparts</b> and timberlaced <b>ramparts),</b> as well as <b>ramparts</b> with stone revetments. One particular type, common in Central Europe, used earth, stone and timber posts to form a Pfostenschlitzmauer or [...] "post-slot wall". Vitrified <b>ramparts</b> were composed of stone that was subsequently fired, possibly to increase its strength.|$|R

5|$|The caponier (rifle gallery) extends {{into the}} ditch between the <b>rampart</b> and glacis from the fort's north west corner. It is {{connected}} to the fort via a tunnel, running under the <b>rampart</b> from the manning parade. For blast protection and defensibility the tunnel was built with a dogleg. The caponier has rifle firing ports and was originally protected from direct artillery fire by the glacis. Early plans showed the caponier extending from the fort's south west, and a tunnel linking the magazine and southern guns.|$|E

25|$|Since Roman times <b>ramparts</b> have {{surrounded}} the Plateau of Angoulême. Repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt their reconstruction was finally {{stopped in the}} 19th century. The <b>Ramparts</b> are classified as historical monuments and the <b>Ramparts</b> Tour {{is one of the}} main attractions of the city.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>ramparts</b> are now historical relics {{from the}} battle. There are about 4,200 kilometers of <b>ramparts</b> from the New Qinhuai River of Tiexin bridge to Jiangjun Mountain and Niushou Mountain. The {{condition of the}} <b>ramparts</b> are especially well preserved on Jiangjun Mountain.|$|R
50|$|The fort {{was built}} with earthen <b>ramparts</b> {{reinforced}} with horizontal freize pickets. The <b>ramparts</b> were surrounded on the east, west and south facades by a dry ditch with a vertical palisade fence and a glacis. A masonry gate {{on the north}} facade of the fort was the only entryway. Inside the fort, timber buildings were constructed and designed to be concealed behind the <b>ramparts.</b> Casemates were tunnelled into {{the inside of the}} <b>ramparts</b> and these were used for storage.|$|R

5|$|The Canadian {{government}} also strongly opposed the <b>Rampart</b> Dam project. According to the Treaty of Washington, signed in 1871, Canada was allowed free navigation of the Yukon River. It was feared that {{construction of the}} dam would block navigation routes and violate the treaty.|$|E
5|$|The {{centre of}} Aarhus {{was once a}} pagan burial site until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it {{during the reign of}} Frode, King of Jutland, around 900. In the 900s an earth <b>rampart</b> for the defence of the early city was constructed, {{encircling}} the settlement, much like the defence structures found at Viking ring fortresses elsewhere. The <b>rampart</b> was later reinforced by Harald Bluetooth, and together with the town's geographical placement, this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre. There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in Viby, a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre.|$|E
50|$|In 1867 the {{fortress}} was abolished {{and the town}} expanded beyond the <b>ramparts.</b> Much of the town's southern <b>ramparts</b> were destroyed in this process and converted into residential areas. The western {{and much of the}} northern <b>ramparts</b> still exist and form the scene of an annual theatre known as Nyborg Voldspil, which is Denmark's oldest outdoor theater.|$|R
50|$|This early Iron Age hillfort, {{taken over}} by the Romans when they invaded, has double and triple <b>ramparts.</b> The {{parallel}} double <b>ramparts</b> on the east and west flanks are connected along the northern border and are unmistakably visible. Because the cliff face acted as defence, it is probable that there were never <b>ramparts</b> along the southern end.|$|R
25|$|In 1581 Christopher Valkendorf {{supervised}} the largest {{expansion of the}} <b>ramparts</b> {{in the history of}} the city, as with the invention of cannons vastly extended earth <b>ramparts</b> were required.|$|R
5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the <b>Rampart</b> Dam project illustrated the growing {{shift in the}} environmental movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving {{the natural beauty of}} a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to <b>Rampart</b> was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While the sleeves of musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the <b>rampart,</b> Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the <b>rampart,</b> starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the <b>rampart,</b> crossed the moat and also started to come inside Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E
5|$|About {{eight miles}} from Brechin, at Karboddo , a place {{belongs to the}} Earl of Crawford, are to be seen the vestiges of a Danish camp, {{fortified}} with a <b>rampart</b> and ditch, and vulgarly called Norway Dikes; near which is the village of Panbridge , where anciently was a church dedicated to St Brigide, because on that saint's day which preceded the battle, Camus, general of the Danes, pitched his camp there.|$|E
50|$|In 1934 {{the remains}} of the <b>ramparts</b> were exposed by the Reich Labour Service. The {{foundations}} of the <b>ramparts</b> and {{the remains of}} the round bergfried were restored in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|Few {{remains of}} the fort and its <b>ramparts</b> remain to this day. Three parts of the <b>ramparts</b> remain. This {{includes}} the Delft Gate, located within the Commercial House along Bristol Street. A building {{dating back to the}} fort which had been used as a warehouse and a magazine currently houses the Colombo Maritime Museum. Within the grounds of the Colombo port a section of the <b>ramparts</b> remain.|$|R
50|$|The 16th-century <b>ramparts,</b> {{which have}} been an Historic Monument since 1925. With the {{separate}} tower in the Town Hall gardens and the Renaissance door, the <b>ramparts</b> make up {{the remainder of the}} old castle.|$|R
5|$|Appeals {{from the}} local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen <b>rampart</b> and towers to protect the settlement. The site of these early defences is not known but may have been near where St Catherine's Church now stands. A ditch of unknown date in that {{vicinity}} may represent a fragment of the medieval defences.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the Early Dynastic period III (earlier than 2500 BC), Mari was rebuilt and populated again. The new city kept many of the first city exterior features, including the internal <b>rampart</b> and gate. Also kept was the outer circular embankment measuring 1.9km in diameter, which was topped by a wall that is two meters thick, which is suitable for the protection of archers.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This {{consisted}} of a <b>rampart,</b> ditch, and possibly a tower, {{in front of the}} gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defence but also to dictate the only approach to the gate.|$|E
5000|$|Ditches in front, {{between and}} behind the <b>ramparts,</b> which were {{sometimes}} filled with water, depending on the location e.g. in a valley. As a rule, the <b>ramparts</b> were made from the excavation of the ditches.|$|R
50|$|The plague indeed missed Warsaw and the <b>ramparts</b> {{became the}} {{boundary}} {{of the city of}} Warsaw for the next century. The line was also used for tax purposes, as all goods entering the city were taxed. In 1794 the <b>ramparts</b> were partially strengthened to include military keeps and played some role in the defence of Warsaw against a joint Russian and Prussian siege of the city in the summer of that year. Around 1825 the president of Warsaw ordered the <b>ramparts</b> to be levelled and replaced with city streets. Their previous location still defined the city limits though. The line of former Lubomirski <b>Ramparts</b> also defined the inner line of the city's defences during the 1831 Battle of Warsaw. It was only in 1916 when areas outside of the Lubomirski <b>Ramparts</b> were incorporated into the city.|$|R
50|$|Milefortlet 21 was a long-axis milefortlet, {{constructed}} with 6 m wide turf <b>ramparts</b> and timber gates. The <b>ramparts</b> were constructed from turf facings revetting a sand core, giving internal dimensions of 14.5 m by 18 m.|$|R
5|$|Higher (av. 9m) and thicker (av. 3m) walls. Walls {{were made}} of stone or stone facing with rubble core. The greater {{thickness}} would protect the wall from enemy mining. The height of the walls would force attackers to use scaling-ladders. The parapet of the <b>rampart</b> would have crenellations to provide protection from missiles for defenders.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{considered}} {{building a}} bridge across <b>Rampart</b> Gorge {{as part of}} a project to extend the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to Nome to facilitate Lend-Lease shipments to the Soviet Union during World War II. The war ended before the project got beyond the planning stages, and the bridge idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle {{expanded}} westwards, and {{the ditch}} {{was extended to}} enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley. A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing <b>rampart</b> was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On {{the south of the}} fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth <b>rampart</b> did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.|$|E

50|$|The area of Christiania {{consists}} of the former military barracks of Bådsmandsstræde {{and parts of the}} city <b>ramparts.</b> The <b>ramparts</b> and the borough of Christianshavn (then a separate city) were established in 1617 by King Christian IV by reclaiming the low beaches and islets between Copenhagen and Amager. After the siege of Copenhagen during wars with Sweden, the <b>ramparts</b> were reinforced during 1682 to 1692 under Christian V to form a complete defence ring. The western <b>ramparts</b> of Copenhagen were demolished during the 19th century, but those of Christianshavn were allowed to remain. They are today considered among the finest surviving 17th century defence works in the world.|$|R
50|$|Sri Ksetra is a {{large city}} site with ruins of many structures, palaces and stūpas. The most {{prominent}} feature {{of the city is}} the circular plan, marked by a semi-circle of <b>ramparts</b> on the north, south and western sides. Outside the <b>ramparts</b> there was a moat, marked by a succession of tanks in the dry season. At several points in the <b>ramparts,</b> there are prominent gates, and around these gates are shrines and important remains.|$|R
