40|$|Given the {{importance}} of <b>reading</b> motivation for <b>reading</b> frequency and academic <b>reading</b> performance, an in-depth understanding of <b>reading</b> motivation is essential to keep children motivated {{and encourage them to}} <b>read.</b> The first aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a questionnaire to measure recreational and academic <b>reading</b> motivation (SRQ-Reading Motivation), based on self-determination theory, and to explore fifth graders’ reasons for <b>reading.</b> Second, to deepen our understanding of <b>reading</b> motivation, we studied the relationship between <b>reading</b> motivation, <b>reading</b> engagement, <b>reading</b> frequency, and <b>reading</b> comprehension. 1260 fifth graders completed the SRQ-Reading Motivation, 8 subscales of the Motivation for Reading Questionnaire (MRQ), a standardized <b>reading</b> comprehension test, and a subscale concerning leisure-time <b>reading</b> frequency and <b>reading</b> self-concept. Teachers rated their students’ <b>reading</b> engagement. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicate that recreational and academic <b>reading</b> motivation comprise two factors: autonomous and controlled <b>reading</b> motivation, each with a high internal consistency. Comparisons with the MRQ and the teacher rating of students’ <b>reading</b> engagement point to the construct validity of the instrument. Participants mainly report autonomous <b>reading</b> motivation in the recreational and academic context. Not surprisingly, controlled <b>reading</b> motivation is a bit stronger in the academic setting. Both contextual models, designed to clarify the relationship between <b>reading</b> motivation and several <b>reading</b> outcomes, have a good fit and support the predictive utility of our instrument. As expected, autonomous <b>reading</b> motivation, relative to controlled <b>reading</b> motivation, is associated with more positive outcomes (i. e. more <b>reading</b> engagement, higher leisure-time <b>reading</b> frequency, more <b>reading</b> comprehension) ...|$|R

In PIRLS 2006, Hong Kong Grade 4 students ranked second among the 46 participating states and countries. The study examined the relative role of gender, <b>reading</b> ability, and independent <b>reading,</b> as well as family and school influences in explaining students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes associated with <b>reading</b> attainment. Research question First, whether gender effect is found in students’ attitudes toward <b>reading?</b> Second, do <b>reading</b> ability and independent <b>reading</b> explain variance in students’ individual <b>reading</b> attitudes? Third, are home educational resources and parents’ <b>reading</b> attitudes associated with students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes? Lastly, to what extent, are instructional practices and school mean <b>reading</b> achievement related to students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes, either at school level or individual level? Method Each student completed a 90 -minute test booklet and an around- 20 -minute questionnaire. Students’ teachers, school principals and parents {{were also asked to}} fill out questionnaires. Data analyzed here was taken from the Hong Kong data in PIRLS 2006. It was collected in 2006 from 144 Hong Kong local schools, comprising a representative sample of 4712 primary fourth-grade students. Relationship between <b>reading</b> attitude and individual (i. e., gender, <b>reading</b> ability, and independent <b>reading),</b> family (i. e., parents’ <b>reading</b> attitudes and home educational resources), and school (i. e., teaching <b>reading</b> skills and school mean <b>reading</b> achievement) factors were modelled with multilevel analysis. Results Results show that gender, <b>reading</b> ability, independent <b>reading,</b> parents’ <b>reading</b> attitudes, and home educational resources made significant contribution to <b>reading</b> attitude. Moreover, teaching <b>reading</b> skills and school mean <b>reading</b> achievement were positively related to students’ <b>reading</b> attitudes. Discussion Male students’ less positive <b>reading</b> attitudes suggest that boys may be more beneficiary to intervention programs on <b>reading</b> attitudes. Thus teachers and parents should pay special attention to boys when considering methods or programs to accelerate <b>reading</b> achievement. In addition, the strong positive relation between in-school independent <b>reading</b> and <b>reading</b> attitude suggests that <b>reading</b> instruction should encourage more independent <b>reading</b> in class. Based on previous research and the present findings, school administrators and <b>reading</b> educators should give a high priority to independent <b>reading</b> when scheduling time for <b>reading</b> instruction. In order to facilitate students’ independent <b>reading,</b> it may be also important for teachers to teach explicitly skills and strategies in relation to <b>reading</b> comprehension. In fact, teaching <b>reading</b> skills and strategies will improve individual students’ <b>reading</b> ability and enlarge peer influence in a school...|$|R

More important, insights gained through examinations of oral <b>reading</b> tend to be generalized to silent <b>reading.</b> In the current study, we examined whether such generalizations are justified.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine how late primary school students’ {{autonomous}} and controlled <b>reading</b> motivation contributes to their <b>reading</b> behaviour (i. e., <b>reading</b> frequency and engagement) and performance (i. e., comprehension) in a longitudinal study, since prior research was particularly cross-sectional and thus unable to test for the directions of effects. In addition, <b>reading</b> behaviour was examined as a mediator between <b>reading</b> motivation and comprehension, given that <b>reading</b> frequency and engagement have received mixed evidence as mediators in prior study. To pursue this aim, a longitudinal study (i. e., three measurement occasions) was set up. Participants included 458 fifth-grade primary school students (i. e., on average 10. 5 years old). Path analyses indicated that recreational and academic autonomous <b>reading</b> motivation predicted higher leisure-time <b>reading</b> frequency and better <b>reading</b> comprehension as compared to controlled <b>reading</b> motivation. Interestingly, recreational and academic controlled <b>reading</b> motivation did not affect <b>reading</b> engagement and even yielded a significantly negative association with <b>reading</b> comprehension. This underlines the significance of distinguishing qualitatively different types of <b>reading</b> motivation (i. e., autonomous and controlled <b>reading</b> motivation). As for the mediation of the relationship between <b>reading</b> motivation and comprehension through <b>reading</b> behaviour, no evidence was found for <b>reading</b> frequency as a mediator between <b>reading</b> motivation and comprehension. In contrast, <b>reading</b> engagement mediated the relationship between recreational autonomous <b>reading</b> motivation and <b>reading</b> comprehension.
