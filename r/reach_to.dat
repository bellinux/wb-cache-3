5|$|The cloudy {{outer edge}} of the eye is called the “eyewall”. The eyewall {{typically}} expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect. The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds <b>reach</b> <b>to</b> their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.|$|E
5|$|After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and {{contained}} little deep and persistent convection; with dry air infringing {{on the western}} edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely. Despite being sheared, the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non-tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents, and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper-level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September12. After a jog to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection. Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough. Hanna then strengthened sharply to <b>reach</b> <b>to</b> its peak intensity of 60miles per hour (100km/h) at 0000UTC on September14.|$|E

The Master Chief and these soldiers capture the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice, and return to <b>Reach</b> <b>to</b> save any UNSC survivors on the planet.

The Chief retrieves Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, the creative genius behind the SPARTAN-II Project, and his fellow soldiers. The Spartans then attack a massive Covenant command station, the Unyielding Hierophant, thus delaying a Covenant assault on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not {{to discriminate}} between European and Third World refugees helped prepare the UNHCR {{for a change in}} the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's <b>reach</b> <b>to</b> refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. The {{last line of}} defense for the planet is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface of <b>Reach</b> <b>to</b> protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.|$|E
5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter {{about the size of a}} bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could <b>reach</b> <b>to</b> a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Vocal cord nodule {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} disorders of laryngeal mucosa which is commonly caused by the overuse of laryngeal vocal function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of speech therapy on laryngeal stroboscopic features of patients with vocal cord nodules. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, five women with vocal cord nodules aged between 14 and 45 years participated in a speech therapy program. Their laryngeal stroboscopic features were assessed in the first and ninth sessions of therapy. Results: After speech therapy, glottal closure in 3 subjects <b>reached</b> <b>to</b> complete closure or near to it. Symmetry of phases in 3 cases <b>reached</b> <b>to</b> symmetrical condition and periodicity of phases in 1 patient <b>reached</b> <b>to</b> periodical state. After speech therapy, right mucosal wave in 4 subjects <b>reached</b> <b>to</b> normal condition.   The left mucosal wave in 1 subject <b>reached</b> <b>to</b> normal and in 1 patient approached to normal form. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that speech therapy has a gradual influence on treatment of vocal cord nodule which can be evaluated by subjective methods such as therapist's assessment of patient's voice or objective methods such as stroboscopy. ...|$|R
