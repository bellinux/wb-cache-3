5|$|After {{working through}} their post launch checklists, the crew opened the payload bay doors, {{deployed}} the Ku band antenna, {{and moved into}} the robotic activities portion of the day, which included {{a survey of the}} payload bay and crew cabin survey with the orbiter's <b>robotic</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the morning}} wake up call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on inspection of the orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
50|$|Kier {{along with}} a group of {{engineers}} and biologists have collaborated to develop <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> that are able to manipulate and handle various objects of different size, mass, surface texture and mechanical properties. These <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> have many advantages over previous <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> that were not based on muscular hydrostats.|$|R
50|$|In {{the decade}} of 2010 the {{availability}} of low-cost <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> increased substantially.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{difference}} between the human behaviours for fault tolerance with a pseudo inverse reconfiguration approach for fault tolerance of <b>robotic</b> <b>arms.</b> If this difference is well understood then {{it can be used to}} introduce a hybrid approach for fault tolerant motion of <b>robotic</b> <b>arms.</b> The proposed approach is expected to combine human fault-tolerance dexterity and advantages of a model based fault tolerance. The main aim is to add human dexterity for fault tolerance of <b>robotic</b> <b>arms...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to module-specific equipment, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda were each equipped with one Lyappa arm, a <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> which, after the module had docked {{to the core}} module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's docking node. The arriving module's docking probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module {{so that it could}} be pivoted 90° for docking to one of the four radial docking ports.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the <b>robotic</b> <b>arm,</b> McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a <b>robotic</b> <b>arm,</b> a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E

5|$|Kelly and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin {{used the}} Shuttle's <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> {{to lift the}} Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station's Unity node. The crews began {{unloading}} supplies the same day. Mission managers extended Endeavour's flight duration to 12 days to allow the crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor {{in one of the}} air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module. A change of command ceremony took place on December 13 as Expedition 3 ended and Expedition 4 began. STS-108 returned to Earth with the previous ISS crew of three men.|$|E

5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA <b>robotic</b> <b>arm</b> technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E

30|$|Space <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> play an {{increasingly}} important role in on-orbit serving missions [2, 3]. Many <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> adopted full-driven mechanism have been developed and used in space capture [4]. Typical operational targets on orbit are cooperative {{in the sense that}} they allow friendly communication for synchronization manipulation, as well as dedicated grappling fixtures and artificial markers to support docking [4]. The capture process of cooperative spacecraft is almost static or quasi-static in low earth orbits, such as the famous CX-OLEV mission [5] and SMART-OLEV spacecraft [6]. Nowadays, the <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> with full driven have been widely applied to the tasks in space, such as docking, berthing, refueling, repairing and upgrading [7 – 9]. However, the structures of those full driven space arms are relatively complex, heavy, and driven by more motors. And the conventional full-driven <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> need complex sensor systems. The control systems are relatively complex for griping different shape objectives [10].|$|R

30|$|Robots {{have been}} {{introduced}} to the operating theater in recent decades; the daVinci surgical system is a well-known example. The daVinci system is a multipurpose surgical robotic system designed for laparoscopic surgeries. Four <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> {{are included in the}} system for manipulating a laparoscope and other surgical tools during surgery. Though tele-surgery is allowed with the daVinci system, the primary surgeon who operates the robot is away distant from the patient’s bedside [6] due to its large footprint. Furthermore, as the <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> are designed for laparoscopic surgeries, the <b>robotic</b> <b>arms</b> are generally setup to operate above the patient’s abdomen; thus, when performing laparoscopic hysterectomy, an assistant is still required to position the patient’s uterus {{from the end of the}} operating table.|$|R
