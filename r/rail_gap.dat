50|$|In 1870, the Scinde, Punjab & Delhi Railway {{was formed}} from the {{incorporation}} of the Scinde Railway, Indus Steam Flotilla, Punjab Railway and Delhi Railway companies {{in order to increase}} efficiency of passenger and cargo transport between Sindh and Punjab. However, the <b>rail</b> <b>gap</b> between Kotri and Multan was considered a hassle as the Indus River and Sutlej River were major obstacles to cross at the time. In 1871, the Indus Valley State Railway was inaugurated and construction began on extending the railway line from Multan south towards Bahawalpur (crossing the Sutlej River) and on wards to Rohri. In 1876, the Punjab Northern State Railway was constructed between Lahore and Peshawar and in 1883 the Attock Bridge over the Indus River was opened. In 1878, the Empress Bridge over the Sutlej River was opened and in 1879 the Indus Valley State Railway reached Rohri. From Rohri, a steam ferry would transport eight rail carriages at a time across the Indus between Rohri and Sukkur. This was found to be cumbersome and time-consuming. In 1889, the Lansdowne Bridge between Rohri and Sukkar was opened and in 1893, work on the Kotri Bridge commenced. It was only in 1900 that the section between Rohri and Kotri was completed. In 1885, all the companies were merged together to form the North Western State Railway.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{acoustic}} postprocessor for multibody simulations is presented. The tool computes the sound {{power on the}} surface of a generic vibrating flexible body. The radiated sound power is not computed because this would require the knowledge of the radiation efficiency. Such parameter can be determined by an ulterior analysis including the fluid/structure interface, to be performed by an appropriate Finite Element or Boundary Element analysis. The sound power computed by the presented tool can be directly used for the relative acoustic assessment of mechanical parts with respect to design variations or modified boundary conditions. Moreover, the computed sound power directly leads to an estimate of the radiated power – and thus eventually of the noise level – if the radiation efficiency can be deduced from experience or empiric formulas, which is the case of most engineering problems. As an application example, the acoustic behavior of a railway wheelset is studied. The wheelset is modeled as a flexible body and integrated in the multibody model of a complete vehicle. Two operative cases have been considered: first, the vehicle driving through a switch, with the resulting impulsive noise due to the wheel rolling over the <b>rail</b> <b>gap</b> {{in the middle of the}} switch (“frog”); secondly, the rolling noise due to wheel and rail roughness – a dramatic problem especially for freight vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Research {{activity}} currently {{sponsored by}} the Association of American Railroads and carried out by Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI) in conjunction with Kandrew, Inc. Consulting Services has focused on improving the performance of continuous welded rail (CWR) track through enhanced rail neutral temperature (RNT) maintenance practices. One issue being investigated {{is the process of}} restoring RNT that has been lowered when the rail is cut or broken at temperatures below the rail’s existing RNT. Readjustment of the RNT is accomplished by restoring the tension that was lost when the rail broke or was cut. This loss of tension is evident by the <b>rail</b> <b>gap</b> that is created at the break/cut location and it influences the rail over some distance each side of the gap. Ideally, the rail in this influence zone will be unfastened and the RNT brought back to a desired condition during the readjustment process. However, influence zone lengths can be long, requiring substantial time and resources for unfastening and RNT readjustment. This paper presents an approach where RNT readjustment lengths can be reduced without compromising the safety of CWR track. This optimized readjustment length is based on allowing a pocket of decreased RNT to remain in the influence zone that is compensated for by overstressing at the location where the rail broke or was cut. It is expected that this uneven readjusted RNT profile will be equalized by subsequent train traffic. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Basic {{operational}} {{characteristics of the}} plasma focus are considered from design perspectives to develop powerful radiation sources. Using these ideas we have developed two compact plasma focus (CPF) devices operating in neon with high performance and high repetition rate capacity for use as an intense soft X-ray (SXR) source for microelectronics lithography. The NX 1 is a four-module system with a peak current of 320 kA when the capacitor bank (7. 8 F 4) is charged to 14 kV. It produces 100 J of SXR per shot (4 % wall plug efficiency) giving at 3 Hz, 300 W of average SXR power into 4. The NX 2 is also a four-module system. Each module uses a <b>rail</b> <b>gap</b> switching 12 capacitors each with a capacity of 0. 6 F. The NX 2 operates with peak currents of 400 kA at 11. 5 kV into water-cooled electrodes at repetition rates up to 16 Hz to produce 300 W SXR in burst durations of several minutes. SXR lithographs are taken from both machines to demonstrate that sufficient SXR flux is generated for an exposure with only 300 shots. In addition, flash electron lithographs are also obtained requiring only ten shots per exposure. Such high performance compact machines may be improved to yield over 1 kW of SXR, enabling sufficient exposure throughput to {{be of interest to}} the wafer industry.

40|$|Insulated {{rail joints}} (IRJs) are a primary {{component}} of the rail track safety and signalling systems. Rails are supported by two fishplates which are fastened by bolts and nuts and, {{with the support of}} sleepers and track ballast, form an integrated assembly. IRJ failure can result from progressive defects, the propagation of which is influenced by residual stresses in the rail. Residual stresses change significantly during service due to the complex deformation and damage effects associated with wheel rolling, sliding and impact. IRJ failures can occur when metal flows over the insulated <b>rail</b> <b>gap</b> (typically 6 - 8 mm width), breaks the electrically isolated section of track and results in malfunction of the track signalling system. In this investigation, residual stress measurements were obtained from rail-ends which had undergone controlled amounts of surface plastic deformation using a full scale wheel-on-track simulation test rig. Results were compared with those obtained from similar investigations performed on rail ends associated with ex-service IRJs. Residual stresses were measured by neutron diffraction at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). Measurements with constant gauge volume 3 x 3 x 3 mm 3 were carried in the central vertical plane on 5 mm thick sliced rail samples cut by an electric discharge machine (EDM). Stress evolution at the rail ends was found to exhibit characteristics {{similar to those of the}} ex-service rails, with a compressive zone of 5 mm deep that is counterbalanced by a tension zone beneath, extending to a depth of around 15 mm. However, in contrast to the ex-service rails, the type of stress distribution in the test-rig deformed samples was apparently different due to the localization of load under the particular test conditions. In the latter, in contrast with clear stress evolution, there was no obvious evolution of d 0. Since d 0 reflects rather long-term accumulation of crystal lattice damage and microstructural changes due to service load, the loading history of the test rig samples has not reached the same level as the ex-service rails. It is concluded that the wheel-on-rail simulation rig provides the potential capability for testing the wheel-rail rolling contact conditions in rails, rail ends and insulated rail joints. ...|$|E
40|$|Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{experience}} a much shorter fatigue life than continuous rail sections, especially IRJs located in heavy haul rail corridors. IRJs {{are one of}} the most critical components of the rail system since their failure can lead to multiple catastrophic consequences, including; malfunctioning of the track signalling system due to metal contact across the insulating <b>rail</b> <b>gap</b> and, in cases where joints are damaged at the fishplate or rail bolt holes, derailment of railway vehicles. A literature review on the topic revealed that these joints suffer from a wide range of damage, predominately resulting from either the gradual accumulation of metal under plastic flow across the railhead in the vicinity of the rail end post, or rail end spalling and/or rail end post insulation damage. Other failure modes relate to problems with fishplates/joint bar and rail bolt holes. These include: fishplate cracking, delamination of fishplates, bolt looseness and bolt hole cracking. Therefore, IRJs are regarded as high-risk component and are maintained via expensive maintenance programs requiring high standards. Every year rail operators around Australia and the world install tens of thousands of rail joints, due to their early failure, or the risk of failure of either the signalling system and/or the structural track integrity. For the Australian heavy haul rail industry, the economic costs of IRJ maintenance are very high. In this study, approaches to both advanced characterisation of IRJ damage and to improving IRJs service lifetimes were investigated. Damage accumulation in the vicinity of the joint was characterised by advanced metallographic (optical microscopy, SEM and TEM) and neutron diffraction techniques. In the early stage of the project, surface hard facing was selected as a potential approach to improving IRJ lifetimes, and surface clad rail samples were produced and studied via simulation testing and testing of ex-service rails. The initial hard facing experiments involved comparison of the performance of ex-service laser clad IRJ samples (431 stainless steel cladding produced by Jarvie Engineering Private Limited) with that of uncoated IRJ samples manufactured from normal head hardened 60 kg grade rail. The results indicated IRJ lifetimes can be improved by a hard facing of rail ends. Follow-up investigations were performed using both robots TIG MMAW hard facing deposition approach, and experimentation with a choice of cladding metal and geometry of the hard-face rail surface. Experimentation included advanced metallography and electron microscopy, and limited wear testing of cladding materials. Full-scale wheel on track rig testing was also performed on both coated and uncoated samples, which involves cyclic rolling contact loading on railhead surface was the main objective to investigate the railhead damage. It was concluded that ferritic type commercial hard facing alloys, and maraging steels, appear good candidate materials for hard facing by weld deposition in the vicinity of IRJs. They also appear more suitable than the initial 431 stainless steel used in the laser cladding experiments as deleterious effects of thermal contraction during cooling are less in the ferritic alloys. It was also concluded and that geometry of the hard facing profile should include a steep angle of hard facing with the rail surface where it intersects the top surface of the rail head. Neutron diffraction analysis of ex-service IRJs revealed significant stress evolution in the vicinity of the top surfaces of the rail ends abutting the insulating gap. This distribution is characterised by a compressive layer of approximately 5 mm deep and a counterbalanced tensile layer located 5 - 15 mm at the sub-surface region. It exceeded the distribution along the continuous rail. Residual stresses analysis for the laboratory rig tested rail ends revealed similar characteristic to those found in ex-service rail ends. However, in contrast to the ex-service rail ends, the stress distributions in the test rig samples were slightly different and this difference was attributed to the localization of wheel load under the particular test conditions. A separate neutron diffraction examination of residual stresses near bolt-holes across ex-service IRJ fishplates revealed a stress evolution characterised by both compressive and tensile stresses, extended in a 900 and 450 angles to the longitudinal plane. The later results were consistent with a common observation of fishplate fracture originating at bolt holes at 450 to the running rail surface...|$|E

50|$|The {{point where}} two {{straight}} but intersecting railroads cross {{is called a}} frog. A groove through each rail allows the wheel flanges {{to pass through the}} intersecting rails.

But when the expansion joint is set in front of the turnout, the pier’s longitudinal force of continuous beam bridge and the simply supported beam bridge (within the expansion range of the device) increase greatly. When the device is close to the turnout, longitudinal relative displacement of the stock rail to the girder also increases a lot. By comparison, it is more favorable to set the expansion joint behind the turnout, or to set the device at the both ends of the continuous beam, or to set the device at the ends of continuous beam rather than in the center of the span...|$|R
