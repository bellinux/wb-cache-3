40|$|User {{authentication}} is {{an important}} security mechanism for recognizing legal roaming users. The emerging global mobility network, however, has called for new requirements for designing authentication schemes due to its dynamic nature and vulnerable-to-attack structure, which the traditional schemes overlooked, such as user anonymity. In this paper, we propose an efficient wireless authentication protocol with user anonymity for <b>roaming</b> <b>service.</b> We also introduce a formal security model suitable for <b>roaming</b> <b>service</b> in global mobility networks and show that the proposed protocol is provable secure based on this model. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this paper offers the first formal study of anonymous authentication scheme for <b>roaming</b> <b>service</b> in global mobility networks. In addition, we point out some practical attacks on Chang et al. s authentication scheme with user anonymity for roaming environments. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In global {{mobility}} networks, anonymous {{user authentication}} {{is an essential}} task for enabling <b>roaming</b> <b>service.</b> In a recent paper, Jiang et al. proposed a smart card based anonymous user authentication scheme for <b>roaming</b> <b>service</b> in global mobility networks. This scheme can protect user privacy and {{is believed to have}} many abilities to resist a range of network attacks, even if the secret information stored in the smart card is compromised. In this paper, we analyze the security of Jiang et al. 2 ̆ 7 s scheme, and show that the scheme is in fact insecure against the stolen-verifier attack and replay attack. Then, we also propose a new smart card based anonymous user authentication scheme for <b>roaming</b> <b>service.</b> Compared with the existing schemes, our protocol uses a different user authentication mechanism, which does not require the home agent to share a static secret key with the foreign agent, and hence, it is more practical and realistic. We show that our proposed scheme can provide stronger security than previous protocols...|$|R
