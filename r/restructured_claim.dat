40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of Chapter 11 {{proceedings}} in eliciting information through delibera-tion, proposal making and voting, and thereby in incorporating aggregated information correctly into reorganization decisions. Our model involves asymmetrically informed claim holders with embedded conflict of interests. Without any proposal design, i. e., without any <b>claim</b> <b>restructuring,</b> there are three sources of inefficiency. First, claim holders may not have incentives to reveal their private information during deliberation prior to the voting stage. Second, the proposing claim holder {{may not be able}} to cred-ibly signal his private information. Third, some claim holders may block a total value maximizing proposal due to their conflicting interests. We argue that proposal design can mitigate these problems and achieve the efficient outcome by giving the correct incentives through <b>claim</b> <b>restructuring.</b> Consequently, we argue that Chapter 11 pro-ceedings are efficient in aggregating dispersed information. We show that the first best outcome can be achieved by <b>restructuring</b> <b>claims</b> in a way such that creditors who hold senior securities ex-ante remain relatively senior in the restructured firm. Finally, we provide empirical support for this argument...|$|R

The study {{analyses}} {{the incentives}} and mechanisms of failing firms on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that <b>restructure</b> their <b>claims</b> following {{a decline in}} performance and value. The study also analyses patterns for restructuring of failing firms. The sample contains firms that were delisted between 1986 and 1996. Firms that were delisted and re-instated number 28 and constitute the sample for firms that <b>restructured</b> successfully their <b>claims.</b> Firms that were delisted on the JSE following an unsuccessful debt restructuring number 32 and constitute the sample for unsuccessful firms. The study finds that firms that restructured successfully on the JSE have more intangible assets, less bank debt and few creditors. This finding means that South African corporate restructuring activities relies more on assets characteristics rather than financial characteristics...|$|R

As a result of this restructuring, its profitable iron and steel trading operation merged into C. Itoh & Co. in 1977. Sumitomo lost nearly $1 billion in the Ataka <b>restructuring,</b> but <b>claimed</b> that a complete collapse of Ataka could have major repercussions on other Japanese trading companies and on the Japanese economy in general. The liquidation of Ataka, combined with the contemporaneous bailout of Mazda, had a major impact on Sumitomo's finances, driving it down from the most profitable bank in Japan to being only ninth-ranked.|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} {{sovereign}} debt {{differs from the}} market for corporate debt in several important ways including the risk of opportunistic default by sovereign debtors, the importance of political pressures, {{and the presence of}} international development organizations. Moreover, countries are subject to neither liquidation nor standardized processes of debt reorganization. Instead, negotiations between a sovereign debtor and its creditors lead to a voluntary restructuring of the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s debt. One of the greatest difficulties in <b>restructuring</b> <b>claims</b> against sovereign debtors is balancing the interests {{of the majority of the}} creditors with those of minority creditors. Holdout creditors serve as a check on opportunistic defaults and unreasonable restructuring terms, yet their presence can interfere with the restructuring process. In this Article, we examine the role of holdout creditors within the context of the international capital markets. In particular, we consider the effect of a litigation remedy on the power of holdout creditors to influence current restructurings of sovereign debt. Recent commentators have criticized holdout creditors and proposed mechanisms designed to reduce their power-particularly their power to enforce contractual claims against sovereign debtors through litigation. We argue that these proposals may undervalue the role of holdout creditors in facilitating the restructuring process and in promoting the functioning of the international capital markets. Accordingly, we suggest that, prior to the implementation of broad reforms, the value of holdouts be tested through a market-based approach. We propose several modifications to the terms of agreements governing sovereign bonds that can be tested in the market as a mechanism for assessing the value of holdout litigation in the international financial architecture...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of the economy to two major [...] although in important respects offsetting [...] tax reforms has been much smaller than ardent supply-side revolutionaries expected, thus suggesting that a reassessment of the grounds for revolt is in order. This paper offers such a reassessment by first discussing how the evidence from the tax reforms of 1981 and 1986 reflects on {{our understanding of the}} response to taxation [...] with particular reference to savings and capital gains realizations. I then reconstruct a 1992 view about how taxes affect behavior. A unifying theme is that the tax system does much more than alter the relative prices of real variables [...] it also provides incentives to misreport income, <b>restructure</b> financial <b>claims,</b> time transactions, change the legal form of organization, and so on. For this reason, observed low tax elasticities of real variables may be due to either low elasticities of substitution or the fact that tax policy changes opportunity sets in complex ways. Disentangling these explanations requires an emphasis on the transaction-based nature of the tax system and the administration and enforcement of tax laws. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} several decades the {{dynamics}} of law and policy reform in Aotearoa/New Zealand have prefigured and encapsulated contemporary trends in economic state <b>restructuring,</b> indigenous <b>claims</b> to refigure the nation, and gender struggles for political representation. Successive governments have restructured the economy and the state using radical forms of neo-liberal economic policy with the stated aim of globalizing the economy. Political action {{on the part of the}} indigenous Maori people, often led by Maori women, increased and diversified, and included demands for self-determination and redress of historical colonial injustices. In 1997, the conservative National Party’s Jenny Shipley become the country’s first white female Prime Minister, followed in 1999 by the election of a center-left coalition headed by Labour Party leader Helen Clark. This article analyzes the race and gender dynamics of these contemporary trends. First, it argues that policies of state structural adjustment and Maori political claims have converged in commodified settlements of past colonial injustices as corporate deals. These deals are temporary alliances of men across race to silence and erase the demands for self-determination or political power sharing of Maori activists, who are usually Maori women. Second, this article contends that the political instability created by rapid structural adjustment and the change to a Mixed Member Proportional (“MMP”) electoral system converges with white backlash against these settlements to open space for New Zealand’s first two female Prime Ministers. This article also suggests that the election of a second white female Prime Minister in New Zealand may reflect the (temporary) regendering of the role of Prime Minister to the feminine...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the recent {{efforts of the}} {{international}} financial institutions to limit the moral hazard created by their assistance to crisis countries. We question {{the wisdom of the}} case-by-case approach taken in Pakistan, Ecuador, Romania and Ukraine. We show that because default and restructuring are so painful and costly, it is simply not time consistent for the IFIs to plan to stand aside if the markets refuse to roll over maturing <b>claims,</b> <b>restructure</b> problem debts, or provide new money. Because these realities create an incentive to disburse even if investors fail to comply, the IFIs are then placed in the position of having to back down on their previous conditionality, which undermines their credibility. And since investors are aware of these facts, their behavior is unlikely to be modified by the IFIs' less-than-credible statements of intent. Hence, this approach to bailing in the private sector' will not work. Fortunately, there is an alternative: introducing collective-action clauses into loan agreements. This, and not ad hoc efforts to bail in the private sector, is a forward-looking solution to the moral hazard problem. ...|$|R

In asking why so few women succeed in reaching senior executive roles in Australian universities, the discussion sets out to identify and expose some {{of the politics of}} gender equity in the academic environment of higher education, in context of the pressures of research accountability and knowledge management of the <b>restructured</b> university. It <b>claims</b> that if we are to identify and interrogate impediments for women academics we need to understand these issues in broader political contexts of the institutional cultures of globalisation. Data of women in senior academic roles in Australia provide the starting points to review recent literature, identify impediments for women and raise further questions. The discussion then turns to ways of seeking solutions through nation-wide measures in Australian universities. It concludes with a brief examination of the implications for women subjects and the recasting of academic identities. The Australian academic context is the focus but the applications are wider than this one location...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on debt restructuring usually assumes that banks {{behave in a}} uniform way towards firms in distress. Using {{a recent survey of}} Italian banks, we show that banks follow different strategies when they decide whether {{to take part in the}} workout process, in that some of them do <b>restructure</b> their debt <b>claims</b> towards small and medium-sized enterprises in distress, while others do not. We explain this heterogeneity by considering the role of banksÂ’ internal organization and lending technologies, which the literature has shown to be strictly tied to the type of relationship developed with the borrower (transactional versus relationship lending). We find that the probability of debt restructuring is higher when the bank: i) is geographically closer to borrowing firms; ii) relies more on soft than hard information; and iii) adopts a decentralized structure with more power allocated to local managers. However there are important complementarities among organizational variables: the adoption of credit scoring increases the likelihood of restructuring if banks also use these techniques systematically in the monitoring process and if they adopt more decentralized structures. Bank size per se is not able to fully explain this heterogeneous behaviour, as organizational forms and lending technologies may also have important consequences on bank decisions. financial distress, debt restructuring, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), bank heterogeneity, bank organization, lending technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the long-term needs of veterans {{returning from the}} Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, and the budgetary and structural consequences of these needs. The paper uses data from government sources, such as the Veterans Benefit Administration Annual Report. The main conclusions of the analysis are that: (a) the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is already overwhelmed by the volume of returning veterans and the seriousness of their health care needs, {{and it will not}} be able to provide a high quality of care in a timely fashion to the large wave of returning war veterans without greater funding and increased capacity in areas such as psychiatric care; (b) the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is in need of structural reforms in order to deal with the high volume of pending claims; the current claims process is unable to handle even the current volume and completely inadequate to cope with the high demand of returning war veterans; and (c) the budgetary costs of providing disability compensation benefits and medical care to the veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan over the course of their lives will be from $ 350 - $ 700 Billion, depending on the length of deployment of US soldiers, the speed with which they claim disability benefits and the growth rate of benefits and health care inflation. Key recommendations include: increase staffing and funding for veterans medical care particularly for mental health treatment; expand staffing and funding for the “Vet Centers,” and <b>restructure</b> the benefits <b>claim</b> process at the Veterans Benefit Administration. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of taxes and financial distress costs in the incremental financing choice between private and public debt. Theory suggests {{it is easier to}} renegotiate and <b>restructure</b> private debt <b>claims</b> outside bankruptcy. While financial distress costs may matter in the choice between private and public debt, the primary motivation for this study is to examine whether the relationship between financial distress costs and the private-public debt choice is dependent on firm's marginal tax rates. The point being firms more likely to default on their debt will exploit tax savings using private debt claims. Using a sample from the SDC database, I find a positive relationship between the issuance of private debt and the proxy for firms' financial distress costs. Additionally, I find a positive and significant relationship between the interaction of taxes and financial distress costs and the issuance of private debt claims. This supports the argument that the relationship between financial distress costs and the choice of debt is dependent on the firm's tax status. The intuition is that while financial distress costs differ between private and public debt claims, firms are likely to exploit this cost differential in the presence of positive tax savings available through the issuance of debt. Overall, the results are robust to alternative specifications of financial distress costs. The empirical models also control for variables that may lead to cost differential between private and public debt claims. I find firms with high growth opportunities are more likely to issue private debt claims. Consistent with the economies of scale argument, I find public debt tend to be denominated in large issues. I also find that large firms are more likely to issue in public debt markets. One argument here is that large firms do not require the close monitoring provided by private lenders. Finally, as documented in prior studies, I find that regulated firms are less likely to issue private debt claims...|$|R
