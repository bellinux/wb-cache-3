Lord Stirling was there likewise, having effected the transportation of the Maryland and Virginia troops across the river, and landed them at the ferry south of Stony Point; though a better landing was subsequently found north of the point. His lordship had thrown out a scouting party in the advance, and a hundred men to take possession of {{a gap in the}} mountain, through which a road passed toward the Jerseys. Washington was now at the entrance of the Highlands, that grand defile of the Hudson, the object of so much precaution and solicitude. On the following morning, accompanied by Generals Heath, Stirling, James and George Clinton, Mifflin, and others, he made a military visit in boats to the Highland posts. Fort Montgomery was in a considerable state of forwardness, and a work in the vicinity was projected to co-operate with it. Fort Constitution commanded a sudden bend of the river, but Lord Stirling, in his <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> had intimated that the fort itself was commanded by West Point opposite. A glance of the eye, without going on shore, was sufficient to convince Washington of the fact. A fortress subsequently erected on that point, has been considered the Key of the Highlands.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the causes of}} acquisitions of nursing homes by corporate chains and the consequences for the operating strategies of the acquired facilities and the health outcomes of their residents. Our data include all <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> <b>of</b> Medicare/Medicaid certified U. S. nursing homes from January 1991 through September 1997. During this period, 3, 000 corporate owners acquired nearly 5, 000 of 19, 000 total nursing homes. Nursing home chains typically acquire poorly performing facilities that offer opportunities for the new owners to improve health quality (pressure ulcer prevalence and health deficiency citations). Post-acquisition health quality of target nursing homes tends to decline initially and then improve. Target quality improves more when the acquiring chain is high quality and/or the target low quality. Nursing home acquisitions also lead to substantial changes in operating strategy, with acquired facilities experiencing declines in staffing ratios and increases {{in the percentage of}} specialty beds...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Little {{is known}} about the {{involvement}} of security personnel in Irish psychiatric care. Content analysis <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>reports</b> is a feasible way to investigate this under-researched topic. We aimed to (i) Describe the number of approved centres per year in which we observed comments about the presence of security personnel in published <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> conducted from 2008 to 2012 (ii) Report the main themes of all text relating to security personnel published in these inspection reports. Method We conducted a content analysis <b>of</b> all 349 <b>inspection</b> <b>reports</b> published between 2008 and 2012. Results The number of approved centres in which security personnel were noted increased from 3 % to 8 % between the years 2008 and 2012. This increase was not statistically significant when the same unique centres were compared between years (p= 0. 684). Employment details such as contracted employment relationship, location relative to the approved centre and hours of work appeared inconsistent across centres. Role functions of security personnel differed across centres and ranged from monitoring the entrance of a unit to observing, restraining and secluding patients. Contrasting perceptions of suitability were evident in the inspection reports. The extent to which the training needs of security personnel were met was unclear from the <b>reports.</b> Conclusions Activity <b>of</b> security personnel in psychiatric hospitals may not be role appropriate, compliant with legislation or conducive to treatment. Best practice guidelines should be developed in consultation with multiple stakeholders...|$|R

Among the facts researchers in Mexico and many other Latin American countries must deal with are the frequent drastic changes in policy and organization with each new administration of an archive.
