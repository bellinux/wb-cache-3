A total of 17 different ramp metering approaches is described. For the already implemented algorithms, the historical background, the network, the algorithm and the main references are described. The proposed <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> approaches are briefly described and the literature references are included. Two possible directions of ramp metering for the future are qualitatively described. Based on the literature review, online simulation and fuzzy logic seem to be two very powerful approaches {{to be considered in}} the future. The hierarchic and dynamic characteristics of the online simulation <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> system are its unique features. The on-line simulation approach is designed to handle both recurring and non-recurring congestion situations. The adaptive fuzzy logic control approach allows a fast and reliable calibration of the existing parameters and the controller adapts itself to a new environment or to changes of the traffic patterns.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an analytical}} framework for ramp metering, under which various <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> strategies {{can be viewed}} as ramifications of the same most-efficient control logic with different threshold values, control methods, and equity considerations. The most-efficient control logic only meters the entrance ramps nearest critical freeway mainline sections so as to eliminate freeway internal queues, which is derived from a new formulation of the optimal <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> problem. Instead of assuming the availability of real-time origin-destination information, the new formulation takes advantages of the stability and predictability of off-ramp exit percentages. Those properties of the off-ramp exit percentages are supported by empirical data, and allow us to formulate the optimal <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> problem as a linear program whose input variables are all directly measurable by detectors in real-time. The solution is also tested on a real-world freeway section in a microscopic traffic simulator for demonstration. Time-dependent origin/destination tables and off-ramp exit percentages are compared as two alternative ways to represent the true real-time demand patterns that are important to freeway ramp metering.

This study presents development and comparative evaluation of five <b>ramp</b> <b>controls</b> including no control, time-of-day plan, and three well-known {{ramp metering}} algorithms; ALINEA, FLOW and Stratified Zone through the use of microscopic traffic simulation. In this paper, <b>ramp</b> <b>controls</b> were developed and evaluated using Microscopic Traffic Simulation, AIMSUN NG. The simulation model of the Pacific Motorway in Queensland, Australia was used as a test-bed model. The results from the study indicated that ramp metering was basically found to be able to improve network performances up to 40 % compared to no control. In terms of network and freeway mainline performance, ALINEA was superior to other algorithms under both normal and high traffic demand, whereas, Stratified Zone was the best algorithm for on-ramp performance. In terms of on-ramp performance, ALINEA was found to generate the lowest on-ramp performance. FLOW was found to be slightly superior to Stratified Zone. However, the trend was opposite for on-ramp performance. Gini coefficient was applied to measure the road user equity under the implementation of different algorithms. The results showed that FLOW was the most equitable algorithm, whereas, ALINEA was the worst.

40|$|Freeway <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} implemented since mid 60 ’s, as an efficient and viable freeway management strategy. However, the effectiveness of any <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> strategy is largely dependent on optimum parameter values which are preferably determined prior to deployment.

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{has become}} an increasingly serious problem in many cities. Ramp metering, which maintains smooth freeway mainline flow by limiting vehicle entry at entrance ramps, has been proposed and implemented {{in a number of}} metropolitan areas in and outside the U. S. to mitigate freeway congestion. This study aims to develop both efficient and equitable freeway <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> strategies. Traffic conditions with and without ramp metering are evaluated on several representative freeways in the Twin Cities with a comprehensive set of performance measures. A unified theory for ramp metering is proposed based on a linear programming model of freeway traffic dynamics. The most efficient <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is found to be also the least equitable one. A novel control objective, minimizing weighted or perceived travel time, is therefore proposed to balance efficiency and equity objectives of ramp metering. This research also develops a new family of applicable ramp metering strategies, which consider both efficiency and equity, and are demonstrated in a microscopic traffic simulator. Future studies should compare various traffic control methods under the analytical framework proposed in this report. Researchers should also pursue field experiments of the proposed multi-objective <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> strategies. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this study is to develop both {{efficient}} and equitable freeway <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> strategies. Measures of efficiency and equity for ramp meters are defined and applied to data collected in the Twin Cities ramp metering shut-off experiment. A trade-off between efficiency and equity is evident from the results of data analysis. A new time-dependent optimization program for the global optimal <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> problem is developed, which aims to minimize total travel time and does not require origin-destination demand information. A heuristic solution to the real-time version of the new optimization program is also provided which can be directly implemented in real-world freeway networks. The heuristic provides a qualitative foundation for the development of an analytical framework for ramp metering under which future ramp metering studies can be conducted. In addition, a new series of <b>ramp</b> <b>control</b> strategies, Co_EOAX, is developed based on the heuristic with some additional equity considerations.
