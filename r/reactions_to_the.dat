5|$|<b>Reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{disclosure}} were diverse, encompassing {{commentary and}} {{articles in the}} electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community researched Essjay's article edits to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his editorial activities Jordan spent less time editing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{extension}} between SR125 and SR67 were mixed. There {{were reports}} of faster transportation through the East County area, yet commuters noted a rush hour backup at SR125 headed westbound {{because there were}} only two lanes traveling west through the interchange.

Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Timberlake's primary {{legacy is}} the journal he kept while {{living with the}} Cherokee. The volume was {{published}} in 1765, likely following Timberlake's death in September of that year. The journal is of importance both as an ethnological study, as it contains detailed descriptions of various facets of Cherokee society, and as a historical account, as it gives insight into Cherokee political decision-making and the tribe's early <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> encroaching European colonists.|$|E

5|$|Troika used first-person {{perspective}} to immerse the {{player in the}} setting, interacting face-to-face with the characters and seeing their facial <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player. It chose to follow a single-character to aid the immersion, creating the isolation of a vampire unable to trust any other character. This aided the story and compensated for the technical issues of allowing multiple player characters.|$|E

Leo and Grace, however, assure Will {{that they will have}} a wedding reception in honor of him, which improves Will's relationship with both Grace and Leo.|$|E

The intensity of the reaction was graded; there was a significantly better response to therapy and survival rate in those with a “severe” cellular reaction than in those with a “mild” <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> gestational choriocarcinoma. <b>The</b> pathological and clinical features of invasive moles showed no relationship with <b>the</b> cellular <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tumour. <b>The</b> cellular <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> trophoblastic teratomata was generally poor {{but there was a}} marked cellular <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tumour of one patient who has enjoyed a sustained remission...|$|R
5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E
5|$|Customers' <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> merger varied. Most of {{the public}} {{understood}} {{the need for the}} merger of two small companies, which were both operating in a very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers. Some loyal Vanaja customers were astounded at the decision to discontinue the make. Some customers were upset because the last long-nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from Jyry-Sisu; they said they would never buy Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus. The drop in the truck market was short-lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus.|$|E
5|$|Initial <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{approaching}} hurricane in the Yucatán Peninsula {{were regarded}} as calm by the United States media. Mexican officials declared an emergency alert by September 2, although they did not advise any evacuations.

Fearing significant loss of life and property, the Red Cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize. The following day, the Mexican Army rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities.
