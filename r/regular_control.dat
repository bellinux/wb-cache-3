50|$|In the Netherlands, the {{guidelines}} for signposting feature a distinction between <b>regular</b> <b>control</b> cities (called hoofddoel) and network cities (called netwerkdoel). The class, a group of ten cities in {{each part of the}} country where major roads intersect, is being signposted in addition to <b>regular</b> <b>control</b> cities. The references to network control cities serve to guide long-distance traffic through the country, unlike the reference to the first <b>regular</b> <b>control</b> city which is seldom more than 30 km away. Network control cities can also be towns on an intersecting road. Since 2010, efforts are being made to create even more prominent references to the towns of Amsterdam and Rotterdam; the former drawing lots of tourists and the latter drawing lots of professional drivers to its port. On roads not leading to a network control city, the route's terminus is often signposted in addition to the control city.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{contribution}} of co-occurring nonhead injuries to hazard of death after traumatic brain injury (TBI). PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with confirmed TBI from 1987 through 1999 was identified. DESIGN: Each case was assigned an age- and sex-matched, non-TBI "regular control" from the population. For "special cases" with accompanying nonhead injuries, 2 matched "special controls" with nonhead injuries of similar severity were assigned. MEASURES: Vital status was followed from baseline (ie, injury date for cases, comparable dates for controls) through 2008. Cases were compared first with <b>regular</b> <b>controls</b> and second with <b>regular</b> or special <b>controls,</b> depending on case type. RESULTS: In total, 1257 cases were identified (including 221 special cases). For both cases versus <b>regular</b> <b>controls</b> and cases versus <b>regular</b> or special <b>controls,</b> the hazard ratio was increased from baseline to 6 months (10. 82 [2. 86 - 40. 89] and 7. 13 [3. 10 - 16. 39], respectively) and from baseline through study end (2. 92 [1. 74 - 4. 91] and 1. 48 [1. 09 - 2. 02], respectively). Among 6 -month survivors, the hazard ratio was increased for cases versus <b>regular</b> <b>controls</b> (1. 43 [1. 06 - 2. 15]) but not for cases versus <b>regular</b> or special <b>controls</b> (1. 05 [0. 80 - 1. 38]).

In {{some parts of}} the country nitrate in drinking water is elevated. About 70,000 families depend on small private water supply systems. The majority of these water supply systems face problems with either nitrate pollution due to extensive agriculture production and/or pollution with pesticides or bacterial contamination.

40|$|In this paper, {{our goal}} is to study the regular {{reduction}} theory of <b>regular</b> <b>controlled</b> Hamiltonian (RCH) systems with symplectic structure and symmetry, and this reduction is an extension of regular symplectic reduction theory of Hamiltonian systems under <b>regular</b> <b>controlled</b> Hamiltonian equivalence conditions. Thus, in order to describe uniformly RCH systems defined on a cotangent bundle and on the regular reduced spaces, we first define a kind of RCH systems on a symplectic fiber bundle. Then introduce regular point and regular orbit reducible RCH systems with symmetry by using momentum map and the associated reduced symplectic forms. Moreover, we give regular point and regular orbit reduction theorems for RCH systems to explain the relationships between RpCH-equivalence, RoCH-equivalence for reducible RCH systems with symmetry and RCH-equivalence for associated reduced RCH systems. Finally, as an application we regard rigid body and heavy top as well as them with internal rotors as the regular point reducible RCH systems on the rotation group SO(3) and on the Euclidean group SE(3),as well as on their generalizations, respectively, and discuss their RCH-equivalence. We also describe the RCH system and RCH-equivalence from the viewpoint of port Hamiltonian system with a symplectic structure. Comment: 36 page...|$|R

From this characterisation we obtain that these languages are semi-linear, and that for RPCGSs with constant communication complexity, the centralised variant has the same generative power as the non-centralised variant...|$|E
