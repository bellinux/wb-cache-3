50|$|The costal or ventral {{surface of}} the scapula {{presents}} a broad concavity, the subscapular fossa. The medial two-thirds of the fossa are marked by several oblique ridges, which run lateralward and upward. The <b>ridges</b> give <b>attachment</b> to the tendinous insertions, and the surfaces between them to the fleshy fibers, of the subscapularis muscle.|$|R

50|$|In humans, the occipitofrontalis only serves for facial expressions. In apes, {{however, the}} head is not {{balanced}} on the vertebral column, and apes therefore need strong muscles that pull back on the skull and prominent supraorbital <b>ridges</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of these muscles.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the greater}} palatine foramen is the {{pyramidal}} {{process of the}} palatine bone, perforated {{by one or more}} lesser palatine foramina which carry the lesser palatine nerve, and marked by the commencement of a transverse <b>ridge,</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of the tendinous expansion of the Tensor veli palatini.|$|R
25|$|The {{front of}} the scapula (also known as the costal or ventral surface) has a broad {{concavity}} called the subscapular fossa, to which the subscapularis muscle attaches. The medial two-thirds of the fossa have 3 longitudinal oblique ridges, and another thick ridge adjoins the lateral border; they run outward and upward. The <b>ridges</b> give <b>attachment</b> to the tendinous insertions, and the surfaces between them to the fleshy fibers, of the subscapularis muscle. The lateral third of the fossa is smooth and covered by the fibers of this muscle.|$|R
50|$|On {{the medial}} {{part of the}} root of the {{coracoid}} process is a rough impression for the attachment of the conoid ligament; and running from it obliquely forward and lateralward, on to the upper surface of the horizontal portion, is an elevated <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of the trapezoid ligament.|$|R
50|$|The {{inferior}} surface, slightly concave and rough, forms, {{with the}} corresponding {{surface of the}} opposite bone, the posterior fourth of the hard palate. Near its posterior margin may be seen {{a more or less}} marked transverse <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of part of the aponeurosis of the Tensor veli palatini.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} surface forms part of {{the bony}} wall of the lesser pelvis. In front it {{is limited by the}} posterior margin of the obturator foramen. Below, it is bounded by a sharp <b>ridge</b> that provides <b>attachment</b> to a falciform prolongation of the sacrotuberous ligament, and, more anteriorly, gives origin to the transverse perineal and ischiocavernosus muscles.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower part}} of the lateral border of the body of the humerus forms a prominent, rough margin, a little curved from behind forward, the lateral supracondylar ridge (or line), which {{presents}} an anterior lip for the origin of the Brachioradialis above, and Extensor carpi radialis longus below, a posterior lip for the Triceps brachii, and an intermediate <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of the lateral intermuscular septum.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inferior}} {{third of}} the medial border of the humerus is raised into a slight ridge, the medial supracondylar ridge (or [...] medial supracondylar line), which becomes very prominent below; it presents an anterior lip for {{the origins of the}} Brachialis and Pronator teres, a posterior lip for the medial head of the Triceps brachii, and an intermediate <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of the medial intermuscular septum.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{new design}} for single-channel {{waveguide}} rotary joints for high-power applications is presented. In {{order to obtain}} correct signal phase conditions along the ring and, at the same time, reduce {{the diameter of the}} <b>rotary</b> joint, tapered <b>ridged</b> wave-guide sections are introduced. Design guidelines with respect to general transmission characteristics,-plane aperture couplers, and ridge waveguide analysis are presented. Measurements of a 9. 05 -GHz prototype show less than 1 -dB insertion loss over a 250 -MHz bandwidth and, hence, verify the design concept.

5000|$|The dorsal surface (facies dorsalis; {{posterior}} surface) directed {{backward and}} lateralward, is broad and concave above; convex and somewhat narrower in the middle; narrow, smooth, and rounded below. On its upper part is an oblique ridge, which {{runs from the}} dorsal end of the radial notch, downward to the dorsal border; the triangular surface above this ridge receives the insertion of the Anconæus, while {{the upper part of}} the <b>ridge</b> affords <b>attachment</b> to the supinator. Below this the surface is subdivided by a longitudinal ridge, sometimes called the perpendicular line, into two parts: the medial part is smooth, and covered by the extensor carpi ulnaris; the lateral portion, wider and rougher, gives origin from above downward to the Supinator, the abductor pollicis longus, the extensor pollicis longus, and the extensor indicis proprius.|$|R
2500|$|Chatterjee {{claims that}} the humerus of Protoavis is [...] "remarkably avian", but as in all matters with the fossils {{referred}} to this taxon, accurate identification of the elaborate trochanters, ridges, etc., attributed to the humerus by Chatterjee is impossible at this time. Interestingly, the expanded distal condyles, which appear {{to be present in}} the humerus of Protoavis and enlarged deltopectoral crest (a <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of chest and shoulder muscles), are congruent with the morphology of ceratosaur humeri, as is the apparent presence of a distal brachial depression.|$|R
60|$|The {{lines of}} {{fracture}} which remain between the coadjusted {{pieces of the}} skull, and are faithfully displayed in Schmerling's figure, are readily traceable in the cast. The sutures are also discernible, but the complex disposition of their serrations, shown in the figure, is not obvious in the cast. Though the <b>ridges</b> which give <b>attachment</b> to muscles are not excessively prominent, they are well marked, and taken together with the apparently well developed frontal sinuses, and {{the condition of the}} sutures, leave no doubt on my mind that the skull is that of an adult, if not middle-aged man.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of examples excavated to date, have evidence of either decorative silvering of the iron, or {{are covered by}} costly silver or silver-gilt sheathing; a job entrusted to men called barbaricarii The Berkasovo-I example is decorated with many glass gems on the bowl, cheekpieces, and neckguard. For a number of extant helmets all that remains is the decorative silver or gold sheathing, the iron having corroded away entirely. A single helmet found at Intercisa in Hungary, where a hoard of 15-20 helmets was unearthed, has a tall, integral, iron crest attached to the ridge. A similar helmet found at Augst has three slots in its <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of a separate crest. There have also been finds of unattached crest pieces, or ones attached to only the ridge of the helmet.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to gliding membranes, weigeltisaurids have several other adaptations to an arboreal or tree-living lifestyle. Their skeletons are lightened by large air spaces within the bones. The {{region of the}} spinal column that connect to the hip, called the sacrum, is formed by three vertebrae rather than two as in most early reptiles, which would have stabilized the skeleton from stresses experienced while climbing. The limb bones of weigeltisaurids have well-developed joint surfaces and prominent <b>ridges</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of muscles, an indication that their limbs were strong enough to support vertical climbing up tree trunks. The shaft of the femur or thigh bone is twisted, allowing for greater flexibility of the hind limbs. The long finger and strongly recurved claw bones with large attachment points for flexor muscles may be adaptations for clinging to tree bark.|$|R
50|$|The medial border {{extends from}} the lesser {{tubercle}} to the medial epicondyle. Its upper third consists of a prominent ridge, {{the crest of the}} lesser tubercle, which gives insertion to the tendon of the teres major muscle. About its center is a slight impression for the insertion of the coracobrachialis muscle, and just below this is the entrance of the nutrient canal, directed downward; sometimes there is a second nutrient canal at the commencement of the radial sulcus. The inferior third of this border is raised into a slight ridge, the medial supracondylar ridge, which became very prominent below; it presents an anterior lip for the origins of the brachialis muscle and the pronator teres muscle, a posterior lip for the medial head of the triceps brachii muscle, and an intermediate <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of the medial intermuscular septum.|$|R
50|$|The lateral border {{runs from}} the back part of the greater {{tubercle}} to the lateral epicondyle, and separates the anterolateral from the posterior surface. Its upper half is rounded and indistinctly marked, serving for the attachment of {{the lower part of}} the insertion of the teres minor muscle, and below this giving origin to the lateral head of the triceps brachii muscle; its center is traversed by a broad but shallow oblique depression, the spiral groove (musculospiral groove). The radial nerve runs in the spiral groove. Its lower part forms a prominent, rough margin, a little curved from backward, forward the lateral supracondylar ridge, which presents an anterior lip for the origin of the brachioradialis muscle above, and extensor carpi radialis longus muscle above, a posterior lip for the triceps brachii muscle, and an intermediate <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of the lateral intermuscular septum.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Scala communis or interscalar septum (IS) defect is a {{developmental}} abnormality {{of the inner}} ear characterized by a dehiscence in the partition separating the turns of the cochlea. The goals {{of the present study}} were to (1) study this anomaly and describe its characteristics compared to control ears using a histological analysis of temporal bones, (2) discuss radiological implications regarding its diagnosis, and (3) describe its embryological derivation. Methods: Out of 1775 temporal bones assessed, 22 specimens were found to have scala communis in cochleae containing all 3 turns (basal, middle and apical). These 22 ears were studied in detail by qualitative and quantitative methods using light microscopy. Results: Scala communis occurred as an isolated inner ear anomaly, or in association with other congenital cochlear and/or vestibular anomalies. The defect occurred most often between the middle and apical turns of the cochlea. Compared to control ears, scala communis ears were found to have a smaller modiolar area (p! 0. 0001) and flattening of the interscalar <b>ridge</b> (point of <b>attachment</b> of the IS to the inner lumen of the cochlea; p! 0. 0001). Scala communis was compatible with normal hearing. Conclusions: Flattening of the interscalar ridge has the potential to improve the diagnosis of scala communis in patients using CT scanning. The anomaly may result from a mesodermal defect such as excessive resorption of mesenchyme during the formation of the scalae, an error in the formation of bone, or both. Copyright © 2010 S.

5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a <b>ridge</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|R
