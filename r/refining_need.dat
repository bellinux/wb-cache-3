40|$|Moneynet, {{launched}} in 1997, was the United Kingdom’s first comparison website in financial services. It enables its users to specify {{their needs and}} then select from suitable product providers, who in turn benefit from potential customers with <b>refined</b> <b>needs.</b> This article makes both a theoretical and applied contribution to the Information Systems literature. It develops an amended version of the Porter value chain, which it terms the click chain, as a theoretical framework which is then used to analyse Moneynet. This framework analyses how Moneynet creates value {{and in doing so}} identifies key implications for comparison websites and product providers. ...|$|R
50|$|The Chicontepec Basin (Chicontepec Formation) is a {{petroleum}} {{system in}} Mexico north-east of Mexico City, covering {{an area of}} around 3800 km2 in the states of Veracruz, Puebla and Hidalgo. Several oil fields have been discovered in that area since 1926. A major field was discovered in 1973 but contains extra heavy crude, which due to special <b>refining</b> <b>needs</b> is considered unviable at this time. Since that time, tiny amounts of oil have been produced. While the reserves are overwhelmingly extra heavy crude, pockets of lighter tight oil, as well as natural gas, are {{also found in the}} basin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Product {{recommendation}} {{systems are}} now {{a key part of}} many e-commerce services and have proven to be a successful way to help users navigate complex product spaces. In this paper, we focus on critiquing-based recommenders, which permit users to tweak the features of recommended products in order to <b>refine</b> their <b>needs</b> and preferences. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to reusing past critiquing histories in order to improve overall recommendation efficiency. ...|$|R

50|$|The CRC {{proposed}} a possible plankton monitoring program which would help {{respond to this}} issue. Phytoplankton {{are part of the}} problem and by monitoring a population in an area and how it affects other aspects of life there, a general health index can be established. The proposed solution was to form workgroups involving bay program managers, experts to design specific elements of the workshops and plans, analytical experts to manage data collected and solve calculations while producing plots for routine use and inspection. It would also use data sets for routine use in ecosystem modeling used in fisheries management for <b>refining</b> <b>needed</b> elements and products for fisheries management. This was proposed because very few projects such as these were developed previously. The report goes on to state there must be input from scientists and managers to ensure that the monitoring is addressing the actual concerns in question. Concerns would include an index of performance metrics directing specific areas such as fish nurseries and spawning areas. By controlling these factors a threshold could be established for when plankton would require management intervention or single a checkpoint achieved.|$|R
5000|$|This {{does not}} mean a fuzzy system should be sloppy. Depending on the system, it might get away with being sloppy, but it will underperform. While the rules are fairly arbitrary, they should be chosen carefully. If possible, an expert should decide on the rules, and the sets and rules should be tested vigorously and <b>refined</b> as <b>needed.</b> In this way, a fuzzy system is like an expert system. (Fuzzy logic is used in many true expert systems, as well.) ...|$|R
25|$|Slag {{may also}} form during smithing and refining. The {{product of the}} bloomer process is {{heterogeneous}} blooms of entrapped slag. Smithing is necessary to cut up and remove the trapped slag by reheating, softening the slag and then squeezing it out. On the other hand, <b>refining</b> is <b>needed</b> for the cast iron produced in the blast furnace. By re-melting the cast iron in an open hearth, the carbon is oxidized and removed from the iron. Liquid slag is formed and removed in this process.|$|R

30|$|These missing {{correlations}} are {{in agreement}} with the results obtained in the survey of consumer information about textile ingredients, where the information strategies and assessments of chemicals by the respondents were independent of the demographic variables like gender, age, educational level, or income [20]. While Steffensen [20] concluded {{that it would not be}} necessary to establish various specific sources of information for various groups in the population, our results would not, in general, support this, because there were clear differences of the various demographic groups in most answers. This outcome shows that more studies of this kind are needed to be able to <b>refine</b> the <b>needs</b> for optimal information strategies.|$|R

30|$|Gupte et al.[15] {{proposed}} {{a system for}} vehicle detection and classification. They classified the tracked vehicles into two categories: cars and non-cars. The classification is based on vehicle dimensions, where they compute the length and height of a vehicle {{and use them to}} distinguish cars from non-cars [15]. Avely et al.[16] used a similar approach, where the vehicles are classified on the basis of length using an uncalibrated camera. However, this method also classifies the vehicles into two coarse groups: short vehicles and long vehicles. In order to achieve a finer-level classification of vehicles, a more <b>refined</b> method <b>needs</b> to be devised that can detect and model the invariant characteristics for each vehicle category considered.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{amount of}} data on the Web is increasing. Current exact and {{complete}} techniques for matching complex query pattern against graph-structured web data have limits.

We propose a new approach, allowing an affordable computation of an ini-tial set of (possibly inexact) results, which can be incrementally <b>refined</b> as <b>needed.</b> It is based on approximate structure matching techniques, which leverage the notion of neighborhood overlap and structure index. For exact and complete result computation, evaluation results show that our incremental approach compares well with the state of the art. More-over, approximative results can be computed in much lower response time, without compromising too much on precision. ...|$|R
40|$|Comparison {{websites}} {{have become}} a fundamental part of UK retail financial services. These websites appeal to both buyers and sellers. They offer buyers the ability to enter their details once and then quickly compare a range of products, usually ordered by price.
