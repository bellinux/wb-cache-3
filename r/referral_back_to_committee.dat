40|$|In New Zealand {{there are}} {{concerns}} about the high numbers of preventable admissions of young children with acute illnesses. These admissions are concentrated in the under five age group, with higher rates of admissions for tamariki Maori and Pacific children. This study sought to address these concerns by focusing on what happened once these children were discharged. Its aims were {{to find out what}} the expressed needs of parents were, as they cared for their child, once home. Whilst there has been a small amount of international research undertaken in this area, there is little known about expressed parent need in the New Zealand context. This exploratory descriptive study involved parents of under five year old children, who had been admitted to a hospital, with one of five acute illnesses. Eighteen parents were surveyed over the telephone. This study found the parents expressed a need for reassurance and advice once home, and that they worried about their child getting sick again. It highlighted gaps in discharge planning and support. None of the parents had received a written discharge plan for their child. Only five parents had received either a contact number for advice or a <b>referral</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their primary care provider. This study found that whilst some parents considered their discharge needs had been met, others considered that they had not. Four local discharge practice opportunities to support these families were recommended, these included, providing parents and caregivers with an individualised written discharge plan, giving a contact number for advice after discharge, offering a follow-up phone call in the first 48 hours, and ensuring that all children have a <b>referral</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their primary health care provider.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether patients referring themselves to {{an accident and}} emergency department for another opinion after consulting their general practitioner present with serious illness, show any risk factors for being admitted, or {{are more likely to be}} patients of particular practitioners. DESIGN [...] Six month prospective survey. SETTING [...] District general hospital's {{accident and emergency department}}, receiving 42, 000 new patients a year. PATIENTS [...] 180 Patients identified as attending for another opinion having already consulted a general practitioner. INTERVENTIONS [...] Classified as admission, referral to specialist clinic, follow up in accident and emergency department, or <b>referral</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> general practitioner. END POINT [...] Admission, with an analysis of admitted patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] General outcome, diagnostic category, age, time of attendance, time since seen by general practitioner, and name of general practitioner were recorded. Forty seven patients were admitted, 99 were discharged <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the general practitioner (62 without a letter), and two died. Patients were most likely to be admitted if they attended within 24 hours after seeing a general practitioner, were aged under 5, or presented with respiratory or gastrointestinal complaints.

Background and Objectives: Linking primary care practices to community entities is critical for providing comprehensive and continuous care. The patient centered medical home (PCMH) should facilitate linkages to the community. Our study aims to understand what challenges pediatric primary care practices in Florida face in developing these linkages. Methods: Interviews were conducted with three-person core project teams working in 20 pediatric practices across Florida. All practices are participating in a longitudinal, PCMH demonstration project. Results: At baseline, most practices reported positive connections with specialists, but about half reported insurance as the main barrier. Practices reported both negative and positive aspects of their connection to hospitals and emergency rooms. While some practices saw the emergency room as source of <b>referral</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their practice, others felt that hospitals or emergency rooms did not communicate well or collaborate in patient care.

We present the {{findings}} in a 78 year old female who has been hospitalized in April 1997 {{with a history of}} 4 months of malaise, headaches and weight loss. Clinical examination showed a right lateral homonymous hemi-anopsia. Computed tomography (CT-Scan) of the brain showed two lesions in the occipital and temporal lobe, consistent with metastasis. Thoracic and abdominal-pelvic CT-Scan revealed a voluminous mass of the left auricle that has been interpreted as a probable sarcoma. Biopsy specimen of one of the cerebral lesions, performed at the Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV) on April 29 th 1997, revealed fragments of a poorly differentiated sarcoma. After <b>referral</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Neuchatel, the patient suffered suddenly three weeks later from a cerebral vascular insult with instant onset of deep coma. She deceased on May 27.

MethodsCross-sectional study {{by means of a}} survey of a random sample of 1500 patients attended in primary and secondary care for the same condition. The study settings consisted of three health areas of the Catalan health system. Data were collected in 2010 using the CCAENAÂ© questionnaire, which identifies patientsâ€™ experiences of continuity of care. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were carried out. ResultsElements of continuity of care were experienced by most patients. However, elements of discontinuity were also identified: 20 % and 15 % were seen by more than one primary or secondary care physician, respectively. Their secondary care physician or both professionals were identified as responsible for their care by 40 % and 45 % of users, respectively. Approximately 20 % reported a lack of information transfer. Finally, 72 % of secondary care consultations were due to primary care referral, whilst only 36 % reported a <b>referral</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> primary care. Associated factors were healthcare setting, age, sex, perceived health status and disease duration. ConclusionUsers generally reported continuity of care, although elements of discontinuity were also identified, which can be partially explained by the healthcare setting and some individual factors. Elements of discontinuity should be addressed to better adapt care to patientsâ€™ needs...|$|R

The set of cut-off values of the ROM reference group (â€˜healthyâ€™) {{can be used in}} specialized mental health care by therapists to support the decision whether a patient is sufficiently recovered to be considered {{as a member of the}} healthy population, and no longer as a member of the patient population. These reference values are suitable as decision support for <b>referral</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> primary care physicians. Additionally, the set of the ROM patient group (â€˜clinically illâ€™) cut-off values can be used by primary care physicians as decision support for referral to the specialized mental health care. To allow determination of cut-off points for skewed distributions, percentile scores were used. In addition, we assessed the discriminative power of the questionnaire scores by means of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analyses. Finally, we calculated reference values in separate strata of gender and age. The secondary aim of the NormQuest study concerned the need for the development of public domain questionnaires.
