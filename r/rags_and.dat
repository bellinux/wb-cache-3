5|$|The {{breeding}} season is in spring. During {{the beginning of}} the {{breeding season}}, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep spiralling or swooping dives. The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> buttons as her playthings.|$|E

5|$|While resting at the pub, Corvo {{is taken}} to a dream world where he meets the Outsider, who brands Corvo with his mark. Corvo is sent by the Loyalists to {{eliminate}} the conspirators behind the Lord Regent's plot, and the player is given the option to kill or otherwise neutralize Corvo's targets, {{the first of which}} is High Overseer Campbell. During the mission, Corvo meets Granny <b>Rags</b> <b>and</b> Slackjaw. Corvo removes the High Overseer and discovers that Emily is being held in a brothel called the Golden Cat under the supervision of twins Custis and Morgan Pendleton. Corvo rescues Emily and eliminates the brothers. After returning to the pub, Emily is taken into the care of Callista to prepare her for becoming Empress, while Corvo is sent to abduct the genius scientist Sokolov, who is responsible for the Lord Regent's powerful technologies. Sokolov {{is taken to}} the pub for interrogation, under which he divulges the identity of the Lord Regent's financier, Lady Boyle. Corvo infiltrates Boyle's masquerade ball, deduces which of the three sisters is the Lord Regent's mistress, and disposes of her.|$|E
25|$|The first {{identified}} coarse paper, {{made from}} hemp, {{dates to the}} early Western Han Dynasty, two hundred years before the nominal invention of papermaking by Cai Lun, who improved and standardized paper production using a range of inexpensive materials, including hemp ends, approximately 2000 years ago. Recycled hemp clothing, <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> fishing nets were used as inputs for paper production.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Buddhist monks, nuns, and novices eschew {{ordinary}} {{clothes and}} wear robes. Originally the robes were sewn together from <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> stained with earth or other available dyes. The color of modern robes varies from community to community: saffron is characteristic for Theravada groups; blue, grey or brown for Mahayana Sangha members in Vietnam, maroon in Tibetan Buddhism, grey in Korea, and black in Japan.|$|E

25|$|Papermaking has {{traditionally}} been traced to China about AD 105, when Cai Lun, an official attached to the Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), created {{a sheet of paper}} using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, old <b>rags,</b> <b>and</b> hemp waste. However, a recent archaeological discovery has been reported from Gansu of paper with Chinese characters on it dating to 8 BC.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, {{especially}} the 15th century, parchment was largely replaced by paper for most uses except luxury manuscripts, {{some of which}} were also on paper. New techniques in paper milling allowed it to be much cheaper than parchment; it was still made of textile <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> of very high quality. With the advent of printing in the later fifteenth century, the demands of printers far exceeded the supply of animal skins for parchment.|$|E

When the British took over Punjab in 1849, they discovered precious stones wrapped in bits of <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> placed in velvet purses scattered inside the mosque, along with other inventory.

25|$|The ship got {{underway}} at 9:30am. As it {{was passing}} East 90th Street, a fire {{started in the}} Lamp Room in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. It was fueled by the straw, oily <b>rags,</b> <b>and</b> lamp oil strewn around the room. The first notice of a fire was at 10:00am; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier, but was not believed.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known means by which the cunning folk opposed {{witchcraft}} was through the use of witch bottles; ceramic bottles containing such items as urine, nails, hair and nail clippings which it was believed, when put together, would cause harm to the malevolent witch. Another commonly used method was to take the heart of an animal, and to pierce it with pins, in order to do harm to the witch, whilst other cunning folk preferred to make dolls of the witch out of <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> other materials and then pierce them with pins, again with the intention of inflicting physical harm on the witch, and breaking their bewitchment.|$|E
25|$|Charles Thomas Payne is Madelyn Dunham's {{younger brother}} and Obama's great-uncle. He {{was born in}} 1925. Payne served during World War II in the U.S. Army 89th Infantry Division. Obama has often {{described}} Payne's role in liberating the Ohrdruf forced labor camp. There was brief media attention when Obama mistakenly identified the camp as Auschwitz during the campaign. In 2009, Payne spoke about his war experience: Ohrdruf was in that string of towns going across, south of Gotha and Erfurt. Our division {{was the first one}} in there. When we arrived there were no German soldiers anywhere around that I knew about. There was no fighting against the Germans, no camp guards. The whole area was overrun by people from the camp dressed in the most pitiful <b>rags,</b> <b>and</b> most of them were in a bad state of starvation.|$|E

25|$|Papermaking is {{traced back}} to China about 105 CE, when Cai Lun, an {{official}} attached to the Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE), created {{a sheet of paper}} using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, old <b>rags,</b> <b>and</b> hemp waste. Paper with legible Chinese writings on it dating from 8 BCE, while hempen paper had been used in China for wrapping and padding since the eighth century BCE. Paper used as a writing medium became widespread by the 3rd century and, by the 6th century, toilet paper was starting to be used in China as well. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavour of tea, while the later Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) was the first government to issue paper-printed money.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, on a {{scorching}} {{hot summer}} night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> he tells an amazing story. Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: traversing treacherous mountains, finding the Kafirs, mustering an army, taking over villages, and dreaming {{of building a}} unified nation and even an empire. The Kafirs (pagans, not Muslims) were impressed by the rifles and Dravot's lack of fear of their idols, and acclaimed him as a god, the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great. They show a whiter complexion than others of the area ("so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends") implying their ancient lineage to Alexander himself. The Kafirs practised a form of Masonic ritual, and Dravot's reputation was further cemented when he showed knowledge of Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{adaptation}} of the play originated in the later years of the sixteenth century. In 1620, a German publication entitled Englische Comedien und Tragedien contained a play called Eine sehr klägliche Tragaedia von Tito Andronico und der hoffertigen Käyserin darinnen denckwürdige actiones zubefinden (A most lamentable tragedy of Titus Andronicus and the haughty empress, wherein are found memorable events). Transcribed by Frederick Menius, the play was a version of Titus performed by Robert Browne and John Greene's group of travelling players. The overriding plot of Tito Andronico is identical to Titus, but all the character names are different, {{with the exception of}} Titus himself. Written in prose, the play does not feature the fly killing scene (3.2), Bassianus does not oppose Saturninus for the throne, Alarbus is absent, Quintus and Mutius are only seen after their death, many of the classical and mythological allusions have been removed; stage directions are much more elaborate, for example, in the banquet scene, Titus is described as wearing blood soaked <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> carrying a butcher knife dripping with blood.|$|E

25|$|Although {{many of his}} {{original}} LP albums are still unissued on CD, Travis' posthumous discography continues to grow, {{due in large part}} to the efforts of independent labels. A live concert album Merle Travis in Boston 1959 released by Rounder Records in 1993 documents Travis' singing and guitar work still at its peak. A major retrospective of Travis' work and career (Guitar <b>Rags</b> <b>and</b> a Too Fast Past, five CDs with an 80-page booklet authored by Rich Kienzle, who interviewed many of Travis's contemporaries) was produced by Bear Family Records in 1994, and includes much previously unreleased material. The Country Routes label has issued several transcriptions of his radio broadcasts of the 1940s and 1950s. Several recent DVDs published by Vestapol and Bear Family have collected many of his music videos and television appearances. He was an honoree of the two-hour television special An Evening of Country Greats: A Hall of Fame Celebration in 1996, and two classic Travis performances were included in the four-part PBS television documentary American Roots Music in 2001, available in CD and DVD formats.|$|E
25|$|After the sorting of {{materials}} is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, {{in the creation}} of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, Marina of the Zabbaleen, PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, {{is one of the most}} highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re-sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from <b>rags</b> <b>and</b> paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.|$|E
25|$|Second, the Zabbaleen are {{the group}} that {{actually}} collects the garbage on donkey-pulled carts, separate out recyclables, breed pigs, {{an important component of}} their recycling system, and engage in a highly efficient process of recycling, whereas the Wahiya do not. The Zabbaleen also sell the sorted secondary materials such as paper, tin, glass, plastic materials, <b>rags,</b> <b>and</b> aluminum cans to intermediaries. Because Cairenes are generally not aware of the distinction between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the informal economy of collecting Cairo’s municipal solid waste (MSW). In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize the refuse collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989. Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time. The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades.|$|E
