5|$|Aside from Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, master gunnery {{sergeant}} (MGySgt) and {{sergeant major}} {{are the highest}} enlisted <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marine Corps; however, there are far fewer master gunnery sergeants than sergeants major. One of the major {{differences between the two}} E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E
5|$|Born in Illinois, Dean {{attended}} the University of California at Berkeley before graduating with a commission in the US Army through the Reserve Officer's Training Corps (ROTC) in 1921. Slowly rising up the <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inter-war years, Dean worked a desk job in Washington D.C. {{for much of}} World War II before being transferred to the 44th Infantry Division which he later commanded during {{the final days of}} the war, and was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E

5|$|Conroy {{was born}} in Wales to Anglo-Irish parents. In 1817, after holding several <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army, he became the equerry of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. Edward died two years later, leaving a widow and infant daughter. Holding the {{position}} of comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household for the next nineteen years, Conroy also acted as her confidant and political agent, among other roles. Together, they designed the Kensington System, an elaborate and strict system of rules for the upbringing of young Victoria, designed to render her weak-willed and utterly dependent upon them {{in the hope of}} allowing them one day to wield power through her.|$|E
5|$|Former Waffen-SS men {{who wished}} to join the Bundeswehr still faced {{heightened}} scrutiny. All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved only for those with the higher <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wehrmacht.

As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} and tapu (sacred matters) in the Cook Islands {{was controlled by}} ariki (high chiefs), with typically between three and six per island. Each ariki was a ruler of an ivi or ngati (tribe). Lesser noble <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social hierarchy were the mataiapo and rangatira (minor chiefs). The chief's control, which could neither be gained or lost, was established by his mana (power), which derived from his birth, achievements and status. However, an ariki with declining popularity could be perceived to be lacking in mana, which {{might lead to a}} loss of social control.|$|E

5|$|The 1914 British cavalry {{regiment}} {{was composed}} of twenty-six officers and 523 other ranks. The commanding officer was a lieutenant colonel, with a major as the second in command; other officers in the headquarters were an adjutant, quartermaster, signals officer, medical officer, and a veterinary officer. The other ranks included one warrant officer, thirty-seven senior non commissioned officers, twenty-two artificers, six trumpeters, and 457 privates, or twenty-seven officers and 598 other <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regiments based in India.|$|E
5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a week when the volunteers were first issued <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E
5|$|The key {{activities}} of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification (taxonomy) and naming (nomenclature). The rules associated with naming plants are {{separate from the}} methods, principles or purposes of classification, except that the units of classification, the taxa, are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks – like species within genera, and genera within families. There are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code, the cultivar and the Group and the grex, but they are only loosely equivalent to <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Botanical Code.|$|E

5|$|With Otto Graham {{and most}} of the other {{original}} Browns in retirement, by 1957 the team was struggling to replenish its <b>ranks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first round of that year's draft, Cleveland took fullback Jim Brown out of Syracuse University. In his first season, Brown led the NFL with 942yards of rushing and was voted rookie of the year in a United Press poll. Cleveland finished 9–2–1 and again advanced to the championship game against Detroit. The Lions dominated the game, forcing six turnovers and allowing only 112yards passing in a 59–14 rout.|$|E
5|$|By 1909, {{the bulk}} of the castle was {{considered}} obsolete and the War Office transferred it to the Office of Works, who carried out restoration work and opened it to visitors. It reentered service during the First World War, equipped with two quick-firing guns to protect the harbour, but they did not see service during the conflict. After the war, the castle was restored and leased to the town, who again opened it to visitors. Between 1940 and 1943, during the Second World War, it was rearmed with two 4.7-inch (11.9 cm) quick-firing guns, dating from the First World War and housed in concrete gun houses, to protect merchant convoys and the Philips' shipyard. The castle was manned by members of the British Army; officers lived in a nearby cottage, non-commissioned officers in the castle itself, and other <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century fortifications, and later in temporary Nissen huts.|$|E

5|$|Hispanics in the United States Navy {{can trace}} their {{tradition}} of naval military service to {{men such as}} Lieutenant Jordi Farragut Mesquida, {{who served in the}} American Revolution. Hispanics, such as Seaman Philip Bazaar and Seaman John Ortega, have distinguished themselves in combat and have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration of the United States. Hispanics have also reached the top ranks of the Navy, serving their country in sensitive leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. Among those who have reached the highest <b>ranks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy are Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy, of Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jewish descent, who participated in the War of 1812 as an assistant Sailing master; Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, for whom the rank of Admiral in the U.S. Navy was created during the American Civil War; and Admiral Horacio Rivero, who led the Navy during the Cuban Missile Crisis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 28 November, the PVA 80th Division {{attacked}} again with four regiments. At the inlet, the Chinese assault became a disaster as communications broke down while devastating fire from the anti-aircraft (AA) guns attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion swept the Chinese <b>ranks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the fighting, the PVA 238th and the 239th Regiment together had less than 600 soldiers. The attacks by PVA 240th Regiment, on the other hand, forced Maclean to order a retreat from the northern hills towards the inlet. On 29 November, the 1st Battalion managed {{to break through the}} Chinese blockade and reached the inlet, but Maclean disappeared as he mistook some Chinese soldiers as American. The Chinese finally stopped their attacks on {{the night of}} 29 November while waiting for fresh reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{evidence}} on auxiliary centuriones and decuriones {{is that such}} officers could be directly commissioned as well as promoted from the ranks. Many appear {{to have come from}} provincial aristocracies. Those rising from the ranks could be promotions from the legions {{as well as from the}} regiment's own <b>ranks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Julio-Claudian period auxiliary centuriones and decuriones were a roughly equal split between citizens and peregrini, though later citizens became predominant due to the spread of citizenship among military families. Because centuriones and decuriones often rose from the ranks, they have often been compared to warrant officers such as sergeants-major in modern armies. However, centurions' social role was much wider than a modern warrant-officer. In addition to their military duties, centurions performed a wide range of administrative tasks, which was necessary in the absence of an adequate bureaucracy to support provincial governors. They were also relatively wealthy, due to their high salaries (see table above). However, most of the surviving evidence concerns legionary centurions and it is uncertain whether their auxiliary counterparts shared their high status and non-military role.|$|E
