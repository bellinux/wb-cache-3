Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game.

But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the tour}} {{represented}} a {{changing of the guard}} in Australian cricket. In their late 30s, Johnson and Miller retired from first-class cricket. In the 1956–57 season, Lindwall took 27 wickets at 23.74 and made 243 runs at 27.00. Having had a successful series in the most recent international fixtures, Lindwall had no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> anything but a continuation of his senior role in the team. Furthermore, having captained the team in the absence of Johnson and Miller, Lindwall was the now the player with the most seniority in terms of leadership. However, when the team for the 1957–58 South African tour was announced, Lindwall's name was omitted altogether. Lindwall heard the news on the radio while he was working, having not being given prior notice. After three consecutive Ashes defeats during Australia's decline in the mid-1950s, the selectors had turned to a radical youth policy in an attempt to reverse the slide. Ian Craig was made youngest Australia's captain at the age of 22, having played only six Tests without securing a regular place in the team. The pacemen selected were Davidson, Ian Meckiff, Ron Gaunt and John Drennan. Davidson had managed only 16 wickets at 34.06 in 12 Tests, while the remaining three had yet to play a Test. While Craig's men defeated South Africa 3–0, Lindwall continued his consistent performances for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield, with 26 wickets at 25.77 and 274 runs at 34.25. During the seasons, Lindwall broke Ernie Jones' record of 209 wickets in Shield competitions in his 54th match in the competition.|$|E

25|$|An eight-game unbeaten streak {{came to a}} gut-wrenching end in Philadelphia. Despite {{playing an}} {{unfamiliar}} midfield that included Markus Halsti and Miguel Aguilar getting their first starts ever for United, and Michael Farfan in his second start, United seemed headed to an earning a point with a scoreless draw against the Philadelphia Union. After using all three substitutions, United was suddenly shorthanded in the game's final minutes, when Silva left the match because of a hamstring injury. In the 3rd minute of stoppage time, Zach Pfeffer got the winning goal for the Union. Traveling to Foxboro the next weekend to play the New England Revolution, United seemed headed to a dispiriting second straight loss, trailing 1-0 at halftime. When two players were shown red cards {{early in the second}} half, there was <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> United to rally and take the 3 points. Nonetheless, the team struggled to generate good chances. Desperate to find the tying goal, Coach Olsen even turned to a new player, Facundo Coria, who had been signed only the week before. Coria reward the move, sending a pass to Kemp in the left corner, and Kemp's cross found the foot of the streaking Arrieta, who scored the equalizing goal in a 1–1 draw that kept United on top of the Eastern Conference. United finished a hugely challenging road trip, playing the 3rd straight road game over an 8-day span, against the Portland Timbers. Because of injuries and tired legs, Olsen rolled out a decidedly second-choice lineup that featured a midfield consisting of Halsti, Aguilar, Jared Jeffrey and Luke Mishu. These players had a combined two starts in prior matches. Jeffrey was making only his second appearance in 2015 for United, and Mishu was not only starting for the first time, but making his first ever appearance in an MLS match. The makeshift lineup played surprisingly well, especially in the second half, but an early turnover by Kemp led to the game's only goal, as United left Portland empty-handed, with a 1–0 loss.|$|E
