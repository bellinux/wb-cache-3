40|$|<b>Reinforcement</b> {{rate and}} {{differential}} <b>reinforcement</b> of IRTs were independently manipulated {{to assess their}} relative contribution to the control of interresponse times (IRTs).

In the absence of differential IRT <b>reinforcement,</b> mean IRT decreased with increasing <b>reinforcement</b> rate.

40|$|In {{everyday}} decision making, {{people often}} face decisions with outcomes that differ on multiple dimensions. The tradeoff in preferences between magnitude of <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and probability of <b>reinforcement</b> {{is a fundamental}} concern in the decision making literature. Yet, the relative impacts of probability of <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and magnitude of <b>reinforcement</b> have not been studied together even though researchers have been advocating for the combined study of these variables for decades. The proposed project was designed to determine the relative impacts of magnitude of <b>reinforcement</b> and probability of <b>reinforcement</b> {{when they were both}} increasing over a 10 s delay to maximum charge. A first-person shooter video game was adapted for the study of choice when outcome magnitude and probability of <b>reinforcement</b> were increasing either simultaneously (Experiment 1) or separately (Experiment 2) over a 10 s delay. Experiment 1 showed that participants waited longer to ensure a greater probability of <b>reinforcement</b> than to ensure a greater magnitude of <b>reinforcement.</b> The results of Experiment 2 indicated that probability of <b>reinforcement</b> had a stronger impact on behavior than magnitude of <b>reinforcement</b> when they were increasing separately.
