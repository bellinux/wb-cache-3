40|$|Abstract—Actuators {{that are}} powered, imaged, and {{controlled}} by magnetic resonance (MR) scanners could inexpensively pro-vide wireless control of MR-guided robots. Similar to traditional electric motors, the MR scanner acts as the stator and generates propulsive torques on an actuator rotor containing one or more ferrous particles. Generating maximum motor torque while avoid-ing instabilities and slippage requires closed-loop control of the electromagnetic field gradients, i. e., commutation. Accurately esti-mating {{the position and velocity}} of the rotor is essential for high-speed control, which is a challenge due to the low refresh rate and high latency associated with MR signal acquisition. This paper proposes and demonstrates a method for closed-loop commutation based on interleaving pulse sequences for rotor imaging and rotor propulsion.

However, inadequate accuracy in diagnosing incipient broken rotor bars (BRB) has motivated many studies into improving this method.

As the MSB-SE has a good performance of noise suppression, the new estimator produces more accurate results in predicting the number of BRB, compared with conventional power spectrum analysis.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} an experimental, speed sensorless, AC {{variable speed}} drive is developed from works presented by previous researchers and the performance and stability of the drive is analysed. The experimental drive consists of a simple control algorithm that can be implemented on low cost systems and provides a performance that is superior to standard constant V/f drives. There {{has been a great}} deal of research into AC {{variable speed drive}}s and many different speed control schemes have been developed which range in complexity, performance and cost. Open-loop scalar control techniques are generally the least expensive to implement as no motor speed sensor is required. These techniques are likely to prevail in applications where instantaneous speed and position control of induction motors is not critical. Such applications may include pumps, fans and conveyors. The experimental drive analysed in this dissertation is an open loop scalar control scheme. It utilises field orientation to control the stator voltage in the synchronously rotating frame and employs constant V/f control for basic voltage regulation. Compensation for stator resistance voltage drop and <b>rotor</b> <b>slip</b> are also employed to improve the dynamic performance and to reduce the steady state speed error...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring faults, severe {{inrush current}} of {{magnitude}} 2 – 5 times reaches DFIG stator and rotor terminals damaging its windings. Many control schemes are developed to limit to these inrush currents to 2 times but face issues like over speeding of generator, dc voltage fluctuations etc. To overcome {{the issues and}} limit the current within 2 times for faults, enhanced field oriented control technique (EFOC) was implemented in the Rotor Side Control (RSC) of DFIG converter. This technique can control oscillations in torque, speed and flux components of DFIG during and after faults. New equations and generator converter control schemes are proposed. This converter topology uses a super capacitor energy storage system (SCESS) in parallel to a normal capacitor for additional reactive power support to further to improve performance of DFIG during the faults. The SCESS helps in maintaining nearly constant voltage profile across the dc link capacitor. In EFOC technique, the reference value of rotor flux changes its value of super-synchronous slip speed to a small value of zero during the fault with the injecting rotor current at the <b>rotor</b> <b>slip</b> frequency during normal operation. In this process dc-offset component of flux is controlled for decomposition during faults. The system performance with symmetrical and asymmetrical fault is analyzed using simulation studies...|$|E

40|$|Doubly fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) {{is a better}} alternative to increased power demand. Modern grid regulations force DFIG to operate without losing synchronism during overvoltages called high voltage ride through (HVRT) during grid faults. Enhanced field oriented control technique (EFOC) was proposed in Rotor Side Control of DFIG converter to improve power flow transfer and to improve dynamic and transient stability. Further electromagnetic oscillations are damped, improved voltage mitigation and limit surge currents for sustained operation of DFIG during voltage swells. The proposed strategy has advantages such as improved reactive power control, better damping of electromagnetic torque oscillations, and improved continuity of voltage and current from stator and rotor to grid during disturbance. In EFOC technique, rotor flux reference changes its value from synchronous speed to zero during fault for injecting current at the <b>rotor</b> <b>slip</b> frequency. In this process, DC-Offset component of stator flux is controlled so that decomposition during overvoltage faults can be minimized. The offset decomposition of flux will be oscillatory in a conventional FOC, whereas in EFOC it is aimed to be quick damping.

30|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} wind power into power systems has brought tremendous challenges to system {{operation and maintenance}} especially {{in the sense that}} power system stability analysis and control seem to be largely dependent on the reliability of wind farm models. If the modeling issue is not treated felicitously, relevant misleading analysis and control measures may improperly hamper the absorption of large scale wind power [1, 2, 3, 4]. For the past few decades, several kinds of wind farm models have been established to study those problems such as security and economic operation [5], subsynchronous resonance [6], operational outage [7], etc. The research communities have made various efforts, mainly involving two categories of approaches, to cope with the modeling issue. Some researchers attempt to classify and cluster the wind turbine generators (WTGs) based on some dynamic parameters or response characteristics in a large wind farm [8, 9, 10]. However, the effectiveness of those clustering criterions including input wind speed, <b>rotor</b> <b>slip</b> and rotor current are difficult to be theoretically verified. The others make the whole wind farm equivalent to a single wind generator, which focus primarily on the whole wind farm’s response behaviors, yet omitting the complex location information and electrical connections [11, 12, 13]. However, both kinds of approaches attempting to meet the parameter identification requirements establish reduced-order and simplified wind farm models at the cost of deteriorating some control effects and dynamic responses [14, 15].|$|E
40|$|The modern grid rules forces DFIG to {{withstand}} and operate during single {{as well as}} multiple low voltage grid faults. The system must not lose synchronism during any type of fault for a given time period. This withstanding capacity is called {{low voltage ride through}} (LVRT). To improve performance during LVRT, enhanced field oriented control (EFOC) method is adopted in rotor side converter. This method helps in improving power transfer capability during steady state and better dynamic and transient stability during abnormal conditions. In this technique, rotor flux reference change from synchronous speed to some smaller speed or zero during the fault for injecting current at the <b>rotor</b> <b>slip</b> frequency. In this process, DC-Offset component of flux is controlled beyond decomposing to a lower value during faults and maintaining it. This offset decomposition of flux will be oscillatory in conventional FOC, whereas in EFOC with internal model controller, flux can damp quickly not only for single fault but during multiple faults. This strategy can regulate stator and rotor current waveform to sinusoidal without distortion during and after fault. It has better damped torque oscillations, control in rotor speed and generator flux during and after fault. The fluctuations in DC bus voltage across capacitor are also controlled using proposed EFOC technique. The system performance with under-voltage grid fault of 30 % and 60 % of the rated voltage occurring at the point of common coupling during 1 to 1. 25 and another fault between 1. 6 to 1. 85 seconds are analyzed using simulation studies...|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{machines}} {{are subject to}} different types of failures. Early detection of the incipient faults and fast maintenance may prevent costly consequences. Fault diagnosis of wind turbine is especially important because they are situated at extremely high towers and therefore inaccessible. For offshore plants, bad weather can prevent any repair actions for several weeks. In {{some of the new}} wind turbines synchronous generators are used and directly connected to the grid without the need of power converters. Despite intensive research efforts directed at rotor fault diagnosis in induction machines, the research work pertinent to damper winding failure of synchronous machines is very limited. This dissertation is concerned with the in-depth study of damper winding failure and its traceable symptoms in different machine signals and parameters. First, a model of a synchronous machine with damper winding based on the winding function approach is presented. Next, simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed. A specially designed inside-out synchronous machine with a damper winding is employed for the experimental setup. Finally, a novel analytical method is developed to predict the behavior of the left sideband amplitude for different numbers and locations of the broken bars. This analysis is based on the magnetic field theory and the unbalanced multiphase circuits. It is found that due to the asymmetrical structure of damper winding, the left sideband component in the stator current spectrum of the synchronous machine during steady state asynchronous operation is not {{similar to that of the}} induction machine with broken bars. As a result, the motor current signature analysis (MCSA) for detection rotor failures in the induction machine is usable to detect broken damper bars in synchronous machines. However, a novel intelligent-systems based approach is developed that can identify the severity of the damper winding failure. This approach potentially can be used in a non-invasive condition monitoring system to monitor the deterioration of a synchronous motor damper winding as the number of broken bars increase over time. Some other informative features such as speed spectrum, transient time, torque-speed curve and <b>rotor</b> <b>slip</b> are also found for damper winding diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Being the workhorse, {{induction}} motors {{are serving}} the industry. Mostly {{we can see}} squirrel cage motors, but when it's come to the large industries, wound rotor induction motors are also there. Applications like Mills, Large Fans, Pumps, Blowers, Crushers and Overhead Cranes which require higher starting torques use wound rotor induction motors {{to have a higher}} starting torque at a lower starting current at the stator. Generally wound rotor induction motors require more maintenance than squirrel cage motors because of its <b>rotor</b> construction, <b>slip</b> ring assembly and the starting method used. Conventionally, wound rotor motors use an external resistor bank, which is connected to the <b>rotor</b> winding via <b>slip</b> rings, and external rotor resistance varies from a maximum value to zero as the rotor speed develops. Varying the external resistance can be achieved by several electromechanical methods. This is done in a stepwise manner with a motorized camshaft with electromechanical contact points or with a set of electrical power contactors and timers having a suitable time delay between adjacent steps. The traditional starter is highly mechanical and can cause lot of startup delays and is bulkier and requires frequent maintenance. To ensure right operation of rotor resistance control, the motor control circuit incorporates several additional measures and these are too prone to failures due to their own nature. Due to high heat dissipation in the resistors the number of consecutive startups during a short time period is also limited. The proposed power electronic starter is entirely a power electronic device, which is having a three-phase rectifier bridge and a programmable transistor chopper. Programmable transistor chopper ensures a gradual speed development at rotor and control the acceleration with the duty factor of the transistor. This could eliminate the major disadvantage of traditional starter, which is the dependability of rotor speed with the load torque by extending it to have a closed loop speed control. Thereby we can ensure the programmable torque-speed characteristics with this power electronic starter. This power electronic development will minimize the overall maintenance, and avoid current fluctuations completely during speed changes while demanding speed up or down at the rotor. This report discusses the proposal, simulations in prone to the construction, hardware design and practical implementation and testing of starter with a no load wound rotor motor. Latter part of the report shows the performances of new starter over the conventional starter and future developments possible...|$|R
