5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal <b>remedies</b> {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other <b>remedies,</b> the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E

40|$|A {{monetary}} <b>remedy</b> that {{is measured}} {{according to the}} gain to the defendant, {{rather than to the}} loss to the plaintiff, is being increasingly sought.

This article questions the need for this new form of common law damages. The article examines the ability of the law to respond to the desire to award victims of common law wrongs a gain-based <b>remedy</b> and investigates whether, as a matter of principle, the equitable <b>remedy</b> of an account of profits should be available, in appropriate cases, to victims of common law wrongs. The choice between restitutionary damages and an account of profits is not one between meaningless labels. Rather, the doctrinal basis for the <b>remedy</b> will inform and provide the appropriate framework for the debate as to the circumstances in which the <b>remedy</b> should be available. It will determine whether the <b>remedy</b> is discretionary and subject to the usual equitable defences. It may also impact upon the extent of the <b>remedy</b> when awarded, and have a number of practical consequences. Sam Doyle and David Wrigh...|$|R

5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal <b>remedies</b> and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal <b>remedies.</b> Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E
