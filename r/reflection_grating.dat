40|$|In {{this work}} we present an {{analysis}} of non-slanted <b>reflection</b> <b>gratings</b> by using a corrected Coupled Wave Theory which takes into account boundary conditions. It {{is well known that}} Kogelnik's Coupled Wave Theory predicts with great accuracy the response of the efficiency of the zero and first order for volume phase <b>gratings,</b> for both <b>reflection</b> and transmission <b>gratings.</b> Nonetheless, since this theory disregard the second derivatives in the coupled wave equations derived from Maxwell equations, it doesn't account for boundary conditions. Moreover only two orders are supposed, so when either the thickness is low or when high refractive index high are recorded in the element Kogelnik's Theory deviates from the expected results. In Addition, for non-slanted <b>reflection</b> <b>gratings,</b> the natural reflected wave superimpose the reflection order predicted by Coupled Wave theories, so the reflectance cannot be obtained by the classical expression of Kogelnik's Theory for <b>reflection</b> <b>gratings.</b> In this work we correct Kogelnik's Coupled Wave Theory to take into account these issues, the results are compared to those obtained by a Matrix Method, showing good agreement between both theories.

5000|$|The <b>Reflection</b> <b>Grating</b> Arrays are {{attached}} {{to two of the}} primary telescopes. They allow approximately 50% of the incoming X-rays to pass unperturbed to the EPIC system, while redirecting the other 50% onto the Focal Plane Cameras. Each RGA was designed to contain 182 identical gratings, though a fabrication error left one with only 181. Because the telescope mirrors have already focused the X-rays to converge at the focal point, each grating has the same angle of incidence, and as with the Focal Plane Cameras, each grating array conforms to a Rowland circle. This configuration minimises focal aberrations. Each 10 xx 20 cm grating is composed of 1 mm thick silicon carbide substrate covered with a [...] gold film, and is supported by five beryllium stiffeners. The gratings contain a large number of grooves, which actually perform the X-ray deflection; each grating contains an average of 646 grooves per millimetre.

40|$|In this study, we {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} light-trapping effect of plasmonic <b>reflection</b> <b>grating</b> back contacts in prototype {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} thin-film solar cells in substrate configuration. The plasmonic <b>reflection</b> <b>grating</b> back contacts consist of periodically arranged Ag nanostructures on flat Ag reflectors. By varying the geometrical parameters of these back contacts, design strategies for optimized light trapping are identified. First, a general correlation between a reduction of {{the period of the}} plasmonic <b>reflection</b> <b>grating</b> back contact and an increase of the absorptance as well as external quantum efficiency is found for various unit cells of the nanostructures i. e. square unit cell, hexagonal unit cell and face-centered unit cell. Second, the width of the nanostructures is varied. With increasing width, an enhanced light-trapping effect of the thin-film solar cells is found independent of the period. As a result, an optimized design for improved light trapping in the studied thin-film solar cells is a combination of a period of 600 nm and a structure width of 350 nm. Solar cells fabricated on plasmonic <b>reflection</b> <b>grating</b> back contacts with this optimized configuration yield enhanced power conversion efficiencies as compared to reference solar cells processed on state-of-the-art randomly textured substrates. In detail, the power conversion efficiency is enhanced by around 0. 2 % from 9. 1 % to 9. 3 %.

This pre-master has been tested for diffraction efficiency at the BESSY II synchrotron light facility and diffracts up to 55 % of incident light into usable spectral orders. Furthermore, tests of spectral resolving power show that these gratings are capable of obtaining resolutions well above 1300 (λ/Δλ) with limitations due to the test apparatus, not the gratings.
