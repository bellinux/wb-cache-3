25|$|For the facelifted {{version that}} debuted at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, Toyota worked to better {{differentiate}} the styling of the hybrid {{away from the}} rest of the Camry range. This was achieved by fitting a distinct front fascia with a large, central air dam, vertically slotted fog lamps, and a single-blade grille. From the rear, the tail lamps abstain from the primarily <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> inserts fitted previously, to predominantly clear lenses, while the interior receives a newly designed fuel economy gauge. The design registrations for the facelifted Camry Hybrid, noting changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only real}} {{advantage}} to these {{is that they}} are often omnidirectional, a quality useful in running lights which must be visible through a very wide arc. [...] Newer LED lights have this feature, removing even this final advantage. [...] Energizer once made a 2.4W halogen rear lamp, which was essentially a headlamp with a <b>red</b> <b>lens,</b> but most rear lights only need to be around 0.5W.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 model {{eliminated}} {{the front door}} vent windows, had a slight grille and taillight revision, moved the ignition key from the dashboard to the steering column (which locked the steering wheel when the key was removed, a federal requirement installed one year ahead of schedule), and the gauge faces changed from steel blue to black. In addition, the rear quarter-panel mounted side marker lamps changed from a <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> shaped like the Pontiac [...] "arrowhead" [...] emblem to one shaped like the broad GTO badge. Front outboard headrests were made standard equipment on all GTOs built after January 1, 1969.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, the PRR experimented {{installing}} <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> in {{the horizontal}} {{position of the}} upper head to help increase the at distance visibility of absolute Stop signals at Overbrook interlocking. Under the Penn Central and later Conrail it became standard practice to add these <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> to high position lights and even some pedestal signals. The Norfolk and Western modified its signals to use <b>red</b> and green <b>lenses</b> in the upper head Stop and Clear positions and yellow lenses everywhere else. In the 1980s Amtrak modified most of its former-PRR position lights to use the equivalent color light colors {{in all of the}} positions of both heads. Internally referred to as position color lights, these are {{not to be confused with}} color position lights described below, which while functionally similar are structurally considerably different.|$|R
5000|$|In the new [...] "Rom" [...] {{series by}} IDW, his energy Analyzer is {{represented}} as two <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> mounted on his arms. The arms transform {{to reveal the}} lenses, which emit a red light when in operation.|$|R
50|$|Luminous marked cards - These {{can only}} be read by using special gimmicked {{sunglasses}} or by wearing contact lenses. The original luminous systems used <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> and greenish ink {{on the back of}} red cards. New luminous technology, called Ultra-Luminous, uses more sophisticated techniques that are based upon chemical and optical scientific principles different from the original luminous systems.|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail light panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E

50|$|In 1898, an {{auxiliary}} light {{was added to}} the tower. The assembly, manufactured by Chance Brothers, consisted of a two-wick lamp with a <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> that produced a red warning light to illuminate the hazardous Hebe Reef. The assembly is positioned such that the light shines from a window just above the midsection of the tower, about 6 m below the main light.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} functional and perceived benefits of wearing coloured lenses by patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Method: Ten subjects with early ARMD and five elderly controls wore a selection of NoIR wrap-around coloured lenses (yellow 29. 7 % light transmission, orange 22. 9 %, red 16. 8 % and grey 10. 3 %), each for a duration of 7 days. Contrast sensitivity, colour vision, visual acuity, the effect of glare and peripheral sensitivity were measured for each lens and compared with a control (no lens) condition. Subjective ratings of visual performance were also scored. Results: Compared with the no filter condition, <b>red</b> and grey <b>lenses</b> reduced contrast sensitivity whereas yellow and orange lenses increased contrast sensitivity. These objective changes were supported by subjective ratings in subjects with ARMD. Grey lenses reduced the loss of contrast sensitivity usually suffered {{in the presence of}} glare, whereas visual acuity and peripheral sensitivity decreased with <b>red</b> <b>lenses.</b> Colour vision became distorted with <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> in control subjects, but was relatively unaffected by the use of coloured lenses in subjects with ARMD. Conclusions: The subjective benefit of coloured lenses appears to be due to a minor enhancement of contrast sensitivity. © 2002 The College of Optometrists...|$|R
50|$|An {{ordering}} mix-up {{meant that}} (right hand drive) NZ versions - now imported assembled from Japan - received the North American Geo tail lamp cluster with red flashing direction indicators {{rather than the}} Suzuki style cluster with amber flasher sent to Australia. Luckily for GM NZ, NZ law still allowed amber or red so the <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> remained for the entire MH series run. The equivalent Suzuki had the amber lenses.|$|R
25|$|The Matrix {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the 2003 model year {{and based on the}} Toyota Corolla platform. Relatively unchanged in 2004, a facelift for 2005 brought minor revisions to the exterior – mainly revised styling to the front fascia due to complaints of rubbing the ground on the previous incarnation and replacing the <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> on the taillamps with clear ones. Also, the center instrument panel was slightly redesigned and featured a Toyota head unit in place of the previous GM-sourced radio.|$|R

The rotating light on the right is fitted with an additional <b>red</b> <b>lens,</b> while the left light will give off unfiltered white light. At the extreme left, a siren speaker can be installed behind the grill.|$|E

50|$|At night (or in poor {{visibility}} in daytime) an oil lamp displayed a white light when the signal was at 'all clear'; when the signal arm {{moved to the}} horizontal “danger” position it brought a <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> {{in front of the}} light, so that a red light was then displayed to oncoming trains. In {{poor visibility}}, GNR regulations called for detonators to be laid if possible on the track at the home signal when this was set to danger; at stations where platelayers were available, this should also be done at the distant signals.|$|E
5000|$|From 1872, {{distant signal}} arms (see below) were {{distinguished}} {{by having a}} [...] "fishtail" [...] notch cut into the end. All signal arms were still painted red at this time. In the 1920s, the British railway companies began to colour their distant signal arms yellow to better distinguish them from the red stop signals. The <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> in distant signals were changed to yellow at the same time. The practice of using red distant arms has survived in some countries however.|$|R
5000|$|The youths {{gathered}} up stones which they called [...] "Irish confetti" [...] and [...] "took {{aim at the}} <b>red</b> <b>lenses,</b> managing to put the signal out of commission," [...] an act they performed many times. Eventually, neighborhood leaders, led by Tipp Hill alderman, John J. [...] "Huckle" [...] Ryan {{and a number of}} local businessmen persuaded the city fathers to install a green-over-red traffic signal, the only one {{of its kind in the}} U.S and it has been that way ever since.|$|R
50|$|For the 2009 model year, Civics {{sold in the}} North American market {{received}} a facelift. For the sedan exterior, the front bumper and grille were restyled and the bar above the rear license plate is chromed, while the coupe {{received a}} new front bumper and grille both reminiscent of previous Civic coupe generations. The sedan's taillights now use transparent lenses with amber bulbs for the turn signals, rather than <b>red</b> <b>lenses.</b> For the interior, the sedan's steering wheel was changed from a two-spoke design to use the coupe and Si model's three-spoke design.|$|R
50|$|The nosecap of the {{flashlight}} {{has the ability}} to be unscrewed, and a custom lens can be fitted. The flashlight contains five lens in the tailcap, consisting of two <b>red</b> <b>lens,</b> blue lens, white lens, and diffuser lens (earlier three red and no blue-green). This enabled soldiers to send signals using different colors, or to cast the light in different methods. As {{the flashlight}} could not be focused/unfocused, the diffuser lens was used to spread the light in such a fashion that it would throw out a wide glow of light, as opposed to a narrow, focused beam.|$|E
5000|$|The 1969 model {{eliminated}} {{the front door}} vent windows, had a slight grille and taillight revision, moved the ignition key from the dashboard to the steering column (which locked the steering wheel when the key was removed, a federal requirement installed one year ahead of schedule), and the gauge faces changed from steel blue to black.

5000|$|The {{correction}} is {{only about}} 1/2 + diopter on the <b>red</b> <b>lens.</b> However, some people with corrective glasses are bothered by difference in lens diopters, as one image is a slightly larger magnification than the other. Though endorsed by many 3D websites, the diopter [...] "fix" [...] effect is still somewhat controversial. Some, especially the nearsighted, find it uncomfortable. There is about a 400% improvement in acuity with a molded diopter filter, and a noticeable improvement of contrast and blackness. The American Amblyopia Foundation uses this feature in their plastic glasses for school screening of children's vision, judging the greater clarity as a significant plus factor.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} Sutphens from 2009 are noticeable by having double colored <b>red</b> led <b>lenses</b> above the headlights. Siren speakers {{are in the}} bumper. The sides of the cab have mini Whelen Freedom light bars.|$|R
50|$|Black Canary: Olivia Queen, {{daughter}} of Oliver and Dinah. Her appearance resembles {{that her mother}} used to sport, except for a headgear with a <b>red</b> vision-enhancer <b>lens</b> on her left eye, a wrist-mounted crossbow and a thigh quiver.|$|R
5000|$|The 1956 through 1958 A8 Checkers {{featured}} single headlights, 1953 Chevrolet taillights, and a thick, single-bar grille. In 1958, quad headlights became {{legal in}} the U.S., and Checkers featured the quad headlights {{from that time}} forward, along with a new egg-crate grille insert. Parking lights were housed in each {{far side of the}} grille insert. Taillights were also changed to the familiar vertical chrome strip housing dual <b>red</b> <b>lenses.</b> Early models also featured a single separate bumper-mounted backup light. Another change between the A8 and later models is the rear window. Originally flat in the A8 with a thicker [...] "C" [...] pillar, the rear window on later models wrapped around a thinner roof-line, affording improved all-around visibility.|$|R

As a result, his brain gains radio-like properties, able to [...] "pick up" [...] certain frequencies. He is now tuned on the [...] "frequency of evil", which enables him to [...] "hear" [...] evil thoughts and doers wherever he goes. He wears a bulletproof bodysuit, {{as well as an}} anti-gravity belt that enables him to fly, a cape with holographic camouflage-style invisibility properties and a mask with a round <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> over his left eye, which includes the ability to see/aim in the dark and fire a laser beam.|$|E

50|$|Combination Night/Day land {{navigation}} test - This {{has proven}} {{to be one of the}} more difficult events for students, as sending units fail to teach land navigation using a map and compass. Students are given a predetermined number of MGRS locations and begin testing approximately two hours prior to dawn. Flashlights, with <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> filters, may only be used for map referencing; the use of flashlight to navigate across terrain will result in an immediate dismissal from the school. Later in the course, Ranger students will be expected to conduct, and navigate, patrols at night without violating light discipline. The land navigation test instills this skill early in each student's mind, thus making the task second nature when graded patrolling begins.|$|E
25|$|For 1984, all Delta 88s {{were now}} Royale or Royale Brougham models. Styling {{highlights}} included new grille inserts {{and red and}} amber taillights replacing the <b>red</b> <b>lenses.</b> At mid-year, a new Royale Brougham LS {{was added to the}} 88 line almost simultaneous to the introduction of a new and downsized 1985 front-wheel drive Ninety-Eight. With the Ninety-Eight being downsized and converted to front-drive, the Royale Brougham LS model of the 88 was now the largest and most luxurious rear-wheel drive car offered by Oldsmobile. Custom Cruiser wagons continued with the same styling changes found on other 88 models. In addition, the 1984 models (i.e., Royale Brougham LS)came equipped with heated seats. This pertains to the driver's seat, passenger's seat, and rear bench.|$|R
5000|$|Midway through 1999, the {{taillights}} {{were also}} changed. 1998 and early 1999 models had a separate amber turn signal {{along the bottom}} edge of each taillight housing. Starting in mid-1999, the extra bulbs were eliminated and the turn signals returned to the combination of stop/turn setup with <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> found in many North American cars. Although the lenses changed, the housings did not; they still had the chambers for the separate turn signals that early models had. These chambers were now empty, leaving a perfect place to install in police cars strobe tubes that would not affect brake or turn signal visibility. Non-Police Interceptors and Police Interceptors equipped with the [...] "Street Appearance Package" [...] retained the amber turn signal.|$|R
50|$|As of 2016 {{it remains}} a working light, with a focal plane of 10 m and white and <b>red</b> light <b>lenses</b> - {{depending}} on direction of approach. The Port of Cork uses the Spit Bank Lighthouse as a boundary marker for the compulsory pilotage of large vessels entering the middle harbour.|$|R
50|$|As the {{new century}} arrived, the traffic around Port Lavaca {{increased}} and in 1902, the light was given a fourth order <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> lantern as a replacement. In 1911, repairs were made to heighten and reinforce the roof. In 1935, the position of assistant keeper was abolished, and an eight-day lantern was installed permitting the keeper to live ashore. For {{the next several years}} the lighthouse braved more violent storms. Though in 1942, a large hurricane ripped off the walkway and weakened the pilings. The Coast Guard, the new owners of the lighthouse, decided to sell the light instead of repairing it. Bill Bauer and Henry Smith eventually purchased the lighthouse and planned {{to use it as a}} headquarters for their dredging business at Point Comfort.|$|E
50|$|Whilst it {{is normal}} to {{associate}} {{the presentation of}} a green light with a safe condition, this was not historically the case. In the very early days of railway signalling, the first coloured lights (associated with the turned signals above) presented a white light for 'clear' and a red light for 'danger'. Green was originally used to indicate 'caution' but fell out of use when the time interval system was discontinued. A green light subsequently replaced white for 'clear', to address concerns that a broken <b>red</b> <b>lens</b> could be taken by a driver as a false 'clear' indication. It was not until scientists at Corning Glassworks perfected a shade of yellow without any tinges of green or red that yellow became the accepted colour for 'caution'.|$|E
5000|$|The {{helicopter}} {{crew and}} the Test Unit's recon platoon cross-trained {{in a series}} of day-and-night trial and error tests. They used the emergency SE-11 signal lights and the Justrite, a three-colored high-intensity beam used to guide pilots onto aircraft carriers during night landings. The Justrite had a simple visual sight that was intended for aiming either the lower edge, bottom <b>red</b> <b>lens,</b> indicating a too-low descent; the middle green lens, indicating a perfect elevation and/or descend; and the upper, top amber lens, indicating that the pilot must increase his rate of descend so as not to overshoot the landing zone (LZ). If the pilot saw [...] "red", he were to decrease his rate of descend and immediately climb up until he was back into the [...] "green".|$|E
5000|$|Elmer Haas of the National Band & Tag Company, a major {{producer}} of rose-colored chicken eyeglasses, whose grandfather had [...] "devised wire frames for chickens in 1902", {{indicated that he}} believed the purported blood-masking effect of the rose coloring was a myth: [...] "the firm added the rose colored glasses because it indulged the chicken owners ... chickens are color blind". (In fact, chickens, like other birds, have good color vision.) The firm had added the rose-colored feature to its glasses in 1939 under the brand name [...] "Anti-Pix". [...] This variety of eyeglasses was more complicated than others because the <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> were fixed to a hinge {{at the top of}} the frame. This meant that as the hen lowered its head to feed, the lens swung out giving the hen an unobstructed view of the ground. When the hen raised her head, as she would during aggression, the lens would swing down giving the hen a red tinted perception of the environment.|$|R
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{relation}} between dark matter halo mass and the baryonic content of host galaxies, quantified via luminosity and stellar mass. Our investigation uses 154 deg 2 of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) lensing and photometric data, obtained from the CFHT Legacy Survey. We employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us to constrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. Our analysis is limited to lenses at redshifts between 0. 2 and 0. 4. We express the relationship between halo mass and baryonic observable as a power law. For the luminosity-halo mass relation we find a slope of 1. 32 +/- 0. 06 and a normalisation of 1. 19 + 0. 06 - 0. 07 x 10 ^ 13 h 70 ^- 1 Msun for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the best-fit slope is 1. 09 + 0. 20 - 0. 13 and the normalisation is 0. 18 + 0. 04 - 0. 05 x 10 ^ 13 h 70 ^- 1 Msun. Similarly, we find a best-fit slope of 1. 36 + 0. 06 - 0. 07 and a normalisation of 1. 43 + 0. 11 - 0. 08 x 10 ^ 13 h 70 ^- 1 Msun for the stellar mass-halo mass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding values are 0. 98 + 0. 08 - 0. 07 and 0. 84 + 0. 20 - 0. 16 x 10 ^ 13 h 70 ^- 1 Msun. For <b>red</b> <b>lenses,</b> the fraction which are satellites tends to decrease with luminosity and stellar mass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2 x 10 ^ 9 h 70 ^- 2 Msun. The satellite fractions are generally close to zero for blue lenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. This, together with the shallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a direct confirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in less clustered environments than red galaxies. We also find that the halo model, while matching the lensing signal around <b>red</b> <b>lenses</b> well, is prone to over-predicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses. This could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolated than assumed. [abridged...|$|R
