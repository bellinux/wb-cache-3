40|$|AbstractThe {{reflection}} and refraction pattern of elastic waves at a corrugated interface between two triclinic half-spaces is discussed. The incident wave {{is taken to}} {{be the cause of}} the interface disturbance and the reflected and refracted waves are effects. This leads to the causality requirement that the reflected and refracted waves must propagate away from the interface. Closed form expressions of {{reflection and}} transmission coefficients are derived using Rayleigh’s method of approximation. The formulae of reflection and transmission coefficients are derived in closed form for the first-order approximation of the corrugation. The analytical expressions of all the three phase velocities of qP, qSV and qSH waves have been derived. The variation of reflection and <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficients</b> with the angle of incidence and also with the corrugation parameter is shown. In this paper we have developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) Software in MATLAB which shows the variation of reflection and <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficients</b> with respect to incident angle and corrugation parameter.

A simple procedure has been presented for the calculation of all the three phase velocities of the quasi waves.

5000|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} inverse scattering problems {{is given in}} {{a long series of}} papers (see monographs, and papers,) where a summary of some of the author’s results is given. In a recent paper [...] the problem which has been open for many decades is solved: uniqueness of the solution to a non-overdetermined inverse scattering problem is proved. Exact inversion of low-frequency scattering data is given in the book. [...] A powerful method, Property C method, based on the notion of completeness of the set of products of solutions of PDE is developed and applied to many important inverse problems. In these works several problems are solved which have been open for decades. For example, the first global uniqueness theorems in geophysics and potential scattering with fixed-energy data are obtained, the first mathematically justified method for solving the 3D inverse scattering problem with noisy fixed-energy data is given, and, for the first time, stability estimates for the solution to the inverse scattering problem with noisy fixed-energy data are obtained.The first variational principle for solving inverse scattering problems which is equivalent to the inverse problems was found; this work is published as a monograph, which is an expanded version of monograph, translated into Russian in 1994. Very recently (paper [...] ) a fundamentally new uniqueness theorem is obtained: it says that a compactly supported real-valued square-integrable spherically symmetric potential is uniquely defined by any part of the fixed-energy phase shifts with the angular momenta [...] running through an arbitrary set [...] of non-negative integers such that [...] Property C is defined and proved for ordinary differential equations (ODE) and its many new applications are demonstrated. Most of the known results for one-dimensional inverse problems are obtained by using this property, and many new results. Among the classical results which are obtained by using property C for ODE are Marchenko and Borg’s uniqueness theorems concerning recovery of the potential from two spectra and from scattering data or spectral function. Inverse problems for an inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation are studied for the first time, a non-over-determined three-dimensional inverse problem of recovery of a potential from the diagonal values of the spectral function known on the boundary of a bounded domain and all real values of the spectral parameter is considered and a uniqueness theorem is proved for this problem. [...] A new approximate method for solving the inverse scattering problem with fixed energy data is given for a spherically symmetric potentials which are known for r > a but unknown for , where [...] is an arbitrary large fixed number. Numerical results are obtained by this method. Krein’s method in inverse scattering is justified and its consistency is proved. Analytical theory is given for inversion of the surface scattering data in the ground-penetrating radar problem for two functions: permittivity and conductivity of the ground, under the assumption that these functions depend on the vertical coordinate only,. A method for recovery of a quarkonium system from experimental data is developed. Inverse problem of finding point scatterers from the surface scattering data is posed and solved. For the first time uniqueness theorems are proved for three-dimensional scattering problems with non-overdetermined data. Stability of the Pompeiu property is established [...] and further results are obtained. In papers [...] and [...] a method for constructing a ”smart material” is given. It is proved that one can distribute small particles in a bounded domain so that the resulting material has the a priori chosen radiation pattern. Moreover, a method for calculating the density of these particles and their properties is developed. In paper [...] theory of scalar wave scattering by one and many small bodies of an arbitrary shape is developed for various boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, transmission). In paper [...] theory of EM (electromagnetic) wave scattering by one and many small impedance bodies of an arbitrary shape is developed.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{empirical}} studies have investigated the characteristics of terrestrial refraction. However, only few of these are concerned with short-term fluctuations of refraction influences. The aim of the present work is to analyze the short-term characteristics (amplitudes and variations at scales of minutes to hours) of terrestrial refraction in the lower atmosphere around 1. 8 m above the grass surface. We apply the known method of simultaneous reciprocal vertical angle measurements to derive time series of the <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> k as a measure for refraction. Our study uses a new setup of two pairs of total stations for parallel observations of the <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> along adjacent lines of sight. Such a controlled experiment not only allows us to determine refraction coefficients independently but also to assess measurement errors from the residuals between <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> pairs. Over five observation days {{in the summer of}} 2008, a total of 33 h of parallel observation data of the <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> were collected at sampling frequencies of 1 min. On one observation day, unique parallel observations of the <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> along three lines of sight with a total of six total stations were possible. For mostly sunny days, we found wave-like and sawtooth-like fluctuations of the <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> with amplitudes of 1 – 1. 5 at time scales of 10 – 30 min. On cloudy days, the amplitudes of fluctuations were on the order of 0. 5. Our refraction experiments show a variation range of k between − 4 and + 16 near the ground on sunny summer days. This equates to vertical temperature gradients between − 0. 5 and − 0. 1 K/m during the day and 1 – 2 K/m shortly after sunset. Cloud cover reduces the variability of k to a range of − 2 to + 5. Our results show that the frequently used Gaussian <b>refraction</b> <b>coefficient</b> of + 0. 13 is not suited for describing refraction effects in the lower atmosphere.
