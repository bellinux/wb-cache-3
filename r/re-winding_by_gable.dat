40|$|Measuring {{the success}} of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for {{adopting}} organizations is an emerging area of research. Our study complements the growing body of knowledge in this area as we attempt to extend the dimensions of success in the measurement model proposed <b>by</b> <b>Gable</b> and colleagues [20, 57, 60]. Overall, this study employed a three-phase approach to enhance its validity; however, {{in this paper we}} will focus on the findings from the major phase. In the study’s main phase, we used postal surveys in Finland and Estonia (two small Northern European countries with businesses adopting ERP systems) to obtain empirical data from 62 subjects in 44 private firms in diverse industries. Our data analysis, using criterion validity and structural equation modeling approaches, suggests that the dimensions of Workgroup Impact and Vendor/Consultant which were added to the model proposed <b>by</b> <b>Gable</b> and colleagues are relevant, and capable of offering useful insights regarding ERP systems success evaluations. The implications of the study’s results are discussed...|$|R
