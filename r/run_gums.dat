50|$|In 2014, Nick and {{his former}} coach, Sam Lapray, founded <b>Run</b> <b>Gum,</b> which markets a caffeinated chewing gum to athletes. In January 2016 <b>Run</b> <b>Gum</b> filed an {{antitrust}} lawsuit against USA Track and Field for rules that Symmonds feels suppress competition. In May, a federal judge dismissed the suit.|$|R
50|$|The {{township}} is {{in northeastern}} Franklin County, bordered {{to the northeast}} by Cumberland County and the borough of Shippensburg. The borough of Orrstown is surrounded by the northwest part of the township, but like Shippensburg is a separate municipality. The county/township boundary follows Mains <b>Run,</b> <b>Gum</b> <b>Run,</b> and Middle Spring Creek, a tributary of Conodoguinet Creek {{and part of the}} Susquehanna River watershed. A separate Southampton Township lies directly adjacent in Cumberland County.|$|R
50|$|The {{genesis of}} Arcola {{was a small}} spring next to a gum tree that fed into the south fork of Broad <b>Run,</b> {{suitably}} called <b>Gum</b> Springs. During the colonial era a distillery, kiln and small church were established at the spring.|$|R
50|$|At {{an unnamed}} {{tributary}} of Wallace <b>Run</b> downstream of <b>Gum</b> Stump, the pH {{was measured in}} 2008 to be 7.9 and 8.0 and the conductivity was 387 and 390 micro-siemens. In August 2008, the water temperature was 68 ft in the lower reaches of the creek and 63 ft two miles (three kilometers) upstream.|$|R
50|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{the borough}} of Shippensburg has a total area of , of which , or 0.18%, is water. <b>Gum</b> <b>Run</b> {{flows through the}} center of town, {{entering}} from the south and becoming Middle Spring Creek, a north-flowing tributary of Conodoguinet Creek and part of the Susquehanna River watershed. Outside the town, the area consists of mostly field and pasture, some forest, few streams and water holes.|$|R

[...] For this was ocean meant, [...] For this {{the sun was}} sent, [...] And moon was lent, [...] And winds in distant caverns pent.|$|R
2500|$|The railroad's {{operations}} {{began at}} Bellefonte, site of coal-hungry iron furnaces {{and the head}} of navigation on the Bald Eagle & Spring Creek canal. Using the tracks of the Tyrone and Lock Haven, it passed north through the narrow valley of Spring Creek to reach the Bald Eagle Valley at Milesburg. The Tyrone and Lock Haven was intended to stretch north up the valley to Lock Haven and south to Tyrone, but only a little grading had been accomplished north of Milesburg or south of Wingate, where the Bellefonte & Snow Shoe turned onto its own tracks. It followed the valley of Wallace <b>Run</b> through <b>Gum</b> Stump, and, at the forks of Wallace Run, climbed {{the side of a mountain}} by a series of switchbacks. The line continued climbing through Rhoads following the edges of the Jonathan Run and South Fork Beech Creek gorges, crossing the latter and winding through Fountain to reach Snow Shoe. The total length of the line, from Wingate to Snow Shoe, was [...] long.|$|R
50|$|Black Creek {{begins in}} Foster Township and flows {{southwest}} {{for less than}} a mile, passing though the community of Jeddo. The creek then enters Hazle Township, where it turns west and flows between two mountains, along the way passing through the community of South Ebervale. Further downstream, the creek leaves the two mountains and flows north of Hazleton, crossing Pennsylvania Route 940 and Pennsylvania Route 309, immediately after which it receives the tributary Little Black Creek. Slightly further downstream it enters West Hazleton, crossing Pennsylvania Route 93 and receiving the tributary Stony Creek, then crossing Interstate 81 in West Hazleton. Upon leaving West Hazleton, it reenters Hazle Township and continues west, soon crossing into Sugarloaf Township. Here for a few miles it flows roughly parallel to the border between Sugarloaf and Hazle townships, then turns southwest and enters Black Creek Township, passing briefly through Hazle Township. In Black Creek Township, the creek continues west, passing through communities of <b>Gum</b> <b>Run,</b> Derringer, Fern Glen and Gowen. At Gowen it turns north and flows through a water gap, with Buck Mountain to the west. On {{the other side of the}} water gap, the creek flows through Rock Glen and picks up the tributary Falls Run. Continuing north for a few miles, it picks up tributaries Barnes Run and Scotch Run, then turns northeast for slightly over a mile, reaching its confluence with Nescopeck Creek near the community of Tank.|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the low-frequency linear viscoelastic properties of polymers is a classical problem in rheometry, especially for broad molecular weight (MW), fractional melt-flow index (MFI) polyolefins with small time-temperature shift factors. By interconversion of high-temperature, low-shear steady-viscosity data in the terminal flow regime into low-frequency data using the Cox-Merz rule, the experimental window is expanded towards lower frequencies. ^ A squeeze-flow apparatus using Newton interferometry as a drift-free transducer to measure the gap between a spherical lens and a flat glass plate with high spatial resolution was constructed. Trials with a Newtonian silicone oil and a viscoelastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gum were undertaken to examine the various experimental factors that might contribute to errors in the calculation of the viscosity. After taking into account those factors during the <b>runs</b> with PDMS <b>gum,</b> the squeeze-flow-derived viscosities at the terminal flow regime (at shear rates accessible to a commercial rheometer) were in good agreement with low frequency dynamic data. To achieve much lower shear rates for the runs with polyolefins, {{an increase in the}} working gap range was made by switching from Newton interferometry to Fizeau interferometry. A hermetically sealed high vacuum chamber was built to allow high-temperature runs with polyolefins with minimal degradation. ^ Interconversion of the measured viscosities of a broad MW, 1. 04 MFI high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with the squeeze flow apparatus resulted in complex viscosity data at ∼ 10 − 5 rad/s, expanding the experimental window by 2 decades. The squeeze-flow derived complex viscosity data was used to decide which of the two popular viscosity models was more accurate in predicting the zero-shear rate viscosity based on its fit to dynamic data limited to higher frequencies. ...|$|R
