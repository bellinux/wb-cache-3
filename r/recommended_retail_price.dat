40|$|We {{consider}} vertical <b>price</b> restrictions like <b>Recommended</b> <b>Retail</b> <b>Prices</b> (RRP) and Resale Price Maintenance (RPM), {{together with}} a retailer’s unit discount when purchasing the good from the manufacturer. We study how retailer’s buyer power affects {{the nature of the}} vertical price restriction occurring in equilibrium. A bit unexpectedly, it emerges that buyer power has got a non—monotonic relation with welfare: when it is either small or very large, welfare is at its lowest level. When buyer power is at an intermediate level, society is better off. The following trade—off explains these results: on the one hand, RPM eliminates double marginalization; on the other hand, to convince the retailer to accept it, a higher unit discount must be given. Our analysis suggests that antitrust authorities should take buyer power into account when assessing welfare effects of vertical price restrictions, and should be open to deal with its non—monotonic relation with welfare.

25|$|Having {{agreed on}} {{the scope of the}} {{publication}} and the formats, the parties in a book agreement must then agree on royalty rates, the percentage of the gross retail price that will be paid to the author, and the advance payment. The publisher must estimate the potential sales in each market and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties usually range between 10–12% of <b>recommended</b> <b>retail</b> <b>price.</b> An advance is usually 1/3 of the first print run total royalties. For example, if a book has a print run of 5000 copies and will be sold at $14.95 and the author is to receive 10% royalties, the total sum payable to the author if all copies are sold is $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000).

500|$|In July 2007, {{a dispute}} arose between Harry Potters British publisher, Bloomsbury, and Asda, a British {{supermarket}} chain {{owned by the}} US corporation Wal-Mart. On 15 July, {{a week before the}} release of the final Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was [...] "holding children to ransom" [...] and that, [...] "t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a quid-ditch as they have sent their prices up north on the Hogwarts Express. By setting the <b>recommended</b> <b>retail</b> <b>price</b> at this level can only be seen [...] as blatant profiteering on their part." [...] Pritchard {{went on to say that}} Asda was acting to [...] "champion the right of young readers", and that the <b>recommended</b> <b>retail</b> <b>price</b> was [...] "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller". Asda had planned to sell the book as a loss leader at £8.87 ($16.30), or half Bloomsbury's <b>recommended</b> <b>retail</b> <b>price</b> of £17.99 ($33.00) and below the wholesale price of £9.89 ($18.00).|$|E
2500|$|At this time, {{with several}} UK auto-producers losing market share, Datsun had grabbed the {{headlines}} as the UK's leading car importer. The magazine Autocar road tested a 180B Bluebird and recorded {{a top speed}} of 101mph (162km/h) along with a 0–60mph (0 – 96km/h) time of 13.6 seconds. The Datsun's overall fuel consumption for the test was 27.7 mpg (10.2 l/100km). For all three of these performance measurements, it was marginally better than the Ford Cortina 1600 GL which continued to dominate this sector in the UK, but both cars were beaten for speed and acceleration (though not for fuel economy) by the relatively crude Morris Marina 1.8HL. It was probably more significant that the Bluebird had a manufacturer's <b>recommended</b> <b>retail</b> <b>price,</b> including sales taxes, of £2950 as against £3263 for the Ford and £3315 for the Morris.

2500|$|Ultimate's first 48K {{releases}} were Lunar Jetman - {{a sequel}} to Jetpac - and Atic Atac {{both of which were}} released in late 1983. Both [...] games were very well received by the gaming press, CRASH magazine in particular praising what Ultimate had managed to do with the extra memory Lunar Jetman utilised. In 1984 came Sabre Wulf, the first in the Sabreman series, and the first release at a <b>recommended</b> <b>retail</b> <b>price</b> of £9.95. The price of Ultimate titles had previously been just £5.50, which was typical for Spectrum arcade-style games at the time. This increase was in order to discourage piracy, with the idea being that if customers paid more for a game they would be less inclined to give away copies. This coincided with the introduction of the distinctive Ultimate [...] "big box" [...] packaging (used with all further Spectrum releases until Gunfright, and with various releases on other platforms), which the company felt might also help justify the price increase and encourage gamers to buy the game rather than copy it. The strategy paid off as Sabre Wulf went on to sell over 350,000 copies on the Spectrum alone. This was followed by the simultaneous release at the end of 1984 of the next two instalments in the Sabreman series, Underwurlde and Knight Lore. Knight Lore was something of a revolution in the home computer game market, using a forced-perspective isometric viewpoint branded Filmation, the style of which would be extensively copied in other games, notable examples being Batman and Head Over Heels from Ocean Software. Knight Lore, and some of its Filmation follow-up Alien 8, was actually completed before Sabre Wulf but Ultimate decided that it could have a potentially negative effect on sales of the comparatively primitive Sabre Wulf, so it was postponed until late 1984 for a simultaneous release with Underwurlde.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} market {{concentration}} {{has been little}} studied in markets for ambulatory care in the developing world, where the retail sector often accounts for {{a high proportion of}} treatments. This study begins to address this gap through an analysis of the consumer market for malaria treatment in rural areas of three districts in Tanzania. We developed methods for investigating market definition, sales volumes and concentration, and used these to explore the relationship between antimalarial <b>retail</b> <b>prices</b> and competition. The market was strongly geographically segmented and highly concentrated in terms of antimalarial sales. Antimalarial prices were positively associated with market concentration. High antimalarial prices were likely to be an important factor in the low proportion of care-seekers obtaining appropriate treatment. Retail sector distribution of subsidised antimalarials has been proposed to increase the coverage of effective treatment, but this analysis indicates that local market power may prevent such subsidies from being passed on to rural customers. Policymakers should consider the potential to maintain lower <b>retail</b> <b>prices</b> by decreasing concentration among antimalarial providers and <b>recommending</b> <b>retail</b> <b>price</b> levels.

50|$|A six-cylinder car was road {{tested by}} Britain's Autocar {{magazine}} in March 1975 {{at the time}} of the model's launch. It recorded a maximum speed of 104 mph (167 km/h) and reached 60 mph (97 km/h) from a standing start in 13.5 seconds.

The 2200 also fell slightly behind the Fiat 132GLS 1800 in these comparisons. At the same time its overall fuel consumption at 20.7 mpg was usefully superior to the Ford's 18.1 mpg.

40|$|Objective: To {{document}} {{the impact of}} changes to tobacco taxes on the range and price of tobacco sold during the period when the National Tobacco Campaign (NTC) was run.

50|$|The company's huge {{investment}} {{in both the}} Imp and the Linwood production plant {{was to be a}} significant part of the demise of the Rootes Group. The Imp's commercial failure added to the major losses suffered by Rootes, although the main reasons for these losses were unresolved industrial unrest and the effects of the link with the Chrysler Corporation of the USA. The link was initiated by Lord (William) Rootes in 1964 as a partnership, but he died in October of that year and by 1967 the company had been acquired by Chrysler, to become part of Chrysler Europe. A year later, ahead of the 1968 London Motor Show, the <b>recommended</b> <b>retail</b> <b>prices</b> of most Imp models were reduced for the domestic market by more than four per cent, despite the general price inflation affecting the UK. Chrysler stewardship was blamed by some for the demise of the Imp in March 1976, after fewer than 500,000 had been built, but the entire Chrysler Europe operation was not a success and two years later it became part of Peugeot. The Imp was one of Britain's longest-running production cars with a 13-year run, despite lower sales in its later years. Its place in the Chrysler UK range was taken the following year by the Chrysler Sunbeam, a three-door hatchback based on the Avenger rear-wheel drive underpinnings. Both cars continued to be produced at the Linwood plant until it closed in 1981, after just 18 years in use.|$|R
