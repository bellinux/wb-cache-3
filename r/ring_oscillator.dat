50|$|The {{stages of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator</b> are often {{differential}} stages, that are more immune to external disturbances. This renders available also non-inverting stages.

50|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator</b> is a {{distributed}} {{version of}} the delay oscillator. The <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator</b> uses an odd number of inverters to give {{the effect of a}} single inverting amplifier with a gain of greater than one. Rather than having a single delay element, each inverter contributes to the delay of the signal around the ring of inverters, hence the name <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator.</b> Adding pairs of inverters to the ring increases the total delay and thereby decreases the oscillator frequency. Changing the supply voltage changes the delay through each inverter, with higher voltages typically decreasing the delay and increasing the oscillator frequency. Vratislav describes some methods of frequency-stability and power consumption improving of the CMOS ring-oscillator.|$|E

40|$|Phase {{noise is}} one of the most {{restricted}} specifications in <b>oscillators,</b> especially <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators.</b> Phase noise will exhibit large fluctuations around its nominal value due to the increased process variation with technology scaling. These fluctuations will cause some fabricated <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators</b> not to meet the phase noise constraint and, hence, result in yield loss. This yield loss is expected to become worse especially for sub- 90 -nm technology nodes. In this paper, an analytical model for the phase noise variability in <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators</b> is proposed. The proposed model has been verified using Monte Carlo SPICE simulations for an industrial 65 -nm CMOS technology and is found in good agreement. The model shows that for the commonly used differential-pair-based <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators,</b> the main contribution in phase noise variability comes from the differential pair tail transistor. It also shows that the phase noise variability is reduced as the supply voltage increases. These results can be used to mitigate the phase noise variability and improve the yield through proper sizing of the tail transistor or higher supply voltage...|$|R

50|$|To {{understand}} {{the operation of}} a <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator,</b> one must first understand gate delay. In a physical device, no gate can switch instantaneously. In a device fabricated with MOSFETs, for example, the gate capacitance must be charged before current can flow between the source and the drain. Thus, the output of every inverter in a <b>ring</b> <b>oscillator</b> changes a finite amount of time after the input has changed. From here, it can be easily seen that adding more inverters to the chain increases the total gate delay, reducing the frequency of oscillation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany side {{channels}} including power consumption, electromagnetic emanation, optical radiation, {{and even}} sound {{have been studied}} since the first publication of a side channel attack {{at the end of}} the 1990 s. Most of these channels can be relatively easily used for an overall analysis of the cryptographic system (implementation of efficient passive attacks) or for injection of faults. Until recently, only the optical channel allowed both analysis of locally leaked information and precise injection of faults (single-bit errors). Recent works showed that the near-field electromagnetic channel enables similar results to be obtained. Like the optical channel, the near-field electromagnetic channel allows both active and passive attacks, which, in addition, can be theoretically non-invasive and contactless. However, the cost of the attack bench that is needed to exploit the near-field electromagnetic channel is less than that of an optical channel. Recently, we showed that it is possible to use the near-field electromagnetic channel to perform an efficient active attack targeting the true random number generator (TRNG) based on <b>ring</b> <b>oscillators.</b> In cryptography, TRNGs are chiefly used to generate encryption keys and other critical security parameters, so the proposed active attack could have serious consequences for the security of the whole cryptographic system.
