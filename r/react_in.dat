5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always <b>react</b> <b>in</b> ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements <b>react</b> <b>in</b> whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E
5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will <b>react</b> <b>in</b> different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
5|$|At 11:30 Sefik told Kemal {{that the}} ANZACs had a beachhead of around , {{and that he}} would attack towards Ari Burnu, in {{conjunction}} with the 19th Division. Around midday Kemal was appraised that the 9th Division was fully involved with the British landings at Cape Helles, and could not support his attack, so at 12:30 he ordered two battalions of the 77th Infantry Regiment (the third battalion was guarding Suvla Bay) to move forward between the 57th and 27th Infantry Regiments. At the same time he ordered his reserve 72nd Infantry Regiment to move further west. Within the next half-hour the 27th and 57th Infantry Regiments started the counter-attack, supported by three batteries of artillery. At 13:00 Kemal met with his corps commander Esat Pasha and convinced him of the need to <b>react</b> <b>in</b> strength to the ANZAC landings. Esat agreed and released the 72nd and 27th Infantry Regiments to Kemal's command. Kemal deployed the four regiments from north to south; 72nd, 57th, 27th and 77th. In total, Turkish strength opposing the landing numbered between ten thousand and twelve thousand men.|$|E

5|$|Miyamoto {{himself had}} {{high hopes for}} his new project. He lacked the {{technical}} skills to program it alone, so instead came up with concepts and consulted technicians {{to see if they}} were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners and <b>react</b> <b>in</b> various ways. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though he had some difficult suggestions himself, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen (eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept would appear in the aforementioned Popeye arcade game). Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.|$|E
5|$|The Invasion of Guadeloupe was a British amphibious {{operation}} fought between 28 January and 6 February 1810 {{over control of}} the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe during the Napoleonic Wars. The island was the final remaining French colony in the Americas, following the systematic invasion and capture of the others during 1809 by British forces. During the Napoleonic Wars, the French colonies had provided protected harbours for French privateers and warships, which could prey on the numerous British trade routes in the Caribbean and then return to the colonies before British warships could <b>react.</b> <b>In</b> response, the British instituted a blockade of the islands, stationing ships off every port and seizing any vessel that tried to enter or leave. With trade and communication made dangerous by the British blockade squadrons, the economies and morale of the French colonies began to collapse, and in the summer of 1808 desperate messages were sent to France requesting helping.|$|E
5|$|Whitney gets {{a job as}} a {{teaching}} assistant at Walford Primary School. During one breaktime, she warns Dennis Rickman Jnr (Harry Hickles) not to run in the playground. He ignores her and falls over, grazing his arm. Whitney does not <b>react</b> <b>in</b> the professional manner she is supposed to, causing Dennis's injury to be ignored. When Dennis's mother, Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) questions Dennis about his injury, he lies that Whitney assaulted him. Sharon complains and Whitney is suspended, but appeals for her job and is allowed to keep it. Whitney later sets her sights on newcomer Johnny Carter (Sam Strike), unaware that he is gay. Johnny's parents, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), hope that Johnny and Whitney will become an item, but his sister Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) reveals to them that he is gay. A few weeks later, Johnny comes out to Whitney, which hurts her as she feels that Johnny has been using her. They later become good friends and Whitney forgives Johnny.|$|E
