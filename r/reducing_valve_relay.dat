40|$|Steam flow is {{the main}} form for energy {{transfer}} in power plants, process industries, etc. The flow rate of the steam relates to the energy transfer amount directly. Pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> are used for flow rate control of the compressible superheated steam in these piping systems. In this paper, a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> with a novel valve core is proposed. In order to analyze the internal flow characteristics of the compressible superheated steam and the flow rate adjustment performance of the proposed pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> a numerical model of DN 80 pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> is established. Then, the flow characteristics inside are studied numerically. Meanwhile, the flow rate adjustment performance is also carried out experimentally. Compared with the numerical and experimental results, it shows an agreement {{and both of them}} are similar to linear flow rate. Furthermore, a fitting equation for the flow rate prediction is carried out for the engineering applications under different working conditions...|$|R
50|$|With {{a service}} brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{electricity}} generation from water pipelines was rare because {{the water would}} have been pumped by other engines in the system prior to the intake of water turbines to generate electricity. The energy generated from the turbines would have been offset by the power used in pumping, canceling out the power generation benefit. However, there have been renewed interests to apply this method to recover energy {{when there is a}} need to reduce pressure in the water supply system that is normally done through pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> The conduit hydro{{electricity generation}} in this case can be done by replacing the pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> with small turbines and electrical generators.|$|R

To {{assure the}} safe {{transportation}} of bulk liquid chemicals by tankers at sea, not only it is required internationally that dedicated pressure relieving devices should be installed onboard, but {{the heights of}} the pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves,</b> the activating pressure are also prescribed numerically, although these are based on experiences gained.

50|$|Without <b>relay</b> <b>valves,</b> {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> is installed near the rear service brake chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> for remote service brake application.|$|R

Elastomeric O-rings can be used as valve stem seals, and O-ring manufacturers recommend lubrication of elastomeric seals to prevent damage and to assure proper sealing. In this research, a metallic coating was applied as a lubricant using a vacuum vapor deposition process to the surface of elastomeric valve stem seals.

According to Huxley, the central nervous system's main function is to shut out the majority of what we perceive; the brain filters those perceptions which are useful for survival. Society aids in this filtering by creating a symbolic system which structures our reality and which reduces our awareness. Psychedelic experiencing has the effect of reducing the strength of the mind's <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> which allows for a broader spectrum of one's overall experience to enter into conscious experience. A person undergoing a psychedelic trip temporarily possesses a higher level of conscious awareness.|$|R

40|$|Air {{brake system}} has been widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other brake system. The practical performance of air brake system may be greatly different from if we analyze it with static theory. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} build an integrate air brake system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. However, the dynamic mathematic model of air brake system is very complicate, which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper, the components of air brake system are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components, and then build the system based on these basic standard pneumatic components. The standard pneumatic components which are built in the software-MWorks based on Modelica language include cylinder, nozzle, air reservoir, volume, and air pipe.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimal pressure management in water distribution systems through the introduction and regulation of pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> Reduction in pressure is aimed at controlling water leakages which, being in some cases {{a high proportion of}} the total volume supplied, are nowadays one of the major concerns for water utilities. The determination of the number, location, and setting of such valves is formulated as a two criteria optimization problem and is solved with multiobjective genetic algorithms. In particular, the first criterion is represented by the minimization of the number of valves, and the second is the minimization of the total leakage in the system, when maintaining the required pressure at each node. The great advantage of the multiobjective approach resides in the fact that, in one run, several trade-off alternatives are found, thus providing the set of the optimal solutions with a different level of compromise between the conflicting objectives. At the same time, data necessary for practical choice and operation of pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> may be determined...|$|R

The three examined solutions are one turbine, several helical screw expanders and several small turbines in parallel with asynchronous generators. The six absorption heat pumps have been divided into two groups; one group of four and one group of two absorption heat pumps. An investigation of locations and space in nearby switchgears has been done for each group. Contacts with retailers of the examined turbine solutions have been taken to gather technical specifications. These technical specifications have been used to simulate the electricity production and the economical yield of each type of examined solution. The investigation shows that the best solution is the solution with several small turbines with asynchronous generators. It has lower investment cost (15 [MSEK]) and the best yield. The proposed solutions will have an installed capacity of 2. 65 [MW] to a cost of 5 601 [SEK/kW]. The electric energy production will be 15. 7 [GWh/year].
