40|$|A new passive trap, {{constructed}} of <b>rigid,</b> clear <b>plastic</b> <b>panes</b> (0. 3 m by 0. 3 m), coated with an STP Oil Treatment film as an adhesive, {{was developed for}} monitoring codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), movement within and between orchard canopies. Tests showed that the trap was effective in recapturing released codling moth adults, that the adhesive was not attractive to moths, and that the adhesive was still effective after remaining on a trap for 1 wk in the field. Field experiments demonstrated that the passive pane-trap method is as efficient for catching moths as molasses-baited traps {{but that it is}} less efficient than pheromone-baited and blacklight traps placed in an orchard at equal densities. However, total capture of moths in plots treated with pane traps increased with trap density...|$|R

By measuring the mesh equality of elements, a coupling algorithm for <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> problems have been proposed based on the interface element method, which converts the FE analysis into the EFG computation to preserve the accuracy in the region where meshes have been severely distorted. Numerical example shows that the present algorithms exploit the respective advantages of both the FE method whose computational efficiency is high and the EFG method which can throws out mesh distortions and be suitable for <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> forming analysis...|$|R

During the investigation the method for the problem solution of the <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> constructions, on the base of which the use of extremal principles of the limiting resistance theory and the formulation of the dynamics problem as the corresponding problem of linear programming are laying, has been used. As a result exact (in the frameworks of the assumptions accepted) solutions of the dynamic deformation problems for <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> rectangular plates with various conditions of resting, statically optimum round plates, three-layer gently sloping shells of revolution have been obtained and analyzed for the first time. The formulation realized for problems of the dynamic deformation of <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> plates and gently sloping shells of revolution as problems of linear programming has an advantage over other possible (numerical) methods for the problem solution both from theoretical and practical points of view and may be used in the calculation practice.

Special Issue: Sixth International Congress on Industrial Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 07) and GAMM Annual Meeting, Z?rich 2007, PAMM, 2008, 7 (1), 1060603 - 1060604 Many classical rigid perfectly/plastic solutions {{cannot be}} extended to more complicated <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> materials, such as <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> hardening materials and rigid viscoplastic materials.

40|$|Copenhagen Municipality {{has with}} its plan ‘KBH 2025 Klimaplanen’ an overall target of {{becoming}} CO 2 neutral {{in the year}} of 2025. One of the means to reach this goal is to recycle all the <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> in the combustible municipal household waste. This report views this change as a transition from the current incumbent regime to an alternative and more sustainable niche regime. We find that one of the required initiatives that make this plan possible is to establish a plastic sorting facility related to the waste stream in Copenhagen. The amount of <b>rigid</b> <b>plastics</b> generated within the municipality of Copenhagen is not enough to make the investment in a full-scale plastic sorting facility feasible. For the establishment of the facility to succeed, the municipality needs to cooperate with the neighbouring municipalities and combining their amount of <b>rigid</b> <b>plastics</b> waste and instead focus on a much smaller pre-sorting facility. We find that this can be done through their already established I/S Partnerships within the combined-heat-and-power plant Amagerforbrænding. Although this requires continuous work from the municipality we believe that the establishment of a pre-sorting facility is an important step in reaching the goal in ‘KBH 2025 Klimaplanen’...|$|R
