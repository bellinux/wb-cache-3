25|$|Lastly, Nardini et al. (2010) {{recently}} hypothesised {{that young}} children have optimized their sensory appreciation for speed over accuracy. When information {{is presented in two}} forms, children may derive an estimate from the fastest available source, subsequently ignoring the alternate, even if it contains <b>redundant</b> <b>information.</b> Nardini et al. (2010) provides evidence that children's (aged 6 years) response latencies are significantly lower when stimuli are presented in multi-cue over single-cue conditions. Conversely, adults showed no change between these conditions. Indeed, adults display mandatory fusion of signals, therefore they can only ever aim for maximum accuracy. Interestingly, however, the overall mean latencies for children were not faster than adults, which suggests that speed optimization merely enable them {{to keep up with the}} mature pace. Considering the haste of real-world events, this strategy may prove necessary to counteract the general slower processing of children and maintain effective vision-action coupling. Ultimately the developing sensory system may preferentially adapt for different goals – speed and detecting sensory conflicts – those typical of objective learning.|$|E
500|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of error in DNA. DNA damage and mutation are fundamentally different. Damage results in physical abnormalities in the DNA, such as single- and double-strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired if <b>redundant</b> <b>information,</b> such as the undamaged sequence in the complementary DNA strand or in a homologous chromosome, is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented, and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. [...] Replication may also be blocked or the cell may die.|$|E

Methods. Regular arrays offer the possibility of using <b>redundant</b> visibility <b>information</b> to constrain the calibration of the array independently of a sky model and a beam model of the station elements. This requires a regular arrangement of the configuration of array elements and identical beam patterns. Results. We revised a previously developed calibration method for phased-array stations using the <b>redundant</b> visibility <b>information</b> in the system and applied it successfully to a LOFAR station. The performance and limitations of the method were demonstrated by comparing its application to real and simulated data. The main limitation is the mutual coupling between the station elements, which leads to non-identical beams and stronger baseline-dependent noise. Comparing the variance in the estimated complex gains with the Cramer-Rao Bound indicates that redundancy is a stable and optimum method for calibrating the complex gains of the system. Conclusions. Our study shows that the use of the redundant visibility does improve the quality of the calibration in phased-array systems. In addition, it provides a powerful tool obtaining system diagnostics. Our results demonstrate that designing redundancy in both the station layout and the array configuration of future aperture arrays is strongly recommended.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel appearance-based technique for qualitative spatial localization. A vocabulary of visual words is built automatically, representing local features that repeatedly {{occur in the}} set of training images. An information maximization technique is then applied to build a hierarchical classifier for each environment by learning informative visual words. Child nodes in this hierarchy encode <b>information</b> <b>redundant</b> with <b>information</b> coded by their parents. In localization, hierarchical classifiers are used in a top-down manner, where top-level visual words are examined first, and for each top-level visual word which does not respond as expected, its lower-level visual words are examined. This allows inference to recover from missing features encoded by higher-level visual words. Several experiments on a challenging localization database demonstrate the advantages of our hierarchical framework and show a significant improvement over the traditional bag-of-features approaches.
