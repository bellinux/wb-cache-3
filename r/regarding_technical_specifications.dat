Hyundai-Rotem/BMEL-India and Band Changchun Railway Vehicle Co Ltd were the only bidders, when the bids were opened in December 2013. The Chinese firm did not qualify, leaving only the Hyundai consortium in contention. The [...] 7.50 billion contract was re-tendered on 10 March 2014, and the coach width requirement was changed. The DMRC opposed re-tendering, stating that it might delay the metro's opening, by {{up to a year}} or more. It also argued that coaches supplied by Hyundai Rotem were already in use on the Delhi Metro, as well as a few other metros. According to metro officials, [...] "The delay will impact integrated trial of coaches in Aluva-Palarivattom route, initially scheduled from August 2015. With re-tendering process on, the proposed integration of coaches with tracks, third traction (sourcing power from third rail) and signal systems can be done only by 2015-end or early 2016." [...] The DMRC held a pre-bid meeting in New Delhi on 2 April 2014 to allow interested firms to seek clarifications <b>regarding</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> for the contract for the coaches.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{coordination}} among scientific and policy activities {{is an old}} debate in which respective communities have often confronted their views rather than reflecting on concrete solutions. In the last few years, however, constructive exchanges {{have taken place in}} the context of expert groups linked to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and related EU funded research projects, which have resulted in a better understanding of communication and knowledge transfer gaps. These exchanges concern not only the way research is being interfaced with water policies, but also how improved coordination could be organised <b>regarding</b> <b>technical</b> <b>specifications</b> linked to standardisation.

40|$|Objectives: To compare 5 digital {{single lens reflex}} cameras (DSLRs) for extraoral {{photography}} in the orthodontic office, to recognize the best camera and the best mode for each camera. Materials and Methods: 5 DSLRs namely Canon 500 D, Canon 550 D, Nikon D 3100, Nikon D 40 and Nikon D 5000 were compared. Images were clicked in auto mode, program mode, manual mode, macro mode and aperture priority mode. Same settings were used for all cameras. Thirteen orthodontists were asked to rank the images for quality. Data was collected and statistically analyzed using Kruskall Wallis analysis of variance. Results: Canon 500 D ranked the highest (P < 0. 001) for auto, program and macro mode, closely followed by Canon 550 D (P < 0. 001), which ranked highest for portrait mode and manual mode. Conclusion: Images by Canon 500 D and Canon 550 D were perceived better than Nikon for the chosen settings, establishing ease of use for these cameras.

The second aim is to examine if the revision of the directive has solved the prior existing problems regarding social considerations in public procurement. In this paper a traditional European legal method is used. The examinations show a number of things, including the Revised Classic directive involving codification of case law, references to other sources of law and some clarified rules as well as new provisions.
