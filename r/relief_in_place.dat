5|$|The Chinese {{engaged the}} US Marines on Boulder City with preparatory fire from mortars and {{artillery}} at 19:30. Ten minutes later Chinese troops were observed massing for an assault north-west of the Berlin feature and were subsequently shelled by the Americans. At 20:30 the Chinese probed the right flank {{held by the}} 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, first striking Hill 111 and then at Boulder City. After infiltrating forward, the Chinese had hid in the paddy fields immediately {{in front of the}} American positions during the barrage, and had then rapidly assaulted as soon as the artillery had lifted. The attack coincided with the ongoing <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> of the defenders by the US 1st Marine Regiment under the command of Colonel Wallace M. Nelson, and it subsequently succeeded in temporarily penetrating the American positions on Hill 111. Yet the Chinese main effort fell on Boulder City, and two battalions subsequently succeeded in occupying a portion of the American trench line. From these positions the Chinese threatened to cut-off Company G, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines on Hill 119, repeatedly assaulting the Berlin Gate feature on the company's left flank and the East Berlin Gate on its right in an effort to exploit their gains. Throughout the fighting the Marines were strongly supported by heavy mortar, artillery and tank fire; however, due to the prevailing weather conditions no spotter aircraft were able to fly during the night which limited the effectiveness of the indirect fire available to them.|$|E

During February and March 2005, the division was relieved by the 2nd Marine Division concluding the largest <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> {{in the history of the}} Marine Corps. In 2006, the division again deployed to Iraq as the ground combat element for I MEF in the Al Anbar province. It returned to MCB Camp Pendleton in early 2007.|$|E
25|$|The resolve of 63rd Signal Battalion was {{challenged}} once again {{when it was}} called into action for Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom in Southwest Asia on February 16, 2003. On G+1, the 63rd crossed into Iraq with the 3rd Infantry Division and the 1st MEF and emplaced signal support stretching from Kuwait to {{as far north as}} Baghdad and Fallujah, Iraq. Some of the many sites the 63rd supported were Camp Arifjan, Camp Virginia, Camp Victory, Cedar I and II, Tallil Air Base, LSA Bushmaster, LSA Resolute, Camp Bucca Theater Internment Facility, Basra International Airport, Baghdad International Airport, and two former Iraqi Presidential Palaces. In January 2004, the 63rd conducted a <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and transition of authority with the 67th Signal Battalion. After successfully deploying and accomplishing the mission, the 63rd brought every soldier home to Fort Gordon, Georgia, on February 19, 2004.|$|E

2500|$|... 1–206th FA was {{reinforced}} during one fight {{in this period}} by a section of M2 Bradleys belonging to the 1-69th Infantry, New York National Guard, which was deployed {{as part of the}} 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Louisiana National Guard. A platoon from B/2-162 IN had four of its five vehicles disabled by a complex ambush in the city of Mushada. While this platoon was being refitted with M1114s requisitioned from the 39th BCT Commander, the BCT Deputy Commander and the BCT S3, the 1–206th asked for assistance from the 1–69th. The 1–69th supplied two M2 Bradleys to help clear this complex ambush site. This was notable because the 1–69th had just arrived at Camp Taji and the M2s {{were in the process of}} being downloaded from their Heavy Equipment Transport System (HETS) carriers at the time of the request. 1–69th eventually conducted a <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> with 1–206th, assuming responsibility for a vast area of operations which stretched from just west of MSR Tamp westward to the boundary with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Forces, just east of Fallujah.|$|E
2500|$|True {{to the new}} Battalion’s motto Vanguard, {{the unit}} was quick to prove its place as {{the tip of the}} combat spear. In February 2006, the unit {{deployed}} as a member of Task Force Spartan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, operating within Regional Command East. [...] The Intelligence and Signal Companies provided critical support to the entire Task Force, while Headquarters Company and Alpha Company conducted combat operations in Logar Province, and Paktiya Province, respectively. [...] The Vanguard Battalion participated in all major operational campaigns, including Operation Mountain Lion, Operation Mountain Thrust, Operation Mountain Fury and Operation Mountain Eagle. In February 2007, the Spartan Task Force faced an additional four-month extension in order to facilitate a surge into several northern provinces that were experiencing increased insurgent activity. [...] The Battalion relocated from Gardez to Jalalabad and moved to quell violence in the provinces of Nuristan, Nangahar, Kunar and Laghman. [...] The Battalion’s extended OEF tour culminated with a successful <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> with Task Force Airborne, 173 ABN BCT.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} half of the deployment, 3rd BSTB focused {{squarely}} upon the non-security lines of operation. [...] Charged with partnering with the Czech Republic Provincial Reconstruction Team and the Afghan provincial leadership, 3rd BSTB reorganized its staff to attack issues along the lines of infrastructure, economic, and governance development. [...] However, in May 2009, 3rd BCT reorganized combat power within AO Spartan, giving 3rd BSTB security responsibility for the four northern districts of Logar Province, in addition to the development responsibility for the entire province. [...] Soldiers from all three line companies served as infantry combat Soldiers, given manpower shortages and mission requirements. [...] At the height of the deployment, immediately prior to the Afghan National Elections of August 2009, the 3rd BSTB consisted of over 700 Soldiers; during that time, these extraordinary men and women could be found conducting combat patrols, pulling security at far-flung outposts, conducting offensive combat operations, clearing routes of IEDs and promoting increased economic and governance development throughout the province, all regardless of MOS. [...] The 3rd BSTB had arguably one of the most successful deployments of any Special Troops Battalion within the history of the Army. [...] A testament to this fact was the ever-increasing and ever-changing mission set that was met with little argument, but rather, a can-do effort that is more than anything a portrait of the brave men and women who comprise the 3rd BSTB. [...] The Battalion concluded their successful tour with a flawless <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by the 173rd STB in December 2009.|$|E

50|$|The statue still retains {{enough of}} its {{polychromy}} to ascertain its original appearance. The throne was coloured an ochre red with the knops being picked out in gilt, the cloak was dark blue with the inner folds red. The ground beneath Mary's feet was a characterictic dark green scattered {{with red and}} white daisies and her crown, sceptre, mantle fastenings and the Christ child's hair were all gilded. These bright colours were characteristic of Nottingham Alabaster since they, for the most part, were designed to be housed in wooden altarpieces with painted shutters and {{to be seen by}} candlelight in dimly lit churches. The fact that the statue is flat backed and almost bas <b>relief</b> <b>in</b> <b>places</b> makes it likely that it was intended for just such an altarpiece.|$|R

50|$|Many {{areas on}} Mars show {{inverted}} <b>relief.</b> <b>In</b> those <b>places,</b> former stream channels are displayed as raised beds, instead of stream valleys. Raised beds form when old stream channels become filled with {{material that is}} resistant to erosion. After later erosion removes surrounding soft materials, more resistant materials that were deposited in the stream bed are left behind. Lava is one substance that can flow down valleys and produce such inverted terrain. However, fairly loose materials can get quite hard and erosion resistant when cemented by minerals. These minerals can come from groundwater. It is thought that a low point, like a valley focuses groundflow, so more water and cements move into it, and {{this results in a}} greater degree of cementation.|$|R
