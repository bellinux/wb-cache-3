5000|$|You can {{continue}} to add additional flip-flops, always inverting the output to its own input, and using the output from the previous flip-flop as the clock signal. The result is called a <b>ripple</b> <b>counter,</b> which can count to 2n - 1 where n {{is the number of}} bits (flip-flop stages) in the counter. Ripple counters suffer from unstable outputs as the overflows [...] "ripple" [...] from stage to stage, but they do find frequent application as dividers for clock signals, where the instantaneous count is unimportant, but the division ratio overall is (to clarify this, a 1-bit counter is exactly equivalent to a divide by two circuit; the output frequency is exactly half that of the input when fed with a regular train of clock pulses).|$|E
5000|$|An {{asynchronous}} (<b>ripple)</b> <b>counter</b> is {{a single}} d-type flip-flop, with its J (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows (starts over from 0). This counter will increment once for every clock cycle and takes two clock cycles to overflow, so every cycle it will alternate between a transition from 0 to 1 and a transition from 1 to 0. Notice that this creates a new clock with a 50% duty cycle at exactly half {{the frequency of the}} input clock. If this output is then used as the clock signal for a similarly arranged D flip-flop (remembering to invert the output to the input), one will get another 1 bit counter that counts half as fast. Putting them together yields a two-bit counter: ...|$|E
40|$|In many {{applications}} counter {{is used to}} divide input clock to produce output, {{the frequency of the}} output is the divide by N times of the input clock frequency.

In {{many applications}} such as ultra low power digital circuits, nano devices, wireless communication etc, designing of low power asynchronous counter is highly desirable.

40|$|An {{improved}} clocking {{scheme and}} sharper circuit design and logic selection, which have yielded a five-to-tenfold {{increased in the}} speed of standard CMOS ICs, are discussed. The clocking strategy relies on a true single-phase clock, device sizes are varied to optimize their speed, and a precharged logic style reduces capacitive loads. The tradeoff is roughly a doubling of circuit area. The high-speed CMOS technique has been demonstrated experimentally, with good results. For example, <b>ripple</b> <b>counters</b> in 3 and 2 μm CMOS processes reached input frequencies of 400 and 750 MHz, respectively, or nearly 80 and 70 % of the intrinsic speeds of these processes. Pipelined accumulators in 2 and 1. 2 μm CMOS processes operated at up to 430 and 700 MHz clock frequencies, respectively.

5000|$|Sometimes digital buses in {{electronic}} systems {{are used to}} convey quantities that can only increase or decrease by one at a time, for example the output of an event counter which is being passed between clock domains or to a digital-to-analog converter. The advantage of Gray codes in these applications is that differences in the propagation delays of the many wires that represent the bits of the code cannot cause the received value to go through states {{that are out of}} the Gray code sequence. This is similar to the advantage of Gray codes in the construction of mechanical encoders, however the source of the Gray code is an electronic counter in this case. The counter itself must count in Gray code, or if the counter runs in binary then the output value from the counter must be reclocked after it has been converted to Gray code, because when a value is converted from binary to Gray code, it is possible that differences in the arrival times of the binary data bits into the binary-to-Gray conversion circuit will mean that the code could go briefly through states that are wildly out of sequence. Adding a clocked register after the circuit that converts the count value to Gray code may introduce a clock cycle of latency, so counting directly in Gray code may be advantageous. A Gray code counter was patented in 1962 , and there have been many others since. In recent times a Gray code counter can be implemented as a state machine in Verilog. In order to produce the next count value, it is necessary to have some combinational logic that will increment the current count value that is stored in Gray code. Probably the most obvious way to increment a Gray code number is to convert it into ordinary binary code, add one to it with a standard binary adder, and then convert the result back to Gray code. This approach was discussed in a paper in 1996 [...] and then subsequently patented by someone else in 1998 [...] Other methods of counting in Gray code are discussed in a report by R. W. Doran, including taking the output from the first latches of the master-slave flip flops in a binary <b>ripple</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E

A set of N input operands (to be accumulated) are converted into a set of L operands of M = log 2 (N + 1) -bit size by using L number of M-bit <b>ripple</b> <b>counters</b> in parallel on the input bit-streams. In proposed structure- 1, the outputs of the counters are added directly by a shift-add tree. In proposed structure- 2, {{a new set of}} M number of L-bit operands are derived from the counter outputs, and shift-accumulated to derive the output sum. Both of the proposed structures are fully-pipelined to process successive multiple-accumulations without intermediate delay. It is shown further that both the structures can be used in multiple pipelined stages of successive accumulations, so that they could be conveniently scaled for implementation of multiple-accumulation of large number of input words. The proposed structures are found to have much higher throughput and less area-delay complexity compared with serial-accumulator and pipelined adder based on carry-save addition as well.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{bottom-up}} approach to cellular computing, in which computational chemical processes are encapsulated within liposomes. This “liposome logic” approach (also called vesicle computing) makes use of supra-molecular chemistry constructs, e. g. protocells, chells, etc. as minimal cellular platforms to which logical functionality can be added. Modeling and simulations feature prominently in “top-down” synthetic biology, particularly in the specification, design and implementation of logic circuits through bacterial genome reengineering. The second contribution in this paper is the demonstration of a novel set of tools for the specification, modelling and analysis of “bottom-up” liposome logic. In particular, simulation and modelling techniques are used to analyse some example liposome logic designs, ranging from relatively simple NOT gates and NAND gates to SR-Latches, D Flip-Flops all the way to 3 bit <b>ripple</b> <b>counters.</b> The approach we propose consists of specifying, by means of P systems, gene regulatory network-like systems operating inside proto-membranes. This P systems specification can be automatically translated and executed through a multiscaled pipeline composed of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulator and Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). Finally, model selection and analysis can be performed through a model checking phase. This is the first paper we are aware of that brings to bear formal specifications, DPD, SSA and model checking to the problem of modeling target computational functionality in protocells. Potential chemical routes for the laboratory implementation of these simulations are also discussed thus for the first time suggesting a potentially realistic physiochemical implementation for membrane computing from the bottom-up...|$|R
40|$|High-frequency ripple oscillations, {{observed}} {{most prominently}} in the hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal layer, are associated with memory consolidation. The cellular and network mechanisms underlying the generation of the rhythm and the recruitment of spikes from pyramidal neurons are still poorly understood. Using intracellular, sharp electrode recordings in freely moving, drug-free mice, we observed consistent large depolarizations in CA 1 pyramidal cells during sharp wave ripples, which are associated with ripple frequency fluctuation of the membrane potential (“intracellular ripple”). Despite consistent depolarization, often exceeding pre-ripple spike threshold values, current pulse-induced spikes were strongly suppressed, indicating that spiking was {{under the control of}} concurrent shunting inhibition. Ripple eventswere followed by a prominent afterhyperpolarization and spike suppression. Action potentials during and outside ripples were orthodromic, arguing against ectopic spike generation, which has been postulated by computational models of ripple generation. These findings indicate that dendritic excitation of pyramidal neurons during <b>ripples</b> is <b>countered</b> by shunting of the membrane and postripple silence is mediated by hyperpolarizing inhibition.

However, the accuracy of these circuits is strongly limited due to the relatively high variability in the characteristics of the OTFTs, typical of low-cost and low-temperature manufacturing techniques based on printing. The circuit performance in terms of linearity and resolution can be improved when other integrated components such as resistors are available. Printed resistors are expected to have better matching than printed OTFTs, since fewer process variables can affect the performance of a resistor. In this work, we show a printed 4 -bit DAC which achieves a maximum INL of 0. 05 LSB, equivalent to 0. 4 LSB at 7 b resolution level. The resistor-based DAC is fabricated in a process flow based on printing which integrates top-gate P- and N-type OTFTs together with resistors on a plastic foil [1]. We have implemented a 4 -bit counting ADC by integrating the R 2 R DAC with an auto-zeroed comparator [2] and a counter. The counter converts the clock signal to a BCD code, which is in turn converted to an analogue signal by the DAC. The DAC output is compared to the input signal using the comparator.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture and achievable {{performance of a}} time-to-digital converter by cascading a time stretcher and a gated ring oscillator based time-to-digital converter (GRO-TDC). The analogue time expansion, where the time interval to be measured is stretched by a factor k, is realized by charging a capacitor with a current I followed by discharging the capacitor by a current I/k. The currents are created by wide swing cascode current source/sinks with a current ratio of k. The time stretching method involves two conversions: time to charge and then charge to time. Whereas these are performed in each individualpixel, the final time to digital conversion is performed by the global GRO-TDC, where a multiphase gated ring oscillator is {{used to measure the}} stretched time interval by counting full clock cycles and storing the states of the ring oscillator within the clock period to obtain increased resolution. A block diagram of the proposed structure is shown paper. The nine phase single ended gated ring oscillator operates as an interpolator and as a clock during charge to time conversion. The layout of the gated inverters in the oscillator is designed by placing them in an order to compensate for the parasitic loading of capacitance for each stage and to minimize the effects of process variations. The clock of the 8 -bit <b>ripple</b> <b>counter</b> is enabled {{at the start of the}} charge to time conversion by the Start-Stretch signal. The result of the counter will be ready after the clock of the counter is disabled to the counter by the Stop-Stretch timing mark from the comparator. Special attention is paid to the design of the hysteresis based comparator using positive feedback. The comparator is designed to achieve acceptable robustness against transistor mismatch, small power dissipation, offset voltage, linearity, speed, small area and good noise immunity. The digital flip-flops functioning as an interpolator will store the time interval measurement responses with in the clock cycle. By selecting an appropriate stretch factor and suitable clock frequency for the gated ring oscillator, measurement error of few cm in distance is achievable. To ensure reliable recording of the timing signals, the counter is synchronized by usinga dual edge synchronization scheme where one of the two flip-flops always has enough delay between data change and clock edge to avoidmetastability problems.

Bubble logic provides a scheme to transport, store and operate on this new class of "digital materials" in an integrated, high-throughput fashion. Furthermore, microfluidics has also been extensively employed in biological systems. This thesis describes the discovery of two new physical fluid dynamic mechanisms motivated by a common theme of microfluidics in biology. Firstly, I describe a new superhydrophobic waterrepelling surface that has a characteristic of directional anisotropy to fluid resistance. The discovery, made while studying the integument of water-walking insects, helps rationalize the origin of thrust and hence propulsion of water-walking insects on a fluid interface. Secondly, this thesis uncovers a new physical mechanism for directed droplet transport, which I term "Capillary ratchet". Discovered in a class of surface feeding shorebirds, it is the only physical mechanism that is known to exploit contact angle hysteresis for fluid transport. Capillary ratchet is a promising candidate for implementing global clocking for integrated microfluidic devices. by Manu Prakash. Thesis (Ph. D.)
