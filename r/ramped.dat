5|$|During the Boer War, the {{importance}} of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, {{and the use of}} wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin & Webb began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the campaign at the Sudan in 1898 and <b>ramped</b> up production for the Boer War a few years later.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered 26 E60s in 1973; 15 on March 26, 1973, and {{a further}} 11 on October 12. The {{total cost of}} the order was $18.4 million. The initial order was for 15 {{locomotives}} with steam generators and 11 with head-end power, but 9 of the first type were switched to using head-end power as Amtrak <b>ramped</b> up acquisition of Amfleet cars. Amtrak anticipated that E60-hauled Amfleet trains could displace both the GG1s and the mechanically-unreliable Metroliners.|$|E

5|$|On 17 October 1933, {{aviation}} pioneer Hugo Junkers, {{owner of}} the Junkers Aircraft Works, was arrested {{and within a few}} days his company was expropriated by the regime. In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and under the direction of Aviation Minister Göring, production was immediately <b>ramped</b> up industry-wide. From a workforce of 3,200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932, the industry grew to employ {{a quarter of a million}} workers manufacturing over 10,000 technically advanced aircraft per year less than ten years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the tower is divided by iron floors and spiral stairways into four stories. The ground floor was originally used for oil store, and it now houses the light equipment, including a generator. Access to the tower was originally through the <b>ramped</b> stone steps on the north, entering the first floor. This entrance was since sealed, and a steel door on the ground level is now used.|$|E
5|$|The need {{to acquire}} or produce extra landing craft and troop carrier {{aircraft}} for the expanded operation {{meant that the}} invasion had to be delayed to June. Production of landing craft was <b>ramped</b> up in late 1943 and continued into early 1944, and existing craft were relocated from other theaters. More than 600 Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft and their crews took a circuitous route to England in early 1944 from Baer Field, Indiana, bringing the number of available troop carrier planes to over a thousand.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} focuses {{primarily on}} the analysis of exit <b>ramp</b> performance related to safety and operations. The safety analysis focuses on the impacts of different exit <b>ramp</b> types for freeway diverge areas and different factors contributing to the crashes that occur on the exit <b>ramp</b> sections. The operational analysis is based mainly on simulations by TSIS-CORSIM. Different <b>ramp</b> effects and guidance for selecting optimal exit <b>ramp</b> type are concluded. Issues related to <b>ramp</b> sections and crossroad sections are also demonstrated. Minimum <b>ramp</b> length and minimum distance between <b>ramp</b> terminal and downstream or upstream intersections are calculated. The operational analysis was conducted to determine different <b>ramp</b> effects and to provide guidance for selecting optimal exit <b>ramp</b> type. Comparisons of the operational performance {{of different types of}} exit <b>ramps</b> are made to present a method for choosing the optimal one. Some methods of evaluation (MOEs) are used to approach this objective, such as number of lane changes, average speed, delay time, etc. Data collection at 24 sites in Florida was conducted, and traffic simulations by TSIS-CORSIM were applied for analysis. Mathematical models were built to evaluate different impacts of these <b>ramps</b> based on simulations. All impact analysis is concluded to summarize a model for optimal exit <b>ramp</b> selection. In addition to <b>ramp</b> type evaluation and selection, issues related to <b>ramp</b> section and crossroad section are demonstrated. Minimum <b>ramp</b> length and minimum distance between <b>ramp</b> terminal and downstream or upstream intersections are calculated...|$|R

50|$|Other <b>ramps</b> {{serve to}} correct these {{problems}} of <b>ramp</b> size, yet either run into critiques of functionality and limited archaeological evidence. There are zig-zagging <b>ramps,</b> straight <b>ramps</b> utilizing the incomplete {{part of the}} superstructure (Arnold 1991), spiraling <b>ramps</b> supported by the superstructure and spiraling <b>ramps</b> leaning on the monument as a large accretion are proposed. Mark Lehner speculated that a spiraling <b>ramp,</b> beginning in the stone quarry to the southeast and continuing around {{the exterior of the}} pyramid, may have been used. The stone blocks may have been drawn on sleds along the <b>ramps</b> lubricated by water or milk.|$|R
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or <b>ramped</b> up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{extension}} of Smithfield's meat market {{took place between}} 1873 and 1876 {{with the construction of}} the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a fountain and a <b>ramped</b> carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} reached the shore at about 07:30. The first four waves of Landing Craft, Personnel (<b>Ramped)</b> (LCP(R)) from the APDs—arrived {{over the next}} 15 minutes. Each of the six LSTs in the assault towed a Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade; two carried bulldozers, two carried rocket {{equipped}} DUKWs, and two carried spare diesel fuel. The LCMs beached shortly before 08:30 and the LSTs soon after. The Shore Battalion, 542nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment laid Australian Reinforcing Company (ARC) mesh to provide a roadway across the beach for vehicles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ramp</b> {{shooters}} are robots {{that use}} {{the height of the}} <b>ramp</b> to greatly reduce the distance that they must propel the ball. <b>Ramp</b> shooters drive up to their wall and fire balls through a high-mounted shooting mechanism that is statically aimed directly at the goal. <b>Ramp</b> shooters have a disadvantage from floor shooters as they must traverse the <b>ramp,</b> risking tipping, and can only shoot from one location {{directly in front of the}} goal. Defense against a <b>ramp</b> shooter is simply to sit in position on top of the <b>ramp,</b> or keep them from getting up the <b>ramp.</b>|$|R

5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit <b>ramps</b> connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover <b>ramp</b> interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn <b>ramps</b> and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several <b>ramps</b> have been completed, with the <b>ramp</b> from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the <b>ramp</b> from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the <b>ramp</b> from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the <b>ramp</b> from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The <b>ramps</b> from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the <b>ramp</b> from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the <b>ramp</b> from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these <b>ramps,</b> the project will also add four <b>ramps</b> to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|R
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are <b>ramped</b> down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is <b>ramped</b> up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry <b>ramped</b> up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E

40|$|<b>Ramp</b> meters {{are special}} traffic signals {{at the end}} of a freeway on-ramp that {{regulate}} the flow of traffic onto the mainline. The main purpose of <b>ramp</b> meters is to keep the mainline of the freeway from becoming overly congested, and to maximize the efficient use of freeway capacity. The first use of <b>ramp</b> metering was in Chicago, in 1963, and today <b>ramp</b> meters are becoming more popular in both the US and in Europe. Although the original <b>ramp</b> metering controllers used pre-timed <b>ramp</b> meters, nearly all modern <b>ramp</b> metering algorithms are traffic responsive. Traffic responsive <b>ramp</b> meters can be divided into two categories: local or coordinated. Local <b>ramp</b> metering algorithms only take into account traffic conditions near a single <b>ramp,</b> while coordinated algorithms try to optimize traffic over an area. Four algorithms are evaluated in this thesis...|$|R

5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration <b>ramped</b> up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The parcours began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase <b>ramped</b> up in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was gapped off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the pace for a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself to just a select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on the finishing circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti put in an attack on an uphill section of the finishing circuit that effectively gapped off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E
5|$|Parker's injury {{extended}} into {{the beginning of}} the 2015–16 NBA season. He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for the Bucks but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he <b>ramped</b> up his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his talonavicular joint in the right mid-foot causing him to be expected to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he began to come off the bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. On February 19, he tied his career high with 23 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He surpassed that total the following night, recording career highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 117–109 double-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 29, Parker set a new career high with 36 points in a 128–121 Bucks victory over the Houston Rockets.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{difference}} of <b>ramp</b> directions, <b>ramp</b> events can be generally divided into two basic types: up-ramp and down-ramp [6]. The characteristic of the up-ramps is sharply increasing. Strong low pressure air systems (or cyclones), low-level jets, thunderstorms, wind gusts or similar atmospheric phenomena will induce up-ramps [7]. Likewise when the wind power suddenly drops or high speed gusts of wind make wind turbines reach cut-out limits (usually 22 ~ 25 m/s), wind turbines would be shut down for protecting themselves from damages. All this phenomena could induce down-ramps [8]. Down-ramps are the reverse physical process of up-ramps [9]. Based on the property of each <b>ramp</b> event, <b>ramp</b> events are parameterized by the following variables: <b>ramp</b> start time, <b>ramp</b> duration, <b>ramp</b> rate, <b>ramp</b> swing, and <b>ramp</b> end time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ramps</b> {{come in two}} styles—fold-up or in-floor—and two {{operating}} modes—manual or motorized. Fold-up <b>ramps</b> fold in {{half and}} stow upright next to the side passenger door in a side-entry configuration or inside the rear access doors in a rear-entry configuration. Fold-up <b>ramps</b> present a lower <b>ramp</b> angle than in-floor ramps; however, in side-entry configurations, {{they are in the}} way of the passenger entrance when stowed. In-floor <b>ramps</b> slide into a pocket underneath the vehicle's floor and are only available for side-entry configurations. Folding <b>ramps</b> are available in manual or motorized versions for both entry configurations. However, in-floor <b>ramps</b> are only available as motorized. Power applications may also have a “kneeling feature” that reduces the angle of the <b>ramp</b> by compressing the suspension of the van on the <b>ramp</b> side.|$|R
