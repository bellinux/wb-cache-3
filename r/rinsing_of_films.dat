40|$|Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES) {{has been}} {{developed}} to perform depth profiles <b>of</b> thick metallic <b>films,</b> in tens <b>of</b> microns range. GDOES spectroscopy {{can also be used}} to analyze thin organic polymer films since this technique has a great potential thanks to its high depth resolution, multi-element capability, sensitivity, and adaptability to solids or films and to conducting or non-conducting samples. In particular thin electrodeposited conducting polymer films remain an unexplored field of investigation for GDOES technique. However GDOES was used in this work to analyze electrodeposited polyaniline films, in addition to other techniques such as profilometry, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). More precisely polyaniline thin films were electrodeposited from HCl solutions and the presence of an anilinium chloride excess at the top surface <b>of</b> the polymer <b>film</b> was demonstrated using GDOES and XRD. <b>Rinsing</b> <b>of</b> these <b>films</b> with water led to the removal of this excess and to the partial dedoping <b>of</b> the polymer <b>film</b> due to the porous structure <b>of</b> polymer <b>films.</b> Polyaniline thin films were also electrodeposited from H 2 SO 4 solutions and an anilinium hydrogen sulfate was similarly observed at the top surface of the polymer. This excess was removed by rinsing, contrary to hydrogen sulfate anions incorporated into the polymer film during the electrochemical polymerization that were not completely expulsed from the polyaniline films as proved using GDOES. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{roles of}} {{molecular}} structure and charge are {{examined in the}} transport of cations within montmorillonite clay <b>films.</b> The series <b>of</b> Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +, Co(NH 3) 3 +, Co(en) 33 +, Co(sep) 3 + and Co(bpy) 3 + are examined in detail via electrochemical nd spectrocbemical methods. The electrochemical signal is enhanced both in minimizing {{the time required to}} develop the signal and in the magnitude of the signal for Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +. In addition, the potential for the observed reduction peak is shifted negative and the current peak associated with reduction disappears with <b>rinsing</b> <b>of</b> the clay <b>film.</b> These observations are characteristic of a compound that is held by simple electrostatic charge characteristics. In contrast, the compounds Co(NH 3) 3 +, Co(en) 3 + and Co(sep) 3 +, while showing rapid and enhanced signal development, eventually evolve a signal that is diminished with respect o the bare electrode, consistent with a hydro-phobic mode of retention. The signal for Co(bpy) 33 + is slow to be observed, is diminished with respect to the bare electrode and is shifted positive in potential, all hallmarks of a strong, non-electrostatic mode of binding within the clay.

The AA. execute the smears of the oral superficial squamous cells on 33 adult sound women, during the estrogenic and during the progestinic phase of the cycle; on the smears stained with Papanicolau's method, the AA. eximate the percentage of acidophilic cells (Acidophilic Index = A. I.) and of pyknotic cells (P. I.). The material was prelevated with three methods: 1) <b>rinse</b> <b>of</b> the mouth with 10 ce of physiological solution and collection of the centrifugate; 2) light touch and roll with a cotton fioc on the oral mucosa and immediately execution of the smears; 3) scraping with a wooden spatula, after <b>rinse</b> <b>of</b> the mouth. The A. I. is high (average 76, 94) at the 11 °- 14 - day of the cycle and low at the 21 °- 25 ° day (average 52, 52); at the same periods, the P.

40|$|Our {{effort for}} {{decontamination}} of radioactive cesium scattered widely by nuclear accident in March 2011 in Fukushi-ma, Japan has been described. Radioactive cesium scattered widely in Japan has been accumulating in arc or plasma molten-solidified ash in waste incinerating facilities up to 90, 000 Bq/kg of the radioactive waste.
