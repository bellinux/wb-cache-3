The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether there is a relationship between homocyst(e) ine and Lp(a) levels and vascular disease risk, and if the relationship depends on the apo(a) isoforms. Methods: A case-control study was performed in 91 Caucasian male subjects with vascular disease due to athersclerosis, and in 100 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Results: Both hyperhomocyst(e) inemia and elevated Lp(a) were significantly more prevalent in patients. Concordant elevated Lp(a) and hyperhomocyst(e) inemia were not associated with increased vascular disease risk (<b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> 2. 96; 95 % CI: 0. 90 - 9. 80), while hyperhomocyst(e) inemia in the absence of elevated Lp(a) was associated with increased vascular disease risk (<b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> 7. 20; 95 % CI: 2. 37 - 21. 91).

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{research}} assignment {{measures the}} <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of certain savings and debt related outcomes based on various domains of financial literacy, I. E. financial control, financial product choice and financial knowledge/understanding? It also measures the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of certain savings and debt related outcomes based on individual elements {{of each of}} these domains. Finally it measures the significance in which overall financial literacy, as a product of the various domains, affect the odds of certain financial outcomes relative to other more conventional demographic determinants, such as income, education and age? The data that informs this research was obtained from the Financial Services Board (FSB) of South Africa, who commissioned the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) to conduct the original data collection process by means of a national survey, in 2011. The salient findings of this research include that the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of savings outcomes are by and large more significantly affected by both the individual elements of– and the various domains of financial literacy, than debt related outcomes. Financial control as a domain of financial literacy has the greatest impact on the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of both savings and debt related outcomes, while financial knowledge/understanding has a comparatively weak influence on the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of savings and debt related outcomes. Financial control also has a significant influence on financial outcomes relative to conventionally significant determinants of financial outcomes, namely income and education, especially among lower income and or non-tertiary educated segments of the population. The individual elements of financial control that appear to be most significant in its influence on the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of savings and debt related outcomes, include the use of a budget and an individual‟s reliability in paying his or her bills. The individual elements of the financial product choice domain that have the largest and or most consistent influence on the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of savings outcomes are the extent of research before obtaining financial products and the level of general awareness of financial products. On the other hand, for debt related outcomes, the most influential independent variables (part of the financial product choice domain) are recent regret regarding financial product choice, recent wasteful expenditure on financial products as well as the extent to which an individual is able to identify suitable products. In terms of the individual elements of financial knowledge and understanding, the ability of individuals to understand compound interest affects the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of debt related outcomes most consistently. Forevery savings outcome of interest, the predictor variable (part of the financial knowledge/understanding domain) with the most significant influence is the ability to understand interest on deposits. The research furthermore uncovered that overall financial literacy has a consistently significant influence on savings outcomes relative to conventional determinants of financial outcomes such as income, age and education if the highest categories of income and education are omitted from analysis. Financial literacy is therefore a very good predictor of saving related outcomes when considering the lower income and or non-tertiary educated segments of the population...|$|E

40|$|Race {{and gender}} {{differences}} in respiratory illness prevalence rates were assessed in a cohort of 8, 322 white children and 1, 056 black children 7 to 14 yr of age from four U. S. cities. Boys had higher rates of wheeze, asthma, cough, phlegm, and bronchitis than girls. Black children had higher rates of persistent wheeze, shortness of breath with wheeze, asthma, chronic cough, and chronic phlegm than white children. We examined whether the racial disparity in respiratory illness prevalence could {{be accounted for by}} environmental exposures and socioeconomic factors. The proportion of families without a parent who had graduated from high school was higher for blacks than for whites, as was the proportion of single-parent households. Black children took up smoking less frequently; their mothers smoked fewer cigarettes. Personal and maternal smoking predicted higher rates of persistent wheeze, chronic cough, chronic phlegm, and chest illness. The <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> for persistent wheeze were 1. 34 (1. 07, 1. 69) for smoking children compared with nonsmoking children. The <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> for persistent wheeze were 1. 35 (1. 13, 1. 60) for children whose mother smoked 3 ̆e 30 cigarettes per day versus children with no maternal smoke exposure.

Our objective {{was to determine whether}} preterm birth is independently associated with medically treated hypothyroidism in young adulthood. Design/Participants: National cohort study of 629, 806 individuals born in Sweden from 1973 through 1979, including 27, 935 born preterm (< 37 weeks). Measurements: Thyroid hormone prescription during 2005 - 2009 (ages 25. 5 - 37. 0 years), obtained from all outpatient and inpatient pharmacies throughout Sweden. Results: Preterm birth was associated with increased <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of thyroid hormone prescription in young adulthood, after adjusting for fetal growth and other potential confounders. This association appeared stronger among twins than singletons (P= 0. 04 for the interaction). Twins had increased <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> across the full range of preterm gestational ages, whereas singletons had increased <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> only if born very preterm (23 - 31 weeks). Among twins and singletons, respectively, adjusted odds ratios for individuals born preterm (< 37 weeks) were 1. 54 (95 % CI, 1. 11 - 2. 14) and 1. 08 (95 % CI, 0. 98 - 1. 19), and for individuals born very preterm (23 - 31 weeks) were 2. 62 (95 % CI, 1. 30 - 5. 27) and 1. 59 (95 % CI, 1. 18 - 2. 14), relative to full-term births. Conclusions: This national cohort study suggests that preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of medically treated hypothyroidism in young adulthood.

Results: Responses were received from 280 men (response rate: 59. 2 %) and 174 partners (response rate: 74 %). Most men (59. 6 %) reported having insufficient information about their risk and wanted further information about personal risk (93. 2 %) and risk management (93. 6 %).

Utilization {{rates for}} cardiac {{catheterization}} and cardiac {{surgery in the}} Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system were studied to determine whether racial diierences existed in a delivery plan in which access is not determined by patient finances. Background. Prior studies have demonstrated significant differences in utilization of cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic resources by white and black patients. Reasons for the reduced utilization by black patients include socioeconomic, biologic and sociocultural effects. Methods. Computerized discharge records of 30, 300 patients with coronary artery disease and 1, 335 patients with valvular heart disease who were discharged from any of 172 VA Medical Centers between October 1, 1990 and September 30, 1991 were studied. Results. For patients with coronary artery disease, utilization rates of cardiac catheterization were significantly greater for white patients (503. 4 procedures/ 1000 patients) than for black patients (433. 2 / 1000 patients), with a <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> ratio of 1. 33, Rates for surgery (179. 0 vs. 124. 5 / 1, 000 patients) were also greater for whites for blacks, with a <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> ratio of 1. 53. For the subset with valve disease, the catheterization rate was significantly greater for whites than for blacks (575. 4 vs. 432. 6 procedures/ 1, 000 patients), with a <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> ratio of 1. 78.

A basic problem, therefore, is to compare two populations by assessing {{the difference between the}} proportions of individuals who possess a characteristic in the first and second populations. When there is prior information, we take the proportions to have independent conjugate beta distributions with known parameters, thereby facilitating a Bayesian analysis. We consider Bayesian inference on functions of the proportions, and the three most common scalar measures used in epidemiology and health services research, namely <b>relative</b> risk, <b>odds</b> ratio and attributable risk. We develop the highest density regions (both exact and approximate) for <b>relative</b> risk, <b>odds</b> ratio and attributable risk. In addition, we consider the Bayes factor for testing whether the model with a common proportion holds rather than one with distinct proportions. Using data from the population-based Worcester Heart Attack Study, we apply our methodology to study gender differences in the therapeutic management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by selected demographic and clinical characteristics. The Bayes factor, the approximate and exact intervals generally suggest that there are no substantial differences in the pharmacologic management of males and females hospitalized with AMI...|$|R
40|$|To {{appreciate}} {{the significance of}} clinical trial results, clinicians {{need to understand the}} mathematical language used to describe treatment effects. When comparing intervention and control groups in a trial, results may be reported in terms of relative or absolute risk (or probability), or as more statistically sophisticated entities based on odds and hazard ratios. When events in the intervention group are significantly less frequent than in the control group, then <b>relative</b> risk, <b>odds</b> ratio and hazard ratio (and their confidence intervals) will be less than 1. 0. If the converse holds true, these values will be greater than 1. 0...|$|R

The stability of this coefficient across all three samples suggests that although individuals represented by the DOJ sample were subjected to greater governmental legal activity than other Arab and Islamic Americans, the post- 9 / 11 national environment reduced incentives to acculturate for all Arab and Islamic Americans.|$|E
40|$|Explanations {{for the low}} {{prevalence}} of atherosclerosis in Japan versus the United States are often confounded with genetic variation. To help remove such confounding, the authors compared coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, between Japanese men in Japan and Japanese men in Hawaii. Findings were based on risk factors and CAC measured from 2001 to 2005 in 311 men in Japan and 300 men in Hawaii. Men were aged 40 – 50 years and without cardiovascular disease. After age adjustment, there was a three-fold excess in the odds of prevalent CAC scores of 10 in Hawaii versus Japan (<b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> 3. 2, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 1, 4. 9). Whereas men in Hawaii had a generally poorer risk factor profile, men in Japan were {{four times more likely}} to smoke cigarettes (49. 5 % vs. 12. 7 %, p < 0. 001). In spite of marked risk factor differences between the samples, none of the risk factors explained the low amounts of CAC in Japan. After risk factor adjustment, the <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of CAC scores of 10 in Hawaii versus Japan was 4. 0 (95 % confidenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} for {{an association between}} depression and mortality among community-dwelling elderly persons remains inconclusive, although it is well established for younger individuals. Extant studies suggest that this as-sociation weakens when adjusted for potential confounding factors, especially functional impairment. A cohort of el-derly subjects followed for 3 years was analyzed to determine the association of depression and 3 -year mortality, controlling for the major known risk factors for mortality in the elderly population. Methods. Information on depression (CES-D scores), mortality, demographics, body mass index, chronic disease, smoking history, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, self-rated health, and social support was obtained from a stratified probability-based sample of community-dwelling elderly persons, with equal distribution between African Americans and whites in the Piedmont of North Carolina. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and logistic regression was used {{for a series of}} models with progressively more control variables. Results. The unadjusted <b>relative</b> <b>odds</b> of mortality among depressed subjects at baseline was 1. 98 over 3 years of fol-low-up. Inclusion of age, gender, and race into the model did not reduce the <b>relative</b> <b>odds.</b> When chronic disease and health habits, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, and social support were added to the model, the odds ratio...|$|E

40|$|Summary. This article {{investigates the}} performance, in a frequentist sense, of Bayesian {{confidence}} intervals (CIs) {{for the difference}} of proportions, <b>relative</b> risk, and <b>odds</b> ratio in 2 × 2 contingency tables. We consider beta priors, logit-normal priors, and related correlated priors for the two binomial parameters. The goal was toanalyze whether certain settings for prior parameters tend to provide good coverage performance regardless of the true association parameter values. For the <b>relative</b> risk and <b>odds</b> ratio, we recommend tail intervals over highest posterior density (HPD) intervals, for invariance reasons. To protect against potentially very poor coverage probabilities when the effect is large, {{it is best to}} use a diffuse prior, and we recommend the Jeffreys prior. Otherwise, with relatively small samples, Bayesian CIs using more informative (even uniform) priors tend to have poorer performance than the frequentist CIs based on inverting score tests, which perform uniformly quite well for these parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pesticides and {{correlated}} lifestyle factors (e. g., {{exposure to}} well-water and farming) are repeatedly reported {{risk factors for}} Parkinson's disease (PD), but few family-based studies have examined these relationships. Methods Using 319 cases and 296 relative and other controls, associations of direct pesticide application, well-water consumption, and farming residences/occupations with PD were examined using generalized estimating equations while controlling for age-at-examination, sex, cigarette smoking, and caffeine consumption. Results Overall, individuals with PD {{were significantly more likely}} to report direct pesticide application than their unaffected <b>relatives</b> (<b>odds</b> ratio = 1. 61; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 13 – 2. 29). Frequency, duration, and cumulative exposure were also significantly associated with PD in a dose-response pattern (p ≤ 0. 013). Associations of direct pesticide application did not vary by sex but were modified by family history of PD, as significant associations were restricted to individuals with no family history. When classifying pesticides by functional type, both insecticides and herbicides were found to significantly increase risk of PD. Two specific insecticide classes, organochlorines and organophosphorus compounds, were significantly associated with PD. Consuming well-water and living/working on a farm were not associated with PD. Conclusion These data corroborate positive associations of broadly defined pesticide exposure with PD in families, particularly for sporadic PD. These data also implicate a few specific classes of pesticides in PD and thus emphasize the need to consider a more narrow definition of pesticides in future studies. </p...|$|R
