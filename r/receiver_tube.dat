50|$|Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm {{designed}} the Interdynamic MP-9 9mm submachine gun. Interdynamic intended {{it as an}} inexpensive submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications, but did not find a government buyer, so it {{was taken to the}} US market as an open-bolt semi-automatic pistol. The open-bolt design was deemed too easy to convert to full auto. Because of this, the ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into a closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to full auto. This variant was called the KG-99. It made frequent appearances on Miami Vice, where it was legally converted to full auto by Title II manufacturers. The KG-9 and KG-99 have an open-end upper <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> where the bolt, recoil springs, and buffer plate are held in place by the plastic/polymer lower receiver frame. This design only allows for 115 grain 9mm ammunition. If heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. The later model TEC-9 and AB-10 have a threaded upper <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the bolt, recoil spring, and buffer plate even if removed from the lower receiver. This solves the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.|$|E

30|$|One type {{of linear}} concentrating solar {{collector}} is the parabolic trough collector (PTC) which is useful {{in a wide range}} of applications where the working temperatures are 50 – 400  °C [1]. In essence, a PTC consists of a parabolic trough mirror or reflector and a solar <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> in the focal line of the reflector. Sunlight falls on the reflector, which focuses it onto the solar <b>receiver</b> <b>tube.</b> The outer surface of the solar <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> is coated with solar selective materials to absorb that concentrated sunlight and also any sunlight that falls directly on the tube itself. All the collected radiation is then converted into thermal energy [2, 3]. One important task is the development of a solar selective absorber to achieve high solar absorptance (α) or low reflectance (R) over the whole range of the solar spectrum (300 – 2500  nm) and low emittance (ε) of long wavelength infrared (IR) radiation at 2.5 – 20  μm [4, 5, 6].|$|E

It collects most of the diffuse flux. The vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>receiver</b> with selective absorber has no convection losses while radiation and conduction losses are minimal.

Until now periodic measurement of transmittance in the solar field has not been possible. The only options for users were to uninstall the tubes or even break them to analyze their properties in a laboratory.

It {{is to be used}} in a small-scale solar thermal Brayton cycle using a micro-turbine with low compressor pressure ratios. There are many different variables at play to model the air temperature increase of the air running through such a receiver. These variables include concentrator shape, concentrator diameter, concentrator rim angle, concentrator reflectivity, concentrator optical error, solar tracking error, receiver aperture area, receiver material, effect of wind, <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> diameter, inlet temperature and mass flow rate through the receiver. All these variables are considered in this paper. The Brayton cycle requires very high receiver surface temperatures in order to be successful. These high temperatures, however, have many disadvantages in terms of heat loss from the receiver, especially radiation heat loss. With the help of ray-tracing software, SolTrace, and receiver modelling techniques, an optimum receiver-to-concentrator-area ratio of A 0 0. 0035 was found for a concentrator with 45 rim angle, 10 mrad optical error and 1 tracking error. A method to determine the temperature profile and net heat transfer rate {{along the length of the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> is presented. Receiver efficiencies are shown in terms of mass flow rate, <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> diameter, pressure drop, maximum receiver surface temperature and inlet temperature of the working fluid. For a 4. 8 m diameter parabolic dish, the larger the <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> diameter and the smaller the mass flow rate through the receiver, the higher the receiver surface temperature and the less efficient the collector becomes. However, the smaller the <b>receiver</b> <b>tube</b> diameter, the higher the pressure drop through the tube and the smaller the second law efficiency. It was found that the receiver with larger tube diameter would perform better in a solar thermal Brayton cycle.
