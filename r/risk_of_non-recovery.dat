40|$|SUMMARY: A {{consideration}} of the composition of bird diets, and the list of bird species found deadl indicates that most New Zealand land bird species risk being killed by feeding directly on baits poisoned with Compound 1080 or by eating poisoned prey. Theoretically, if a population of a species is heavily reduced, its ability, or inability, to recover can be predicted from a {{consideration of}} its reproductive and dispersal capacities. Species with poor reproductive potential and poor dispersal have a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery,</b> e. g., the three species of kiwi, the takahe, kakapo, laughing owl, bush wren, rock wren, fernbird, yellowhead, stitchbird, saddleback, kokako, and New Zealand thrush. Species with either poor reproduction or poor dispersal are medium risk species, e. g., the New Zealand falcon, weka, New Zealand pigeon, kaka, kea, the three species of parakeets, the morepork, rifleman, brown creeper, whitehead, and robin.

40|$|Injuries, {{including}} {{those related to}} traffic, are an important cause of long-term morbidity among people in productive ages. This thesis focuses on self-perceived recovery after traffic related minor musculoskeletal injuries. The aims of the studies were to characterize the variation in recuperation time using sick-leave and self-perceived non-recovery as markers of residual illness, to identify prognostic factors of delayed recovery (Paper I), to relate selfperceived recovery to functional health status, {{as measured by the}} Short Form- 36 (Paper II). to develop a new instrument - the Prediction of Prolonged Self-perceived recovery after musculoskeletal injuries questionnaire, the PPS - and to evaluate its predictive ability regarding self-perceived recovery by applying it on a new group of patients (Paper III) and finally, to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary intervention program in terms of by patient reported recovery at 12 months (Paper IV). This thesis is based on two prospective studies on patients with traffic related musculoskeletal injuries. In the first study, 318 patients were included (Papers I and II). All patients received medical and surgical treatment according to the hospital routines. Information about the patient's background and the injuries were collected and the patients were asked to assess their functional health status during the week that had preceded the accident using the SF- 36. The patients were followed up at 1 month and at 6 months by means of a mailed questionnaire and asked to report if they felt recovered, to report their duration of sick leave and to rate their functional health status (SF- 36) In the second study (Papers III and IV) 387 patients were enrolled and followed up in the same manner. The PPS questionnaire was filled in by all enrolled patients and the ones predicted to have a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> were randomized to an intervention (n= 65) or to a control group (n= 62). The intervention program consisted of four group sessions and focused on information about injuries and pain management and called attention to self-care and physical activity. All patients were followed up at 6 months (Paper III) and 12 months (Paper IV). Self-perceived non-recovery was reported by about 60 % at 1 month and by about 40 % at 6 months. The injury-type, working status and educational level were associated with selfperceived non-recovery at 1 month, while only working status and educational level were associated with self-reported non-recovery at 6 months (Paper I). Patients who reported recovery had significantly higher SF- 36 subscores than those who reported non-recovery, even if not all of the recovered patients had reached their pre-injury levels. The physical dimensions of the SF- 36 were more strongly associated with feeling of recovery both at 1 month and at 6 months (Paper II). The PPS questionnaire identified patients at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> more accurately than a prediction that was based solely on information about the injury (Paper III). A significantly larger proportion of the patients in the intervention group than in the control group reported selfperceived recovery at 12 months (Paper IV). In conclusion, the injury in combination with, social, and emotional factors interact in the recovery process after an injury. The PPS questionnaire might be useful in identifying patients at risk of delayed recovery. Intervention focusing on somato-p sycho- social support in the early phase after an injury seems to enhance self-perceived recovery in selected patient groups but need to be verified in future studies...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} predictors <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> in non-traumatic complaints at the arm, {{neck and}} shoulder in general practice 6 {{months after the}} first consultation. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was set in 21 Dutch general practices. Consulters with a first or new episode of non-traumatic arm, neck or shoulder complaints and age 18 through 64 yrs entered the cohort. Complaint, patient, physical, psychosocial and work characteristics were investigated as possible predictors <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> at 6 months using multiple logistic regression analyses (backward Wald). RESULTS: At 6 months, 46 % {{of the total population}} (n = 612) and 42 % of the working subpopulation (n = 473) still reported complaints. Complaint characteristics (long duration of the complaint before consultation, recurrent complaint, musculoskeletal comorbidity and complaint mainly located at wrist or hand) were most predictive <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> followed by psychosocial characteristics (more somatization and experiencing less social support). Having a specific diagnosis was associated with recovery. In the working subpopulation, the same variables were predictors <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery.</b> Additionally, low supervisory support was associated with non-recovery. The models correctly classified 72 - 75 % of the patients (explained variance 0. 27 - 0. 28).

30|$|However, {{prior studies}} {{have failed to}} {{demonstrate}} a clinical benefit of furosemide in terms of mortality and renal recovery of AKI and suggested a possible harmful effect of furosemide when used to prevent or treat AKI. [37 – 45] A previous multicenter, observational study that enrolled 552 patients with AKI in intensive care units from the Program to Improve Care in Acute Renal Disease (PICARD) study group demonstrated {{that the use of}} furosemide was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> death or <b>non-recovery</b> <b>of</b> renal function (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95 % confidence interval, 1.14 to 2.76) [39]. A recent meta-analysis of 9 randomized, controlled trials of 849 patients that compared furosemide with a placebo to prevent or treat acute renal failure concluded that furosemide did not reduce in-hospital mortality (relative risk 1.11, 95 % confidence interval 0.92 to 1.33), the requirement for dialysis (relative risk 0.99, 95 % confidence interval 0.80 to 1.22), number of dialysis sessions required until recovery of renal function, proportion of patients remaining oliguric, or length of hospital stay [40].

40|$|Study design: Cross {{sectional}} (Study 1) {{and prospective}} (Study 2). Background: Chronic {{low back pain}} (LBP) is problematic with significant personal, social, and economic impact. The need to screen for indicators of poor prognosis and/or stratify patients with LBP based on risk is highlighted in the literature. The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) is one tool that has been developed to meet this need. There is {{a growing body of}} evidence for the psychometric properties of the SBST and for the tool’s predictive and discriminative ability, particularly in populations with LBP of variable episode duration. Studies have shown that the SBST’s performance has differed depending on the population in which it was evaluated. Clinical setting, cultural context, and LBP episode duration have all influenced the tool’s performance. There are a lack of studies evaluating the utility of the SBST in a population exclusively with chronic LBP. While the SBST is commonly used in Australia, the tool is yet to be evaluated in an Australian context. Aims: This study aimed to determine the utility of the SBST in a population exclusively with chronic non-specific LBP in Australia. The aim of the cross sectional study was to profile the SBST risk subgroups with respect to pain, disability, and psychological measures. The aim of the prospective study was to evaluate the predictive and discriminative ability of the SBST for pain intensity, self-reported LBP related disability, and global self-perceived change at one year follow-up. Methods: Participants with dominant axial non-specific LBP of at least three months duration were recruited (n= 290). At baseline participants completed the SBST and data were collected on demographic information, pain intensity (11 -point numerical rating scale [NRS]), disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ]), depression/anxiety/stress (Depression Anxiety Depression Scale), fear avoidance beliefs (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire [FABQ]), catastrophising (Pain Catastrophising Scale), perceived risk of pain persistence (11 -point NRS), self-efficacy (Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire), and chronic pain acceptance 5 (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire). Baseline SBST risk subgroup differences were examined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis test, or Chi Squared test depending on the data type and distribution. Follow-up data were collected after one year (n= 264). The follow-up measures were pain intensity (NRS), disability (RMDQ), and global perceived change (7 -point global rating of change scale). The follow-up measures were dichotomised into recovered and not recovered for analysis. The proportion of participants who were not recovered with respect to each of the follow-up measure was calculated at a cohort level and by baseline SBST risk subgroup. The predictive ability of the SBST was evaluated with risk ratios (RR) using the low risk group as the reference category. In order to evaluate the discriminative ability of the SBST, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for both the SBST total score and psychological subscale score for each of the follow-up measures. Likelihood ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for the low risk group versus the medium/high risk group and the low/medium risk group versus the high risk group were calculated for the significant AUC values. Statistical significance was considered to be at the p< 0. 05 for all analyses. Results: At baseline, the SBST categorised 82 participants (28. 3 %) as low risk, 116 (40. 0 %) as medium risk, and 92 (31. 7 %) as high risk. There were significant differences between the SBST risk subgroups for pain intensity (p≤ 0. 001), disability (p≤ 0. 001), and for the scores on the psychological questionnaires (p≤ 0. 001 except FABQ work subscale p= 0. 010). The SBST risk subgroups demonstrated increasingly higher levels of pain, disability, and negative psychological affect and cognitions as subgroup categorisation increased from low to medium to high risk. Non-recovery rates at the one year follow-up were 76. 1 % (n= 201) for pain, 31. 4 % (n= 83) for disability, and 44. 5 % (n= 117) for global perceived change. The predictive ability of the SBST was the strongest for disability. The medium risk group (RR 2. 30 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 28, 4. 10], p= 0. 003) and the high risk group (RR 2. 86 [1. 60, 5. 11], p≤ 0. 001) had a meaningfully greater relative risk of being considered disabled compared to the low risk group. The medium risk group (RR 1. 25 [1. 04, 1. 51], p= 0. 013) and the high risk group (RR 1. 26 [1. 03, 1. 52], p= 0. 020) had a statistically greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> with respect to pain but this relative risk was unlikely to be of any clinical significance. Conclusions: The results of this study provide valuable information to clinicians on the usefulness and limitations of using the SBST in patients with chronic LBP in an Australian setting. The SBST should be applied with caution for patients presenting with chronic LBP. The SBST has value as a substitute for the administration of multiple full-length, unidimensional questionnaires to initially screen for high levels of pain, disability, and negative psychological affect and cognitions in clinical practice. Therefore the tool can alert the clinician to the need for further assessment. The SBST has moderate predictive and acceptable discriminative ability for future disability. However, the SBST’s predictive and discriminative ability was relatively weak for future pain and the tool was unable to identify those participants who perceived themselves as improved versus not improved at the one year follow-up...|$|E
40|$|This journal issue entitled: Special Issue: Abstracts of the XX International Congress on Schizophrenia ResearchPatient’s {{perception}} of recovery from first-episode psychosis {{is a less}} well covered area in existing assessment and research. The Psychosis Recovery Inventory (PRI) is a self-administered questionnaire developed to address key issues in the recovery stage. This study applied the PRI to survey perceived extent of recovery and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> relapse {{in a sample of}} patients recovering from first episode psychosis. The PRI was administrated to 51 patients in the recovery period following a first psychotic episode. The PRI required patients to rate their perceived levels <b>of</b> recovery and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> relapse with a visual analog scale. In addition, respondents indicated their attitudes towards 32 items covering different aspects of recovery with a 6 -point Likert scale. We explored howthese attitudes are related to the perceptions of recovery and relapse. More than 33. 3 % of patients perceived a low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> relapse (10 % or lower), but only 7. 9 % of them recognized a high relapse risk (90 % or higher). 11. 8 % of the patients considered they had a full recovery, while on the other hand, 21. 6 % of the patients perceive they had recovered less than 50 %. Perception of non recovery is related to the presence of cognitive problems and impairment in occupational functioning. In addition, the need to continue on medication is rating as an important recovery for the perception <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery.</b> We successfully applied a tailor-made questionnaire to explore attitudes and perceptions of relapse and recovery in a sample of patients recovering from a first psychotic episode. Despite comprehensive psychoeducation, patients still tended to underestimate their <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> relapse.

40|$|Abstract OnlyMotivated by the {{evidence}} that many collapsed stocks have failed to recover despite fishing mortality has been reduced, or even when a moratorium is currently in effect, we develop a spline methodological approach to analyze the stochastic population dynamics of fish stocks at low stock levels. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide a simple mathematical model which allows us to analyze stochastic population dynamics of fish stocks at low stock levels. Unlike the conventional models, the concordance between the population dynamics of decline and recovery is not assumed, with a clear focus on modeling the stochastic aggregated stock (biomass) dynamics of collapsed species. The model can be used to analyze the consequences of all possible population dynamics at low population sizes, which can be different to those estimated at high stock levels, on the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> collapse and <b>non-recovery,</b> in a setting of high degree of uncertainty. Considering the northern cod stock by way of illustration, we find that the lack of recovery of the species, despite the moratorium which still remains in force, is consistent with the hypothesis of weak compensatory population dynamics at low population sizes instead of the strong compensation estimated by conventional statistical method...|$|R

5000|$|The theory behind CPT conceptualizes PTSD as a {{disorder}} <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery,</b> {{in which a}} sufferer's beliefs about the causes and consequences of traumatic events produce strong negative emotions, which prevent accurate processing of the traumatic memory and the emotions resulting from the events.

40|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of depression}} in elderly people is reported as poor, with high mortality and high rate <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} investigate the outcome after 6 years in a broader perspective. In addition to the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> dying, we also estimated the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> moving to long-term care, and having a depression in a re-screening event after 6 years. In 1993, a screening event for depressive symptoms using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL- 25) was carried out on 1215 subjects aged 65 years and older living in a health care district in Karlstad, Sweden. The study population was divided into a high score, a low score and a dropout group. A re-screening of the same population was carried out in 1999. Logistic regression analysis was used for calculating odds ratios for the selected end-points adjusted for age, gender, civil status and occurrence of physical illness. The adjusted odds ratios for dying for the high score group were 2. 5 (95 % CI 1. 5 - 4. 4) and for any of the end-points 6. 1 (95 % CI 3. 5 - 10. 8) compared with the low score group. Nearly three-quarters of the subjects in the high score group were deceased, depressed or had moved to long-term care after 6 years. The prognosis was poor for depressed elderly people despite not having more physical illness.

40|$|Question: Which multivariable {{prognostic}} model(s) {{for recovery}} {{in people with}} neck pain {{can be used in}} primary care? Design: Systematic review of studies evaluating multivariable prognostic models. Participants: People with non-specific neck pain presenting at primary care. Determinants: Baseline characteristics of the participants. Outcome measures: Recovery measured as pain reduction, reduced disability, or perceived recovery at short-term and long-term follow-up. Results: Fifty-three publications were included, of which 46 were derivation studies, four were validation studies, and three concerned combined studies. The derivation studies presented 99 multivariate models, all of which were at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias. Three externally validated models generated usable models in low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias studies. One predicted recovery in non-specific neck pain, while two concerned participants with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). Discriminative ability of the non-specific neck pain model was area under the curve (AUC) 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 59 to 0. 71). For the first WAD model, discriminative ability was AUC 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 79 to 0. 91). For the second WAD model, specificity was 99 % (95 % CI 93 to 100) and sensitivity was 44 % (95 % CI 23 to 65) for prediction <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery,</b> and 86 % (95 % CI 73 to 94) and 55 % (95 % CI 41 to 69) for prediction of recovery, respectively. Initial Neck Disability Index scores and age were identified as consistent prognostic factors in these three models. Conclusion: Three externally validated models were found to be usable and to have low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bias, of which two showed acceptable discriminative properties for predicting recovery in people with neck pain.

40|$|Objectives: To compare health status, {{family and}} {{occupational}} impact {{and quality of}} life one year after an accident between casualties with whiplash versus other mild injuries, and to explore the relation between initial injury (whiplash vs. other) {{and quality of life}}. Design: Prospective cohort study. Subjects: The study used data from the ESPARR cohort (a representative cohort of road accident casualties) and included 173 casualties with “pure” whiplash and a population of 207 casualties with other mild injuries (MAIS- 1). Quality of life at 1 -year follow-up was assessed on the WHOQoL-Bref questionnaire. Methods: Correlations between explanatory variables and quality of life were explored by Poisson regression to provide adjusted relative <b>risks,</b> with analysis <b>of</b> variance for the various quality of life scores explored. Results: One year post-accident, more whiplash than other casualties complained <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> <b>of</b> health status (56 % vs. 43 %) and of occupational impact of pain (31 % vs. 23 %). Quality of life and post-traumatic stress disorder were similar in the two groups. Impaired quality of life did not correlate with whiplash when models were adjusted on sociodemographic variables and history of psychological distress. Whatever the initial lesion, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was a determining factor for poorer quality of life. Conclusions: Sociodemographic factors, pre-accident psychological history prior and post-traumatic stress disorder were the main factors influencing quality of life, rather than whether or not the injury was whiplash.

By understanding the mechanism of mechanical behavior of individual C 720, the energy absorption ability of a 1 -D array of buckyball system is studied. It is found that regardless of the direction of alignment and number of buckyballs, the unit energy absorption density is almost the same for low-speed impact. In addition, different 3 -D stacking at various impact speeds and stacking forms are investigated. Explicit empirical models are suggested where packing density and impact speed may pose a positive effect on the unit energy absorption. This study may shed lights on the buckyball dynamic mechanical behavior and its application in energy absorption devices and inspire the related experimental work.|$|R

40|$|When Australia’s {{compulsory}} superannuation {{system was}} introduced in 1992, the name given to it, the superannuation guarantee, suggested that the payment of contributions by employers would be “guaranteed”. Reporting on compliance with superannuation guarantee by small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), however, paints a vastly different picture — especially for small businesses. Also, the pseudo status of some small businesses as “contractors” (as opposed to employees) of larger businesses may be undermining their potential own entitlement to superannuation guarantee. Such non-compliance draws into question how certain the superannuation guarantee system is for employees of these enterprises, and thereby undermining this important pillar of Australia’s retirement system. Non-compliance by the SME sector is of concern given that it accounts for nearly 50 % of private employment in Australia and performs important sub-contracting roles. This article will examine data on the compliance by small business employers with their superannuation guarantee obligations that indicate this {{is far from the}} case.

Methods A prospective study to compare echocardio-graphic left ventricular diastolic wall thickness (5 mm), low-dose dobutamine echocardiography and rest-redistribution thallium- 201 scintigraphy, alone and in com-bination, for predicting recovery of left ventricular akinesis after surgical revascularization. Results Twenty-eight consecutive patients aged 589 years were studied. Of the 448 left ventricular segments, 263 were akinetic at rest; 230 / 263 (87 %) had wall thickness 5 mm, 135 (51 %) had a positive response and 175 (66 · 5 %) were graded viable on thallium. Of akinetic segments 61 % improved after surgery. Left ventricular score decreased from 2 · 30 · 4 to 1 · 80 · 4 (P< 0 · 01) and ejection fraction increased from 2710 to 3714 % (P< 0 · 01). For predict-ing results at 1 year, diastolic wall thickness had a sensitiv-ity and a predictive accuracy of a negative test of 100 % but a specificity of 28 % and predictive accuracy of a positive test of 61 %. The addition of dobutamine echocardiography or thallium- 201 improved the predictive accuracy of a positive test to 76 % and 69 %, respectively; the addition of both tests was not of greater benefit {{than that of a}} single test. Conclusions Diastolic wall thickness < 5 mm on echo-cardiography was the best simple and single predictor <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> <b>of</b> left ventricular dysfunction. The addition of dobutamine echocardiography or thallium- 201, but not both, was the best solution for predicting recovery of left ventricular dysfunction.

40|$|Continuous {{long-term}} {{delivery of}} experimental drugs to the cochlea {{of a small}} animal, such as a young guinea pig, presents several technical problems. A method of placing and securing a cannula-osmotic pump system is described in this paper. Guinea pigs (225 - 410 g) were unilaterally implanted with an Alzet micro-pump and cannula for delivery of 20 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX) (six animals) or saline (three animals) for three days (1 [mu]l/h). Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded under light anesthesia on post-implant day 1 and day 3 and compared with pre-implant baseline values. In all six cochleas infused with TTX, most frequencies showed a 30 - 60 dB decrease in sensitivity within 24 h. Saline control animals showed little or no change from baseline sensitivity for most frequencies. In three TTX-infused animals, the cannula-pump unit was removed on day 3, and ABRs were followed during recovery. Most frequencies returned to, or near, pre-implant levels after pump removal but recovery times varied. By day 6, all animals had recovered post-surgical weight loss and showed a gain of 10 - 40 g. Brains and cochleas were removed and processed for sectioning. Assessment of the cochlear nucleus <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> TTX-treated animals showed a deafness-related flattening of auditory nerve active zones on the treated side...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the best test(s) for predicting functional recovery of hibernating myocardium after reperfusion. METHODS: A prospective study to compare echocardiographic left ventricular diastolic wall thickness (> or = 5 mm), low-dose dobutamine echocardiography and rest-redistribution thallium- 201 scintigraphy, alone and in combination, for predicting recovery of left ventricular akinesis after surgical revascularization. RESULTS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients aged 58 +/- 9 years were studied. Of the 448 left ventricular segments, 263 were akinetic at rest; 230 / 263 (87 %) had wall thickness > or = 5 mm, 135 (51 %) had a positive response and 175 (66. 5 %) were graded viable on thallium. Of akinetic segments 61 % improved after surgery. Left ventricular score decreased from 2. 3 +/- 0. 4 to 1. 8 +/- 0. 4 (P< 0. 01) and ejection fraction increased from 27 +/- 10 to 37 +/- 14 % (P< 0. 01). For predicting results at 1 year, diastolic wall thickness had a sensitivity and a predictive accuracy of a negative test of 100 % but a specificity of 28 % and predictive accuracy of a positive test of 61 %. The addition of dobutamine echocardiography or thallium- 201 improved the predictive accuracy of a positive test to 76 % and 69 %, respectively; the addition of both tests was not of greater benefit {{than that of a}} single test.

40|$|Non-traumatic {{complaints}} of arm, neck, and shoulder are common and {{can result in}} functional limitations in daily life and may sometimes lead to sickness absence. Reported symptoms are e. g. pain, tingling, stiffness, numbness, loss of hand coordination. When seeking medical care for these complaints, the general practitioner (GP) is usually {{the first person to}} consult. This thesis studies patients who consult their GP with a new non-traumatic complaint of arm, neck or shoulder, with a focus on incidence, course and management. The incidence study showed that a fulltime GP is consulted about 3 times every week for a new non-traumatic complaint of arm, neck, or shoulder, most frequently located at neck or shoulder. Six months after the first consultation with their GP, 46 % of the patients in the cohort study reported no recovery. Next to several complaint specific variables, the psychosocial variables little social support and high score on somatization were predicitve <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> at 6 months. Management upto 6 months after the first consultation most frequently consisted of prescribed analgesics and referral for physiotherapy. Specific and non-specific diagnostic subgroups differed in the frequency that corticosteroid injections were applied, and referrals to physiotherapy and to a medical specialist. In addition variables associated with five common management options within {{a few weeks after the}} first consultation were evaluated. Overall, besides diagnosis, most frequently long duration of complaints, more functional limitations but also several GP characteristics were associated with the application of a treatment option in non-traumatic arm, neck and shoulder complaints...|$|R
40|$|Background: Patients whose {{symptoms}} are 'unexplained by disease' {{often have a}} poor symptomatic outcome after specialist consultation, but we know little about which patient factors predict this. We therefore aimed to determine predictors of poor subjective outcome for new neurology out-patients with symptoms unexplained by disease 1 year after the initial consultation. Method: The Scottish Neurological Symptom Study was a 1 -year prospective cohort study of patients referred to secondary care National Health Service neurology clinics in Scotland (UK). Patients were included if the neurologist rated their symptoms as 'not at all' or only 'somewhat explained' by organic disease. Patient-rated change in health was rated on a five-point Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) scale ('much better' to 'much worse') 1 year later. Results: The 12 -month outcome data were available on 716 of 1144 patients (63 %). Poor outcome on the CGI ('unchanged', 'worse' or 'much worse') was reported by 482 (67 %) out of 716 patients. The only strong independent baseline predictors were patients' beliefs [expectation <b>of</b> <b>non-recovery</b> (odds ratio [OR] 2. 04, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 40 - 2. 96), non-attribution of symptoms to psychological factors (OR 2. 22, 95 % CI 1. 51 - 3. 26) ] and the receipt of illness-related financial benefits (OR 2. 30, 95 % CI 1. 37 - 3. 86). Together, these factors predicted 13 % {{of the variance in}} outcome. Conclusions: Of the patients, two-thirds had a poor outcome at 1 year. Illness beliefs and financial benefits are more useful in predicting poor outcome than the number of symptoms, disability and distress...|$|R

40|$|Target of {{the work}} is to study the Latvian trade sector {{external}} and internal risks, perform risk identification, classification and assessment. In the work are used scientific research methods – analysis and synthesis methods, economic analysis method of enterprises, the special coefficient method and the risk ranking method. The authors had studied the Latvian trade sector in the period from 2004 to 2010. In Latvian trade sector from 2004 to 2006 was observed increment of turnover, but from 2007 was observed decline of turnover. In Latvian trade sector is monopolistic competition. Many enterprises offer a market differentiated trade services. Small and medium companies are merging into trade cooperation and chain stores. The authors had studied average financial indexes of the Latvian trade sector enterprises. Average financial <b>risk</b> coefficient <b>of</b> Latvian trade sector enterprises had increased during the period from 2006 to 2009. The authors have created classification of Latvian trade sector economic and financial <b>risks</b> and classification <b>of</b> the trade technological process risks. The authors have created the algorithms of classification and assessment of the trade sector enterprises’ risks. The economic risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the country’s economic slowdown, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> increment <b>of</b> taxes, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> reduction in consumer’s solvency, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> demand’s instability and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of credit resources. The financial risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> unpaid credit, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> financial instability, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of own capital, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> liquidity and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> debtors.
