5|$|Although he {{is known}} by many attributes, Ganesha's {{elephant}} head makes him easy to identify. Ganesha is widely revered as the <b>remover</b> of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured {{at the start of}} rites and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits and explain his distinct iconography.|$|E
5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart <b>remover.</b> If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E
5000|$|... === 2-Butoxyethanol === The organic {{compound}} 2-Butoxyethanol, {{commonly found in}} glass cleaners, laundry stain <b>removers,</b> windshield wiper fluid, oven cleaners, and rust <b>removers</b> has been proven to cause reproductive problems in laboratory experiments.|$|R
50|$|Chemical paint <b>removers</b> {{work only}} on {{certain types of}} finishes, and when {{multiple}} types of finishes {{may have been used}} on any particular surface, trial and error testing is typical to determine the best stripper for each application. Two basic categories of chemical paint <b>removers</b> are caustic and solvent.|$|R
50|$|Caustic paint <b>removers,</b> {{typically}} {{sodium hydroxide}} (also known as lye or caustic soda), work by {{breaking down the}} chemical bonds of the paint, usually by hydrolysis of the chain bonds of the polymers forming the paint. Caustic <b>removers</b> must be neutralized or the new finish will fail prematurely. In addition, several side effects and health risks {{must be taken into}} account in using caustic paint <b>removers.</b> Such caustic aqueous solutions are typically used by antique dealers who aim to restore old furniture by stripping off worn varnishes, for example.|$|R
5|$|Homer, Bart and {{the group}} arrive at Miami's Pro Player Stadium for pre-game festivities, but the ticket agent reveals the tickets Wally had bought were counterfeit. Attempting to sneak into the stadium, the group is locked up in the {{detention}} center and vents their frustration on Homer. They are freed when Kogen's friend Dolly Parton uses her extra-strength makeup <b>remover</b> to dissolve the lock on the door. They run into a skybox suite and get {{a view of the}} game until the owner Rupert Murdoch arrives and confronts them. Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players. The group ends up in the locker room where they share the celebration, and everyone has a Super Bowl ring on one of their hands at game's end.|$|E
5|$|In Blessing, Tennessee, Jared Chirp, while {{attempting}} to flee his home, is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed. Federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), after conferring with the completely ordinary Reverend Mackey, go to Reverend Enoch O'Connor's church, Church of God with Signs and Wonders, where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services. As such, O'Connor becomes the prime suspect. Later, a woman named Iris tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order {{to talk to his}} girlfriend, Gracie. Iris, however, refused because Gracie was in bed. Later that night, Iris is bitten when her staple <b>remover</b> turns into a snake; she promptly goes into the bathroom to clean up but is killed when snakes appear everywhere in the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|Since {{nail polish}} <b>remover</b> is a solvent, it will {{dissolve}} in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish <b>remover</b> that enters the hydrosphere {{will increase the}} concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish <b>remover</b> is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.|$|E

50|$|Various laundry {{techniques}} {{exist to}} attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and stain <b>removers</b> are an important type of chemical in laundry detergents. Some stand-alone stain <b>removers</b> also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the stain or stain mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.|$|R
5000|$|... 2-Butoxyethanol acetate {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of {{industries}} as a solvent for nitrocellulose and multicolored lacquers, varnishes, enamels, and epoxy resin. It is useful as a solvent because of its high boiling point. It is also used in the manufacture of polyvinyl acetate latex. It is an ingredient in ink <b>removers</b> and spot <b>removers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Nail polish <b>remover</b> has {{the ability}} to enter bodies of water and soil after {{entering}} landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to acetone's high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, and so, when acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish <b>remover</b> evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{has gained}} {{importance}} in the detergent industry the last decade. It is a good descaler, soap-scum <b>remover,</b> and a registered anti-bacterial agent. It is also economically beneficial as well {{as part of a}} trend toward environmentally safer and natural ingredients.|$|E
25|$|Baking soda is {{commonly}} added to washing machines {{as a replacement}} for water-softener and to remove odors from clothes.

25|$|A staple <b>remover</b> {{allows for}} the quick removal of a staple from a {{material}} without causing damage. The form of destapler described was invented by William G. Pankonin of Chicago, Illinois. A patent application for the same was filed on December 12, 1932, granted on March 3, 1936, and published on April 3, 1936 as a patent.|$|E
25|$|A {{lint roller}} or lint <b>remover</b> is {{a roll of}} one-sided {{adhesive}} paper on a cardboard or plastic barrel that is mounted on a central spindle, with an attached handle. The device facilitates the removal of lint or other small fibers from most materials such as clothing, upholstery and linen. The lint roller was co-invented in 1956 by American electrical engineer Nicholas McKay and his wife Helen.|$|E
25|$|In October 1993, The Straits Times, Singapore's main English-language newspaper, {{reported}} that car vandalism in Singapore {{was on the}} rise. Cars parked at apartment blocks were being damaged with hot tar, paint <b>remover,</b> red spray paint, and hatchets. Taxi drivers complained that their tires were slashed. In the city center, cars were found with deep scratches and dents. One man complained {{that he had to}} refinish his car six times in six months.|$|E
50|$|ECN's fee {{structure}} can {{be grouped}} in two basic structures: a classic structure and a credit (or rebate) structure. Both fee structures offer advantages of their own. The classic structure tends to attract liquidity <b>removers</b> while the credit structure appeals to liquidity providers. However, since both <b>removers</b> and providers of liquidity {{are necessary to}} create a market, ECNs must choose their fee structures carefully.|$|R

25|$|Nail polish <b>remover</b> {{can also}} enter the {{lithosphere}} by landfills and by precipitation. However, {{it will not}} bind to the soil. Microorganisms in the soil will decompose acetone. The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The more acetone readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Lint on {{clothing}} {{is generally considered}} unattractive and unprofessional. Furthermore, lint may be abrasive and may damage the clothing itself. For this reason, visible lint is often removed with a lint <b>remover</b> or clothes brush. The accumulation of lint during clothes cleaning can be reduced {{with the use of}} a fabric softener, which reduces the amount of static electricity on clothing surfaces and therefore prevents the lint from sticking to the clothes.|$|E
25|$|Serving {{pieces were}} often elaborately {{decorated}} and pierced and embellished with ivory, and could include {{any or all}} of the following: carving knife and fork, salad knife and fork, cold meat fork, punch ladle, soup ladle, gravy ladle, casserole-serving spoon, berry spoon, lasagna server, macaroni server, asparagus server, cucumber server, tomato server, olive spoon, cheese scoop, fish knife and fork, pastry server, petit four server, cake knife, bon bon spoon, salt spoon, sugar sifter or caster and crumb <b>remover</b> with brush.|$|E

50|$|Other {{equipment}} {{is often used}} with road marking machines. The main auxiliary equipment includes thermoplastic paint pre-heaters, hand-push pre-markers and road marking <b>removers.</b> Thermoplastic paint pre-heater is used to melt the solid powder coating into a viscous liquid, providing {{a steady supply of}} paint to the marking machine. Pre-markers are used to draw a field sketch in advance to avoid faulty marking. Road marking <b>removers</b> are used to remove old or incorrect markings. Large self-propelled machines usually do not need any support equipment, as equivalent functionality is built in.|$|R
25|$|Substances in the {{environment}} {{can also lead to}} false BAC readings. For example, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a common gasoline additive, has been alleged anecdotally to cause false positives in persons exposed to it. Tests have shown this to be true for older machines; however, newer machines detect this interference and compensate for it. Any number of other products found in {{the environment}} or workplace can also cause erroneous BAC results. These include compounds found in lacquer, paint <b>remover,</b> celluloid, gasoline, and cleaning fluids, especially ethers, alcohols, and other volatile compounds.|$|E
25|$|Whitley was a {{longtime}} alcoholic, who began drinking {{early in his}} career at bluegrass gigs, long before he was legally allowed to drink alcohol. Many times, he had attempted to overcome his alcoholism, but failed; and his pre-existing depression made it more challenging for him to quit. Moreover, Whitley preferred to drink alone, making it difficult for anyone to detect that he had a problem. According to Lorrie Morgan, she tried to conceal all alcoholic beverages from him at the home they shared, even going to the extent of binding their legs together before going to bed to make it impossible for Whitley to awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to consume a drink without her knowledge - only to discover that he would drink various items such as perfume and nail polish <b>remover</b> to get intoxicated.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{syringes}} {{help reduce}} occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One {{of the most}} recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into the syringe or rendering the syringe plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are hands free methods usually involving a hinging cap that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the needle <b>remover.</b> Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from the syringe. This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separate from the syringe. There is debate around the use of these devices as they involved in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.|$|E
