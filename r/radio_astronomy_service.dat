40|$|Radio {{spectrum}} {{access is}} important for terrestrial wireless networks, commercial earth observations and terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations. The <b>services</b> offered by terrestrial wireless networks, commercial earth observations and terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations have evolved due to technological advances. They are expected to meet increasing users' demands which will require more spectrum. The increasing demand for high throughput by users necessitates allocating additional spectrum to terrestrial wireless networks. Terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations s require additional bandwidth to observe more spectral windows. Commercial earth observation requires more spectrum for enhanced transmission of earth observation data. The evolution of terrestrial wireless networks, commercial earth observations and terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations leads {{to the emergence of}} new interference scenarios. For instance, terrestrial wireless networks pose interference risks to mobile ground stations; while inter-satellite links can interfere with terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations. Terrestrial wireless networks, commercial earth observations and terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations also require mechanisms that will enhance the performance of their users. This thesis proposes a framework that prevents interference between terrestrial wireless networks, commercial earth observations and terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations when they co-exist; and enhance the performance of their users. The framework uses the cognitive radio; because it is capable of multi-context operation. In the thesis, two interference avoidance mechanisms are presented. The first mechanism prevents interference between terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations and inter-satellite links. The second mechanism prevent interference between terrestrial wireless networks and the commercial earth observation ground segment. The first interference reductionmechanism determines the inter-satellite link transmission duration. Analysis shows that interference-free inter-satellite links transmission is achievable during terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observation switching for up to 50. 7 seconds. The second mechanism enables the mobile ground station, with a trained neural network, to predict the terrestrial wireless network channel idle state. The prediction of the TWN channel idle state prevents interference between the terrestrial wireless network and the mobile ground station. Simulation shows that incorporating prediction in the mobile ground station enhances uplink throughput by 40. 6 % and reduces latency by 18. 6 %. In addition, the thesis also presents mechanisms to enhance the performance of the users in terrestrial wireless network, commercial earth observations and terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observations. The thesis presents mechanisms that enhance user performance in homogeneous and heterogeneous terrestrial wireless networks. Mechanisms that enhance the performance of LTE-Advanced users with learning diversity are also presented. Furthermore, a future commercial earth observation network model that increases the accessible earth climatic data is presented. The performance of terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> observation users is enhanced by presenting mechanisms that improve angular resolution, power efficiency and reduce infrastructure costs...|$|R

50|$|The 2 {{millimeter}} band is {{a portion}} of the EHF (microwave) radio spectrum internationally allocated to amateur radio and amateur satellite use.

The additional bandwidth will provide greater image resolution, improve range accuracy, allow for greater radar density, improve interference performance, lower system costs, and increase ability to collect more information about an object or area observed by a radar. Operation of these radars must not adversely affect other co-primary services in the band, or the <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> <b>service</b> in the adjacent band, 15. 35 - 15. 40 GHz. This proposal also takes into account the need for an allocation in the range 15. 4 - 15. 6 GHz to address the requirements of mobile-satellite service systems under WRC- 12 Agenda item 1. 25.
