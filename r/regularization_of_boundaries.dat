40|$|Abstract An {{efficient}} and easy-to-implement method is proposed to regularize integral equations in the 3 D boundary element method (BEM). The method {{takes advantage of}} an assumed three-noded triangle discretization <b>of</b> the <b>boundary</b> surfaces. The method {{is based on the}} derivation of analytical expressions of singular integrals. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, three elastodynamic problems are numerically worked out in the frequency domain: a cavity under harmonic pressure, diffraction of a plane wave by a spherical cavity, and amplification of seismic waves in a semispherical alluvial basin (the second one is also investigated in the time domain). The numerical results are compared to semi-analytical solutions; a close agreement is found for all problems, showing the accuracy of the proposed method. <b>Regularization</b> <b>of</b> <b>Boundary</b> Integral Equations In contrast to other discretization methods, the boundary element method (BEM) involves singular integrals. According to the power, there are three kinds of singularities that depend on whether integrability is defined (1) in the ordinar...|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} {{visual processing}} theory {{is used to}} provide {{a new approach to}} the analysis of surface perception. notably shape-from-shading. The theory elsewhere has been used to explain data about boundary detection and completion. textural segmentation. depth perception. color and brightness perception. and striate-prestriate cortical interactions. Neural netv{ork interactions within a multiple scale boundary contour (BC) system and feature comour (FC) system are used to explain these phenomena. Each spatial scale of the BC system comains a hierarchy of orientationally tuned interactions. which can be divided into two successive subsystems called the DC filter and the CC loop. The DC filter contains two successive stages of oriented receptive fields which are sensitive to different properties of image contrasts. The DC filter generates inputs to the CC loop. which contains successive stages of spatially short-range competitive interactions and 'patially long-range cooperative interactions. Feedback between the competitive and cooperative stages synthesizes a coherent. multiple Scall ~ structural representation of a smoothly shaded image. called a boundary web. Such a bOUlldary web regulates multiple-scale filling-in reactions within the FC system which generate a pe:rcept of form-and-color-in-depth. Computer simulations establish key properties <b>of</b> a <b>boundary</b> web representation: nesting <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> web reactions across spatial scales. coherent completion and <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> webs across incomplete image data. and relative insensitivity <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> webs to illumination level and highlights. The theory clarifies data about interactions between brightness and depth percepts. transparency. influences of highlights on perceived surface glossiness. and shape-from-texture gradients. The total network suggests a new approach to the design of computer vision systems. and promises to provide a univ~rsal set of rules for 3 D perceptual grouping of scenic edges. textures. and smoothly shaded regions. t: 1987 Academic Press.

40|$|Several {{approaches}} are discussed how {{to understand the}} solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Poisson equation when the Dirichlet data are non-smooth such as if they are in L^ 2 only. For the method of transposition (sometimes called very weak formulation) three spaces for the test functions are considered, and a regularity result is proved. An approach of Berggren is recovered as the method of transposition with the second variant of test functions. A further concept is the <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> the <b>boundary</b> data combined with the weak solution of the regularized problem. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>regularization</b> error is studied. The regularization approach is the simplest to discretize. The discretization error is estimated for a sequence of quasi-uniform meshes. Since this approach turns out to be equivalent to Berggren's discretization his error estimates are rendered more precisely. Numerical tests show that the error estimates are sharp, in particular that the order becomes arbitrarily small when the maximal interior angle of the domain tends to 2 Ï€...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gradient field representation using an analytical <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> a hypersingular <b>boundary</b> integral equation for a 2 -dimensional time harmonic wave equation called the Helmholtz equation. The regularization {{is based on}} cancelation of the hyper-singularity by considering properties of hypersingular elements that are adjacent to a singular node. Advantages to this regularization include applicability to evaluate corner nodes, no limitation for element size, and reduced computational cost compared to other methods. To demonstrate capability and accuracy, regularization is estimated for a problem about plane wave propagation. As a result, {{it is found that}} even at a corner node the most significant error in the proposed method is due to truncation error of non-singular elements in discretization, and error from hypersingular elements is negligibly small...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{previously}} developed a model-based strategy for joint estimation of myocardial perfusion and boundaries using ECT (emission computed tomography). They have also reported difficulties with boundary estimation in low contrast and low count rate situations. Here they propose using boundary side information (obtainable from high resolution MRI and CT images) or boundary regularization to improve both perfusion and boundary estimation in these situations. To fuse boundary side information into the emission measurements, the authors formulate a joint log-likelihood function to include auxiliary boundary measurements {{as well as}} ECT projection measurements. In addition, they introduce registration parameters to align auxiliary boundary measurements with ECT measurements and jointly estimate these parameters with other parameters of interest from the composite measurements. In simulated PET O- 15 water myocardial perfusion studies using a simplified model, the authors show that the joint estimation improves perfusion estimation performance and gives <b>boundary</b> alignment accuracy <b>of</b> < 0. 5 mm even at 0. 2 million counts. They implement boundary regularization through formulating a penalized log-likelihood function. They also demonstrate in simulations that simultaneous <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> the epicardial <b>boundary</b> and myocardial thickness gives comparable perfusion estimation accuracy with the use <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> side information...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the electromagnetic field with a two dimensional plasma sheet intended to describe the pi-electrons of a carbon nano-tube or a $C_{ 60 }$ molecule is investigated. By integrating out first the displacement field of the plasma or first the electromagnetic field different representations for quantities like the Casimir energy are derived which are shown {{to be consistent with}} one another. Starting from the covariant gauge for the electromagnetic field it is shown that the matching conditions to which the presence of the plasma sheet can be reduced are different from the commonly used ones. The difference in the treatments does not show up in the Casimir force between two parallel sheets, but it is present in the Casimir-Polder force between a charge or a neutral atom and a sheet. At once, since the plasma sheet is a <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> the conductor <b>boundary</b> conditions, this sheds light on the difference in physics found earlier in the realization <b>of</b> conductor <b>boundary</b> conditions as 'thin' or 'thick' boundary conditions in Phys.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{constrained}} shape optimization governed with a nonlinear axisymmetric magnetostatic state problem and we apply it to an optimal shape design of an electromagnet. The state problem is solved via Hiptmairâ€™s symmetric coupling of finite elements employed in the interior ferromagnetic domain and boundary elements modelling the exterior air domain as well as current excitations. As a novelty we derive Duffy <b>regularization</b> transforms <b>of</b> the <b>boundary</b> element integrals for the axisymmetric case, which are then evaluated using a tensor-product Gaussian quadrature. Nonlinear ferromagnetic behaviour is resolved by Newton iterations. The optimization method under both linear and nonlinear constraints relies on the active-set steepest-descent search, projections onto the set of linearized constraints, and an adjoint method of shape sensitivity analysis. Shape perturbations influence grid deformation via a solution to an auxiliary torsion-free linear elasticity problem. Finally, numerical results are presented. Web of Science 82101731172...|$|R

40|$|The {{surface of}} a 3 + 1 d topological {{insulator}} hosts an odd number of gapless Dirac fermions when charge conjugation and time-reversal symmetries are preserved. Viewed as a purely 2 + 1 d system, this surface theory would necessarily explicitly break parity and time-reversal when coupled to a fluctuating gauge field. Here we explain why such a state can exist on the <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> a 3 + 1 d system without breaking these symmetries, even if the number <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> components is odd. This is accomplished from two complementary perspectives: topological quantization conditions and regularization. We first discuss {{the conditions under which}} (continuous) large gauge transformations may exist when the theory lives on a <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> a higher-dimensional spacetime. Next, we show how the higher-dimensional bulk theory is essential in providing a parity-invariant <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> the theory living on the lower-dimensional boundary or defect.
