500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where {{you were going to get}} a <b>really</b> <b>long</b> look at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E

500|$|After {{positive}} {{reviews from}} the heavy metal {{press and the}} release of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow-up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were <b>really</b> <b>long,</b> too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E

[...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go– Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that [...] "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that [...] "..."Kaminey" [...] is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal.

The following month, Friedman {{announced that he had}} pulled out of the tour due to scheduling conflicts with his own reality series.

[...] The script of the show was created by Jamie King, and was inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. Rudolph stated that the idea for the show was to have Spears as an [...] "international woman of mystery". The setlist was composed mostly of songs from Femme Fatale, but also included hits from her previous albums, as Spears explained, [...] "The fans really like a lot of the old songs, because that's what they are used to.

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the album was, overall, fairly laudatory. Its score of 79 out of 100 – or 'generally favorable' – on Metacritic attests to decent reception. Regarding its place in Isis' catalog, it {{has been described as}} their [...] "most accomplished and complete album to date" [...] by Ali Maloney of The Skinny, as their [...] "smartest and richest record" [...] and as [...] "the toughest and catchiest Isis record" [...] since their debut full-length, Celestial." [...] Beyond the band's own repertoire, it was described as [...] "metal played at its arresting best", and Andrew Rennie of NOW went as far as declaring it [...] "close to perfect". Not all reviews were so glowing, as the NME characterized it as [...] "45 minutes of awesomeness stretched out to a slightly bloated hour [...] the unsettling Toolisms of 'Ghost Key' meander just too long and 'Hand of the Host' spends half of its 11 minutes repeating itself without really juddering into the granite riff golem it threatens to be." [...] Similarly, Chris Norton of Tiny Mix Tapes feels that the album [...] "isn't the band's best by a <b>really</b> <b>long</b> shot, even if it ain't bad." [...] Accessibility was a similarly divisive issue, with the album being characterized as [...] "perhaps their most rewarding yet, but simultaneously their hardest to immediately access given its prioritising of subtle nuances over senses-numbing assaults" [...] and [...] "a slow-burning success". Conversely, it has also been declared to be [...] "easily the band's most accessible effort". Allmusic's William Ruhlmann felt that with regards to structure, [...] "Wavering Radiant works as a single piece of music rather than a series of songs", as Milton Savage of Drowned in Sound concurred that Isis have [...] "construct their latest so that it's best experienced as a whole".|$|E
