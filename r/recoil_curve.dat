Airways conductance at low flow (Gaw), maximum expiratory flow (V̇E, MAX) and static lung recoil pressure [Pst (l) ] were measured at different lung volumes, and conductance-static recoil pressure and maximum flow-static recoil pressure curves constructed. Low values of ΔGaw/ΔPst (l) and ΔV̇E, max/ΔPst (l) were attributed to intrinsic airways disease.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} hard magnetic properties and microstructure of bulk FePt magnets, which can potentially be used in dental prostheses. A high level of remanence was obtained in a Fe- 39. 5 mol %Pt alloy aged at 873 K, in which minute FePt ordered domains of about 10 nm in size were uniformly created. The change in the maximum energy product of this alloy was in good agreement with the level of remanence: they both decreased with increasing aging time, {{and the size of the}} ordered domains gradually grew. The remanence ratio of as-quenched Fe- 40 mol %Pt magnet has been estimated at 0. 69, despite the morphological isotropy of the magnet. Remanence enhancement occurred in an FePt single phase without the presence of the magnetically soft disordered phase, since the spring back phenomenon was not observed in the <b>recoil</b> <b>curve</b> measurements, and the entire area was covered with minute FePt ordered domains. The hard magnetic properties were enhanced at the optimum ordered domain size of about 10 nm. This study found that the ordered domains behaved as a single magnetic domain particle and improved remanence through intergranular exchange interaction. © 2003 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work the phase constitution, {{microstructure}} and magnetic {{properties of the}} Pr 9 Fe 52 Co 13 Zr 1 Ti 3 B 22 alloy ribbons in the as-cast state and subjected to short time annealing were investigated.

Subsequently, the samples were annealed for 5 min at temperatures ranging from 923 to 1013 K. The ribbon samples in as-cast state were fully amorphous and exhibited soft magnetic properties. Annealing at 923 K resulted in partial devitrification of samples that has not changed considerably their magnetic properties. Heat treatment of specimens at higher temperatures caused the increase of volume fractions of hard magnetic phase, which was accompanied by significant changes of their hysteresis loops.

40|$|Melt-quenched NdFeB is an {{important}} modern permanent magnet material. However there still remains doubt as to the magnetization reversal mechanism which controls coercivity in material prepared by this processing route. To investigate this problem a new technique based on measurements of reversible magnetization along <b>recoil</b> <b>curves</b> has been used. The technique identifies the presence of free domain walls during magnetic reversal. For this study samples of isotropic (MQI), hot pressed (MQII) and die upset (MQIII) melt-quenched NdFeB were examined. The results indicate that in MQI free domain walls are not present during reversal and the reversal mechanism is most likely incoherent rotation of some form. Free domain walls are also not present during reversal {{in the majority of}} grains of MQII, even though initial magnetization measurements indicate that the grain size is large enough to support them. In MQIII free domain walls are present during reversal. These results are attributed to the reduced domain wall nucleation field in MQIII compared with MQII and the increased dipolar interactions in MQIII...|$|R
40|$|Immiscible polymer blends {{are known}} to display an unusual elastic {{recovery}} after stress release. Recoil after steady-state shearing is well understood and obeys specific scaling relations. Releasing the stress before the steady-state morphology has been reached results in a more complex elastic recovery, including very large final values. This behaviour is investigated systematically. Model blends are used, consisting of nearly inelastic components; hence the measured recoil can be attributed totally to contributions from the interface. The instantaneous structure {{at the onset of}} the recoil can vary greatly in transient experiments, ranging from slightly deformed droplets to highly elongated filaments. The effects of this initial structure on the ultimate recoil and time scale of the recovery are studied. The morphological changes during recovery are considered as well. It is demonstrated that they can be computed from the normal stresses during stress relaxation with comparable initial morphologies. This indicates that the same morphological changes occur during stress relaxation and constrained recoil. A scaling relation for the <b>recoil</b> <b>curves</b> has been derived from the Doi-Ohta theory, which is confirmed by the experiments. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} secondary Bjerknes forces on targeted microbubbles using high-speed optical imaging. We observed that targeted microbubbles attached to an underlying surface and subject to secondary Bjerknes forces deform {{in the direction of}} their neighboring bubble, thereby tending toward a prolate shape. The deformation induces an elastic restoring force, causing the bubbles to recoil back to their equilibrium position; typically within 100 μs after low-intensity ultrasound application. The temporal dynamics of the recoil was modeled as a simple mass-spring system, from which a value for the effective spring constant k of the order 10 − 3 Nm− 1 was obtained. Moreover, the translational dynamics of interacting targeted microbubbles was predicted by a hydrodynamic point particle model, including a value of the spring stiffness k of the very same order as derived experimentally from the <b>recoiling</b> <b>curves.</b> For higher acoustic pressures, secondary Bjerknes forces rupture the molecular adhesion of the bubbles to the surface. We used this mutual attraction to quantify the binding force between a single biotinylated microbubble and an avidin-coated surface, which was found to be between 0. 9 and 2 nanonewtons (nN). The observation of patches of lipids left at the initial binding site suggests that lipid anchors are pulled out of the microbubble shell, rather than biotin molecules unbinding from avidin. Understanding the effect of ultrasound application on targeted microbubbles is crucial for further advances in the realm of molecular imaging...|$|R
40|$|Thin film CoPt/Co bilayers {{have been}} {{prepared}} as a model system to investigate the relationship between microstructure and exchange coupling in two-phase hard/soft composite magnets. CoPt films, with a thickness of 25 nm, were sputter-deposited from a nearly equiatomic alloy target onto oxidized Si wafers. The films were subsequently annealed at 700 C and fully transformed from the FCC phase to the magnetically hard, ordered L 1 {sub 0 } phase. The coercivity of the films increased rapidly with annealing time until it reached a plateau at approximately 9. 5 kOe. Fully-ordered CoPt films were then used as substrates for deposition of Co layers, with thicknesses {{in the range of}} 2. 8 [...] 225 nm, in order to produce the hard/soft composite bilayers. As predicted by theory, the magnetic coherency between the soft Co phase and the hard, ordered CoPt phase decreased as the thickness of the soft phase increased. This decrease in coupling was clearly seen in the magnetic hysteresis loops of the bilayers. At small thicknesses of Co (a few nanometers), the shape of the loop was one of a uniform material showing no indication of the presence of two phases with extremely different coercivities. At larger Co thicknesses, constricted loops, i. e., ones showing the presence of a mixture of two ferromagnetic phases of different hardnesses, were obtained. The magnetic exchange present in the bilayer samples was qualitatively analyzed using magnetic <b>recoil</b> <b>curves</b> and the dependence of exchange coupling on the soft phase dimension in the bilayer hard/soft composite magnet films is discussed...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the feasibility of measuring pharyngeal (PP) and esophageal (Pes) pressures of young children on HFNC oxygen therapy through a specifically designed new monitoring, acquisition, and elaboration system (MAES). Through MAES we recorded and elaborated Pes and PP tracings obtained through esophageal and pharyngeal catheters in a group of young children hospitalized in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit because of respiratory distress. All traces were recorded during spontaneous breathing and on HFNC 1 and 2 L/kg/min. To determine the onset and the end of inspiration, the Pes and PP signals were synchronized with the inspiratory flow obtained by a flow transducer placed in the HFNC circuit. Direct measurement of inspiratory flow by a face mask pneumotachograph also allowed for inspiratory tidal volume (TV) measurement which was used together with Pes curve to build Campbell’s diagram as well as the static lung and chest wall <b>recoil</b> <b>curves</b> required for pressure time product (PTP) evaluation. Using MAES we were able to obtain: time interval between the beginning of inspiratory effort and inspiration (Tdelay), TV, intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPi), total inspiratory Pes variation (ΔPes), transpulmonary pressure at end of inspiration (Ptpei), dynamic lung compliance (CLdyn), total lung resistance (RLtot) along with all the relevant components of the inspiratory work of breathing (WOB) and PTP. We believe that this new system will allow clinicians for a bedside monitoring of respiratory distress in infants treated with HFNC and to modify flow rates accordingly.

A modification of the Dock type of electromagnetic, un-damped, direct ballistocardiograph has been employed {{in this study of}} 23 normal individuals. The total duration of mechanical systole in the great vessels has been found to correspond closely to the H-L interval. The HWJKL complex of the ballistocardiogram appears to be entirely related to the events of ventricular systole. The M, N and 0 waves represent after-waves occurring during diastole. H ENDERSON 1 studied the <b>recoil</b> <b>curves</b> of the heart and circulation as early as 1905 and attempted to derive car-diac output. For many years, little was done with this method until Starr 2 modified the apparatus and suggested its use not only for the measurement of cardiac output but also as a clinical tool in evaluation of the functional status of the heart. Starr and his co-workers extensively investigated ballistocardiography and described the findings in both health and disease.

Maximal expiratory volumes and flows were normal. Total lung capacity was not significantly increased, but this may be a consequence of preagonal edema. Comparison of normal, senile, and emphysematous lungs showed a close relationship between recoil pressures and mean linear intercept, Lm, and between forced expiratory volume in 1 s and diameter and density of the membranous bronchioles.

The total number of unit magnets produced per year in a large plant amounts to several hundreds of millions, since the small magnet weighing 4 mg in a high quality material as Cobalt-Rare Earth and used in electric watches, till the big 40 kg magnet, directly cast in Ticonal 600, for the stator of an electric generator. The same 107 factor in the weight {{can be found in the}} coercivities of ferromagnetic materials, going from 10 - 2 Oe for very soft materials to 105 Oe for very hard materials. This review deals with the various hard materials now in production, illustrated by a few new laboratory results. If the old theory of pinned Bloch walls, initially developed for magnet steels, comes back again for cobalt-rare earths alloys substituted with copper and iron, the origin of the properties of most modern hard materials is interpreted in terms of single domain fine — particle theory : in one case, magnetization reversal is governed, either by a shape anisotropy (Ticonals, powder magnets) or a crystal anisotropy (platinum-cobalt alloy, hard ferrites) — in the other case, it is governed by nucleation of reversed domains or unpinning of Bloch walls (sintered cobalt-rare earths magnets). The study of first magnetization curves, as well as intrinsic <b>curves</b> or <b>recoil</b> <b>curves,</b> is very useful to distinguish between various mechanisms of coercivity, and is illustrated here by new results obtained on high coercivity materials, as Ticonal 2000 ((BHmax) = 6. 5 × 106 G. Oe), Sermalloy P, Plasto-Ferrite magnets Ferriflex 10 very well oriented ((BH) max = 2. 0 x 106 G. Oe) and Cobalt-Rare Earth Coramag. Although an increase in coercivity is usually followed by a decrease in remanence, this does not appear in intermetallic compounds based on transition and rare earth metals, thus allowing very high specific energies.

The observed changes were qualitatively similar in the four groups. Whereas total lung capacity and dynamic compliance were not influenced, {{there was an increase}} in vital capacity (not in healthy subjects and mild bronchitics), in FEV 1, in maximal expiratory flows and a decrease in pulmonary resistance. The static recoil pressure-volume relationship was shifted to the left over its ascending part. The effect of isoprenaline tended to be larger in patients. Among the latter, the increase of vital capacity was especially pronounced in the severe bronchitics, whereas the maximal flows increased most in asthmatics. We suggest that the influence of isoprenaline on maximal flows results from a bronchodilation, associated with an increased collapsibility of the central intrathoracic airways, whereas the influence of VC might reflect a delayed onset of small airway closure. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with chronic obstructive lung disease, we determined single-breath N 2 and 133 Xe washout curves, and regional distributions of volumes (Vr) and of 133 Xe boluses inhaled at residual volume (VIRV). Patients suffering from emphysema with minimal airway obstruction demonstrated large closing volumes and apicobasal distribution gradients, apparently because of a steep pulmonary <b>recoil</b> pressure-volume <b>curve.</b> In one subject with basal small airway disease there was no vertical gradient in regional residual volume; closing volume was increased with the 133 Xe technique but almost absent with the N 2 technique. Patients with moderate-to-severe airway obstruction had upward-sloping alveolar plateaus without distinct phase IV, and small apicobasal differences in Vr and VIRV. The latter resulted probably from increased regional differences in time constants counteracting the influence of gravity. Finally, {{patients with}} severe airway obstruction and basal emphysema demonstrated a rising N 2 but a descending 133 Xe plateau; the gradient for VIRV was normal, and reversed for Vr.

By subtracting Rp from RL and Rti from Rp, we obtained, respectively, central (Rcaw) and peripheral (Rpaw) airway resistance. We determined also lung volumes, the elastic <b>recoil</b> pressure-volume <b>curve,</b> and the forced expiratory volume in 1 s-to-vital capacity ratio (FEV 1 /VC). The functional data were related to morphometry: mean linear intercept (L(m)), diameter (dBAR), and density (n/cm 2) of membranous bronchioles. In the three groups of lungs, Rti demonstrates a marked negative frequency dependence and increases with transpulmonary pressure. In emphysematous lungs, the increase of RL is mainly due to an increase of Rpaw; in addition, Rcaw and Rti are higher than normal. In the group of senile lungs, airway resistances are within normal range, but Rti is slightly increased.
