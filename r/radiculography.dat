40|$|The use {{of nuclear}} {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) in the diagnosis of radicular pain due to lateral canal stenosis in 21 patients is reported. NMR was able to distinguish normal intervertebral discs from degenerate discs, and NMR evidence of reduction of epidural fat was more reliable than <b>radiculography</b> in identifying lateral root entrapment. NMR is an important advance in the investigation oflumbar radiculopathies. The importance oflateral canal stenosis {{as a cause of}} root entrapment is becoming increasingly recognised, es-pecially in the older patient (Macnab 1977; Crock 1981; Getty et a!. 1981 b). <b>Radiculography</b> is often unhelpful in demonstrating such entrapment (Lee, Kazam and New-man 1978; Getty et a!. l 981 a; Critchley 1982). Compu-tensed tomography (CT) has greatly improved imaging of the lateral canal, has made imaging of soft tissues within the canal possible (Haughton, Syvertsen and Williams 1980; Isherwood and Antoun 1980) and has been considered the procedure of choice in the investi...|$|E
40|$|Study design. Case-series study. Objective. To {{describe}} the clinical presentation, characteristic findings of imaging studies, {{and treatment of}} lumbar radiculopathy caused by foraminal stenosis in rheumatoid arthritis. Background. Lumbar lesions in rheumatoid arthritis are relatively rare, with {{a limited number of}} systemic reports. Methods. Six patients with lumbar radiculopathy caused by foraminal stenosis in rheumatoid arthritis were treated. The patients were all women {{with a mean age of}} 69 years and mean rheumatoid arthritis duration of 15 years. The medical records and imaging studies of all patients were reviewed. Results. The affected nerve roots were L 4 in four patients and L 3 in two patients. Foraminal stenosis was not demonstrated in magnetic resonance images in four of the six patients. Selective <b>radiculography</b> with nerve root block reproduced pain, manifested blocking effect, and demonstrated compression of the nerve root by the superior articular process of the lower vertebra in all patients. Conservative treatment was performed on one patient, and surgery was conducted for the rest of the five patients; radiculopathy was improved in all patients. Conclusions. Lumbar foraminal stenosis is a characteristic pathology of rheumatoid arthritis, and should be kept in mind in the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy. Selective <b>radiculography</b> is useful in the diagnosis of affected nerve roots...|$|E
40|$|A 62 -year-old patient {{presented}} with a 12 -month history of severe sciatica. The patient showed tenderness of Valleix and lateral lower leg pain on his left side. MRI, myelogram, and <b>radiculography</b> revealed extraforaminal stenosis {{at the level of}} L 5 /S 1. His symptoms disappeared after injection of lidocaine onto the L 5 spinal nerve. The symptoms did not improve after conservative treatment, and surgery was performed under a diagnosis of neuropathy from far-out syndrome. For release of L 5 spinal nerve compression, decompression and instrumented fusion surgery were performed. His symptoms disappeared immediately after surgery. Far-out syndrome itself is rare; however, {{it is important to consider}} this disease in cases of sciatica...|$|E
40|$|The radiographs {{and records}} of 58 cases of lumbar disc {{prolapse}} {{in children and}} adolescents were reviewed, and 28 cases were followed up after an average of 6. 8 years. Trauma was not a significant aetiological factor, but there was a high incidence of back pain in relatives of affected patients. The clinical picture is similar to that in the adult except for a relative paucity of neurological signs. This review of patients treated by surgical or conservative methods suggests that good results may be obtained in patients with a short history who are offered surgery early. Preoperative <b>radiculography</b> is considered to be essential because of the inaccuracy in localising the level of disc prolapse by clinical signs. The result of treatment in patients with long histories is usually disappointing. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Perineurial cysts usually {{affect the}} lumbosacral spinal nerve roots, but {{sometimes}} they can erode the sacrum and reach the retroperitoneal space. In such cases misdiagnosis can lead to an improper treatment and cause serious complications. A presacral mass was diagnosed in a young woman during routine ultrasound investigation, and an exploratory laparotomy was performed. A large, fluid-containing cyst was found and marsupialized into the pelvis. After operation the patient experienced headache, vomiting and VI cranial nerve palsy whenever she stood up. By <b>radiculography</b> a iatrogenic spinopelvic cerebro-spinal fluid fistula was diagnosed, which required further surgery to be repaired. The presence of a giant perineurial cyst in the pelvis in unusual but {{must be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of presacral masses; the exceptionally rare case reported in this paper is exemplar of the harmful complications that an incautious procedure can determine...|$|E
40|$|Five {{patients}} {{known to}} be HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) -positive- that is, susceptible to AIDS-presented with symptoms initially thought to be indicative oflumbar disc lesions. Signs of nerve root or cauda equina compression were found in all five patients. Lumbar <b>radiculography</b> and, in one patient, computerised tomography produced no evidence of compressive pathology. We recommend that orthopaedic surgeons exercise caution in diagnosing nerve root compression in patients who may be HIV-positive. Accumulating evidence about the acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has revealed that the disease may present with complex neurological symp-toms (Britton and Miller 1984; Levy, Bredesen and Rosenblum 1985). Although most of the significant neurological features are attributable to intra-cranial disease, when the spinal cord is involved the symptoms may mimic those of cauda equina syndrome or lumbar nerve root compression.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Although uncommon, {{selective}} cervical {{nerve root}} blocks can have serious complications. The most serious complications {{that have been}} reported include cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, transient quadriplegia and death. Case presentation A 40 -year-old Japanese woman {{with a history of}} severe right-sided cervical radicular pain was scheduled to undergo a right-sided C 6 selective cervical nerve root block using a transforaminal approach under fluoroscopic guidance. An anterior oblique view of the C 5 -C 6 intervertebral foramen was obtained, and a 23 -gauge spinal needle, connected to the normal extension tube with a syringe filled with contrast medium, was introduced into the posterior-caudal aspect of the C 5 -C 6 intervertebral foramen on the right side. In the anteroposterior view, the placement of the needle was considered satisfactory when it was placed no more medial than halfway across the width of the articular pillar. Although the spread of the contrast medium along the C 6 nerve root was observed with right-sided C 6 <b>radiculography,</b> the subdural flow of the contrast medium was not observed with real-time fluoroscopy. The extension tube used for the <b>radiculography</b> was removed from the spinal needle and a normal extension tube with a syringe filled with lidocaine connected in its place. We performed a negative aspiration test and then injected 1. 5 [*]mL of 1. 0 % lidocaine slowly around the C 6 nerve root. Immediately after the injection of the local anesthetic, our patient developed acute flaccid paralysis, complained of breathing difficulties and became unresponsive; her respiratory pattern was uncoordinated. After 20 minutes, she regained consciousness and became alert, and her muscle strength in all four limbs returned to normal without any sensory deficits after receiving emergent cardiorespiratory support. Conclusions We believe that confirming maintenance of the appropriate needle position in the anteroposterior view by injecting local anesthetic is important for preventing central needle movement. Because the potential risk of serious complications cannot be completely eliminated during the use of any established selective cervical nerve root block procedure, preparation for an emergency airway, ventilation and cardiovascular support is indispensable in cases of high spinal cord anesthesia. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the dynamics of change of neuron-specific enolase concentration in patients with acute ischemic brain disease in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. The study included 103 patients, their mean age 58 - 66 years. The control group consisted of 16 patients, of matching age and sex, with radicular lesions of discal origin, subjected to diagnostic <b>radiculography.</b> Concentration of neuron-specific enolase was measured by a flouroimmunometric method. The results showed that the concentration of neuron-specific enolase in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of patients with brain ischemic disease within first seven days significantly increased compared to the control. The highest increase of concentration was established in brain infarction, somewhat lower in reversible ischemic attack, and the lowest in transient ischemic attack. Maximal concentration was established on the 3 rd- 4 th day upon the brain infarction. Neuron-specific enolase concentration in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma may be an indicator of pathophysiological processes in the acute phase of brain ischemia and is significant in early diagnostics and therapy of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Background Bed rest is {{not only}} used in the {{management}} of patients who are not able to mobilise, but is also prescribed as a treatment for a large number of medical conditions, a procedure that has been challenged. We searched the literature for evidence of benefit or harm of bed rest for any condition. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane library, and retrieved reports on randomised controlled trials of bed rest versus early mobilisation for any medical condition, including medical procedures. Findings 39 trials of bed rest for 15 different conditions (total patients 5777) were found. In 24 trials investigating bed rest following a medical procedure, no outcomes improved significantly and eight worsened significantly in some procedures (lumbar puncture, spinal anaesthesia, <b>radiculography,</b> and cardiac catheterisation). In 15 trials investigating bed rest as a primary treatment, no outcomes improved significantly and nine worsened significantly for some conditions (acute low back pain, labour, proteinuric hypertension during pregnancy, myocardial infarction, and acute infectious hepatitis). Interpretation We should not assume any efficacy for bed rest. Further studies need to be done to establish evidence for the benefit or harm of bed rest as a treatment...|$|E
40|$|Consecutive {{patients}} attending {{hospital for}} the first time with backache were entered into a prospective study, provided that certain defined causes (infective, neoplastic, metabolic and inflammatory etc.) were not apparent at the first visit. Amongst 188 available for analysis, 65 % were discharged and 28 % defaulted, together making a total of 93 % who 'recovered unevent-fully ' (in the sense that they were no longer attending hospital) on average in about three months, 4 % came to 'myelography ' (<b>radiculography</b> using Dimer-X or Amipaque) including 2 % to discectomy, 1. 5 % proved to have treatable underlying diseases accounting for their backache while 1. 5 % became 'chronic attenders'. Information available at the first visit (patient charac-teristics, history, examination, radiographs and psychological questionnaire) provided few pointers to what the outcome would be or how long the patient would attend hospital. In particular, routine X-ray examination did not provide clues to any important conditions not already suspected by the clinicians. A case is made for reserving routine radiography for patients who have not recovered within about three months. Low back pain is a problem of daunting proportions, not only because of the suffering which it produces, but also because of economic wastage and demands on health services...|$|E
40|$|Introduction One of the {{reactions}} to ischemia is increased release of glucocorticoid hormones, included in regulation of effects of numerous mediators/modulators {{that could be}} released in the acute phase of brain ischemia. The aim of our investigation was to define temporal dynamics of cortisol concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with different types of ischemic brain disease. Material and methods The study included 263 patients of both sexes, aged 55 - 68 years. History, clinical examination and cerebral computerized tomography were performed to establish the diagnosis. 97 patients had brain infarction, 66 had a reversible ischemic attack, 66 had a transient ischemic attack, and 34 patients had chronic encephalopathy. The control group included 22 age- and sex- matched patients, subjected to diagnostic lumbar <b>radiculography,</b> without disturbances in the cerebrospinal fluid passage. Cortisol concentrations were measured by direct radioimmunoassay. Results and discussion Results obtained in this research showed that in acute brain ischemic period {{there was a significant}} increase of cortisol concentration in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The increase was highest in patients with brain infarction, somewhat lower in reversible ischemic attack, and the lowest in transient ischemic attack compared to controls (331. 7 ± 92. 8 pmol/ml of plasma and 2. 5 ± 1. 1 pmol/ml of cerebrospinal fluid). Maximum concentrations were found during the first two days after insult. The main potentially protective effects of increased cortisol concentrations in patients with acute stroke could be the decrease of effects of deleterious reactions induced by ischemia. This mechanism might be an attempt of organism to compensate for disturbed homeostasis. Conclusion Measurement of cortisol in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with acute stroke is significant for monitoring the intensity of response of an organism to acute brain damage...|$|E
40|$|Background. Leukocyte {{migration}} {{into the}} ischemic {{area is a}} complex process controlled by adhesion molecules (AM) in leukocytes and endothelium, by migratory capacity of leukocytes {{and the presence of}} hemotaxic agents in the tissue. In this research it was supposed that in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients in the acute phase of ischemic brain disease (IBD) there were relevant changes in the concentration of soluble AM (sICAM- 1 sVCAM- 1 and sE-selectin), that could have been the indicators of the intensity of damaging processes in central nervous system (CNS). Methods. The study included 45 IBD patients, 15 with transient ischemic attack (TIA) 15 with reversible ischemic attack (RIA), and 15 with brain infarction (BI) of both sexes, mean age 66 ± 7. Control group consisted of 15 patients with radicular lesions of discal origin, subjected to diagnostic <b>radiculography</b> without the signs of interruption in the passage of CSF. Changes of selected biochemical parameters were determined in all patients in frame 72 hours since the occurence of an ischemic episode. Concentrations of soluble AM were determined in plasma and CSF by ELISA. Total number of leukocytes (TNL) in peripheral blood was determined by hematological analyzer. Results. The results showed that during the first 72 hrs of IBD significant increases occured in TNL and that the increase was progressive compared to the severeness of the disease. Significant increase of soluble AM concentration was shown in plasma of IBD patients. The increase was highest in BI somewhat lower in RIA and the lowest in TIA patients compared to the control. In CSF concentrations of sICAM- 1, sVCAM- 1 and sE-selectin demonstrated similar increasing trend as in plasma. Conclusion. TNL, as well as the soluble AM concentrations in plasma and CSF, were increased during the acute IBD phase and progressive in relation to the severeness of the disease, so that they might have been the indicators of CNS inflammatory reaction intensity. Furthermore, the results indicated their role in IBD pathogenesis and offered the possibility of researching the application of antagonists and/or activity modulators of some of them in IBD therapy...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{in detail the}} clinical spectrum of spinal stenosis {{in a series of}} two hundred and twenty-one patients at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre. It depicts those conditions with which spinal stenosis may be confused, and other conditions with which it is associated. Characteristic symptoms and physical signs are reported and the role and value of different methods of investigation are discussed. The aetiology and pathogenesis of spinal stenosis is discussed and the emphasis turned away from absolute measurements of the dimensions of the bony spinal canal, towards the role of the soft tissues and the dynamic response of the canal and its neural contents to postural change and loading, as evidenced by erect flexion and extension <b>radiculography.</b> The spinal reserve capacity measurement on CT approaches more closely the ideal of measurement of volumetric disproportion of canal and contents, but it takes no account of the dynamics of the canal. Magnetic Resonance Imaging may, in the future, provide the most objective criteria for diagnosis if section thickness can be reduced. Experimental spinal stenosis was produced in a group of immature New Zealand white rabbits. This was induced by sublaminar wiring at three levels at the age of eight weeks and allowing the animals to grow for twenty-four months before sacrifice and analysis of the spines. The effect of sublaminar wiring on the growth and development of the lamina and spinal canal was analysed using a Kontron Ibas Image Analysis Computer, and the results described and statistically analysed. The results of surgery were analysed in detail in a group of seventytwo patients with spinal stenosis at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre. The long-term results were compared with the initial post-operative result and two groups were identified: the stable result and the unstable result. The indications for and results of re-operation were also analysed in a group of twelve patients. Improved understanding of the aetiology of spinal stenosis has enhanced surgical management and results. The extent of surgical decompression must be precisely planned pre-operatively from radiographic and CT studies, and the surgeon must be able to execute this plan at operation. There is now no place for exploratory operations. The objective of surgery is adequate nerve root decompression without spinal de-stabilisation and when this is achieved, re-operation is redundant...|$|E
40|$|Background. Brain {{ischemia}} initiates {{series of}} biochemical reactions that could, directly or indirectly, induce and extend processes that damage numerous cellular and subcellular structures. One of {{the reactions of}} organism to ischemia is the increased release of glucocorticoid hormones, included in regulation of effects of numerous mediators/modulators that could be released in the acute phase of brain ischemia. Considering that brain infarction induced systemic response of organism to stress, we presumed that it reflected the contents of cortisol in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the acute phase of the disease, and that cortisol influenced damaging processes of lipid peroxidation in CNS initiated by ischemia. The aim of our investigation was to define temporal dynamics and manner correlation of cortisol concentration and index of lipid peroxidation (ILP) in the CSF patients in the acute phase of completed stroke. Methods. In this investigation we followed changes of cortisol concentration and ILP in the CSF of 53 patients in the acute phase of completed stroke. Control group included 14 age and sex matched patients, subjected to diagnostic lumbar <b>radiculography</b> because of the sudden motor deficiency onset, without disturbances in the CSF passage and without pain {{and the consequences of}} anti-pain and anti-inflammatory therapy. From the perspective of the duration of period after an ischemic episode patients were divided into four groups: group A: 0 - 6 hours (n= 12), group B: 7 - 12 hours (n= 14), group C: 13 - 24 hours (n= 14), and group D: 24 - 48 hours of postischemic period (n= 13). Concentration of cortisol in the CSF was measured by quantitative RIA method (Cortisol Bridge kit, Biodata). The ILP was determined according to the spectrophotometric method. Results. Concentration of cortisol in the CSF of patients with completed stroke was of amount 69 ± 6. 7 pmol/ml CSF and was significantly increased (p< 0. 001) compared to the values of the control group (2. 49 ± 0. 29 pmol/ml CSF). From 0 to 6 hours after the ischemic insults concentration of cortisol in the CSF the amount was 15. 9 ± 2. 4 pmol/ml CSF (p< 0. 001), then was progressively increasing and was maximal from 13 to 24 hours after insults (123. 2 ± 7. 1 pmol/ml CSF), (p< 0. 001). In patients with completed stroke ILP in the CSF was twice increased in the course of 48 hours compared to controls (0. 54 ± 0. 08 nmolMDA/ml CSF), (p< 0. 05). By comparing the observed parameters we found significant negative correlation between this two indicators in period from 7 to 24 hours (r=- 0. 77), (p< 0. 001). Conclusion. The main potentially protective effect of the increased CSF cortisol concentration in patients with completed stroke in the acute phase could be the decrease of deleterious effects of lipid peroxidation reactions induced by ischemia. This mechanism could be the attempt of organism to compensate ischemia-disturbed homeostasis...|$|E
