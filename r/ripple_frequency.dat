40|$|Abstract—Closed loop {{converters}} {{are strongly}} nonlinear system. Dynamic behavior {{is difficult to}} investigate by traditional approach. For some PWM controlled converters, low <b>frequency</b> <b>ripple</b> may occur in the output voltage and results in unsteadiness to the system. In this paper buck converter is taken as an example to investigate the stability feature. A delay in the feedback loop is related with stability closely, so the converters with delay and without delay are analyzed in detail, respectively. The second-order differential equation for output voltage profile is established. Characteristic equations are deduced from the differential equations. Based on Hurwitz Stability Criterion, stability requirement is derived from characteristic equations. It is shown that converters without delay in the feedback loop are steady. On the other hand converters with delay in feedback loop may produce low <b>frequency</b> <b>ripple</b> in some cases. Regulating parameters can avoid the low <b>frequency</b> <b>ripple</b> phenomenon. The <b>frequency</b> and amplitude of the low <b>frequency</b> <b>ripple</b> voltage are determined by using zero-pole analysis method. The proposed approach is verified by simulation and experiment. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the analysis is correct...|$|R
40|$|Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) are {{population}} oscillatory {{patterns in}} hippocampal LFPs during deep sleep and immobility, {{involved in the}} replay of memories acquired during wakefulness. SWRs have been extensively studied, but their exact generation mechanism is still unknown. A computational model has suggested that fast perisomatic inhibition may generate the high <b>frequency</b> <b>ripples</b> (~ 200 Hz). Another model showed how replay of memories can be controlled by various classes of inhibitory interneurons targeting specific parts of pyramidal cells (PC) and firing at particular SWR phases. Optogenetic studies revealed new roles for interneuronal classes and rich dynamic interplays between them, shedding new light in their potential role in SWRs. Here, we integrate these findings in a conceptual model of how dendritic and somatic inhibition may collectively contribute to the SWR generation. We suggest that sharp wave excitation and basket cell (BC) recurrent inhibition synchronises BC spiking in <b>ripple</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This rhythm is imposed on bistratified cells which prevent pyramidal bursting.

Previous methods such as the widely used Speech Transmission Index (STI) fail to account for masking effects that arise from the highly nonlinear cochlear transfer function. We therefore propose a Neural Articulation Index (NAI) that estimates speech intelligibility from the instantaneous neural spike rate over time, produced when a signal is processed by an auditory neural model. By using a well developed model of the auditory periphery and detection theory we show that human perceptual discrimination closely matches the modeled distortion in the instantaneous spike rates of the auditory nerve.

5000|$|The circuit {{works by}} {{alternately}} switching {{the output of}} each stage between a voltage doubler driven by [...] and one driven by [...] This behaviour leads to another advantage over the Dickson multiplier: reduced ripple voltage at double the frequency. The increase in <b>ripple</b> <b>frequency</b> is advantageous because {{it is easier to}} remove by filtering. Each stage (in an ideal circuit) raises the output voltage by the peak clock voltage. Assuming that this is the same level as the DC input voltage then an n stage multiplier will (ideally) output nVin. The chief cause of losses in the cross-coupled circuit is parasitic capacitance rather than switching threshold voltage. The losses occur because some of the energy has to go into charging up the parasitic capacitances on each cycle.|$|E
50|$|Sex {{discrimination}} in Gerridae is determined through communication of <b>ripple</b> <b>frequency</b> produced {{on the water}} surface. Males predominantly produce these ripples in the water. There are three main frequencies found in ripple communication: 25 Hz as a repel signal, 10 Hz as a threat signal, and 3 Hz as a courtship signal. An approaching gerrid will first give out a repel signal to let the other water strider know they are in its area. If the other gerrid does not return the repel signal, then the bug knows it is a female and will switch to the courtship signal. A receptive female will lower her abdomen and allow the male to mount her and mate. A non-receptive female will raise her abdomen and emit a repel signal. Males that are allowed to mate stay attached to the same female for the entire reproductive season. This {{is to ensure that}} the female's young belong to the mounting male and thus guarantee the spread of his genes. Females oviposit, or lay their eggs, by submerging and attaching the eggs to stable surfaces such as plants or stones. Some water strider species will lay the eggs at the water edge if the body of water is calm enough. The amount of eggs laid depends on the amount of food available to the mother during the reproductive season. The availability of food and dominance among other gerrids in the area both play crucial roles in the amount of food obtained and thus, resulting fecundity. Water striders will reproduce all year long in tropical regions where it remains warm, but only during the warm months in seasonal habitats. Gerrids that live in environments with winters will overwinter in the adult stage. This is due to the large energy cost which would need to be spent to maintain their body temperature at functional levels. These water striders have been found in leaf litter or under stationary shelters such as logs and rocks during the winter in seasonal areas. This reproductive diapause is a result of shortening day lengths during larval development and seasonal variation in lipid levels. Shorter day length signals the water strider of the coming temperature drops, also acting as a physical signal the body uses to store lipids throughout the body as food sources. Water striders use these lipids to metabolize during their hibernation. The length of the hibernation depends when the environment warms and the days become longer again.|$|E

40|$|This thesis proposes the {{adaptive}} PI gain control to regulate sinusoidal ripple current (SRC) in battery charger systems. The SRC charge method is suited for fast and efficient charging. Y. D Lee (2015) propose that SRC charge method {{can reduce the}} charging time, decrease the charging temperature and improve the charging efficiency by applying optimal frequency to charge the battery. In order to determine optimal frequency for charging, the swept frequency is required in SRC charge method. Therefore, in order to perform SRC charge approach, the battery charger systems have {{to be capable of}} handling swept frequency input and regulating high <b>frequency</b> <b>ripple</b> current. However, the conventional designed charger {{would not be able to}} satisfy the aforementioned requirements because the control bandwidth of a fixed PI control gains is not designed for SRC but for a constant current profile. Therefore, the fixed PI gain control is limited to regulate the wide range <b>frequency</b> of <b>ripple</b> current. The solution to the aforementioned issue is to apply {{the adaptive}} PI gain control based on Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) so that it can regulate variable <b>frequency</b> of charging <b>ripple</b> current. The proposed approach shows that MRAC is the suitable solution for SRC charging because it is easily equipped into the conventional PI controller of a digital signal processor without any adjustments to the hardware design. As a result, there is no attenuation and phase delay under variable <b>ripple</b> <b>frequencies</b> condition (1 ~ 600 Hz). The performance of current control is compared with conventional fixed PI gain and the proposed adaptive variable gain. The proposed method is verified with simulation and experimental results...|$|R

Hippocamposeptal neurons provide direct inhibitory feedback from the hippocampus onto septal cells, and are therefore likely to also {{play an important role}} in the circuit; these neurons fire at either low or high frequency, reflecting hippocampal network activity during theta oscillations or ripple events, respectively. Here, we optogenetically target the long-range GABAergic projection from the hippocampus to the medial septum in rats, and thereby simulate hippocampal input onto downstream septal cells in an acute slice preparation. In response to optogenetic activation of hippocamposeptal fibers at theta and <b>ripple</b> <b>frequencies,</b> we elicit postsynaptic GABAergic responses in a subset (24 %) of septal cells, most predominantly in fast-spiking cells. In addition, in another subset of septal cells (19 %) corresponding primarily to cholinergic cells, we observe a slow hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and a decrease in input resistance, particularly in response to prolonged high-frequency (ripple range) stimulation. This slow response is partially sensitive to GIRK channel and D 2 dopamine receptor block.

How entorhinal ensembles form, interact, and accomplish emer-gent processes such as memory formation is not well-understood. We lack sufficient understanding of how neuronal ensembles in general can func-tion transiently and distinctively from other neuronal ensembles. Ensem-ble interactions are bound, foremost, by anatomical connectivity and temporal constraints on neuronal discharge. We present {{an overview of the}} structure of neuronal interactions within the entorhinal cortex {{and the rest of the}} hippocampal formation. We wish to highlight two principle features of entorhinal-hippocampal interactions. First, large numbers of entorhinal neurons are organized into at least two distinct high-frequency population patterns: gamma (40 – 100 Hz) frequency volleys and ripple (140 – 200 Hz) frequency volleys. These patterns occur coincident with other well-defined electrophysiological patterns. Gamma frequency vol-leys are modulated by the theta cycle. <b>Ripple</b> <b>frequency</b> volleys occur on each sharp wave event. Second, these patterns occur dominantly in specific layers of the entorhinal cortex. Theta/gamma frequency volleys are the principle pattern observed in layers I–III, in the neurons that receive cortical inputs and project to the hippocampus. <b>Ripple</b> <b>frequency</b> volleys are the principle population pattern observed in layers V–VI, in the neurons that receive hippocampal output and project primarily to the neocortex.

40|$|High-frequency {{oscillations}} (HFOs) are {{an intriguing}} potential biomarker for epilepsy, typically categorized according to peak <b>frequency</b> as either <b>ripples</b> (100 – 250 Hz) or fast ripples (250 Hz). In the hippocampus, fast ripples were originally {{thought to be}} more specific to epileptic tissue, but it is still very difficult to distinguish which HFOs are caused by normal versus pathological brain activity. In this study, we use a computational model of hippocampus to investigate possible network mechanisms underpinning normal ripples, pathological ripples, and fast ripples. Our results unify several prior findings regarding HFO mechanisms, and also make several new predictions regarding abnormal HFOs. We show that HFOs are generic, emergent phenomena whose charac-teristics reflect a wide range of connectivity and network input. Although produced by different mechanisms, both normal and abnormal HFOs generate similar <b>ripple</b> <b>frequencies,</b> underscoring that peak frequency is unable to distinguish the two. Abnormal ripples are generic phenomena that arise when input to pyramidal cells overcomes network inhibition, resulting in high-frequency, uncoordinated firing. In addition, fast ripples transiently and sporadically arise from the precise conditions that produce abnormal ripples. Lastly, we show that such abnormal conditions do not require any specific network structure to produce coherent HFOs, as even completely asynchronous activity is capable of producing abnormal ripples and fast ripples in this manner.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this case}} report was to study the {{relationship}} between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spikes, and seizures in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. IntroductionDuring intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), HFOs {{are thought to be}} a marker for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). High-frequency oscillations are classified into <b>ripples</b> with <b>frequencies</b> of 70 – 200 Hz and fast <b>ripples</b> with <b>frequencies</b> of 200 – 500 Hz. Although HFOs are thought to be a marker for the SOZ, their relationship to spikes has not been studied in detail, especially within the SOZ. MethodsWe studied the time course of ripples and spikes in a patient undergoing intracranial EEG. Medications were discontinued on day one. She suffered three seizures on day three. Her SOZ was in the left hippocampus, which displayed abundant ripples and spikes. Ripples, spikes with simultaneous ripples, and spikes without ripples were counted for this study. ResultsWe found that ripples and spikes in the SOZ had a marked diurnal variation. Ripples, spikes with ripples, and spikes without ripples increased and decreased in concert until just before seizure onset, when ripples and spikes with ripples increased markedly. Spikes without ripples did not increase. ConclusionsThese results support ripples as a marker for SOZ and show that they co-occur with spikes. Seizure onset was heralded by an increase in ripples and spikes with ripples, without an increase in spikes without ripples. We hypothesize that spikes associated with ripples may have a somewhat different pathophysiological mechanism than spikes not associated with ripples, differences that may be relevant for the timing of seizure onset...|$|R
