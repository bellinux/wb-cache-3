40|$|This paper {{examines}} the progress and prospects {{for sustainable development}} in the Cameron Highlands, Peninsular Malaysia, focusing especially on agriculture. Vegetable, flower and fruit production in the Highlands have caused extensive forest clearance and the excavation of valley sides and floors.

Unsustainable agriculture has severe impacts on the Cameron Highlands environment, wildlife, tourism, and local people’s well being, and its effects are felt further afield, especially through the degradation of {{quality and quantity of}} water supplies which flow to surrounding lowlands.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The INTERREG IIIB NWE funded ‘nofdp ’ project {{promotes}} a nature-oriented approach towards flood damage prevention (www. nofdp. net). It addresses {{a combination of}} both technical and non-technical measures to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> and to improve nature at the same time. One of the project’s key deliverables is the interactive planning and communication software nofdp IDSS (Information and Decision Support System) which is open source and free of charge for the user. The software is designed to assist water managers in the interactive and iterative process of developing and communicating alternative flood risk management strategies, which keep track with a balanced view on the often conflicting issues of spatial planning, flood damage prevention and ecological development. Eight project partners from The Netherlands and Germany were directly involved in the development process. A consortium formed by Björnsen Consulting Engineers (GER) and WL | Delft Hydraulics (NL) implemented the descriptive concept that was developed by the nofdp project partners. A first key functionality of interaction enables the user to position 22 different types of measures of flood control on a map within a GIS environment. At the same time, the user can assess existing and new spatial conflicts. Individual measures can be grouped to form variants and evaluated interactively.

This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as coastal protection from hurricanes by mangroves for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting cattle.

Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to devaluation of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former coffee plantations in Finca Santa Fe, Costa Rica. The pollination services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.

40|$|The {{water flow}} in rivers during floods {{has a strong}} impact on the {{transport}} system infrastructure – roads, bridges, dams, etc. The frequency and intensity of flood events increase with high water levels and considerable discharges, thus raising the loads on engineering structures in rivers and, at the same time, the possibility of damage. The stability of piers, abutments, guide banks, and spur dikes in floods depends on the dimensions of scour holes at foundations. By preliminary computing the scour development in time during floods, we can estimate a possible scour-depth value induced by expected floods. According to the calculated scour value, protection measures can be taken if necessary, which will reduce the economical and environmental losses. A method for predicting the damage risk of bridge structures during multiple floods is presented. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> is studied {{from the viewpoint of}} scouring. The method is based on two approaches to scour calculation: (1) determination of the scour development in time during multiple floods and (2) determination of the designed equilibrium depth of scour. Using these two methods, we suggest estimating the factor of flood damage risk as a ratio between the scour depth calculated during/after multiple floods and the designed equilibrium scour depth. Under critical conditions, when the scour depth calculated in floods is close to the designed equilibrium stage of scour for bridge foundations, emergency protection measures should be taken to avoid the failure of bridge structures...|$|E

Recently, a US senatorial sub-committee on disaster prediction and prevention recently underlined the necessity for developing an effective preventive Pan American warning system to warn the affected population of potential terrorist acts or natural disasters. These warning systems aim to identify areas that are susceptible to be struck by natural disasters. Early warning systems are key tools for local and national governments to avoid losses of human lives and decrease infrastructure impacts caused by destructive elements. Econova Flood Warning System (FWS) integrates the available climatic and water level information with realtime data processing and forecast modeling, and state-of-the-art information broadcasting technology.

40|$|Purpose – Climate {{change will}} present many new {{challenges}} for {{professionals in the}} built environment. Observers have speculated {{that the increase in}} damage to property caused by more frequent and severe flood events may result in loss of property value. However a consistent link between flood risk and value has not been proven in the UK to date. This paper aims to investigate the impact of flooding on property value in the UK. Design/methodology/approach – As part of an ongoing study into the impact of flooding on property value in the UK, the available international evidence has been examined and general lessons drawn. A case study is presented of an example site, flooded in 2000, using actual transaction data. Findings – This research demonstrates that, in general, there is a tendency for people to forget about the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> with time. However, various manifestations of floodplain designation or regulation including mandatory insurance purchase can maintain awareness in the longer term. For the case study the impact of the flood on house prices is seen to be temporary, lasting less than three years. Research limitations/implications – Both the case study and the previous international research indicate that studies of the price impact of flood events should consider temporal aspects. Tentative conclusions from a single case study suggest that taking the long view of likely future recovery could promote price stability for flooded communities. Originality/value – The discounting of flood-prone property is naturally of concern to property stakeholders including the valuation profession and property owners. This research is unique in using transaction data to measure flood impacts in the UK...|$|E
40|$|The Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District {{occupies}} a valley and adjoining mesa along the lower Gila River, {{in the southwestern}} part of the State of Arizona. The area has been irrigated for centuries, and now shows problems which reflect past and present water management. First, the water supplies came from the Gila River; later, the groundwater reservoir was used and within about 30 years, groundwater levels declined and salt accumulation, {{as a consequence of}} water recirculation, put a limit on attempts to maintain irrigated agriculture. Recently, Colorado River water was brought into the area as the solution to assure permanent large-scale irrigation development. The application of water for crops and leaching of salts caused serious drainage problems. Salinity also caused a problem out of the District as drainage water from the aquifer with high salt content reached the Colorado River and became a source of friction between the United States and Mexico. The water conveyance system in the District is unique in that irrigation water is pumped up the valley into the distribution system. During flood flows along the lower Gila River, this leads to the situation where water is going down the River with little chance to be used, and goes up the valley through a sophisticated conveyance system. Flood flows along the lower Gila River are dependent on infrequent releases from Painted Rock Reservoir, at the upstream boundary of the lower Gila River. The few times they have occurred (2 in 15 years), they created high groundwater levels which were damaging to crop production. The water problems in the District could have short-run solutions through technically possible and economically feasible management practices. The objectives of the study are focused on better use of the water resources, reduction <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damages,</b> and decrease <b>of</b> salt content of water being diverted to Mexico. A mathematical model was developed to analyze the impact of selected alternatives which could meet these objectives upon the hydrologic system of the District. The application of Strategy I, which proposes the increase of the irrigated acreage by about 5, 000 acres, proved to be impracticable under present management conditions since the amount of drainage water to be disposed would be greater than the capacity of the disposal system. Strategies II, III, and IV, which propose increasing levels <b>of</b> change from <b>flood</b> to sprinkler irrigation (25, 50 and 100 rcent) showed results that although not economically encouraging, provide, however, for solution of the internal water problem of the area, and substantial decrease of drainage flow of high salt content delivered to the Colorado River. Strategies V and VI, which proposed reduction by 50 percent or complete elimination of riparian vegetation also proved to be impracticable. Under present management conditions in the District, phreatophytes are an important auxiliary of the water discharge system of the area. Strategies VII and VIII showed that the combination of changes to sprinkler irrigation and reduction of riparian vegetation at levels proposed (50 and 100 percent) practically counteract each other in terms of drainage water to be pumped and does not achieve the proposed objectives. Change in the water management system of the Wellton-Mohawk District would solve its water problems and significantly reduce salinity of the Colorado River water at Morelos Dam, for which {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} will be expended in a desalting complex. Drainage from excessive irrigation on the mesa flowing into the valley aquifer is the main cause of high groundwater levels there.

Specific investigations are confined to two locations within the Klondyke reach of the river, namely Intake Bend and Klondyke Bend. A fluvial geomorphological assessment of the Rangitata River, and specifically the Klondyke reach, is carried out to facilitate the selection of appropriate erosion mitigation measures. Historical flood data for the Rangitata River are analysed and a flood frequency analysis using annual maximum discharge data is carried out. A <b>risk</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> to the RDR intake structure and canal at Intake Bend is undertaken using the results <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> frequency analysis and a calibrated MIKE 11 numerical hydraulic model.

An analysis {{of the effect of}} RDR water abstraction on bed aggradation in the river below the RDR intake is undertaken using the river flow-duration curve and semi-empirical sediment transport equations. Assessment of erosion trends and mitigation options at Klondyke Bend are undertaken primarily through analysis of historical photographs and river discharge data. River morphology trends are inferred from study of river terrace remnants, recent river bank erosion, bar morphology and intervening discharge regimes. A generic analysis of the effects on river bed and water surface profiles from a proposed bend cut-off, to mitigate erosion at Klondyke Bend, is undertaken using a HEC- 6 morphological model.

40|$|Wave induced set-up is {{a process}} that leads to {{increased}} water levels in coastal regions. When coupled with storm conditions, wave set-up – or, for brevity, set-up – can significantly increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> or structural <b>damage</b> and therefore is of particular importance when considering coastal management or issues related to the planning of nearshore infrastructures. Here, we investigate the effects of set-up in the coastal region of the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea, close to Tallinn, Estonia, although the results will have wider relevance for many other areas. Due to a lack of continuous wave data we employ modelling to provide input data using a calculation scheme based on a high-resolution (470 m) spectral wave model WAM to replicate spatial patterns of wave properties based on high-quality, instrument-measured wind data from the neighbourhood of the study site. The results indicate that for the specific geometry of coastline under consideration, there is a variation in set-up which is strongly affected by wind direction. The maximum set-up values are up to 70 – 80 cm in selected locations. This is more than 50 % of the all-time maximum water level and thus may serve as a substantial source of marine hazard for several low-lying regions around the city. Wind directions during storms have changed in recent years and, with climate variability potentially increasing, these results will encourage further tests which may be used in a policy setting regarding defences or other structures in and around coastlines. In particular, with urban development now taking place in many coastal regions (including the one within this study) these results have implications for local planners. They may also be incorporated into new storm warning systems...|$|R
40|$|Floods {{are common}} natural {{disaster}} occurring {{in most parts}} of the world. This results in damage to human life and deterioration of environment. There have been immense uses of technology to mitigate measures of flood disaster i. e. structurally and non-structurally. Undoubtedly, structural measures are very expensive and time consuming which involves physical work like construction of dams, reservoirs, bridges, channel improvement, river diversion and other embankments to keep floods away from people. Whereas non-structural measures is concerned with planning like flood forecasting and warning, flood plain zoning, relief and rehabilitation for reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> to keep people away from floods. Thus, non-structural measures involve analysis, planning providing spatial information on maps with high accuracy in less time. Non-structural measures can help decision maker to plan an effective emergency response towards flood disaster. A one of the good way to plan non-structural measures is to analyze impact of flood in the flood prone areas. The thesis tries to analyze impact of flood on environment along the demarcated flood prone areas of Lake Roxen and Lake Glan in Östergötland County, Sweden. The thesis also proposes how to use current flood information during flood emergency utilizing geographical information system. This provides spatial information for area in the flood zone for assessment regarding flood vulnerability. Using map overlay analysis in GIS software (ArcGIS); flood prone areas and topographic data along Lake Roxen and Lake Glan were digitized from PDF maps. Thus, the thesis work is an effort to analyze impact of flood when areas along Lake Roxen and Lake Glan are flooded. ESRI® GIS software Arc Map 9 and Arc View 3. 3 is used for data preparation, integrating, analyzing, and spatial data with attribute table information.

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Severe {{floods in}} the Western Cape have caused {{significant}} damage to hydraulic structures, roads and other infrastructure {{over the past}} decade. The current design criteria for these structures and flood return level calculations {{are based on the}} concept of stationarity, which assumes that natural systems vary within an envelope of variability that does not change with time. In the context of regional climate change and projected changes in rainfall intensity, the basis for these calculations may become unrealistic with the passage of time. Hydraulic structures and other infrastructure may become more vulnerable to damaging floods because of changing hydroclimatic conditions. This project assesses the changes in extreme rainfall values over time across the Western Cape, South Africa. Using a Generalised Pareto Distribution, this study examines the changes in return levels across the Western Cape region for the periods 1900 - 1954 and 1955 - 2010. Of the 137 rainfall stations used in this research, 85 (62 %) showed an increase in 50 -year return level, 30 (22 %) a decrease in 50 -year return level and 22 (16 %) stations displayed little change in rainfall intensity over time. While there were no clear spatial patterns to the results, they clearly indicate an increase in frequency of intense rainfalls {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th and early 21 st century. The changes in return level are also accompanied by a change in the frequency of high intensity 2 - 3 day long storms. 115 (84 %) of the 137 rainfall stations showed an increase in the frequency of long duration, high intensity storms over the data record. This change generates a shifting risk profile of extreme rainfalls, which, in turn, creates challenges for the design of hydraulic structures and any infrastructure exposed to the resulting damaging floods. It can therefore be argued that it is inappropriate to design structures or manage water resources assuming stationarity of climate and that these principles should be assessed in order to reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> owing to increasing storm intensity.

40|$|As {{humans have}} adapted river systems to meet theirneeds, the natural {{variability}} characteristic of rivers {{has been greatly}} reduced. Most rivers are no longer free to course across the landscape unimpeded by infrastruc-ture (Surian and Rinaldi 2003; Pinter 2005), and most major rivers no longer exhibit their historic range of flow variability (Postel and Richter 2003; Poff et al. 2007). Yet, flow variability over time and space is a fundamental characteristic of natural rivers and a river’s “flow regime”, in concert with sediment inputs, determines not only geomorphic adjustments, but biotic composition and rates of key ecosystem processes, such as primary produc-tion (Poff et al. 1997). These adjustments, which include the lateral migration of channels and dynamic interac-tions between the streambed, floodplain, and riparian zone, {{are part of a}} healthy river’s response to changes in the surrounding landscape and changes in discharge. In fact, these adjustments allow rivers to absorb disturbances and buffer the ecosystem and surrounding land from the impacts <b>of</b> <b>floods</b> and anthropogenic effects. The ability of rivers and their biota to respond to altered flow regimes is not, however, unbounded. Changes brought on by urbanization, excessive water withdrawals, or climate shifts that occur rapidly and lead to flows outside the natural range of variability will have important consequences for river ecosystems and the people who depend on them (Lettenmaier et al. 1999; Poff et al. 2002; Palmer et al. 2007). Native riverine biodiversity and productivity may decline, water quality for human consumption may be compromised, and in some regions, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding,</b> with concomitant <b>damage</b> to property and people, may increase (Bunn and Arthington 2002; Allan et al. 2005; Naiman et al. 2005).

The high variance that is commonly associated with absolute <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> assessments is the reason for the present study that investigates the reliability of estimates of relative changes in the development <b>of</b> potential <b>flood</b> <b>damage.</b> While studies that estimate (relative) changes in <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> over time usually address uncertainties resulting from different projections (e. g. land-use characteristics), the influence <b>of</b> different <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> modelling approaches on estimates of relative changes in the development <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> is largely unknown. In this paper, we evaluate the reliability of estimates of relative changes in <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> along the river Rhine between 1990 and 2030 in terms of different flood-damage modelling approaches. The results show that relative estimates <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> developments differ by a factor of 1. 4. These variations, which result from the application of different modelling approaches, are considerably smaller than differences between the approaches in terms of absolute damage estimates (by a factor of 3. 5 to 3. 8), or than differences resulting from land-use projections (by a factor of 3). The differences that exist when estimating relative changes principally depend on the differences in damage functions. In order to improve the reliability of relative estimates of changes in the development <b>of</b> potential <b>flood</b> <b>damage,</b> future research should focus on reducing the uncertainties related to damage functions. © Author(s) 2011...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructure {{located along}} the U. S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts {{is exposed to}} rising <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> from sea level rise, {{increasing}} storm surge, and subsidence. In these circumstances coastal management commonly based on 100 -year flood maps assuming current climatology is no longer adequate. A dynamic programming cost–benefit analysis {{is applied to the}} adaptation decision, illustrated by application to an energy facility in Galveston Bay. Projections of several global climate models provide inputs to estimates of the change in hurricane and storm surge activity as well as the increase in sea level. The projected rise in physical flood risk is combined with estimates <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> and protection costs in an analysis of the multi-period nature of adaptation choice. The result is a planning method, using dynamic programming, which is appropriate for investment and abandonment decisions under rising coastal risk...|$|R

40|$|Public flood {{protection}} cannot totally eliminate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding.</b> Hence, private mitigation measures which proactively protect homes from being flooded or reduce <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> are {{an essential part}} <b>of</b> modern <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> management. This study analyses private flood mitigation measures among German households. The dataset covers more than 6000 households {{from all parts of}} the country, including flood plains as well as areas which are typically not at a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> riverine <b>flooding.</b> The results suggest that the propensity to mitigate <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> increases i. a. with past damage experience and damage expectations for the future. The latter effect can be interpreted as a ’climate adaptation signal’ in the flood mitigation behaviour. All other factors remaining equal, a strong belief in a climate-change-induced increase <b>of</b> personal <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> in the next decades induces an increase of the probability <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> mitigation by more than 10 percentage points. Moreover, strong evidence for moral hazard effects in the flood mitigation behaviour cannot be observed. Households expecting insurance coverage do not reduce their mitigation efforts. Likewise, the expectation of government relief payments hinders mitigation only for some groups of households...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damages</b> {{and the effects}} of structural and non-structural <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> mitigation measures in Korea. First, a theoretical discussion of the structural and non-structural measures to mitigate <b>flood</b> <b>damages</b> was used to select the variables and devise the hypotheses. An analysis was conducted using the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA) time series methodology, Korean socioeconomic data, and <b>damage</b> characteristics <b>of</b> major <b>flood</b> events. The effects <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> mitigation measures on the extent <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> <b>damages</b> were assessed using an intervention time series model. The major findings were that the intervention effects of structural and non-structural measures were statistically significant from 1958 to 2013 (a period of 55 years) and that while the former were ineffective at mitigating <b>flood</b> <b>damages,</b> the latter were successful in doing so. Based on the above findings, policy suggestions for future <b>flood</b> <b>damage</b> mitigation measures in Korea were offered. For structural measures, the government should manage its existing facilities, recover ecosystems of damaged rivers, and devise mitigation measures for urban areas. For non-structural measures, the government should enhance its flood forecasting capacity, revise laws related to flood control and prevention, and update and rationalize land-use plans...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> current <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> allocation {{and the use}} <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> easements as a means <b>of</b> reallocating <b>flood</b> <b>risk</b> and reducing total <b>flood</b> <b>damages</b> in large river floodplains. Changes in agricultural floodplain land use and levels of crop insurance coverage as the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> changes are simulated using mathematical programming. The net benefits <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> easements to {{a portion of the}} Lagrange Reach of the Illinois River region are then simulated. Our results indicate that flood easements may provide positive net benefits. This positive result stems primarily from the decreased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> for non-inundated agricultural levee districts, rather than from reduced municipal <b>flood</b> <b>damages.</b> Our results are robust to changes in the estimated dollar damages, yet extremely sensitive to changes in hydrological estimates.
