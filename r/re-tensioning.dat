5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} is the appearance and propagation of tears in the fabric, this issue has been partially investigated [...] and represents a fundamental data in {{the determination of the}} safety factor which should be used for a specific structure. Because tear propagation generally occurs at 25% UTS, the safety factor is generally higher than four. The test is carried out on a sample taken from a dismounted structure or by using conditioned samples of fabric which aim to reproduce the in-situ conditions. The load profile should reproduce the expected overload by pulling the sample until breakage, which should start far from the sample edge and the clamping system. The repetition of the test and different temperatures (generally -20 °C and +70 °C) offers important information about the joint behaviour at extreme conditions, such as heavy snow fall with temperatures below zero or a blast of wind during a hot summer. This type of test is generally required by designers and manufacturers and those in charge of the evaluation of the structure behaviour and the final test of the structure. Finally, in order to prevent collapses due to ponding and fluttering, the creep behaviour should be carefully considered in the design, choosing anchorages which enable periodical <b>re-tensioning</b> according to the predicted fall in the level of pre-stress. It is based on a monoaxial test but an accurate investigation requires the use of virgin cruciform samples of fabric and the force is applied by means of counter weights. The creep is defined as the “increase in strain with time when a constant force is applied” [...] and aims to describe the material behaviour when a constant force is applied {{over a long period of}} time. This has a considerable effect on the design and realisation of the membrane structure because a progressive increase in the material strain leads to a considerable reduction in the level of pre-stress initially induced in the structure. The sample should be maintained at a constant temperature and for specific applications it may require a proper climatic chamber for investigations at high and low temperatures.There are no complete studies about the dynamic behaviour of coated fabric and foils for structural applications. A dynamic test on coated fabrics can evaluate the response under fast loading and unloading cycles due to blasts of wind or other sources of stress. It should consider a conditioned fabric which reproduces the in-situ conditions and the testing apparatus should be able to apply a high speed load profile which is generally not possible with a common testing rig equipped with electric servomotors. The results of this type of test, despite the absence of research which can support these expectations, can highlight anomalies in the fabric strength and in the tear propagation with consequent adjustments in the safety factor applied.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the case}} of the French stretcher, a mitre joint is used to adhere the corners. [...] "Keys" [...] or small {{triangle}} wedges are inserted in the joint after stretching the canvas to give the canvas its final tension. When fastening the canvas, pressure should be distributed evenly around the stretcher to minimize warping due to unequal distribution of pull. Unlike other types of stretchers, the corner joints in French stretchers are not glued or fastened in any permanent way. This allows the canvas to be <b>re-tensioned</b> later, as it has a natural tendency to stretch and sag over time. In contrast, strainer bars stretch canvas in a fixed (non-adjustable) way.|$|R
40|$|The {{time-dependent}} phenomena effects {{might play}} an important role in the structural behavior of a cable-stayed bridge during construction and in service. In fact, because of these effects the target state of stresses (Objective Service Stage, OSS) can only be achieved at a certain target time. In the literature, a number of software have been presented to study creep and shrinkage effects during cantilever erection of cable-stayed bridges. Nevertheless, the effects of these phenomena in the alternative erection technique, the temporary support erection method, have received little attention. Furthermore, none of the presented software are able to: (1) Define a determined OSS for a given time including the time-dependent phenomena effects and the evolutionary erection of the superstructure. (2) Simulate the construction process assuring the achievement of a given OSS without the need of an overall iterative process taking into account time-dependent phenomena. (3) Provide the prestressing sequence in such a way that no additional tensioning operations are required to correct creep and shrinkage effects in service. To fill all these gaps, a new algorithm, the Forward-Direct Algorithm (FDA), is formally presented in this paper to simulate the construction process of cable-stayed bridges built on temporary supports. The main innovation of this algorithm consists of introducing the time-dependent phenomena effects into the unstressed length of the stays concept to calculate the prestressing strains to be introduced during the last <b>re-tensioning</b> operation. The application of the unstressed length concept has major advantages both in the simulation (as the OSS can be achieved without any overall iterative process) and in service (as <b>re-tensioning</b> operations to correct time-dependent phenomena effects can be avoided). To illustrate the creep and shrinkage effects during the construction and in service the FDA is applied to a real cable-stayed bridge. Furthermore, an analysis to define the optimum time to achieve the OSS is presented. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the mechanical behaviour of coated fabrics used for architectural membranes can lead to significant improvements in the design of tensile surface structures. The plane biaxial test on a cruciform specimen is considered to be the most appropriate test to characterise the complex non-linear behaviour of such membrane material. The biaxial tests described in the literature are usually carried out under prescribed stress histories at various, constant stress ratios. The present contribution describes some strain-controlled biaxial tests carried out at Politecnico di Milano, in which the strains in the central square of the specimen are prescribed. Such tests can be particularly meaningful in relation to installation and <b>re-tensioning</b> processes. Since they imply a variable stress ratio, the results obtained by these non-traditional tests complement the ones of stress-controlled experiments. It appears that these two types of biaxial tests can be exploited jointly in order to select and calibrate constitutive models for coated fabrics; these are needed for the overall modelling of tensile structures, with the aim of simulating both the response under external loadings and the installation process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: When {{tension is}} applied to steel tendons they {{elongate}} {{in proportion to the}} tensile force, as predicted by Hooke’s law. This elongation is used by the South African standard on concrete structural works (SANS 2001 -CC 1) and South African standard specification for road and bridgeworks (COLTO) to determine the adequacy of the force applied in a tendon. The standards prescribe an elongation variation limit of ± 6 % and an average elongation variation limit of ± 3 %. According to these standards, if the elongation variation of the tendon falls outside these prescribed limits it must be {{brought to the attention of}} the engineer. The scatter of tendon elongation results is often greater than the range prescribed by these standards. This usually requires the contractor to re-tension the tendons at huge financial costs.

5000|$|Richard Whitaker and David Stuart then {{introduced}} a key improvement to the system. Early {{versions of the}} Spademan required the skier to clamp the binding onto the plate by tightening the spring with the rotating nut. Whitaker and Stuart suggesting having the spring on an arm that rotated upward, positioned over a cam {{at the rear of}} the binding. When the arm was rotated up, it would slide off the top of the cam and release all the tension. It could then be <b>re-tensioned</b> onto the plate by pushing the spring back down onto the cam. Spademan later further improved on this design, adding a latch to keep the clamp arms open. In use, the skier would remove the binding as normal by lifting the spring off the cam, but could then return it immediately to the [...] "clamped" [...] position. The latch kept the clamps open until a small button under the binding plate was depressed, which happened when the skier stepped back into the binding. This gave the Spademan [...] "step in" [...] performance, which previous models lacked.|$|R
40|$|In {{a ground}} anchor system, cables or tendons {{connected}} to a bearing plate are used for stabilization of slopes. Then, the stability of a slope is dependent on maintaining the tension levels in the cables. So far, no research on a strain-based field sensing system for ground anchors has been reported. Therefore, in this study, a practical monitoring system for long-term sensing of tension levels in tendons for anchor-reinforced slopes is proposed. The system for anchor-reinforced slopes is composed of: (1) load cells based on vibrating wire strain gauges (VWSGs), (2) wireless sensor nodes which receive and process the signals from load cells and then transmit the result to a master node through local area communication, (3) master nodes which transmit the data sent from sensor nodes to the server through mobile communication, and (4) a server located at the base station. The system was applied to field sensing of ground anchors in the 62 m-long and 26 m-high slope {{at the side of}} the highway. Based on the long-term monitoring, the safety of the anchor-reinforced slope can be secured by the timely applications of <b>re-tensioning</b> processes in tendons...|$|E

This requires background knowledge acquired from several research and application fields. Suitably designed strengthening systems are required that do not adversely affect {{the nature of the}} structure itself, in order to efficiently protect cultural heritage buildings against earthquakes. When put into practice, any interventions for cultural heritage conservation should be easy to of install, noninvasive and the reversible. In this work, cable systems made of high-strength materials are proposed for the seismic reinforcement of masonry domes. Because of the significant influence of geometrical factors on the performance of the strengthening system, interventions must take into account the specific characteristics of the building, the stages of its construction, and its current state, which is inherently subject to variations. A cable dome system can also support self-diagnosis and <b>re-tensioning</b> tools in order to facilitate control and maintenance activities. The structural response of the reinforced domes and their capacity to react to horizontal and vertical seismic loads is investigated and assessed through numerical simulations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reverse {{shoulder}} arthroplasty {{requires a}} <b>re-tensioning</b> of the deltoid to obtain active elevation and implant stability. Currently, {{there is no}} objective and reliable technique described for the preoperative planning of reverse shoulder prosthesis or the postoperative evaluation of deltoid tension and arm lengthening. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to outline a standardized technique for measuring deltoid length and to preoperatively plan a reverse shoulder arthroplasty, and to determine whether complications are related to inadequate deltoid lengthening. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were included in this radiographic review. Variations in humeral length, overall arm length, and the height of the subacromial space were evaluated before and after reverse shoulder arthroplasty. RESULTS: The average postoperative lengthening of the humerus was 2 +/- 7 mm (range, - 9 - 16, P =. 243) and the arm was lengthened 23 +/- 12 mm (range, 1 - 47, P <. 001). Measured preoperative and postoperative differences of the subacromial space were statistically significant when comparing the operated and contralateral arm (P <. 0001). Lengthening was not correlated to sex (P =. 242), acromial fractures, or neurological complications (P =. 83). However, in cases of postoperative instability, both humeral and overall arm lengthening were statistically lower (P <. 0001). CONCLUSION: A technique to preoperatively plan adequate deltoid tensioning using radiographs of the contralateral arm is described. This technique is critical in challenging cases and postoperatively in cases of complication to assess the deltoid length. Subjective intraoperative criteria to evaluate deltoid tension should be replaced by objective measures to prevent insufficient or excessive deltoid tension. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3...|$|E

A square flat slab, two bays in each direction was constructed. The span of each bay was 3. 2 m (10. 5 ft) and the slab 89 mm (3. 5 in) thick. Initially the slab behaved elastically and no residual deflections were observed upon releasing the load up to 5. 8 kN/m 2 (0. 85 psi). Punching shear failure happened at a load of 23. 6 kN/m 2 at the edge column-slab connection # 2.

40|$|In a {{staggered}} erected {{cable-stayed bridge}} made of concrete, time-dependent phenomena effects might {{play an important}} role in both its geometry and its stress state. In fact, because of these phenomena stays will indeed lose force. To compensate these loses, one or two re-stressing operations are traditionally planned during the life time of long span cable- stayed bridges made of concrete. These re-stressing operations might be technologically challenging and always imply additional costs. To guarantee that allowable stresses and deflections are not exceeded during erection, a number of simulation methods are presented in the literature. Some of these methods, concretely those based on a backward simulation approach, fail addressing the effects of the time-dependent phenomena. To simulate these effects, methods based on the forward simulation approach are traditionally followed. Nevertheless, the main trade-off of these algorithms is that their computation is based on complex iterative processes that make simulation more time consuming. Furthermore, these methods are not able to avoid the need of additional re-stressing operations in service to prevent the effects of the time-dependent phenomena. To fill all these gaps, a new simulation algorithm, the Forward-Direct Algorithm (FDA), is formally presented in this paper to simulate the construction process of cable-stayed bridges including the time-dependent phenomena effects. This algorithm takes advantage of the unstressed length of the stays concept to carry out a computationally efficient simulation based on an innovative direct simulation approach. The major advantage of this algorithm is the fact that the prestressing operations during construction can be defined to avoid the need of additional <b>re-tensioning</b> operations in service. To illustrate the creep and shrinkage effects, the proposed algorithm is applied to a real cable-stayed bridge. Postprint (published version...|$|E

Universal Clamps associated with Socore TM spinal assembly, transpedicular lumbar screws and thoracic hooks at the upper end of the curve were used. The etiology of disease was cerebral palsy in 81 cases, Friedreich ataxia in two cases and Aicardi syndrome in one case. The average preoperative angular value was 73 ° ±  16 °. It was implanted a mean of seven Clamps for each procedure (range 5 – 9). The average percentage of correction was 72 %. Mean operative time was 240  ±  30  min with mean blood loss of 1200  ±  400  ml. No intra-operative complications occurred. Mean follow-up was 36  months.

In this group of patients the Universal Clamps technique appeared safe and effective and its mechanical performance is comparable to all-level screws construct. Furthermore, the kyphotic component can be better managed in case of thoracic lordosis. The most important aspect of this technique is a short operative time and low vascular and neurologic risks combined with a satisfying stability in the short-postoperative period.

40|$|The dome-drum {{system of}} the "Regina Montis Regalis" Basilica of Vicoforte has {{suffered}} over the years from significant structural problems, partly due to settlements of the building induced progressively by newly built masses. In 1983, concerns over the severe settlement and cracking phenomena affecting the structure prompted the decision to undertake inspection, monitoring and strengthening interventions. The strengthening intervention, put in place in years 1985 - 1987, consists of 56 active steel tie-bars, for a total cross-sectional area of 3200 mm 2, which are placed within holes drilled in the masonry {{at the top of}} the drum along 14 tangents around the perimeter. The bars were slightly tensioned right after their placing. A static monitoring system was set up to measure strains and stresses in the masonry structure, crack propagation, as well as tensile loads in the reinforcing bars. The bars were <b>re-tensioned</b> in 1997 to compensate for stress losses. The monitoring program of the Basilica started in 1983, in order to assess the efficacy of the interventions over time, but only in 2004 the acquisition procedure was automatized. The instruments of the monitoring system can be subdivided in two groups: i) instruments for the measurement of displacements, strains and cracks; ii) instruments for measuring boundary conditions. The first group includes: 12 Linear Variable Displacement Transducers (LVDTs) applied to the main cracks at the impost of the dome and to the biggest west crack at the extrados; 20 pressure cells to determinate the stress variation in the masonry; 56 load cells installed at the ends of the active tie-bars to control their stress condition and 2 wire gauges at the impost of the dome to assess the overall geometry of the structure. The second group of instruments includes: 24 temperature sensors (17 located inside the walls and 8 externally). Data acquired from monitoring systems are inevitably affected by the environmental conditions and many other factors. Therefore, environmental fluctuations and trends have to be separated by variations induced by possible damage in the structure or tension loss in the reinforcement system. To this aim, interpolating functions helped to interpret the data of the monitoring system.
