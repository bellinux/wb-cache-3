40|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Harvesting</b> {{is the age}} old {{traditional}} practice {{which is}} being practiced from the birth of human civilization. Like other living organisms man cannot survive without water. This made him to think and invent on different types of harvesting structures {{in order to obtain}} potable water. From the decades onwards with new technologies and globalization the structures focused are on dams, reservoirs, canals, irrigation tanks, percolation tanks etc. But, with the increasing population (human and animal) and with diseases related to water, it has become incessant practice to provide safe drinking water. In continuation to this above practice, a project on Roof top <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> structure with a study was implemented to provide safe drinking water to the community and to identify the best possible technology with respect to the specific region. In this paper, it covers the components that can be taken under the <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> structure, geographical <b>area,</b> availability of the water quantity, its quality and water demand. It also covered about the design parameters in which the flexibility and community management can promote and accordingly the design was modified. The main conclusion of this paper was the acceptance of the community about the technology, its design considerations and about the promotion of this technology in the water scarcity and pollutant regions. Finally, the study revealed that, it requires awareness (Psychological awareness) about the utilization of direct <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> with a primary filter unit, challenge of social and community acceptance, maintenance and time involvement for effective utilization and the water available at the door step with an amount of Rs. 1. 30 /- per liter...|$|R

50|$|Rainwater harvesting, {{irrespective}} of the technology used, essentially means <b>harvesting</b> and storing <b>water</b> in days of abundance, for use in lean days. Storing of rainwater {{can be done in}} two ways; (i) storing in an artificial storage and (ii) in the soil media as groundwater. The former is more specifically called roof <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> and is rather a temporary measure, focusing on human needs providing immediate relief from drinking water scarcity, while the latter has the potential to provide sustainable relief from water scarcity, addressing the needs of all living classes in nature. Through the proposed individual rainwater harvesting, units will be made available to the beneficiaries. <b>Rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> has gained popularity in Kerala through various projects implemented by different agencies. The <b>Rain</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Harvesting</b> Campaign of the Government and publicity by various media are responsible for popularizing <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the state.

40|$|Water {{being one}} of the world’s basic {{resources}} {{and one of the most}} essential needs to life, could be considered the nature’s precious gift to the living being. Although this resource was available in plenty till recently, due to urbanization, increase in population, industrialization and for large scale enterprises the shortage of water in the world has become evident. Furthermore, due to implications of climate change on rainfall patterns, with extremities of weather giving rise to floods and droughts there is growing concern globally about appropriate strategies to be adopted as far as the built environment is concerned for proper management and <b>harvesting</b> of <b>rain</b> <b>water.</b> Thus globally a Millennium Development Goal has also been set and <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> has emerged as an important issue in the international scenario. It has been highlighted at the third World Water Forum held in Kyoto, Japan, in the context of Millennium Development Goals and the issue of sustainability, at the Global Ministerial Environmental Forum in Korea, which has led to formulation of many networks and policies. The famous proclamation by King Parakramabahu the Great in (1153 - 1186 AD) could be considered as one of earliest policy statements, on water resources development and management in Sri Lanka, which highlights <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting.</b> “Let not allow a single drop of <b>water</b> falling as <b>rain</b> flow into the sea without being used for the benefit of mankind”. This shows the wisdom and commitment of ancient kings and people to conserve and efficiently manage water resources by building tanks specially in the dry zone and the design and construction of complex water collection and distribution systems such as in the Sigiriya rock fortress. The Government of Sri Lanka in June 2005 accepted a “National Policy on <b>Rain</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Harvesting</b> & Strategies”. Sri Lanka has used <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> for both domestic and agricultural purposes for many centuries and the institutionalized <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> became a practice in Sri Lanka in 1995, under the World Bank funded Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project. This project initiated the emergence of the Lanka <b>Rain</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Harvesting</b> Forum (LRWHF). A major challenge is the need to have a delivery of the stored <b>rain</b> <b>water,</b> for which gravity flow and hand/manual pumping has been the economic option the use of Solar Energy is being promoted specially in rural areas where there is no main grid power available. Another challenge is the public Health concern due to the comparatively stagnant nature of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting.</b> There has been a significant increase in the use of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in Sri Lanka, which has proved to be a boon to rural people, particularly for domestic water supplies in water scarce situations. An estimated thirty thousand systems are presently in operation, scattered over a large number of districts. Interestingly, several large scale projects have also been implemented in the urban context, and this too is likely to increase in the future. With a National policy on <b>Rain</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Harvesting</b> and other legislation in effect, Sri Lanka stands to benefit significantly by the appropriate use of this technology...|$|R

40|$|Introduction : Given its low and sparse {{precipitation}} both in {{spatial and}} temporal scales, Iran is nestled in an arid and semiarid part of the world. On the other hand, because of population growth, urbanization {{and the development of}} agriculture and industry sector is frequently encountered with increasing water demand. The increasing trend of water demand will widen the gap between water supply and demand in the future. This, in turn, necessitates urgent attention to the fundamentals of economic planning and allocation of water resources. Considering the limited resources and the declining water table and salinization of groundwater, especially in semi-arid areas forces us to exploit surface waters. When we evaluate the various methods of collecting rainwater, surface water that is the outcome of rainfall-runoff responses in a basin, is found to be a potential source of water and it can be useful to meet some of our water demand if managed properly. Water shortages in arid areas are critical, serious and persistent. Thus, <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> is an effective and economic goal. The most important step in the implementation of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems is proper site selection that could cause significant savings in time and cost. In this study the potential of surface waters in the Aq Emam catchment in the east Golestan province was evaluated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a framework for locating <b>areas</b> with <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> potential. Materials and Methods: For spatial evaluation of potential runoff, first, the amount of runoff is calculated using curve number and runoff potential maps were prepared with three classes: namely, the potential for low, medium and high levels. Finally, to identify suitable <b>areas</b> for <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> rainfall maps, soil texture, slope and land use were weighted and multiplied based on their importance in order to determine the appropriate areas to collect runoff Results and Discussion : The results of runoff production potential indicated that May and June accounted for the highest runoff and it can be inferred from these results that both of these months are characterized with storms which was confirmed by interviewing local residents and as range-land covers the largest land use in the basin as well as low vegetation density in the spring and summer due to overgrazing, much more runoff has been produced which is in line with the studies conducted by the Department of Natural Resources of the Golestan province in Aq Emam watershed (2003) as well as findings of Eftekhari et al. The results showed that the highest areas of the sub watershed 8, and 3 were suitable for <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Thus, the appropriate <b>areas</b> for <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the sub watersheds do not have a uniform spatial distribution according to the results. It can be argued that these sub basins are characterized by 4 criteria to be appropriate for <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> which is in confirmation with Miliniai et al. Also according to the results, the areas suitable for rainwater harvesting in each sub-basin have heterogeneous spatial distribution as confirmed by the results of Eftekhari and Jin et al. Given the final map from integrating data layers, it was found that the central part of the study area has a good potential for rainwater harvesting and as results show, suitable <b>area</b> for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the watershed coincides with range-lands that have a moderate crown cover as confirmed by the results reported by Tabatabaii et al. Conclusion: Finally it can be said that spatial evaluation and identification of proper <b>areas</b> for <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> is an important and necessary step in the application of <b>rain</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems.
