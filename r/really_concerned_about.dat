The purpose of this thesis is to introduce new system of cost control, do cost control through investigating menu engineering the restaurant will have a clear description to plan the menu item that will be sold in a day, week or in a month. The techniques of menu engineering are not overly complex as business analytical techniques go. Nevertheless, it is an eye-opening experience, in that many restaurateurs simply have not looked at their menus in this light, and quite frankly, are leaving money on the table. Menu engineering is a discipline, once applied consistently in the restaurant, though; menu engineering can reap immediate increases in sales and, more importantly, profitability. Most of the restaurants management doesn?t have accurate costs. Accurate food costs are important managerial controls and are vital to the overall profitability of the restaurant. How to calculate the actual cost and the profit is the question. By analyzing data and some interview, the writers would describe the need of cost control and the profit restaurant can obtain by using menu engineering...|$|R

This study had used 457 completed and returned questionnaires by MEs from northern region of Malaysia. The findings have indicated that bureaucratic process has no significant relationship on MEs business performance. However, facilities do had a significant influence on MEs business performance. This might be because MEs, they themselves do not <b>really</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> bureaucratic process of local authority.

40|$|Although {{the jury}} trial is {{regarded}} as a lynchpin of the American concept of justice, ambivalence about the institution persists, particularly in the context of civil litigation. Some question whether the civil jury is an inefficient anachronism. This article argues that many of the <b>concerns</b> raised <b>about</b> civil juries in general are <b>really</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the routine use of the general verdict, an institution that merges the jury’s fact finding function and its role as an applier of law. The article argues that in many instances, replacing a general verdict with a special verdict would allow the jury to play to its strength as reporter of fact. At the same time, it would free the jury from the burden of interpreting and applying elaborate instructions of complex legal doctrine. Despite criticism that the special verdict weakens the constitutional powers of the jury, the article proposes the use of the special verdict in a manner that presents the jury with questions of actual fact while leaving the task of applying law to the judge. The special verdict, if used correctly, enhances the reliability and efficiency of the litigation process...|$|R

In the 10-13 {{overtime}} loss, Ringer had 3 Kick Returns, a 19 yard average, including a long of 21 yards. He also played on special teams, and had one tackle. Ringer was again used as a kick returner, this time in a 31-34 loss to the Houston Texans. Ringer had 6 returns for a 20 yard average, with a long of 25, and no touchdowns. He also played on special teams, but had no tackles. In a 17-24 week 3 loss to the New York Jets, Ringer was benched as the kick returner, and, while active, did not play in the game. Ringer's kick return replacement, Ryan Mouton, had two fumbles during returns. Despite this, Titan's coach Jeff Fischer stood behind his decision to bench Ringer. In a 37-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was again active, but only played as a reserve on special teams. Ringer was one of three Titans who did not register a stat. The Titans, who last year had 13 wins, only three losses, started the season out zero wins four losses.

The Titans finished the game with negative 7 passing yards as their record moved to 0 wins 6 losses, putting them in a tie for the worst record in the NFL alongside the St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite his performance in the loss, head coach Jeff Fisher said that Chris Johnson and LenDale White will continue to get the majority of the carries. [...] "There's not enough balls to go around. I wouldn't hesitate to put Ringer in if there's an issue," [...] Fisher said. During a practice on October 28, 2009, Ringer injured his back and had to be carted off in an ambulance. Fisher said of the injury [...] "It could be any number of things and it would be unfair for me to speculate right now. He is obviously in some pain." [...] The call to the hospital was initially phoned to treat a potentially [...] "traumatic" [...] injury, but tests have revealed that the injury is [...] "not considered serious". After spending a night with back problems, Ringer was released from the hospital early morning on October 29. Ringer's expected to miss a few weeks, as he's listed on the injury report with a back injury. Fisher commented on the injury, [...] "We got some good news on Javon. He obviously didn’t practice today, but he’s going to be OK. We were <b>really</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> it. We feared the worst and we got good results," [...] but would not elaborate as to {{the full extent of the}} injury. In a 30-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was declared inactive before the game, and did not play. It was however, the Titans first victory of the season. In week 9, Ringer was again inactive and did not play. In week 10, Ringer was listed as questionable, but was declared inactive, and did not play. In a 20-17 win against the Houston Texans, Ringer was inactive, and did not play. In 20-17 win against the Arizona Cardinals, Ringer was listed as the #2 running back. He had one yard on one carry. Ringer played because LenDale White, the team's usual #2 Running back, was benched due to being late to a team meeting. Ringer was then inactive for the rest of the season. Ringer finished the season with 8 attempts for 48 yards, playing in 7 games.|$|E

This situation refers also to ethical questions. Research, particularly that relating to neurobiological and cognitive foundations suggest significant changes in our perception of a human being while many researchers and theorists predict revolutionary changes to follow. This means that the old disputes become current anew, although in a different context: on one hand – in the light of unquestionable successes of neurobiology and other sciences, there is an increasing number of supporters of the naturalization concept whereas on the other hand – there are growing <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the “naturalized” view on the human and the world. In my paper, I would like to address two major questions. The first one refers to the results of contemporary research carried out within the framework of broadly construed neuroscience which may affect the functioning of a human in the sphere of ethics. The other question is whether one <b>really</b> should be <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the naturalization of ethics (whereby it greatly depends on how the “naturalization” is understood). Either way, there is much evidence in support of the view that Dostoyevsky was wrong stating that if God does not exist (or, specifically: the immortal soul, volitional “I”, etc), everything is permitted. Due to their importance, these questions will require broader, possibly interdisciplinary discussion and refraining from simplified conclusions that are often a result of ignorance...|$|R
