40|$|ABSTRACT This study aims {{to assess}} the {{cooperative}} <b>regulation</b> process of forestry producers {{in comparison to the}} traditional individual <b>regulation</b> of properties. Twenty (20) forest properties are studied as examples of the development of three forest <b>regulation</b> scenarios: 1) individual <b>regulation,</b> 2) group <b>regulation,</b> and 3) cooperative <b>regulation.</b> The Net Present Value (NPV) of each of the scenarios is optimized according to mathematical programming models and compared to a baseline scenario without forest <b>regulation.</b> According to the proposed cooperative <b>regulation,</b> properties had a proportion factor for annual net revenue distribution calculated from results of the baseline scenario. By comparing the NPV maximization results from scenarios 1 and 3 with the non-regulation scenario, the cost for individual <b>regulation</b> is on average 25 %, while being only 11 % for cooperative <b>regulation,</b> that is, a 14 % reduction in property <b>regulation</b> costs.

This paper presents a dynamic model of <b>regulation,</b> in which the environment is stochastic such that the imposition of <b>regulation</b> can either be efficient or inefficient, and in which the regulator’s ability to observe the underlying need for <b>regulation</b> is reduced when <b>regulation</b> is imposed. As compared to a full-information benchmark, <b>regulation</b> is highly persistent, even if there is a high probability of transition to a state in which <b>regulation</b> is inefficient. This regulatory persistence decreases welfare and dramatically increases the proportion of time the economy spends under <b>regulation.</b> The ability to perform deregulatory experiments can improve outcomes, but only if they are sufficiently inexpensive and effective, and <b>regulation</b> will still remain more persistent than in the full-information benchmark.
