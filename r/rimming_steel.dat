40|$|<b>Rimming</b> <b>steel</b> {{consists}} of Carbon approximately 0. 08 - 0. 09 % and Manganese 0. 40 - 0. 50 %. This grade contains high oxygen (ppm) {{level in the}} bath around 1000 - 1200 and 225 - 275 in ladle after tapping. Rimming grade steel is casted only through ingot teeming route. Rim thickness and Rimming duration are the main physical quality parameters of a <b>rimming</b> <b>steel</b> ingot. Of all the parameters, the casting temperature of steel plays {{a very important role}} in determining the quality of <b>rimming</b> <b>steel.</b> Superheat is the temperature by which the ladle temperature exceeds the liquidus temperature of steel. The magnitude of superheat affects the rate of solidification of steel in mould, as a result of which, the rimming intensity gets affected, which in turn, affects the rim thickness. Therefore, the study of superheat-rimming intensity correlation is important in controlling the quality of <b>rimming</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} object is the {{deoxidation}} of mild <b>rimming</b> <b>steel.</b> The study {{purpose is to}} improve the quality of steel ingot and to rise the output of good metal. The character of recycle flows in the ingot mould during the period of deoxidizer introduction, the size-transfer conditions and the distribution conditions of it in the ingot volume have been determined. The optimum relationship between the carbon concentration and the oxygen activity in the metal during the steel pouring period has been refined. The dioxidation process of mild rimmimg non-ageing steel with activometer use has been developed and has been introduced. The method of forced mixing of deoxidizer with the metal has been developed. The deoxidation process and the pouring process of mild and non-ageing steel has been introduced at the open-furnace shop of "Zaporozhstal" Integrated Iron-and-Steel Works. The metal spoilage has been reduced 2. 9 times at the first conversion, the output of goods has been risen by 0. 3 %Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} model for tracing the inelastic pre- and postbuckling load-deformation path of tubular struts has been developed. The analysis accounts simultaneously for both the geometrical and material nonlinearities. The influence of strain-unloading is included. In particular, the model takes into account a generalized stress-strain relationship {{and the influence of}} strain hardening. Several stress-strain relationships of the material are assumed with respect to as-received material, material that is prestrained in tension and fully-aged, and material that is prestrained in tension and unaged. The structure tangent stiffness matrix is obtained by using a series of transformation matrices to update the element geometry. A so called arc-length iterative numerical procedure is combined with a modified Newton-Raphson method to obtain a solution to the incremental equations of equilibrium. The procedure has been applied to trace out the inelastic load-deflection paths of both as-received and prestrained pin-ended struts. Material and strut tests have been performed on circular tubular sections of 60. 3 mm diameter and wall thickness 2. 3 mm. Several material effects (strain hardening, strain aging, the Bauschinger effect and residual stresses) have been included in the tests. The significant influence of these effects have been investigated by applying a two-way analysis variance to the strut test results. It has been found that the combined influence of strain aging, strain hardening and the Bauschinger effect have a dominant role in the test results referred to herein, with load capacity reductions up to 38 %. Strain aging has been seen to be more significant than strain hardening for the <b>rimming</b> <b>steel</b> used in enhancing the capacity of the prestrained struts. The experimental results are also compared with the current column design curves from ECCS, SSRC and existing and proposed Australian column curves. By comparing the theoretical results with the experimental results of the as-received struts and the struts prestrained in tension, both fully-aged and unaged, it shown that the developed theoretical model can accurately predict the experimental maximum loads and the post-buckling load-deflection paths of steel tubular struts...|$|E

50|$|The steelpan {{comes in}} many {{different}} forms, and put together is called a steel orchestra. Steel bands traditionally {{are made up of}} old pieces of metal example old irons, tire <b>rims,</b> <b>steel</b> pipes etc. Antigua's steel orchestras and iron bands can be found in churches and in many villages, and have been popular since their introduction. Every Carnival there is a competition to dub the best band of the island. Antigua's largest and oldest steel orchestra that still competes is the Hell's Gate steel orchestra. It is often said that The Brute Force Steel Band was the first steelpan band to record an album anywhere. Steel Orchestras have evolved to using highly technical instruments costing up to US$1500.00 for one instrument. These pans are meticulously honed out of the steel drum, sunken and burned over a hot fire, chromed and tuned. This process was perfected in Trinidad and Tobago and exported to Antigua & Barbuda through various collaborations between several of the bands in both island-nations.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rimmed</b> <b>steel,</b> {{also known}} as drawing quality steel, has little to no {{deoxidizing}} agent added to it during casting which causes carbon monoxide to evolve rapidly from the ingot. This causes small blow holes in the surface that are later closed up in the hot rolling process. Another result is the segregation of elements; {{almost all of the}} carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur move {{to the center of the}} ingot, leaving an almost perfect [...] "rim" [...] of pure iron on the outside of the ingot. This gives the ingot an excellent surface finish because of this iron rim, but also form the most segregated composition. Most rimmed steel has a carbon content below 0.25% carbon, a manganese content below 0.6%, and is not alloyed with aluminum, silicon, and titanium. This type of steel is commonly used for cold-bending, cold-forming, cold-heading and, as the name implies, drawing. Due to the non-uniformity of alloying elements it is not recommended for hot-working applications.|$|R
