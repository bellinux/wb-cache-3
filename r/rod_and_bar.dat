The low capital cost for a mini-mill—around US$140-200 per ton of annual installed capacity, compared with US$1,000 per ton of annual installed capacity for an integrated steel mill—allowed mills to be quickly established in war-ravaged Europe, and also allowed them to successfully compete with the big United States steelmakers, such as Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Steel, for low-cost, carbon steel [...] "long products" [...] (structural steel, <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>bar,</b> wire, and fasteners) in the U.S. market.|$|E

50|$|No6 Mill was a three-high {{rolling mill}} with several stands (Sets of Rolls) {{producing}} bar down to thick wire sizes from red hot billets {{taken from the}} reheat furnaces. The small diameter <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>bar</b> produced in this mill snaked all over the cast iron floor plates. The operators used tongs to catch hold {{of the end of}} the red hot bar as it left the rolls, passed the bar around their body allowing it to loop out onto the floor and then entered the bar into the next pass position. In one hot summer the floor plates expanded, the expansion could not go anywhere and two plates buckled upwards like flagstones directing the hot metal into the air - within milliseconds there was no one on the mill floor as the metal reared up towards the roof and collapsed in a writhing heap as the mill rollers continued to spew out the rest of the bar.|$|E

50|$|The Boonton Iron Works {{were founded}} about 1770 by Samuel Ogden who, {{with others in}} his family, {{purchased}} a 6 acre tract along the Rockaway River, near Boonton, New Jersey, United States. Here rolling and slitting mills were erected that engaged {{in the manufacture of}} nail <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bar</b> iron. With the construction of the Morris Canal in 1830, the New Jersey Iron Company was organized. This company built a new plant costing $283,000 and imported skilled mechanics from England. Under Fuller & Lord (1852-1876) the enterprise tended to become an integrated industry with ore and timber reserves, canal boats, furnaces, mills and auxiliary plants. After 1881, the business slowly declined. The plant closed in 1911.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the applicability to plastics of a fracture toughness testing tool developed for metals. The intent is to study pre-test conditioning of several plastic materials and the effect of the depth of the razor notch cut in the chevron notched fracture toughness test specimens. The study includes the careful preparation of samples followed by conditioning in various environments. Samples were subjected to laboratory air for a specific duration or to a controlled temperature-humidity condition as per the ASTM D 1870. Some of the samples were subjected to vacuum conditioning under standard test specifications. Testing was conducted using the conventional three-point bend test as per ASTM D 5045 - 95. ASTM E 1304, which sets a standard for short <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>bar</b> testing of metals and ceramics provides some basis for conducting chevron notched four-point bend tests to duplicate the toughness tool. Correlation of these results with the ASTM test samples is determined. The four-point bend test involves less specimen machining as well as time to perform the fracture toughness tests. This study of fracture toughness testing has potential for quality control as well as the fracture property determination...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This paper {{describes}} {{the impacts of}} the closure of a major industry on air quality in ‎the Lower Hunter Region. BHP <b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bar</b> was recognized {{as the most important}} source of ‎particulate matter (PM 10, bsp), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) in Newcastle ‎before it closed in October 1999. ‎Objective: This study investigated the impacts of the closure of a major industry, a steel works in ‎Newcastle, on air quality in the Lower Hunter Region, New South Wales. ‎Method: A combined three-station data set for these pollutants for 3. 5 years before and after ‎closure allowed a comparison of daily and data set averages, using both the measured data, and a ‎Mixed Model to calculate significant changes in the time series by month. ‎Result: PM 10 increased after BHP closure by 13. 2 %, an unexpected result, but the post closure ‎data set was influenced by summer bushfires. bsp decreased by 10. 2 %, reflecting the reduction ‎is emissions due to industrial burning processes. This result was verified by a separate PM 2. 5 data ‎set which showed significant reductions in elemental carbon and soil source components. SO 2 ‎concentrations dropped by 40. 2 % after closure, a change which verified the importance of BHP ‎as a source. Despite the industry being a major source of NO 2, there was no significant change of ‎this pollutant after closure, suggesting dominance of other sources. ‎Conclusion: Air pollution in the region is caused by different sources. Further research into the ‎role of meteorology and quantifying changes in the range of sources is recommended. ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, it was {{apparent}} that steel output would remain insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the Four Modernizations. During the period covered by the Seventh Five-Year Plan, imports were expected to average 41 percent of domestic output. Thin rolled sheets, used to make such items as vehicles, washing machines, and refrigerators, were in extremely short supply. In 1984 China had to import about half its steel sheet and about 80 percent of its steel plate. Production of tubes and pipes also was inadequate, and approximately 50 percent of all tubes had to be imported. The country was most proficient in the production of steel bars, but it still had to import an estimated 1.8 million tons of <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bars</b> in 1984. In 1985 China imported a record 15 million tons of steel, more than two-thirds of it from Japan.|$|R

40|$|A {{three-roll}} {{process is}} a significant technique {{in the production of}} wire <b>rod,</b> round <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> hexagonal profiles for structural applications. Better mechanical properties of wire <b>rod,</b> round <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> hexagonal profiles can be achieved due to large plastic deformation by the three-roll process. Asymmetric rolling is a novel technique characterised by a kinematic asymmetry linked to the difference in peripheral speed of the rolls, able to introduce additional shear strains through the bar thickness. In order to achieve this, asymmetrical three-roll rolling process was investigated to better control the deformation compared to the conventional three-roll rolling process in a stand with two three-roll calibers located very close to each other. Simulation of round-triangle-triangle pass rolling was performed. FEM simulations were carried out with using software DEFORM 3 D. The influence of the friction coefficient and speed asymmetry on the shear strain and material flow was discussed. The results of simulation can be used to optimize the asymmetric three-roll rolling process to improve the mechanical properties of wire <b>rod,</b> round <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> hexagonal profiles...|$|R
40|$|Bi- 2223 oxide superconductors {{have been}} {{synthesized}} by the diffusion reaction between a {{high melting point}} Sr-Ca-Cu oxide substrate and a low melting point (Bi,Pb) -Cu oxide coating layer. The substrate with Sr:Ca:Cu atom ratio of 1. 9 : 2. 1 : 2. 5 was pressed into cylindrical rods with 4 mm diameter or rectangular bars with 3 mm× 3 mm× 15 mm sizes, and then sintered. The coating layer with Bi:Pb:Cu ratio of 1. 8 : 0. 4 : 1 was coated around the substrate <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bars.</b> The heat treatment was performed to produce the (Bi,Pb) - 2223 diffusion layer at 840 ℃ for different time. The Bi- 2223 phase in the diffusion process is transformed from the Bi- 2212 phase through the Bi- 2201 phase. The Ag 2 O added to the coating layer does not enhance the (Bi,Pb) - 2223 diffusion reaction.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} 90 years, {{a lot of}} works have been {{published}} about rolling theories for the two-roll rolling process (2 RP). In the last decades, the three-roll process (3 RP) has become a significant technique {{in the production of}} wire <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>bars,</b> as it allows to cover a wide range of finished dimensions with one pass design, or to realize very close tolerances, depending on the pass design method used (free size rolling or high precision rolling). Horihata and Motomura [2] made use of the upper bound theorem to construct a method for spread calculation, but up to now, a straightforward mathematical method for calculation of stress distribution, roll forces, torques and forward slip is still missing. The present paper aims at a transfer of the slab method, which is well-known and established for the 2 RP, to the 3 RP. After the rolling theory for flat passes is introduced, Lendl’s equivalent pass method is transferred to the 3 RP, which allows the calculation of section passes. Computational results show, that roll forces, torques and forward slips can be calculated under inclusion of elastic stand feedback and interstand tensions. Therefore the model can be used for roll speed set-up to minimize interstand tensions, which is of great importance for the rolling industry...|$|R

40|$|Mice are {{increasingly}} being used in behavioral neuroscience, largely replacing rats as the behaviorist's animal of choice. Before aspects of behavior such as emotionality or cognition can be assessed, however, {{it is vital to}} determine whether the motor capabilities of e. g. a mutant or lesioned mouse allow such an assessment. Performance on a maze task requiring strength and coordination, such as the Morris water maze, might well be impaired in a mouse by motor, rather than cognitive, impairments, so it is essential to selectively dissect the latter from the former. For example, sensorimotor impairments caused by NMDA antagonists have been shown to impair water maze performance 2. Motor coordination has traditionally been assessed in mice and rats by the rotarod test, in which the animal is placed on a horizontal rod that rotates about its long axis; the animal must walk forwards to remain upright and not fall off. Both set speed and accelerating versions of the rotarod are available. The other three tests described in this article (horizontal <b>bar,</b> static <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> parallel <b>bars)</b> all measure coordination on static apparatus. The horizontal bar also requires strength for adequate performance, particularly of the forelimbs as the mouse initially grips the bar just with the front paws. Adult rats do not perform well on tests such as the static <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> parallel <b>bars</b> (personal observations); they appear less well coordinated than mice. I have only tested male rats, however, and male mice seem generally less well coordinated than females. Mice appear to have a highe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{influence of}} degree processing for {{parameters of the}} structure and properties of products after hot rolling of continuous ingots made of low carbon steels. Design/methodology/approach: Ingots with cross sections of 105 x 105 mm and 135 x 135 mm were rolled to wire <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>bars</b> respectively, with applying the degree of processing λ = 6. 5 - 115 and λ= 3 - 14. Tests of the microstructure parameters and their distributions were carried out on a SEM HITACHI S- 4200, using the Met-Ilo computer application. Findings: Parameters of the structure and properties of steel after hot rolling of a continuous ingot made of low-carbon steel and after air-cooling, significantly depend {{on the degree of}} processing. After the hot rolling process of the continuous ingots of steel of S 355 J 2 grade within the range of the degree of processing λ = 2. 97 - 14. 15, a structure of ferritic-pearlitic steel with heterogeneous distribution on the cross-section was revealed. Practical implications: A good quality of products after hot rolling is obtain for minimal degree of processing, which will ensure obtaining an advantageous structure and properties. Originality/value: The finding of the quantitative relations between the degree of processing, the structure and properties allows for predicting the minimal value of the degree of processing, which should guarantee obtaining the required structural features and consequently, product’s functional properties...|$|R
60|$|These things, {{the steam}} railway and the {{electric}} telegraph, {{were to the}} popular imagination of the middle nineteenth century the most striking and revolutionary of inventions, but they were only the most conspicuous and clumsy first fruits of a far more extensive process. Technical knowledge and skill were developing with an extraordinary rapidity, and to an extraordinary extent measured by the progress of any previous age. Far less conspicuous at first in everyday life, but finally far more important, was the extension of man's power over various structural materials. Before {{the middle of the}} eighteenth century iron was reduced from its ores by {359} means of wood charcoal, was handled in small pieces, and hammered and wrought into shape. It was material for a craftsman. Quality and treatment were enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the individual iron-worker. The largest masses of iron that could be dealt with under those conditions amounted at most (in the sixteenth century) to two or three tons. (There was a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the size of cannon.) The blast-furnace rose in the eighteenth century and developed with the use of coke. Not before the eighteenth century do we find rolled sheet iron (1728) <b>and</b> rolled <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bars</b> (1783). Nasmyth's steam hammer came as late as 1838.|$|R
