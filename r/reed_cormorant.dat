50|$|The <b>reed</b> <b>{{cormorant}}</b> (Microcarbo africanus), {{also known}} as the long-tailed cormorant, is a bird in the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. It breeds in much of Africa south of the Sahara, and Madagascar. It is resident but undertakes some seasonal movements.|$|E
50|$|The {{target species}} are {{primarily}} the double-crested cormorant in North America {{and the great}} cormorant in Europe, Japan and Australia. The little black cormorant has also been targeted in Australia. In Africa, the <b>reed</b> <b>cormorant</b> is targeted and shot.|$|E
50|$|The crowned {{cormorant}} is 50-55 cm in length. Adults {{are black}} {{with a small}} crest {{on the head and}} a red face patch. Young birds are dark brown above, paler brown below, and lack the crest. They can be distinguished from immature <b>reed</b> <b>cormorants</b> by their darker underparts and shorter tail.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} a {{breeding}} ground for large numbers of water birds, particularly purple herons, <b>reed</b> <b>cormorants</b> and African darters.During the low-water periods rosy bee-eaters and African river martins breed in the reserve.It is the only location in the DRC where Congo sunbirds have been found.Vulnerable African bush elephants are present, and Allen's swamp monkeys are thought to be present.|$|R
50|$|The rich {{communities}} of oysters, crabs, invertebrates {{and the great}} variety of fish sheltering and spawning in the mangroves sustain animal life including monkeys, African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis), and turtles like the African softshell turtle (Trionyx triunguis). Birds include breeding waterbirds such as striated heron and <b>reed</b> <b>cormorant</b> and large flocks of others during migration.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] crowned {{cormorant}} (Microcarbo coronatus) {{is a small}} cormorant that is {{endemic to}} {{the waters of the}} cold Benguela Current of southern Africa. It is an exclusively coastal species and is not found more than 10 km (6 mi) away from land. This species is related to the <b>reed</b> <b>cormorant,</b> and was formerly considered to the same species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reed</b> <b>cormorant</b> can dive to {{considerable}} depths, {{but usually}} feeds in shallow water. It frequently brings {{prey to the}} surface. It takes {{a wide variety of}} fish. It prefers small slow-moving fish, and those with long and tapering shapes, such as mormyrids, catfishes, and cichlids. It will less frequently eat soles (which can be important in its diet locally), frogs, aquatic invertebrates, and small birds.|$|E
50|$|The coastal {{wetlands}} are of immense importance {{for over two}} million wintering Western Palearctic waders, from fifteen different species including dunlin, bar-tailed godwit, curlew sandpiper and common redshank each numbering over 100,000 birds. Other wintering species include more than 30,000 greater flamingos Breeding birds include great white pelican, <b>reed</b> <b>cormorant,</b> gull-billed tern, Caspian tern, royal tern and common tern, together with two unique subspecies of grey heron Ardea cinerea monicae and Eurasian spoonbill Platalea leucorodia balsaci and an outpost of the western reef heron.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} regions in north {{such as the}} Cintra Bay and Dakhla Peninsula, the area {{is one of the}} most {{important}} wintering grounds for Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia leucorodia). Breeding birds include white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), <b>reed</b> <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax africanus), gull-billed tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), royal tern (Sterna maxima) and common tern (Sterna hirundo), together with several species or subspecies with an African distribution, such as grey heron (Ardea cinerea monicae) and Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia balsaci) and western reef heron (Egretta gularis) (IUCN, 1987).|$|E
50|$|There is a bird {{sanctuary}} bordering the dam to the west, {{with the goal}} of protecting birds that are not classified as game birds.The reservoir is home to a variety of bird life, with as many as seventy species being recorded at different times of the year including 11 species of herons and egrets, 14 species of ducks and geese and 24 species of waders. In summer the shallows are used by waders, and Black-headed and Grey Herons, Cattle Egret, <b>Reed</b> <b>Cormorant</b> and African Spoonbill breed in the reed beds {{in the center of the}} shallows when they are surrounded by water.Orange-breasted Waxbill and Fan-tailed Cisticola are found in the reeds and grasses around the reservoir.|$|E
5000|$|The white-breasted {{cormorant}} is {{the only}} form of great cormorant found in Sub-Saharan Africa, the only form that has strictly freshwater populations and the only form with a white breast and throat; it does however interbreed freely with dark-breasted forms in central Africa. [...] It has a wide distribution; {{on the west coast}} from the Cape Verde Islands to Guinea-Bissau and from Angola to the Cape of Good Hope and northwards on the east coast to Mozambique. It occurs around the entire Southern African coastline, {{but it is not clear}} whether the coastal populations are separate from the inland populations. On the African mainland it occurs more frequently in eastern and southern parts, rather than in the drier western regions, where it usually is found only on perennial rivers and dams. On inland waters it commonly occurs together with the <b>reed</b> <b>cormorant</b> and the African darter, but it is ecologically separated from these species by its fishing habits and the size and nature of its prey. [...] There are also inland populations in Nigeria and around Lake Chad, and in eastern and southern Africa from Sudan southwards. It can be found around the Red Sea, where it is sometimes referred to as the Red Sea white-breasted cormorant.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns in selected components of the ichthyofauna and piscivorous avifauna in the small temporarily open/closed Riet River Estuary located on the eastern seaboard of southern Africa was investigated monthly over the period August 2005 to July 2006. The ichthyofauna within the littoral zone of the estuary was sampled using a 5 m seine net (8 stations) while a 30 m seine net (4 stations) was employed to sample {{the fish in the}} channel. Bird counts were made along repeat transects {{along the length of the}} estuary. Total ichthyofaunal abundances and biomass ranged between 1. 60 and 8. 67 individuals m⁻² and 0. 45 to 21. 76 g wwt m⁻² within the littoral zone, and between 0. 08 and 0. 44 individuals m⁻² and 0. 58 and 36. 52 g wwt m⁻² in the channel of the estuary. The highest values were generally recorded during the summer months. Results of the numerical analysis indicated that the breaching events recorded over the study period did not lead to a common trend in the ichthyofaunal community. In the absence of a link to the marine environment, the ichthyofaunal community in the littoral zone was numerically dominated by the estuarine resident species, Gilchristella aestuaria and to a lesser extent by Glossogobius callidus, which collectively accounted for ca. 54 % of the total ichthyofauna sampled. The establishment of a link to the marine environment coincided with increased numbers of marine breeding species including Atherina breviceps and Rhabdosargus holubi to total fish counts within the estuary. Hierarchical cluster analysis did not identify any spatial patterns in the community structure of the ichthyofauna in the littoral zone or channel zone of the estuary, which could likely be linked to the absence of any distinct horizontal patterns in salinity and temperature within the system. A total of thirteen piscivorous bird species was recorded over the study period. Of the recorded species, six species were wading piscivores, four species were aerial divers and the remaining three species were pursuit swimmers. There were no significant correlations between the estimates of the ichthyofaunal abundance and biomass and bird numbers evident during the study (P> 0. 05 in both cases). The <b>Reed</b> <b>Cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax africanus) was the dominant species throughout the study, with a mean of 8. 25 (SD ± 7. 90) individuals per count. Mean values of the Pied Kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) and Giant Kingfisher (Megaceryle maximus) were 3. 42 (SD ± 1. 20) and 1. 17 (SD ± 0. 60) individuals per count, respectively. The remaining species revealed mean values < 0. 5 individuals per count. The highest bird numbers were recorded in winter reflecting the migration of large numbers of the <b>Reed</b> <b>Cormorant</b> into the system. Breaching events were associated with a decrease in total bird numbers, which was most likely due to loss of potential foraging habitat (littoral zone) for waders resulting from reduced water levels. Monthly food consumption by all piscivorous birds revealed large temporal variability, ranging from 26. 35 to 140. 58 kg per month. The observed variability could be linked to mouth phase and bird numbers...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. (Zoology) The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} effects of metal-polluted aquatic {{habitats}} at five different localities on the Witwatersrand and the Orange Free State on the concentrations of lead, nickel, copper and cadmium in the organs and tissues of the Redknobbed Coot, Fulica cristata, the Sacred Ibis, Threskiornis aethiopicus, and the <b>Reed</b> <b>Cormorant,</b> Phalacrocorax africanus. The physical and chemical conditions of the water and the sediments which prevailed during the period of survey at the various sampling sites suggest that concentrations of parameters such as phosphates, nickel and lead in a number of cases exceeded the limits laid down by Kempster et at. (1980) for acceptable river water quality standards in South Africa. The major sources of pollution responsible for these conditions can primarily be related to sewage, mine and industrial effluents (urban) as well as agricultural practices (rural), respectively. Mining activities were largely responsible for the acidification and miniralization as well as metal pollution of the water and sediments, especially so at the Marievale Bird Sanctuary in the Blesbokspruit catchment area. However, automobiles are suspected to contribute much towards the lead concentrations in the water and sediments at all the sampling sites. Levels of cadmium were generally low and may be {{the only one of the}} four metals analysed which truly reflected unpolluted, environmental conditions for this metal in the water and sediments of all the sampling sites. The nutrient loads which suggest mild to moderate eutrophication of the water at all the localities can largely be attributed to sewage effiuents and surface runoff waters from the surrounding townships on the Witwatersrand as well as from inorganic fertilizers from farm lands in the vicinity of the Steynsrus and Senekal farm dams in the Orange Free State. These conditions resulted in the overall increase in primary and secondary production of the affected waters which also coincided with the development of submerged and floating water weeds such as Potamogeton pectinatus and Azolla filiculoides, respectively. The herbivorous Redknobbed Coot and to a lesser extent the piscivorous <b>Reed</b> <b>Cormorant,</b> benefitted directly or indirectly from these conditions. Data obtained during the investigation present a complex situation in terms of the environment and the biological availability of the four metals under discussion. A number of factors in both the abiotic and biotic components may have had an effect on fluctuations in metal concentrations. These may have acted individually and/or synergistically, making the interpretation of the data difficult. Cadmium occurred in the lowest concentrations of all four metals in all four the organs and tissues during all four seasons of investigation. In the case of the rest of the metals as well as the organs and tissues no specific, clear seasonal trend or sequence in the concentrations of the metals was discernible. Copper in the kidney and liver and lead in the bone and blood tissues had the highest mean concentrations over the four seasons of investigation. As far as the winter and summer seasonal tendencies are concerned, statistically significant differences occurred in the concentrations of some metals in specific organs and tissues between the winter and summer seasons, respectively. However, values recorded were not necessarily higher during a particular season. Lead (liver) and cadmium (kidney) concentrations were found to be significantly higher in winter 1991 whilst cadmium and copper (both in the blood) were significantly lower during this same season, compared to winter 1992. Concentrations of nickel did not differ significantly between organs and tissues such as the liver and blood for particular seasons. It was only nickel in the kidney and cadmium in the bone tissue which reflected definite seasonal trends for the four successive seasons of investigation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{determine}} the major helminth parasites of the sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus, the straightfin barb, Barbus paludinosus and four species of piscivorous birds: Phalacrocorax africanus (<b>Reed</b> <b>Cormorant),</b> P. carbo (White-breasted Cormorant), Anhinga melanogaster (Darter) and Ardea cinerea (Grey Heron), in the Manyame catchment area. The study also aimed {{to determine the effect}} of host size, sex and season on the rate of infection, and to study aspects of the life cycles of some of the parasites. Metacercariae of the digenean trematode, Harvardia sandgroundi, were found on the skin of B. paludinosus from the Marimba River, which drains into Lake Chivero and is polluted mainly by the effluent discharged from the Crowborough sewage treatment plant (Prevalence (P) = 12. 2 - 22. 0 %, Intensity (I) = 1 - 11, Mean Intensity (MI) = 3. 3), but they were not present in the same host species from Lake Chivero and the Munwahuku Dam. Plerocercoid larvae of the tapeworm, Ligula intestinalis, infected only B. paludinosus from the Munwahuku Dam (P = 7. 2 %, I = 1 - 3, MI = 1. 1). Adult Proteocephalus sp., another tapeworm species, were found only in the intestine of C. gariepinus from Lake Chivero (P = 7. 1 %, I = 1 - 14, MI = 5. 6) but were absent from the other sampling localities. Third-stage larvae of the nematode, Contracaecum sp., were also recovered from the body cavity of C. gariepinus from Lake Chivero (P = 42. 6 %, I = 1 - 7, MI = 2. 2) but not from the other sampling locations. In all cases, the prevalence and intensity of infection were not significantly correlated to the respective host size or sex (p > 0. 05), with the exception of B. paludinosus from the Munwahuku Dam where the size of Ligula increased with an increase in host weight. Monthly samples were usually small and were not uniform. The effect of season on helminth prevalence was also not significant for all the parasite species although there was a marked reduction in the prevalence of Contracaecum larvae in C. gariepinus from Lake Chivero between June and August 2001 (winter) because the temperatures might have been too low for the parasiteâ€™s eggs to hatch. The helminths did not affect the normal condition of their fish hosts and no gross pathological conditions were detected. A low parasite index was recorded for B. paludinosus from the Munwahuku Dam infected by ligulae (PI = 7. 97 Â± 3. 38). Barbs from the Marimba River were not infected by L. intestinalis perhaps because there were very few copepods, which are the first intermediate hosts of the parasite, in the flowing water than in the dam. Barbs from Lake Chivero, which has high zooplankton abundance, were however not infected probably because they do not preferentially feed on copepods in the lake, where alternative food is abundant. The fish-eating birds harboured four species of adult Contracaecum: C. rudolphii, C. microcephalum, C. carlislei and C. tricuspis. These species are described {{for the first time in}} Zimbabwe although they have been recovered from the same host species in the neighbouring South Africa. One darter and one white-breasted cormorant each had a single clinostomid fluke (Clinostomum complanatum) lodged in their buccal cavities. Stomach content analysis showed that the infected birds mainly fed on the cichlids Pharyngochromis acuticeps and Oreochromis niloticus, suggesting that these fish, as well as C. gariepinus, are possible intermediate hosts of Contracaecum. Future work should consider other fish and bird species from the catchment that were not included in this study and larger samples would yield sufficient data for seasonality studies. Further taxonomic work on the parasites, especially the proteocephalid cestodes and trematodes, is recommended, and so are some applied aspects of fish parasitology, such as correlationships with pollution levels...|$|E
