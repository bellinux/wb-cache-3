40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{studies were}} carried out in pursuit of the difference and interrelationship between the changes of the basement membrane of renal glomerulus and the changes of the basement membrane of <b>renal</b> <b>arteriole</b> in experimental hypertension. The changes of the basement membrane of arteriole and basement membrane like material of mesangium and lacis show their occurrence {{at about the same time}} and their progress in the same degree. The changes first observed are the beads-like thickening and reticular change of the basement membrane of vascular wall and also the increase of basement membrane like material in mesangium and lacis. These changes are followed by the deposit of dense material and fibrin on the vascular wall and the increase of basement membrane like material of mesangium and lacis so as to compress their cells and tear them to pieces. About this stage, the thickening of the basement membrane of glomerular capillary loop is intensified and moreover the wrinkle and tortuosity of the basement membrane of glomerular capillary loop and the collapse of glomerular capillary lumen became remarkable. The above findings suggest that the basement membrane of <b>renal</b> <b>arteriole</b> and the basement membrane like material of mesangium and lacis are interrelated, and may be the portions in the kidney most liable to changes and injury in hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{present study}} {{examined}} the hypothesis that activation of protein kinase C (PKC), components of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, or both contributes to the inhibitory effects of 20 -hydroxyeicosatet-raenoic acid (20 -HETE) on K 1 -channel activity and its vasoconstrictor response in renal arterioles. 20 -HETE (0. 1 to 50 mmol/L) dose-dependently produced a 30 % increase in PKC activity and a fivefold rise in the expression of active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1) and ERK 2 proteins in renal microvessels. 20 -HETE (0. 01 to 1 mmol/L) reduced the diameter of isolated perfused renal interlobular arterioles by 3362 %. Blockade of PKC activity with an N-myristoylated PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor (Myr-PKCi, 100 mmol/L) or calphostin C (0. 5 mmol/L) had no {{significant effect on the}} vasoconstrictor response to 20 -HETE. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein (30 mmol/L) and tyrphostin 25 (10 mmol/L) reduced the response to 20 -HETE by 76. 562. 1 % and 67. 561. 8 %, respectively. A specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK), PD 98059, had no effect on the vasoconstrictor response to 20 -HETE. In cell-attached patches on renal vascular smooth muscle cells, 20 -HETE reduced the open state probability of a large-conductance K 1 channel (from 0. 002660. 0004 to 0. 000660. 0001). The Myr-PKCi (100 mmol/L) did not alter the inhibitory effects of 20 -HETE on this channel. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (30 mmol/L) blocked the inhibitory effects of 20 -HETE on the large-conductance K 1 channel. These data suggest that 20 -HETE activates the MAP kinase system in <b>renal</b> <b>arteriole...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aprominent {{pathology}} textbook {{used in the}} United States {{includes an}} image illustrating the renal histopathology caused by malignant hypertension. The legend describes striking “onion skin” changes of a <b>renal</b> <b>arteriole.</b> Curiously, a sea of mononuclear inflammatory cells surrounding this arteriole is overlooked both in the legend and in the related text. Moreover, nothing regarding inflammation or immune reactions is discussed. This {{lack of attention to}} inflammatory cells is, however, not surprising. Although many experimental studies have implicated inflammation in hypertension, these have largely been performed in experimental animals; there is no proof that inflammation contributes to human hypertension. In fact, some anti-inflammatory or immune-suppressing drugs (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclosporine) paradoxically cause hypertension in humans, likely via off-target effects. Often the term “inflammation” is used in the context of cardiovascular disease as a catchall referring to nonspecific phenomena, such as elevation of C-reactive protein or the presence of macrophages in a tissue. Most clinicians and investigators find this vague and difficult to understand. Even more puzzling is that many studies now implicate the adaptive immune response, and in particular, lymphocytes, in hypertension and vascular disease. Traditionally, bacterial, viral, or tumor antigens activate this arm of immune defense. As such, it has been hard to imagine how adaptive immunity could be involved in a disease such as hypertension. In this article, we will attempt to address some of these puzzling questions. We will briefly review components of the innate and adaptive immune response, discuss data from many groups, including our own, that suggest that common forms of hypertension are immune mediated, and provide a working hypothesis of how signals from the central nervous system trigger an immune response that causes hypertension...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) {{isoenzymes}} (CYP 2 C and CYP 2 J) {{are involved}} in the production of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which are postulated as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs). We hypothesized that if CYP 2 C 11 is involved in the EDHF-mediated responses, its mRNA should be expressed in endothelial cells. We, therefore, examined the mRNA expression of CYP 2 C 11 in endothelial cells of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles.</b> METHODS: Laser microdissection was applied to isolate endothelial cells from the <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> of 4 male and 4 female Wistar rats. As a positive control of CYP 2 C 11 expression, hepatocytes were also dissected from these rats. RNA was isolated and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis was applied. RESULTS: Q-PCR analysis showed that CYP 2 C 11 mRNA was not expressed in laser microdissected endothelial cells of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> of male and female rats. CYP 2 C 11 mRNA expression was highly abundant in hepatocytes dissected from male livers, but in female livers hardly any CYP 2 C 11 mRNA was detected. CONCLUSION: We have shown that endothelial cells can be dissected from small <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> by laser microdissection to study the mRNA expression of specific genes by Q-PCR. Using this novel tool, we demonstrated that the CYP 2 C 11 mRNA was not expressed in the endothelial cells of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles.</b> Therefore, we speculate that CYP 2 C 11 does not contribute to the EDHF-mediated responses in <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the acute renal effects of the glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor agonist (GLP- 1 RA) exenatide in type 2 diabetes patients. Methods: We included overweight (BMI 25 – 40  kg/m 2) men and postmenopausal women, aged 35 – 75  years with type 2 diabetes (HbA 1 c 48 – 75  mmol/mol; 6. 5 – 9. 0 %) and estimated GFR ≥ 60  ml min− 1 1. 73  m− 2. Exenatide or placebo (NaCl solution, 154  mmol/l) was administrated intravenously in an acute, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Diabetes Center VU University Medical Center (VUMC). GFR (primary endpoint) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by inulin and para-aminohippurate clearance, respectively, based on timed urine sampling. Filtration fraction (FF) and effective renal vascular resistance (ERVR) were calculated, and glomerular hydrostatic pressure (PGLO) and vascular resistance of the afferent (RA) and efferent (RE) <b>renal</b> <b>arteriole</b> were estimated. Tubular function was assessed by absolute and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), potassium (FEK) and urea (FEU), in addition to urine osmolality, pH and free water clearance. Renal damage markers, BP and plasma glucose were also determined. Results: Of the 57 patients randomised by computer, 52 {{were included in the}} final analyses. Exenatide (n = 24) did not affect GFR (mean difference + 2 ± 3  ml min− 1 1. 73  m− 2, p = 0. 489), ERPF, FF, ERVR or PGLO, compared with placebo (n = 28). Exenatide increased RA (p < 0. 05), but did not change RE. Exenatide increased FENa, FEK, urine osmolality and pH, while FEU, urinary flow and free water clearance were decreased (all p < 0. 05). Osmolar clearance and renal damage makers were not affected. Diastolic BP and mean arterial pressure increased by 3 ± 1 and 6 ± 2  mmHg, respectively, whereas plasma glucose decreased by 1. 4 ± 0. 1  mmol/l (all p < 0. 05). Conclusions/interpretation: Exenatide infusion does not acutely affect renal haemodynamics in overweight type 2 diabetes patients at normal filtration levels. Furthermore, acute GLP- 1 RA administration increases proximal sodium excretion in these patients.

I also examined the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on the expression of MHC isoforms in <b>renal</b> afferent <b>arterioles</b> from SHR. SM 1 was expressed in both afferent and efferent arterioles from WKY and SHR, but much less expressed in efferent arterioles compared with afferent arterioles. On the other hand, SM 2 was only expressed in afferent arterioles, and was less expressed in vehicle SHR than WKY. The expression of SM 1 and SM 2 in afferent arterioles from enalapril-treated SHR for 6 weeks and WKY were more increased than those from vehicle SHR (WKY vs vehicle SHR; p < 0. 01, vehicle SHR vs enalapril-treated SHR; p < 0. 05, WKY vs enalapril-treated SHR; not significant).

40|$|The exact {{relation}} between {{disease of the}} <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> and arterial hypertension is not understood.

40|$|Dynamics {{of blood}} {{pressure}} {{over the life}} span of a human being demonstrates a growth path. The most significant theories which try to explain dynamics of blood pressure adopt a kidney-dependent approach. Structural reductions in the size of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> (vascular remodeling) and loss of nephrons are considered to be primarily responsible for the progressive increase in blood pressure. A dynamic simulation model is constructed to realistically reproduce the long-term progression of blood pressure in healthy and in hypertensive people. It focuses on systemic interactions that result in vascular remodeling of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> and in loss of nephrons. These hypertensive mechanisms are integrated with fluid volume and blood pressure control mechanisms which are aimed to achieve homeostatis. This study suggests that progression of blood pressure can suitably be modeled by conceptualizing the problem as a long-term control of fluid excretion capacity. The reference behaviors for normal and hypertensive people underline alternative pathways in blood pressure progression. Experiments with the model demonstrate that management of the number of remodeled arterioles over time should be an essential task in long-term blood pressure progression control. Scenario runs with the simulation model help distinguish successful policies from the ineffective interventions. 2...|$|R

In tissue bathed in Ringer's solution containing 150 mM Na+ and 1. 5 mM Ca 2 +, afferent and efferent arteriolar [Ca 2 +]i averaged 136 ± 6 and 154 ± 7 nM, respectively. Removal of extracellular Na+ increased afferent arteriolar [Ca 2 +]i by 70 ± 7 nM, while efferent arteriolar [Ca 2 +]i only increased by 39 ± 5 nM (P < 0. 01 vs. afferent arteriole).

Recently, we {{have found}} that transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 2 and renin are abundantly expressed in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) of dehydrated mice. Since potassium (K+) depletion also stimulates renin and induces hypertrophy of the JGA, we examined the ability of this maneuver to stimulate TGF-β isoforms and renin in renovascular tissue and the JGA of young rats. Sprague-Dawley rats (50 ± 5 g) were fed either a control diet or a potassium-deficient diet (< 0. 05 % K+) for 7, 16, or 21 days. As a control for TGF-β and renin stimulation, an additional group of animals was fed a normal diet but was water deprived for three days. Potassium-depleted animals experienced severe growth retardation but kidney weight increased significantly. Potassium depletion induced both TGF-β 2 and renin immunoreactivity in <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> and the JGA but had no effect on TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 3 isoforms. To determine the role of circulating angiotensin II in the stimulation of TGF-β 2 by potassium depletion, a group of potassium-depleted rats received enalapril (100 mg/liter) in the drinking water. The addition of converting enzyme inhibitor increased both the intensity of TGF-β 2 and renin staining as well as the number of cells positively stained. Our results demonstrate that K+ depletion induces TGF-β 2 and renin in <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> and in the JGA. Furthermore, circulating angiotensin II is not responsible for the increase in the local expression of TGF-β 2. These findings suggest that TGF-β 2 may be an important mediator of JGA hypertrophy.

Additionally, intramyocardial coronary, gastric submucosal and <b>renal</b> interlobular <b>arterioles</b> were examined in hypertensive patients. Hypertensive medial damage consist-ed of irregular atrophy and paucity of smooth muscle with accumulation of nonfatty debris and basement membranes. These changes were diffuse, extensive and not uniform, and were unrelated to atherosclerosis or bifurcation.

40|$|Diversity and {{variability}} of smooth muscle phenotypes of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> as revealed by myosin isoform expression. The contractility and extensibility of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> {{are important in}} the regulation of glomerular filtration. However, little is known regarding the characteristics of contractile proteins in these arterioles. Recently it was demonstrated that vascular smooth muscles contain two types of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, SM 1 and SM 2, which are unique molecular markers of smooth muscle cell phenotypes. SM 1 is constitutively expressed in all types of smooth muscles, whereas SM 2 exists only in mature smooth muscles. We characterized the expression of MHC isoforms {{as well as the}} ultrastructural myofilament assembly of renal arteriolar smooth muscles in human, rat and rabbit by immunohistochemical techniques. SM 1 and α-smooth muscle actin were localized in both the preglomerular vessels (including the afferent arterioles) and efferent arterioles, whereas SM 2 was present only in the preglomerular vessels. Renin-producing cells in the afferent arterioles (juxtaglomerular granular cells, JG cells) were positive for α-smooth muscle actin but negative for SM 2. When renin synthesis was stimulated, the more proximal afferent arteriolar smooth muscles turned renin-positive and SM 2 disappeared. Glomerular mesangial cells did not show immunoreactivities for SM 1, SM 2 or α-smooth muscle actin. The difference in MHC isoform expression in these arterioles was also reflected by ultrastructures; the afferent arteriolar smooth muscles contained abundant myofilaments including thick filaments, whereas the efferent arteriolar smooth muscles had a few myofilaments composed only of thin microfilaments. The JG cells displayed a myofilament assembly similar to that in the efferent arteriolar smooth muscles. We conclude from these observations that smooth muscles in pre- arid postglomerular arterioles, the glomerular mesangial cells and JG cells differ in phenotypes, suggesting that they may have different contractile properties which may be critically involved in the regulation of glomerular filtration...|$|R

He also suffered from slowly progressive renal failure {{with the findings of}} granular deposits similar to electron-dense granular osmiophilic material in the <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles.</b> We found a novel heterozygous missense mutation of the NOTCH 3 gene, c. 4039 G>C in exon 24, resulting in a p. Gly 1347 Arg substitution in its extracellular domain. The noncysteine substitution may underlie the pathogenesis of white matter lesions in the brain and of the chronic renal failure in the present case. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{produced}} and characterized three anti-C-flanking peptides of neuropeptide Y (CPON) monoclonal antibodies. The Ka for these antibodies ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 8 x 10 (8) l/mol with an IC 50 for CPON(1 - 30) at about 20 nM {{as determined by}} ELISA. All these antibodies are IgG 1 and recognize the 16 - 30 part of CPON. These antibodies and a specific anti-NPY monoclonal antibody were used to study the localization of CPON and NPY in the human kidney. The avidin-biotin technique was employed. NPY and CPON immunoreactivities were present in large amount in the renal tubules of the human kidney {{but not in the}} glomeruli. No labeling was found within the <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> and veins, but some immunoreactivity was evidenced in the perivascular area. Because no specific receptor for CPON has been described to date, the presence of this peptide in the tubules may be due to a tubular reabsorption or perhaps to a local synthesis of pro-NPY...|$|R
40|$|Aminopeptidase-A (APA) is a {{metalloprotease}} that cleaves N-terminal aspartyl and glutamyl residues from peptides. Its best-known substrate is angiotensin II (Ang II), {{the most}} active compound of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS is involved in renal development. Most components of the RAS system are expressed in the developing kidney. Thus far, APA has not been studied in detail. In the present study we have evaluated the expression of APA at the protein, mRNA, and enzyme activity (EA) level in the kidney during nephrogenesis. Furthermore, we have studied the effect of inhibiting APA EA by injection of anti-APA antibodies into 1 -day-old mice. APA expression was observed from the comma stage onwards, predominantly in the developing podocytes and brush borders of proximal tubular cells. Notably, APA was absent in the medulla or the <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles.</b> Inhibition of APA EA caused temporary podocyte foot-process effacement, suggesting a minimum role for APA during nephrogenesis...|$|R
30|$|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is {{a common}} {{condition}} in critically ill patients with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in cases of persistent AKI [1]. The renal Doppler resistive index (renal RI) has recently been suggested as a bedside tool in critically ill patients. It is a rapid and noninvasive technique that allows evaluation of renal hemodynamics through the analysis of flow velocities through the <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography [2 – 5]. In recent years, renal RI has been used {{with a wide variety}} of renal conditions for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation, such as evaluation of renal graft rejection after transplantation [6, 7], assessment of the progression of chronic renal disease [8], and evaluation of renal artery stenosis in patients with systemic arterial hypertension [9, 10]. In the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, a recent meta-analysis showed that renal RI might be an accurate tool to assess the reversibility of AKI in critically ill patients [2].|$|R

Connexin 40 (Cx 40) also plays a sig-nificant role in the regulation of renin secretion. We investigated the effect of deleting the Cx 40 gene on autoregulation of afferent arteri-olar diameter in response to acute changes in renal perfusion pressure. The experiments were performed using the isolated blood perfused juxtamedullary nephron preparation in kidneys obtained from wild-type or Cx 40 knockout mice. Renal perfusion pressure was increased in steps from 75 to 155 mmHg, and the response in afferent arteriolar diameter was measured. Hereafter, a papillectomy was performed to inhibit TGF, and the pressure steps were repeated. Conduction of intercellular Ca 2 changes in response to local electrical stimulatio...|$|R
40|$|Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) modulates {{the growth}} and {{differentiation}} of many cells and often functions in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. The myoepithelial cells of the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) synthesize and secrete renin. Under conditions which chronically stimulate renin production, the JGA undergoes hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The molecular factors responsible for these changes in the JGA have not been identified. In the present study, plasma renin activity was stimulated in the mouse by water deprivation. Using immunoperoxidase staining with specific antibodies against TGF-beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3, we found increased TGF-beta 2 accumulation in the JGA and interlobular arteries. Immunostaining with renin antiserum demonstrated colocalization of TGF-beta 2 and renin. TGF-beta 1 and beta 3 expression was not different between control and water-deprived mice. Our results suggest that {{in the setting of}} water deprivation, TGF-beta 2 is localized in a manner which would allow it to act either as a growth factor for or as a phenotypic modulator of the JGA and <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} thesis were to explore the {{molecular}} genetics and pathophysiology of hyperhomocysteinemia. These objectives will be addressed by the following two research questions: i) Which genetic variants contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia, and ii) What is the pathophysiology of homocysteine {{in relation to the}} endothelium-dependent vasodilatation? This thesis is divided into two parts. Part I includes studies in which we investigated whether genetic variation in genes coding for two major regulating enzymes of the homocysteine metabolism (e. g. BHMT and SHMT) is associated with elevated homocysteine levels (chapters 2 - 3). In part II we have i) investigated the role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) -mediated vasodilatation, connexins and cytochrome P 450 in small <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> of hyperhomocysteinemic rats (chapters 4 - 6) and, ii) examined the pathophysiology of hyperhomocysteinemia in aorta by microarray analysis (chapters 7 - 8) and studied the role of a common polymorphism in the eNOS gene in relation to hyperhomocysteinemia (chapter 9) ...|$|R
40|$|Renovasculopathies of nephrosclerosis in {{relation}} to atherosclerosis at ages 25 to 54 years. Renovasculopathies of hypertension include arteriolar hyalinization and arterial intimal fibroplasia. Atherosclerotic features of coronary arteries and aorta include fatty streaks and raised lesions. Data were obtained {{from a series of}} 573 autopsies of black and Caucasian males and females aged 25 to 54 years, who died of violent and natural causes unrelated to atherosclerosis. Analysis showed positive correlations of coronary and aortic raised lesions with arteriolar hyalinization. Arterial intimal fibroplasia correlated positively with raised lesions in the aorta but only weakly and inconsistently in the coronary arteries. The extent of fatty streaks in the coronaries, as in the aorta, did not correlate with either form of renovasculopathy. These results provide evidence that hyalinization of <b>renal</b> <b>arterioles</b> may be a marker for young people who have the most advanced coronary atherosclerosis, and who therefore have an early start upon a course toward coronary heart disease later in life...|$|R
