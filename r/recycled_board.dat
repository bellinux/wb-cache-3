40|$|In {{order to}} remain on store shelves and stay {{competitive}} among the overwhelming number of packaged goods on today’s shelves, companies continue to cut packaging material and increase sustainability. Current packaging has made use {{of a variety of}} paperboard materials including Solid Bleached Sulfate (SBS), Coated <b>Recycled</b> <b>Board</b> (CRB) and Uncoated <b>Recycled</b> <b>Board</b> (URB), also known as Kraft. While both SBS and CRB feature a smooth, white printing surface ideal for high quality graphics, Kraft is typically associated with a dull printing surface and lower-quality graphics. Companies and brands interested in marketing to the eco-friendly consumer are printing a simulated Kraft look on SBS and CRB board rather than utilizing a natural Kraft substrate. The packages printed on natural Kraft substrate (URB) or simulated Kraft substrate (CRB) may or may not affect attention of the consumer when shopping. This research sought to investigate this by using eye-tracking metrics collected from participants in a retail-shopping environment.

40|$|Challenges {{surrounding}} energy {{have gained}} increased attention, {{which is not}} least reflected in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Energy issues have also become a pressing matter for most countries in the last decades. The reasons for this are not only related {{to the effects of}} the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from fossil fuels and their impact in climate change, but also span through other issues such as security of energy supply with geopolitical considerations and competitiveness of industry. To address these issues, a collection of public policies ranging from the international to local levels have been implemented. Sweden has historically had lower energy prices than its European counterparts, which has resulted in its industry having a relatively higher share of electricity in the total energy use by industry. The share of electricity accounts for 35 % of total energy use in Swedish industry. This has led to efficiency measures being overlooked by industry, and the pulp and paper industry is by far the biggest energy user, with a share of 51 % of the total energy use by industry. The variation of energy prices, and particularly electricity prices have obvious implications on the competitiveness of this sector. Production of biogas in pulp and paper mills has been gaining attention, and is now the target of an increasing number of scientific studies. The interest for this industry is not only related to security of energy supply and the environmental performance of the biogas itself, but there are also considerations regarding the biogas plant as an alternative to treat the large flows of wastewaters and other waste stream in this sector. There is an estimated biogas production potential of 1 TWh within this industry in Sweden, which accounts for 60 % of the current biogas production in the country. Pulp and paper mills commonly rely on aerated biological treatment to deal with waste streams with high organic content This biological process has a high energy demand, and the integration of an anaerobic treatment, along {{with the use of the}} biogas for heat and electricity can yield a net positive energy recovery for the combined plant. This project analyses the current energy and material performance of an anaerobic biological treatment combined with an aerobic biological treatment in a <b>recycled</b> <b>board</b> mill. The anaerobic treatment is performed upstream of the aerobic one and removes most of the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater. Energy and material balances for the plant are presented, and a comparison of the wastewater treatment plant running before and after the start-up of the biogas plant is made. The plant operation with the anaerobic digestion has shown an increased energy use of 9. 4 % coupled to an increased flow of wastewater of 7. 7 %. The average biogas production is 72 Nm³/h, which accounts for 440 kWh and is currently being flared. The introduction of AD has largely decrease the organic load in the aerobic treatment, by nearly 50 %. This project ends with an optimisation model implemented with the optimisation tool reMIND to investigate potential optimisation strategies for the operation of the combined plant. The model has shown to be adequate to describe electricity use with mean error below 10 %. For the biogas production, the mean error was of 16 %...|$|E

The collier tended the hearths for 10 to 14 days until the charcoal was ready. The charcoal was then sent to the Juniata Iron Works which was in operation until 1848 when all the wood in the surrounding area had been consumed.

40|$|At the end {{of their}} service life, wood-based panels become {{eventually}} waste wood. Deploying in landfills is no longer considered as an acceptable solution for their handling due to the high organic load included. The recycling of this waste to be employed as raw material for the wood panel industry, which traditionally makes use of wood processing residues, has hence gained more importance and been examined from earlier times. Technical problems and the lack of enforcing legislative regulations have delayed, however, the industrial implementation of the new technologies proposed. Recent research efforts enabled {{the development of a new}} process for the recycling of end-use wood panels into new marketable fibreboards. This patent pending process is based on the refiner technique and allows the use of mixtures of fresh wood and waste panel chips as a raw material for dry-process fibreboard production. The process is applicable in existing fibreboard plants with only minor operation modifications and therefore, there is no need of major capital investment in additional equipment to effect the recycling. At the refining stage, chemical agents are employed and the process enables the use of significant amounts of waste material replacing over 20 % of the wood feed and providing significant savings. The aim of the present work was to validate the industrial applicability of the new process in the recycling of waste medium-density fibreboards. The new fibreboards obtained during the industrial scale tests were of acceptable quality, and the testing results revealed that under conventional gluing and pressing conditions, the process effectively <b>recycles</b> the waste <b>boards</b> into new ones at least at 25 % wood substitution level.

40|$|Brown {{packaging}} linerboard, made {{entirely from}} recovered pulp, {{was subjected to}} deinking flotation for evaluating the possible improvements in its chemical, optical and mechanical properties. The increase {{in the rate of}} recovered paper utilisation, along with the tendency towards lower basis weights, in the packaging paper production, has created a growing need for the utilisation of secondary fibers of improved quality. To attain better quality fibers, flotation deinking of brown grades is being considered, along with the addition of primary fibers to recovered paper furnish. Numerous conducted studies, in which the flotation technology was used in the treatment of brown grades, support this idea. Most of them show that the quality of fibers is improved after flotation deinking, resulting in higher mechanical properties of the deinked handsheets and in lower amounts of chemical contaminants. As to food and human health safety, packaging paper has to meet specific requirements, to be classified as suitable for its direct contact with foods. <b>Recycled</b> paper and <b>board</b> may contain many potential contaminants, which, {{especially in the case of}} direct food contact, may migrate from packaging materials into foodstuffs.
