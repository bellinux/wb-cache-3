In order to address the above issue, improved control scheme of UPFC should be adopted.

40|$|AbstractThe soluble F 1 {{complex of}} ATP synthase (FoF 1) {{is capable of}} ATP hydrolysis, {{accomplished}} by the minimum catalytic core subunits α 3 β 3 γ. A special feature of cyanobacterial F 1 and chloroplast F 1 (CF 1) is an amino acid sequence inserted in the γ-subunit. The insertion is extended slightly into the CF 1 enzyme containing two additional cysteines for regulation of ATPase activity via thiol modulation. This molecular switch was transferred to a chimeric F 1 by inserting the cysteine-containing fragment from spinach CF 1 into a cyanobacterial γ-subunit [Y. Kim et al., redox regulation of rotation of the cyanobacterial F 1 -ATPase containing thiol <b>regulation</b> <b>switch,</b> J Biol Chem, 286 (2011) 9071 – 9078]. Under oxidizing conditions, the obtained F 1 tends to lapse into an ADP-inhibited state, a common regulation mechanism to prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis under unfavorable circumstances. However, the information flow between thiol modulation sites on the γ-subunit and catalytic sites on the β-subunits remains unclear. Here, we clarified a possible interplay for the CF 1 -ATPase redox regulation between structural elements of the βDELSEED-loop and the γ-subunit neck region, i. e., the most convex part of the α-helical γ-termini. Critical residues were assigned on the β-subunit, which received the conformation change signal produced by disulfide/dithiol formation on the γ-subunit. Mutant response to the ATPase redox regulation ranged from lost to hypersensitive. Furthermore, mutant cross-link experiments and inversion of redox regulation indicated that the γ-redox state might modulate the subunit interface via reorientation of the βDELSEED motif region...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the study of load models and control of residential appliances. A load model base on computing an average dwelling augmented by a diversification process is introduced. This model is well-suited for studying the load group's natural and controlled dynamics. To validate this model, extensive simulations are employed. Two different strategies are proposed for the control of residential appliances: (1) aperiodic ON/OFF switching of the appliances; (2) continuous control of the thermostat temperature settings. A mathematical framework based on Pulse Width Modulation theory is developed for the remote ON/OFF switching of residential appliances. Load Management System performs the switching actions on load groups {{in such a way that}} the resulting net demand of the appliances matches with a Load Reduction Target. The Load Reduction Target is obtained by modelling load groups as new generation resources into generation scheduling functions. The results of the proposed approach are compared with the results of the current practices and it is shown that the proposed scheme is an effective and flexible method that not only can realize the general form of Load Reduction Targets but also it is capable of error compensation, payback power <b>regulation,</b> <b>switching</b> schedules, incremental update and handling unequal peak powers of load groups. For continuous control schemes, it is shown that during the control period, diversified states of the appliances do not change drastically and room temperatures within each load group are largely similar. Optimal control strategies are generated by employing Priority List, Linear Programming and Forward Dynamic Programming. The results show a close match between the Load Reduction Target and appliances' demand during control period. Both methods are efficient and flexible. They allow incremental updating of schedules. Therefore, they are good candidates for use in real time operations...|$|R

VSGs are expressed exclusively from subtelomeric loci, and we have previously shown that telomere proteins TbTIF 2 and TbRAP 1 play important roles in VSG switching and VSG silencing regulation, respectively. We now discover that the telomere duplex DNA-binding factor, TbTRF, also plays {{a critical role in}} VSG <b>switching</b> <b>regulation,</b> as a transient depletion of TbTRF leads to significantly more VSG switching events. We solved the NMR structure of the DNA-binding Myb domain of TbTRF, which folds into a canonical helix-loop-helix structure that is conserved to the Myb domains of mammalian TRF proteins. The TbTRF Myb domain tolerates well the bulky J base in T. brucei telomere DNA, and the DNA-binding affinity of TbTRF is not affected by the presence of J both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we find that point mutations in TbTRF Myb that significantly reduced its in vivo telomere DNA-binding affinity also led to significantly increased VSG switching frequencies, indicating that the telomere DNA-binding activity is critical for TbTRF's role in VSG <b>switching</b> <b>regulation.</b> Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R

Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene, erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF), is required for expression of the beta-globin gene in mice, presumably through interaction with a high-affinity binding site in the proximal promoter. To examine the role of EKLF in the developmental regulation of the human gamma-globin gene we interbred EKLF heterozygotes (+/-) with mice harboring a human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene. We find that {{in the absence of}} EKLF, while human beta-globin expression is dramatically reduced, gamma-globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5 -fold. Impaired silencing of gamma-globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma-globin to beta-globin switch.
