50|$|Point to Multipoint is {{the most}} popular {{approach}} for wireless communications that have a large number of nodes, end destinations or end users. Point to Multipoint generally assumes there is a central Base Station to which <b>remote</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Units</b> or Customer Premises Equipment, CPE (a term that was originally used in the wired telephone industry) are connected over the wireless medium. Connections between the Base Station and <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Units</b> can be either Line of Sight or for lower-frequency radio systems Non-Line-of-Sight where link budgets permit. Generally, lower frequencies can offer non-Line-of Sight connections. Various software planning tools can be used to determine feasibility of potential connections using topographic data as well as link budget simulation. Often the point to multipoint links are installed to reduce the cost of infrastructure and increase the number of CPE's and connectivity.|$|R
5000|$|The trunked voice {{operations}} include {{registration of}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>units,</b> affiliation of <b>subscriber</b> <b>units</b> to the <b>Subscriber</b> Group Home, initiation of an SU-to-SU call, and initiation of a Group call.|$|R
30|$|The cost of <b>subscriber</b> <b>units</b> {{varies by}} the {{technology}} used. An unlicensed band PtMP <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit</b> typically costs $ 150, or circa $ 800 for a licensed band unit. PtP equipment costs circa $ 3000 for an unlicensed band, or $ 6000 for a licensed band unit.|$|R
50|$|A <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit,</b> or SU is a {{broadband}} {{radio that}} is installed at a business or residential location {{to connect to}} an access point to send/receive high speed data wired or wirelessly. Devices {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit</b> include cable modems, access gateways, home networking adapters and mobile phones.|$|R
30|$|The network {{topology}} used to service wind farms with high speed data connectivity {{is that of}} fixed base stations serving numerous fixed <b>subscriber</b> <b>units.</b> Before radio planning can commence, {{it is necessary to}} calculate the distance <b>subscriber</b> <b>units</b> can be from their base station so that base stations can be appropriately placed.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the link}} is bidirectional, each antenna both transmits and receives. As EIRP {{is limited to}} the same value at both the <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit</b> and the base station, the range will be limited by the lower of the two antenna gains. Directional {{antennae}} may be used at the <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit,</b> so in practice the base station antennae will limit range.|$|R
50|$|Although Wi-Fi and WiMAX are {{designed}} for different situations, they are complementary. WiMAX network operators typically provide a WiMAX <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Unit</b> that connects to the metropolitan WiMAX network and provides Wi-Fi connectivity within the home or business for computers and smartphones. This enables the user to place the WiMAX <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Unit</b> in the best reception area, such as a window, and have date access throughout their property.|$|R
30|$|The quality-of-service (QoS) {{mechanisms}} of WiMAX and Wi-Fi are different. WiMAX provides {{quality of service}} through a connection orientated scheme operated at the base station. This delivers packets to <b>subscriber</b> <b>units</b> based on priority, and similarly schedules <b>subscriber</b> <b>units</b> to transmit based on the priority of their data. Wi-Fi uses contention based quality of service, where subscribers try to access the access point based on random time intervals. This is a poor mechanism for time sensitive data.|$|R
50|$|Maximum {{information}} rate (MIR) {{in reference to}} broadband wireless refers to maximum bandwidth the <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit</b> will be delivered from the wireless access point in kbit/s.|$|R

5000|$|In the Bell System, central offices {{provided}} {{this type}} of service on a dedicated telephone number (102 type Milliwatt line) for <b>remote</b> <b>subscriber</b> line testing. In conjunction, a second line (type 100 line) provided quiet termination (cf. loop around). Various types of test lines were called [...] "100", [...] "102", [...] "104" [...] etc. because these numbers accessed the test line in tandem offices in lieu of an area code.|$|R

50|$|Wideband Integrated Digital Enhanced Network, or WiDEN, is a {{software}} upgrade developed by Motorola for its iDEN enhanced {{specialized mobile radio}} (or ESMR) wireless telephony protocol. WiDEN allows compatible <b>subscriber</b> <b>units</b> to communicate across four 25 kHz channels combined, for up to 100 kbit/s of bandwidth. The protocol is generally considered a 2.5G wireless cellular technology.|$|R
40|$|PACS (Personal Access Communications System) {{has been}} {{recently}} standardized as a TDMA air interface for microcellular networks {{operating in the}} PCS band (1850 - 1990 MHz). In order to meet performance requirements, the standard suggests use of a simple dual diversity antenna system at the Radio Port (base station) and <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Unit</b> (mobile). Spacetime signal processing {{can be used to}} enhance the PACS system, improving its coverage and capacity. We propose a hybrid transceiver architecture consisting of switched antennas and adaptive combining. The receiver at the Radio Port consists of a multiple sectored antenna array, a switch that selects the best two antennas, and an adaptive combiner for the two selected outputs. Transmission takes place on the best receive antenna. The receiver at the <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Unit</b> consists of two omnidirectional antennas and an adaptive combiner.

50|$|AXE10 covers {{two main}} types of digital {{telephony}} switching equipment: the <b>remote</b> <b>subscriber</b> switch (RSS) and the AXE10 local switch. RSS {{acts as a}} remote concentrator and deals with the conversion of analogue telephony signals used in the access network, which is the copper pairs between exchange buildings and customer premises, also called local loop, and the multiplexing of customer lines over cabling to the AXE10 local switching unit. The AXE10 local switch uses a processor-controlled switch to route calls and data depending on the destination of the telephony transmission.|$|R
50|$|Owing to its {{inherent}} {{single carrier}} structure, a prominent advantage of SC-FDMA over OFDM and OFDMA {{is that its}} transmit signal has a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), resulting in relaxed design parameters in the transmit path of a <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit.</b> Intuitively, the reason {{lies in the fact}} that where OFDM transmit symbols directly modulate multiple sub-carriers, SC-FDMA transmit symbols are first processed by an N-point DFT block.|$|R

5000|$|The Project 25 Inter RF Subsystem Interface (P25 ISSI) is a {{non-proprietary}} interface {{that enables}} RF subsystems (RFSSs) built by different manufacturers {{to be connected}} together into wide area networks so that users on different networks can talk with each other. The wide area network connections using the ISSI provide an extended coverage area for <b>subscriber</b> <b>units</b> (SUs) that are roaming. The extended coverage area is important for public safety first responders that provide assistance in other jurisdictions during an emergency.|$|R
30|$|The {{link between}} the base station and the <b>subscriber</b> <b>unit,</b> in this work, is {{considered}} to be the ‘last-mile’. The radio frequency band used is 5.8  GHz, a license exempt/light licensed band. In other applications, it may be more appropriate to operate under license in the 3.5  GHz band, but the same methodology will apply. Although microwave links can be established without line-of-sight, experience suggests that at 5.8  GHz adequate performance in range and throughput can only be achieved with line-of-sight to the base station.|$|R
