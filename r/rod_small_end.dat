50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The connecting <b>rod</b> <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into {{the eye of the}} small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E
40|$|Main and {{connecting}} rod bearings along the crankshaft in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow to ensure the performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} rod bearings have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting rod large end bearing loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting rod large end bearing and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting rod large end and small end bearing stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main bearing and connecting rod large end bearing appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to connecting <b>rod</b> <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|E

A frusto-conical member extends into the extension at the cutter member end of the rotating <b>rod</b> with its <b>small</b> <b>end</b> engaging the tube. The portion of the frusto-conical member outside of the extension forms a tissue engaging member and may be cut-off at an angle to the axis of the rod to form a tissue engaging edge. Apertures are provided in the extension adjacent the frusto-concial member so that treatment fluid supplied in the annular space between the tube and the extension may flow to the operative site. An aperture is provided in the frustoconical member between the extension and the tube so that fluid may also flow into the tube where it mixes with macerated tissue being directed through an aperture in the tube to a passageway which may have suction applied to help remove macerated material...|$|R
40|$|Having in mind con-rods for {{motorbike}} and car engines, and {{spurred by}} the disagreements evidenced in the pertinent literature, the maximum circumferential stresses within the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> are investigated analytically, photoelastically, and numerically. The analytical models are based upon a plane assumption, and they adopt both beam and theory of elasticity idealizations. The plane photoelastic study concentrates on <b>small</b> <b>ends</b> with outer to inner radii ratios ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 5. A plane numerical model aimed at thoroughly mimicking the pin ovalization is developed, and a design chart of the peak hoop stress within the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> is provided for {{a wide spectrum of}} <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and pin geometries, for zero initial clearance.

40|$|Keywords：pipe elbows; {{reducing}} elbows; elastic stress; in–plane close-bending moment; limit close-bending moment Abstract：Elastic {{stresses and}} limit close-bending moments of reducing elbows subject to in–plane close-bending moments were validated by limit element analysis (LMA) and testing. Results of LMA show {{that if the}} end bend moment M acts on <b>small</b> <b>end</b> while the large end is fixed, the largest movement acts on neutral line near the larger end, and large circumferential stress lies on inside surface near neutral lines but deflect to intrados of large end. For the same model, if the end bend moment M acts on large <b>end</b> while the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> is fixed, the largest movement acts on near the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and lies on neutral line, and larger stress acts on <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and nearby. Results of testing show that stress character in tension stress and compressive stresses {{are consistent with the}} calculation results from formula. The limit bending moment calculation results from formula of reducing elbow is conservative, but is consistent with the formula of the limit bending moment, which is controlled by <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of reducing elbow...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effects of divergent selection and different positions of Japanese quail eggs in artificial incubation on hatchability, egg weight loss, chick weight. 300 Japanese quail (100 birds in each line) were used for egg collection. These lines have been selected for high (HW) and low (LW) body weight for 9 generations and compared with control line(C). Average of 822 eggs (274 eggs in each line) was 14. 19, 12. 02 and 10. 2 in HW, C and LW, respectively, all at 13 weeks of age. Based on eggs positions during incubation were divided into two experimental groups (137 eggs in each group in each line: vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up, vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> down with turning). The eggs incubated in vertical and <b>small</b> <b>end</b> down had the higher hatchability (59. 2 %), while those incubated in vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up presented the lower hatchability (8. 5 %). Egg position influenced water loss during incubation. The groups with better hatchability presented lower egg weight loss and better hatch weight. The eggs in HW had the lower hatchability and higher egg weight loss and better hatch weight. Key words: Divergent selection Egg position Reproductive traits Japanese quai...|$|R

40|$|Storing hatchable eggs is {{a common}} {{practice}} in commercial hatcheries. However, storage time may negative effects on several performance parameters. An experiment was carried out to evaluate inverting egg position during storage of eggs laid by young and old layer breeders. Fertile eggs of 32 and 58 -week-old breeders were stored for seven, 14, and 21 days at 18 ºC ± 2 ºC and 80 % ± 10 % relative humidity (RU). The following parameters were evaluated: egg weight loss, hatchability and hatchling weight, and embryodiagnosis results. Eggs stored with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up lost less weight during storage compared with the control eggs. Storing eggs for 14 days with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up reduced early embryo mortality, improving hatchability. In addition, hatchling weight increased.
