Using a Contracer apparatus, the profiles of the buccal and lingual root surfaces of these teeth were traced on a millimeter-scaled paper. The profiles were registered from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), millimeter by millimeter, up to the entrance of the furcation. The width, length and depth of the <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> groove, as well as the length of the <b>root</b> <b>trunk,</b> were studied. After statistical analysis (p < 0. 05) it was possible to conclude that: a) the mean width of the <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> groove on the buccal surface was 3. 6 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 3 mm; b) the mean depth of the <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> groove on the buccal surface was 0. 88 mm and, on the lingual surface, 0. 77 mm; c) the mean length of the <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> groove on the buccal surface was 2. 93 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 61 mm. The mean length of the <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> on the buccal surface was 3. 09 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 91 mm (p < 0. 025).

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate root dimensions in the furcation area of 233 mandibular first molars. Material and Methods: Digital photomicrographs were used to obtain the following measurements on the buccal and lingual surfaces of each tooth: <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> height (RT), horizontal interadicular distance obtained 1 mm (D 1) and 2 mm (D 2) below the fornix and interadicular angle (IA). Results: Mean standard deviation of buccal and lingual furcation measurements were, respectively, 1. 37 +/- 0. 78 mm and 2. 04 +/- 0. 89 mm for RT; 0. 86 +/- 0. 39 mm and 0. 71 +/- 0. 42 mm for D 1; 1. 50 +/- 0. 48 mm and 1. 38 +/- 0. 48 mm for D 2; 41. 68 +/- 13. 20 degrees and 37. 78 +/- 13. 18 degrees for IA. Statistically significant differences were found between all measured parameters for buccal and lingual sides (p< 0. 05, paired t test). Conclusions: In conclusion, the lingual furcation of mandibular first molars presented narrower entrance and longer <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> than the buccal furcation, suggesting more limitation for instrumentation and worse prognosis to lingual furcation involvements in comparison to buccal lesions...|$|E
40|$|Treating bony craters by {{surgical}} method needs elimination or {{reduction of}} bony lesions {{as well as}} providing sufficient bone by minimum osteotomy in order to preserve supporting bone. Furcation preservation is very important. Most mandibular molars are overtreated from buccal aspect that leads to inverted morphology and affects buccal forcation. Identifying anatomical structures and their relation to lesions is essential. In crater therapy, furcation and tooth trunk are two major anatomical structures. Low to medium Craters are appropriate for osseous resection. Craters of maxillary molars with palatal plate bone loss are treated by 10 degree palatal inclination and decreasing buccal bone according to <b>root</b> <b>trunk.</b> Besides, osteoplasty  is indicated for buccal bone. Second molars are treated similarly but they have longer root trunks and thicker buccal bone which needs osteoplasty. Craters of Mandibular first molar area are treated by osteoplasty in lingual bone as well as buccal bone reduction according to <b>root</b> <b>trunk.</b> likewise, second molars are treated but they have more lingual bone as well as lingual inclination of teeth and longer root trunks.   On the other hand, scalloped morphology is not sufficiently favorable.

30|$|Root {{amputation}} or hemisection may {{be suggested}} for maxillary molars (Gupta and Kabra 2016) or mandibular molars (Anitha and Rao 2015) when {{just one of}} their roots is fractured. Depending on the periodontal condition {{and the level of}} the fracture line, the resection may be done at several levels of the root, and the coronal part of the root can sometimes be retained following a root-end treatment and filling. However, in case of fused roots, the amputation procedure is usually not recommended (Tsesis et al. 2015).

Results: The results indicated that compound 6 -(4 -fluorophenyl) - 4 -methoxy- 5, 6 -dihydropyran- 2 -one (2 d) exerts potent and dosedependent analgesic activity, inhibiting abdominal constrictions caused by acetic acid in mice, and being more active than some reference drugs.

40|$|The cohesion-tension {{theory of}} water {{transport}} states that hydrogen bonds hold water molecules together {{and that they}} are pulled through the xylem under tension. This tension could cause transport failure in at least two ways: collapse of the conduit walls (implosion), or rupture of the water column through air-seeding. The objective of this research was to elucidate the functional significance of variations in tracheid anatomical features, earlywood to latewood ratios and wood densities with position in young and old Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine trees in terms of their consequences for the safety factors for tracheid implosion and air-seeding. For both species, wood density increased linearly with percent latewood for <b>root,</b> <b>trunk</b> and branch samples. However, the relationships between anatomy and hydraulic function in trunks differed from those in roots and branches. In roots and branches increased hydraulic efficiency was achieved at the cost of increased vulnerability to air-seeding. Mature wood of trunks had earlywood with wide tracheids that optimized water transport and had a high percentage of latewood that optimized structural support. Juvenile wood had higher resistance to air-seeding and cell wall implosion. The two safety factors followed similar axial trends from roots to terminal branches and were similar for both species studied and between juvenile and mature wood...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of Neodimium:Yttrium-Aluminium-Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in association with graphite on the dentin morphologic changes. METHODS: In this experimental in vitro study, 16 freshly extracted third molars were selected. 5 specimens with the dimensions of 2 × 2 × 1 mm from <b>root</b> <b>trunk</b> were prepared. Specimens were randomly divided into five groups: group 1 (control, no laser irradiation). Group 2, 3 irradiated by Nd:YAG laser 0. 5 and 1 W, output power respectively. Group 4, 5 smeared with graphite and then irradiated by Nd: YAG laser 0. 5 and 1 W output power. Samples were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Number and diameter of dentinal tubules were determined in different groups and analyzed with the Kruskal-wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (SPSS 16). RESULTS: The number of tubules had significant difference between all groups (P P > 0. 05), and group 3 in comparison with group 4 (P > 0. 05). Micro-cracks and rupture of melted dentin materials were seen in group 4 and 5.
