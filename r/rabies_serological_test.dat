40|$|Serology {{remains the}} only way to monitor the {{effectiveness}} of vaccination of humans and animals against rabies. Many techniques for determining the level of rabies antibodies have been described, and all of the methods used rabies viruses as antigen. Indeed attenuated viruses can revert to a more virulent form, and inactivated virus may produce serious side effects. Anti-idiotype Ab can induce protective immune response against rabies virus, its means that anti-idiotype Ab can be used as surrogate antigen in serological test. The aim {{of this study is to}} prepare the anti-idiotype antibody (anti-idiotype Ab) as diagnostic kit in <b>rabies</b> <b>serological</b> <b>test.</b> Polyclonal anti-idiotype Ab were prepared in laying chickens and purified using affinity chromatography column for IgY. Rabbit anti dog immunoglobuline were prepared used New Zeeland White strain, and dog anti rabies serum were prepared from rabies immunized dog. For the preparation of the kit, it takes a few stages, i. e. the making of stocks A, stocks B and prototype diagnostic kit. Stocks A is a mixture of S. aureus Cowan I intact in solution of Tris Buffer HCl with rabbit anti dog serum in various comparisons (v/v). Stocks B is a mixture of rabies anti-idiotype Ab with rabies antibody (IgG anti rabies) are harvested fro...|$|E
40|$|Rabies and canine {{distemper}} are fatal diseases of mammals and {{of concern in}} the Serengeti, Tanzania both for public health and wildlife conservation. This study investigates the epidemiology of these diseases through cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of two domestic dog populations bordering the Serengeti National Park. Chapter 2 demonstrates differences in demographic and behavioural characteristics between the two populations, leading to predictions of distinct patterns of rabies and {{canine distemper}} infection, and the requirement for different strategies of disease control. Chapter 3 compares the use of three <b>rabies</b> <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> for seroepidemiological studies of domestic dogs. Non-specificity precluded use of the indirect ELISA, but a liquid-phase blocking ELISA (BE) and neutralization test (RFFIT) demonstrated rabies seropositivity among unvaccinated Serengeti dogs. The poor agreement between BE and RFFIT in unvaccinated dogs led to an investigation of specificity, which indicated that the BE was the more specific assay. In Chapter 4, incidence data and virus typing suggested that dogs, not wildlife, are the reservoir of rabies in the Serengeti. Case surveillance data indicated that rabies persists in higher- density dog populations, but occurs only sporadically in lower-density dog and wild carnivore populations. Rabies seropositivity occurred in dogs remaining healthy, demonstrating the existence of atypical infections. Mathematical models showed that rabies persistence in Serengeti dogs was more likely if seropositives were infectious carriers, rather than slow-incubators or immune animals. In Chapter 5, analysis of case-morbidity, mortality and age-seroprevalence data indicated that canine distemper was stably endemic in higher-density dog populations, but sporadically epidemic in lower-density dog populations. In conclusion, higher-density dog populations {{to the west of}} the Serengeti National Park are the most likely reservoir of both rabies and canine distemper in the Serengeti and disease control strategies should therefore focus on controlling infection in these populations...|$|R

40|$|This review covers some {{epidemiological}} {{aspects that}} allow Brucella to survive, spread, and maintain {{itself in the}} environment. Because the success of maintaining Brucella-free herds {{is determined by the}} efficiency of the <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> to detect a single infected animal the limitations of the traditional <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are emphasized. <b>Serological</b> <b>tests</b> cannot differentiate between cattle infected with Brucella and cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with B. abortus antigen. These cattle and cattle with 'natural' antibodies jeopardize the Brucella-free status of a herd. Likewise, infected cattle with serologically inconclusive test results or which elude detection are also a hazard to Brucella-free herds. Since cattle that elude detection with <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> and the presence of non-specific serum antibodies in healthy cattle have long been recignized as problems, it is opportune to reconsider the procedures currently used to diagnose brucellosis in individual animals. Use of the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity test in addition to <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> will significantly improve the diagnosis of brucellosis. This will limit the financial loss incurred by outbreaks of brucellosis...|$|R

40|$|Background. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are {{now widely}} available, but indi-cations {{for their use}} have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a {{committee}} of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations {{for the use of}} type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV- 2) <b>serological</b> <b>tests.</b> Methods. By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population. Results. The committee concluded that, in addition to <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV- 2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial. Conclusions. The targeted use of HSV- 2 <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> for specific diagnostic situations and selected pop-ulations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recom-mendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV- 2 <b>serological</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

A total of 109 sera collected from 65 seropositive and 44 seronegative dogs were used. The sensitivities of the Snap and ImmunoRun kits were 89. 23 % (95 % confidence interval: 79. 05 - 95. 54 %) and 86. 15 % (95 % confidence interval: 75. 33 - 93. 45 %), respectively, and the specificity of both tests was 100 %. A good agreement between each of the rapid in-clinic <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> and IFAT and between the 2 rapid in-clinic <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> was witnessed.

40|$|AbstractSerological {{tests for}} {{tuberculosis}} are inaccurate and WHO has recommended against their use. Although not {{used by the}} Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP), serodiagnostics are widely used {{in the private sector}} in India. A root-cause analysis was undertaken to determine why <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are so popular, and seven root causes were identified that can be grouped into three categories: technical/medical, economic, and regulatory. Technical/medical: RNTCP’s current low budget does not allow scale-up of the newer, WHO-endorsed technologies. Thus, under the RNTCP, most patients have access to only smear microscopy, a test that is insensitive and underused in the private sector. Because there is no accurate, validated, point-of-care <b>test</b> for TB, <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> meet a perceived need among doctors and patients. Economic: While imported molecular or liquid culture tests are too expensive, there are no affordable Indian versions on the market, leaving <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> as the main alternative. Although <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are inaccurate, various players along the value chain profit from their use, and this sustains a market for these tests. Regulatory: TB tests are poorly regulated and a large number of serological kits are on the market. Private healthcare in general is poorly regulated, and doctors in the private sector are outside the scope of RNTCP and do not necessarily follow standard guidelines. A clear understanding of these realities should facilitate market-based strategies that can help replace <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> with accurate, validated tools...|$|R
