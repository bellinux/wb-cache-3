40|$|Several {{computations}} on radiation {{emerging from}} the atmosphere for different aerosol models have been performed and the reflection matrix of a given surface was defined by incident light signature analyses. A two channel polarimeter is being constructed for measuring the Stokes parameters of reflected light. Surface albedo measurements were made in six wavelength ranges in the ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared spectral regions for six different vegetated surfaces, four soil surfaces, and two roadway surfaces. The effects of polarization changes on the intensity of projected images were studied by using a <b>rotatable</b> <b>polarizer</b> {{in front of an}} aerial camera lens...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate two types of sensor that can be applied to monitor human finger flexion in real time. Currently, flex sensors are the most commonly used resistance sensors in glove-based systems. However, measurements show that current flex sensors have problems associated with hysteresis error, low sensitivity at small angles, and considerable time drift with large bending angles which render them unsuitable for tracking hand motion at low speed. In contrast, the developed optical sensor prototype has good repeatability, sensitivity and low temporal drift, as well as offering the capability of accurate measurements in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. The sensor is based on the principle of crossed-polarization detection, and consists of one LED, two <b>rotatable</b> <b>polarizers</b> and one photodiode amplifier which enables the detection of changes in polarized light intensity proportional to angular rotation...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the {{mechanism by which}} a metamaterial surface can act as an ideal phase-controlled <b>rotatable</b> linear <b>polarizer.</b> With equal-power linearly polarized beams incident {{on each side of}} the surface, varying the relative phase rotates the polarization angles of the output beams, while keeping the polarization exactly linear. The explanation is based on coupled-mode theory and the idea of coherent perfect absorption into auxiliary polarization channels. The polarization-rotating behavior occurs at a critical point of the coupled-mode theory, which can be associated with the exceptional point of a parity-time (PT) symmetric effective Hamiltonian...|$|R
40|$|A beam {{waveguide}} (BWG) design suitable for high-power applications is described. The design features a transmit-only, four-port high-gain horn as input to a BWG {{system with a}} single parabolic mirror and three flat plates. The use of a single parabolic mirror is such that the highest field concentration is no greater than that caused by the horn itself. The horn is linearly polarized and a grid reflector is used to reflect the orthogonal polarization into the receive feed. A <b>rotatable</b> dual <b>polarizer</b> provides for arbitrary transmit polarization. The dual-reflector system is shaped to provide uniform illumination over the main reflector and therefore maximum gain for the given size aperture. Measured data from a scale model BWG system are presented...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{fluidity}} {{was measured}} in the isolated perfused proximal tubule from rabbit kidney. The apical and basolateral plasma membranes of tubule cells were stained separately with the fluidity-sensitive fluorophore trimethylammonium-diphenyl-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) by luminal or bath perfusion. Fluorescence anisotropy (r) of TMA-DPH was mapped with spatial resolution using an epifluorescence microscope (excitation 380 nm, emission greater than 410 nm) equipped with <b>rotatable</b> <b>polarizers</b> and a quantitative imaging system. To measure r without the confounding effects of fluorophore orientation, images were recorded with emission polarizer parallel and perpendicular to a continuum of orientations of the excitation polarizer. The theoretical basis of this approach was developed and its limitations were evaluated by mathematical modeling. The tubule inner surface (brush border) was brightly stained when the lumen was perfused with 1 microM TMA-DPH for 5 min; apical membrane r was 0. 281 +/- 0. 006 (23 degrees C). Staining of the tubule basolateral membrane by addition of TMA-DPH to the bath gave a significantly lower r of 0. 242 +/- 0. 010 (P less than 0. 005); there was no staining of the brush border membrane. To interpret anisotropy images quantitatively, effects of tubule geometry, TMA-DPH lifetime, fluorescence anisotropy decay, and objective-depolarization were evaluated. Steady-state and time-resolved r and lifetimes in the intact tubule, measured by a nanosecond pulsed microscopy method, were compared with results in isolated apical and basolateral membrane vesicles from rabbit proximal tubule measured by cuvette fluorometry; r was 0. 281 (apical membrane) and 0. 276 (basolateral membrane) (23 degrees C). These results establish a methodology to quantitate membrane fluidity in the intact proximal tubule, and demonstrate a significantly higher fluidity in the basolateral membrane than in the apical membrane...|$|R
40|$|The Motional Stark Effect (MSE) {{diagnostic}} on ITER {{determines the}} local plasma current density {{by measuring the}} polarization angle of light resulting from the interaction of a high energy neutral heating beam and the tokamak plasma. This light signal has to be transmitted from the edge and core of the plasma to a polarization analyzer located in the port plug. The optical system should either preserve the polarization information, or {{it should be possible}} to reliably calibrate any changes induced by the optics. This LLNL Work for Others project for the US ITER Project Office (USIPO) is focused on the design of the viewing optics for both the edge and core MSE systems. Several design constraints were considered, including: image quality, lack of polarization aberrations, ease of construction and cost of mirrors, neutron shielding, and geometric layout in the equatorial port plugs. The edge MSE optics are located in ITER equatorial port 3 and view Heating Beam 5, and the core system is located in equatorial port 1 viewing heating beam 4. The current work is an extension of previous preliminary design work completed by the ITER central team (ITER resources were not available to complete a detailed optimization of this system, and then the MSE was assigned to the US). The optimization of the optical systems at this level was done with the ZEMAX optical ray tracing code. The final LLNL designs decreased the ''blur'' in the optical system by nearly an order of magnitude, and the polarization blur was reduced by a factor of 3. The mirror sizes were reduced with an estimated cost savings of a factor of 3. The throughput of the system was greater than or equal to the previous ITER design. It was found that optical ray tracing was necessary to accurately measure the throughput. Metal mirrors, while they can introduce polarization aberrations, were used close to the plasma because of the anticipated high heat, particle, and neutron loads. These mirrors formed an intermediate image that then was relayed out of the port plug with more ideal (dielectric) mirrors. Engineering models of the optics, port plug, and neutral beam geometry were also created, using the CATIA ITER models. Two video conference calls with the USIPO provided valuable design guidelines, such as the minimum distance of the first optic from the plasma. A second focus of the project was the calibration of the system. Several different techniques are proposed, both before and during plasma operation. Fixed and <b>rotatable</b> <b>polarizers</b> would be used to characterize the system in the no-plasma case. Obtaining the full modulation spectrum from the polarization analyzer allows measurement of polarization effects and also MHD plasma phenomena. Light from neutral beam interaction with deuterium gas (no plasma) has been found useful to determine the wavelength of each spatial channel. The status of the optical design for the edge (upper) and core (lower) systems is included in the following figure. Several issues should be addressed by a follow-on study, including whether the optical labyrinth has sufficient neutron shielding and a detailed polarization characterization of actual mirrors...|$|R
