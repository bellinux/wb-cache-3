The movement spread rapidly, particularly under his son Zhang Heng (...) and grandson Zhang Lu. The Zhangs were able to convert many groups to their cause, such as the Bandun Man (belonging to the Ba people), which strengthened their movement.

500|$|The dark fantasy-themed RPG Diablo was {{released}} by Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996, {{in the midst of}} a stagnant PC RPG market. Diablo is set in the fictional kingdom of Khanduras, in the world of Sanctuary, and has the player take control of a lone hero who battles to <b>rid</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Its development was influenced by Moria and Angband, and Diablo resembles a roguelike due to its focus on dungeon crawling, and its procedurally generated levels. Major differences include the commercial quality of the game's graphics, its simplified character development, and its fast, real-time action. A factor in Diablos success was its support for online, collaborative play over a local area network or through its Battle.net online service. This greatly extended its replay value, though cheating was a problem. While not the first RPG to feature real-time combat, Diablos effect on the market was significant, a reflection of the changes that took place in other genres following the release of the action titles, Doom and Dune II. It had many imitators, and its formula of simple, fast combat and replayability were used by what were later referred to as [...] "Diablo clones", and more broadly [...] "action RPGs".|$|E
