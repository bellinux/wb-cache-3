40|$|We {{surveyed}} adjacent reaches with dif-fering {{riparian vegetation}} {{to explain why}} channels with forested banks are wider than channels with nonforested banks. Cross sec-tions and geomorphic mapping demonstrate that erosion occurs at cutbanks in curving reaches, while deposition is localized on active fl oodplains on the insides of bends. Our data indicate that <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition</b> and lateral migration are both higher in nonforested reaches than in forested reaches. Two dimensionless parameters, α and E, explain our observations. α represents the infl uence of grassy vegetation on <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> active fl oodplain deposition; it is 5 times higher in nonforested reaches than in forested reaches. E is proportional to <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> cutbank migration; it is 3 times higher in nonforested reaches than in forested reaches. Differences in width between forested and nonforested reaches are proportional to E/α. In forested reaches, channels are wide with banks that are diffi cult to erode. Dense tree roots create a low value of E, and the channel migrates slowly. E/α is high, however, because α is very low: shade from trees inhibits the growth of grass on active fl oodplains. In nonforested reaches, channels are narrow with banks {{that are easy to}} erode. E is high, and the channel migrates rapidly. E/α is low, however, due to a very large value of α: grass grows readily on nonforested convex bank fl oodplains. Thus, differences in width between forested and nonforested reaches are related to a balance between <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> cutbank erosion and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition</b> on active fl oodplains, implying that equilibrium widths develop to equalize <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> cutbank erosion and vegetation-mediated <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition</b> on active fl ood-plains. These results suggest that accurate models of width adjustment should consider the combined effects of bank erodibility and fl oodplain depositional processes, rather than focusing on these processes in isolation from one another...|$|R

40|$|Forests {{have long}} been {{considered}} as efficient sinks for atmospheric pollutants.

Large <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> pollutant gases, however, are only found for the very reactive gases HNO 3, HC 1 and NH 3.

The effects of afforestation on inputs of pollutants to catchments are illustrated by model calculations for inputs of sulphur and nitrogen to Kielder forest in northern England.

6000|$|How to Estimate the Average <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deposition</b> of the Sedimentary Rocks.--But if we {{take the}} {{estimate}} of Professor Haughton (177,200 feet), which, as we have seen, is probably excessive, for the maximum thickness of the sedimentary rocks of the globe of all known geological ages, can we arrive at any estimate of {{the rate at which}} they were formed? Dr. Croll has attempted to make such an estimate, but he has taken for his basis the mean thickness of the rocks, which we have no means whatever of arriving at, and which he guesses, allowing for denudation, to be equal to the maximum thickness as measured by geologists. The land-area of the globe is, according to Dr. Croll, 57,000,000[41] square miles, and he gives the coast-line as 116,000 miles. This, however, is, for our purpose, rather too much, as it allows for bays, inlets, and the smaller islands. An approximate measurement on a globe shows that 100,000 miles will be nearer the mark, and this has the advantage of being an easily remembered even number. The distance from the coast, to which shore-deposits usually extend, may be reckoned at about 100 or 150 miles, but by far the larger portion of the matter brought down from the land will be deposited comparatively close to the shore; that is, within twenty or thirty miles. If we suppose the portion deposited beyond thirty miles {{to be added to the}} deposits within that distance, and the whole reduced to a uniform thickness in a direction at right angles to the coast, we should probably include all areas where deposits of the maximum thickness {111} are forming at the present time, along with a large but unknown proportion of surface where the deposits were far below the maximum thickness. This follows, if we consider that deposit must go on very unequally along different parts of a coast, owing to the distance from each other of the mouths of great rivers and the limitations of ocean currents; and because, compared with the areas over which a thick deposit is forming annually, those where there is little or none are probably at least twice as extensive. If, therefore, we take a width of thirty miles along the whole coast-line of the globe as representing the area over which deposits are forming, corresponding to the maximum thickness as measured by geologists, we shall certainly over rather than under-estimate the possible rate of deposit.[42] ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two age-equivalent Upper Triassic fluvial {{successions}} {{deposited on}} the continental {{interior of the}} southwestern United States were evaluated using an adapted marine stacking-pattern analysis methodology. A three-tier cyclic hierarchy {{is present in the}} strata at both study areas. Meter-scale fining-upward fluvial aggradation cycles (FACs) comprise fluvial aggradational cycle sets (FACSETs) 4 – 15 m thick (avg. 8. 4 m). FACSETs in turn stack into four fluvial sequences 26 – 48 m thick (avg. 41 m). Within these sequences, transgressive-systems-tract equivalents (TE) are characterized by channel sands and associated minor overbank deposits and relatively immature paleosols (i. e., high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition),</b> whereas highstand- to falling-stage-systems-tract equivalents (HFE) are dominated by overbank muds and relatively well-developed paleosols (i. e., lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposition).</b> These two fluvial successions, which are 200 km apart, contain age-equivalent fluvial sequences that record similar histories <b>of</b> <b>deposition</b> and pedogenesis: Sequence 1 contains only an incomplete HFE; Sequence 2 includes both the TE and HFE; Sequence 3 is an HFE; and Sequence 4 contains only a TE. Fluvial sequences likely accumulated in response to pulses of source area uplift and/or basin subsidence, which resulted in changes in accommodation. Conversely, higherfrequency FACs and FACSETs that occur within sequences do not correlate between study areas and are likely the products of autocyclic processes, such as channel avulsion, floodplain aggradation, and channel migration. These results suggest that regionally significant tectonic episodes may be discernible in suspended-load fluvial deposits that accumulated over a broad area...|$|R
