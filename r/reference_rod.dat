40|$|The Cosserat {{theory of}} elastic rods {{has been used}} {{in a wide range of}} {{application}} domains to model and simulate the elastic deformation of thin rods. It is physically accurate and its implementations are efficient for interactive simulation. However, one requirement of using Cosserat rod theory is that the tubular object must have rigid cross-sections that are small compared to its length. This requirement make it difficult for the approach to model elastic deformation of rods with large, non-rigid cross-sections that can change shape during rod deformation, in particular, hollow tubes. Our approach achieves this task using a hybrid model that binds a mesh elastically to a reference Cosserat rod. The mesh represents the surface of the hollow tube while the <b>reference</b> <b>rod</b> models bending, twisting, shearing and stretching of the tube. The cross-sections of the tube may take on any arbitrary shape. The binding is established by a mapping between mesh vertices and the rod’s directors. Deformation of the elastic tube is accomplished in two phases. First, the <b>reference</b> <b>rod</b> is deformed according to Cosserat theory. Next, the mesh is deformed using Laplacian deformation according to its mapping to the rod and its surface elastic energy. This hybrid approach allows the tube to deform in a physically correct manner in relation to the bending, twisting, shearing, and stretching of the <b>reference</b> <b>rod.</b> It also allows the surface to deform realistically and efficiently according to surface elastic energy and the shape of the <b>reference</b> <b>rod.</b> In this way, the deformation of elastic hollow tubes with large, non-rigid cross-sections can be simulated accurately and efficiently...|$|E
40|$|A {{brief summary}} of the {{objections}} to the relational nature of inertial mass, gravitational mass and electric charge is presented. The objections are refuted by showing that the measurement process of comparing an instrument reference clock and a <b>reference</b> <b>rod</b> both obeying {{the laws of physics}} to a system obeying the same laws of physics results in relational quantities: inertial mass, gravitational mass and electric charge appear only as ratios. This means that scaling of the absolute inertial mass of every object in the universe by the same factor is unobservable (likewise for gravitational mass and electric charge). It is shown that the measurement process does not separate the instrument parameters from the system parameters. Instead a measurement produces functions of fundamental, dimensionless parameters such as the fine structure constant, electron-proton mass ratio and the proton gyro-magnetic factor. It is shown that the measurement of Planck's constant also results in such a function of these dimensionless parameters. Application of this analysis to the "absolute" Planck units shows that they too are functions only of relational quantities. Analysis focuses initially on non-relativistic systems for the sake of clarity and simplicity. The results are then extended to relativistic systems described by the Dirac equation and the Einstein field equations of general relativity. The results support the assertion that instrument parameters cannot be separated from system parameters even in classical mechanics. Comment: Posted to arXiv by Michael G.

40|$|A birefringence-balanced polarimetric {{multimode}} fiber temperature sensor is proposed and demonstrated. Two single-crystal sapphire rods {{are incorporated into}} the sensor head. They are connected end to end {{in such a way}} that the slow axis of the first rod is aligned with the fast axis of the second rod, referred to as the <b>referencing</b> <b>rod.</b> Since the lengths of the two rods are chosen to be almost the same, the original birefringence of the first rod is balanced by that of the second rod. A light-emitting diode serves as the light source. This sensor has been experimentally demonstrated for high-temperature measurements as high as 1500 C. A sensitivity of 5 C has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{performing}} predictive simulation of cardiac surgery. It applies a hybrid approach to model the deformation of blood vessels. The hybrid blood vessel model consists of a <b>reference</b> Cosserat <b>rod</b> and a surface mesh. The <b>reference</b> Cosserat <b>rod</b> models the blood vessel’s global bending, stretching, twisting and shearing in a physically correct manner, and the surface mesh models the surface details of the blood vessel. In this way, the deformation of blood vessels can be computed efficiently and accurately. Our predictive simulation system can produce complex surgical results given {{a small amount of}} user inputs. It allows the surgeon to easily explore various surgical options and evaluate them. Tests of the system using bidirectional Glenn shunt (BDG) as an application example show that the results produced by the system are similar to real surgical results. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA planar rod {{model with}} {{flexible}} cross-section has been recently proposed in literature (Guinot et al., 2012). This model is especially {{suitable for the}} modeling of tape springs, which develop localized folds due to the flattening of the cross-section. Starting from a complete non-linear elastic shell model, original kinematics assumptions (inspired from the elastica model) {{have been made to}} describe the important in-plane changes of the cross-section shape. In the present work, the choice of the position of the <b>rod</b> <b>reference</b> line is discussed. This choice {{plays an important role in}} the overall behavior because of the large changes of the cross-section shape. We show that the model published in Guinot et al.

40|$|Road {{smoothness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important road functional characteristics because it affects ride quality, operation cost, and vehicle dynamic load. There are many types of devices that measure the road profile, which is often used to compute different smoothness indices. The development of performance-based specifications and pavement warranties that use ride quality as a performance measure has increased the need for accurate measurement of pavement smoothness. For this reason, researchers have compared and evaluated the performance of available profilers and several profiler accuracy criteria have been proposed. However, there is not a definite answer on the ability of available profilers to accurately measure the actual road profile as well as the various smoothness indices. A recent profiler round-up compared the performance of 68 profilers on five test sections at Virginia Smart Road. The equipment evaluated included high-speed, light-weight, and walking-speed profilers, in addition to the <b>reference</b> device (<b>rod</b> and level). The test sites included two sites with traditional hot-mix asphalt (HMA) surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Similar to HIV- 1, the viral load in HIV- 2 is {{a marker}} of the {{evolution}} of infection and the success of therapy. No approved or commercially distributed assay exists to determine the plasma viral load of HIV- 2. We therefore developed a quantitative real-time PCR to determine the plasma RNA viral load of HIV- 2, based on the <b>reference</b> strains <b>ROD</b> and EHO, which represent subtypes A and B of HIV- 2, respectively. After testing several pairs of primers, a set was chosen that recognised the 5 '-LTR region of a subtypes A and B consensus sequence. The quantification of the PCR reaction was done using SYBR-Green I as the fluorescent dye in a Lightcycler system and relying on an external standard curve. The method was then optimised with reference strains, an validated further using patient samples and an inter-laboratory comparison. Good specificity was obtained for both subtypes of HIV- 2, and a linear range between 10 and 10 (6) copies of viral RNA. The limit of quantitation was 250 copies per millilitre of plasma. The coefficient of variation ranged from 0. 7 to 5. 6 %, depending on the concentration of the target sequences...|$|R
50|$|In fact, the {{downward}} {{acceleration of the}} rod, which is simultaneous in the grate's frame of reference, is not simultaneous in the <b>rod's</b> frame of <b>reference.</b> In the <b>rod's</b> frame of <b>reference,</b> {{the bottom of the}} front of the rod is first accelerated downward (not shown in drawing), and as time goes by, {{more and more of the}} rod is subjected to {{the downward}} acceleration, until finally the back of the rod is accelerated downward.

40|$|Three fast {{reactors}} (FR) {{are included}} in the Generation IV (GEN IV) nuclear system concepts: Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR), Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) and Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR). FRs have a unique role in the actinides management due to effective fissioning of the transuranic actinides (TRU) recovered from LWRs spent fuel. These GEN IV systems are capable, in principle, to operate with a complete recycle of all the uranium and TRU isotopes, providing a considerable increase in the available fuel resources and a decrease in the long term nuclear waste burden. These innovative systems can operate by using a wide range of fuel types including oxide, carbide, nitride, metal and dispersion fuels with different cladding material options. Concerning fuel technology, most of the gained experience refers to oxide fuels. Cross-cutting and generic open issues concerning fuel and cladding applicable to GEN IV nuclear systems will {{play an important role in}} the future nuclear fuel science. In this paper, a preliminary thermo-mechanical study, by means of the TRANSURANUS code (TU), is performed on mixed oxide fuel rods (MOX) operating in a LFR environment. To this purpose the design of the European Lead-cooled SYstem (ELSY), under study in the context of the EURATOM 6 th FP, was used as reference. In ELSY, main GEN IV goals are pursued (sustainability, economics, safety and reliability, proliferation resistance and physical protection).

40|$|In this talk, {{we present}} a theory of the linear {{viscoelasticity}} of dilute solutions of freely draining, inextensible, semiflexible rods. The theory is developed by {{an expansion of the}} polymer contour about a rigid <b>rod</b> <b>reference</b> state, in a manner that respects the inextensibil-ity of the chain, and is asymptotically exact in the rod-like limit where the polymer length L is much less than its persistence length Lp. In this limit, the relaxation modulus G t exhibits three time regimes: At very early times, less than the time τ ∝ L 8 L 5 p required for the end-to-end length of a chain to relax significantly after an initially affine deformation, the average tension induced in each chain and G t both decay as t 3 4. Over a broad range of intermediate times, τ t τ, where τ ∝ L 4 Lp is the longest relaxation time for the transverse bending modes, the end-to-end length decays as t 1 4, while the residual tension required to drive this relaxation and G t both decay as t 5 4.

5000|$|By contrast, {{the metric}} system has {{remained}} unchanged (for most practical purposes) {{since it was}} first defined. Even though the metre was initially defined to equal one ten-millionth {{of the length of}} the meridian through Paris from pole to the equator, the first prototype metre bar was subsequently found to be short by 0.2 millimetres (because researchers miscalculated the flattening of the Earth). Nevertheless, this original reference metre was retained, leaving the exact distance from equator to pole slightly more than ten million metres. The need for a more practical and reproducible definition of the metre and advances in metrology have led to increased precision in the definition, so that it is now defined as the length travelled by light in a vacuum during the time interval of [...] of a second. In addition, a <b>reference</b> standard (a <b>rod</b> of platinum-iridium alloy) is maintained by the inter-governmental organisation the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and calibration of a standard metre is usually achieved (to one part in a billion, or slightly better in some recent installations) by counting 1,579,800.298728 wavelengths of the ultra-fine (3s2 to 2p4) emission line of helium-neon laser light (this wavelength being approximately 632.99139822 nm in a vacuum).

40|$|Abstract: In our {{previous}} work [8] we proposed two methods {{to identify the}} reference electrode signal under the key assumption that the reference signal is independent from EEG sources. Although this assumption is shown to be possibly true for intracranial EEGwith a scalp reference. However, this assumption {{may not be true}} for scalp sources with a scalp reference electrode. As such, this limits the application of our methods to the vast majority of scalp EEG with cephalic reference. In this paper, we conduct analysis for five reference electrode locations of one subject: left thumb, left arm, left shoulder, left chest and left back. Since these locations are far away from the head of the subject, the real reference signal from these locations should be independent from all the scalp sources. As such, the second method in [8] should be able to be applied to identify the reference signal well. Our simulation results demonstrate that the corrected EEG after removing the obtained reference signal involves much more brain neural activities for anyone of these five reference locations than the corrected EEG after removing the average reference (AR), and the dominated periodical ECG artifacts in original EEG are completely removed out. This fact actually provides a strong evidence to support the above assumption of independence. The results in this paper suggest that rather <b>rod</b> <b>reference</b> sites such as hand, shoulder, chest, back, etc., indeed turn out to be much better than commonly suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{document}} {{deals with}} {{the application of a}} numerical model, called POTEL, to determine the electrical power to be supplied to filled rods, available in the PIPER-ONE experimental simulator, in order to simulate the performance of the nuclear fuel. Filled rods are difficult to construct but have a thermal capacity close to the one which characterizes the <b>reference</b> nuclear fuel <b>rods.</b> However, density and other material properties (e. g. conductivity) of electrical rods are still different from the prototype nuclear fuel; the difference may become important in selected transient conditions. In those conditions electrical power must be controlled in order to reproduce the temperature transient expected {{on the surface of the}} nuclear fuel rods. A complex software was developed to determine the electrical power transient based on the inverse solution for transient conduction heat transfer, i. e. the Fourier equation. Reference conditions (surface temperature and heat flux) were calculated by the RELAP code for nuclear fuel in the expected experimental conditions and were transformed into electrical power to be supplied to PIPER-ONE heaters during the actual experimental conditions (obviously if the code prediction was wrong – to be demonstrated a posteriori – the calculated transient for electrical power resulted inconsistent with the occurring thermal-hydraulic conditions). The application of the software to the commissioning experiments performed in PIPER-ONE is discussed in this report. PIPER-ONE was a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) simulator installed at the Scalbatraio Laboratory managed by Dipartimento di Costruzioni Meccaniche e Nucleari (DCMN, now DICI) of University of Pisa...|$|R

HIV- 2 replicates in lymphocytes but the susceptibility of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) to in vitro infection remains partly characterized. ResultsHere, we investigated HIV- 2 replication in primary CD 4 + T lymphocytes, both activated and non-activated, {{as well as}} in MDDCs. We focused on the requirement of Vpx for productive HIV- 2 infection, using the <b>reference</b> HIV- 2 <b>ROD</b> strain, the proviral clone GL-AN, as well as two primary HIV- 2 isolates. All HIV- 2 strains tested replicated in activated CD 4 + T cells. Unstimulated CD 4 + T cells were not productively infected by HIV- 2, but viral replication was triggered upon lymphocyte activation in a Vpx-dependent manner. In contrast, MDDCs were poorly infected when exposed to HIV- 2. HIV- 2 particles did not potently fuse with MDDCs and did not lead to efficient viral DNA synthesis, even in the presence of Vpx. Moreover, the HIV- 2 strains tested were not efficiently sensed by MDDCs, as evidenced by a lack of MxA induction upon viral exposure. Virion pseudotyping with VSV-G rescued fusion, productive infection and HIV- 2 sensing by MDDCs. ConclusionVpx allows the non-productive infection of resting CD 4 + T cells, but does not confer HIV- 2 with the ability to efficiently infect MDDCs. In these cells, an entry defect prevents viral fusion and reverse transcription independently of SAMHD 1. We propose that HIV- 2, like HIV- 1, does not productively infect MDDCs, possibly to avoid triggering an immune response mediated by these cells...|$|R
