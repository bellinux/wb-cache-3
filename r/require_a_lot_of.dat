25|$|Shamals {{normally}} {{last three}} to five days. Dust and sandstorm is several thousand feet deep. Wind speeds can reach up to 70 km/hr. Such events can impact health and transport, as visibility becomes limited, some flights get cancelled. Sand dunes build up on roads and <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> effort to remove. Some infrastructure such as street signs, become damaged by the Shamals.|$|E

25|$|Moose are not grazing animals but browsers (concentrate selectors). Like giraffes, moose {{carefully}} select {{foods with}} less fiber and more concentrations of nutrients. Thus, the moose's digestive system has evolved to accommodate this relatively low-fiber diet. Unlike most hooved, domesticated animals (ruminants), moose cannot digest hay, and feeding it to a moose can be fatal. The moose's varied and complex diet is typically expensive {{for humans to}} provide, and free-range moose <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> forested acreage for sustainable survival, {{which is one of}} the main reasons moose have never been widely domesticated.|$|E

25|$|M-theory {{is based}} on a {{quantitative}} theory of the ventral stream of visual cortex. Understanding how visual cortex works in object recognition is still a challenging task for neuroscience. Humans and primates are able to memorize and recognize objects after seeing just couple of examples unlike any state-of-the art machine vision systems that usually <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> data in order to recognize objects. Prior to the use of visual neuroscience in computer vision has been limited to early vision for deriving stereo algorithms (e.g.,) and to justify the use of DoG (derivative-of-Gaussian) filters and more recently of Gabor filters. No real attention has been given to biologically plausible features of higher complexity. While mainstream computer vision has always been inspired and challenged by human vision, it seems to have never advanced past the very first stages of processing in the simple cells in V1 and V2. Although some of the systems inspired - to various degrees - by neuroscience, have been tested on at least some natural images, neurobiological models of object recognition in cortex have not yet been extended to deal with real-world image databases.|$|E

The Nalimov tablebases, which use advanced compression techniques, require 7.05GB of hard disk space for all five-piece endings. The six-piece endings require approximately 1.2TB. The seven-piece Lomonosov tablebase requires 140 TB of storage space.|$|E

500|$|The {{amount of}} {{functional}} recovery and independence achieved {{in terms of}} activities of daily living, recreational activities, and employment {{is affected by the}} level and severity of injury. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate the function of patients throughout the rehabilitation process following a [...] spinal cord injury or other serious illness or injury. [...] It can track a patient's progress and degree of independence during rehabilitation. [...] People with SCI may need to use specialized devices and to make modifications to their environment in order to handle activities of daily living and to function independently. [...] Weak joints can be stabilized with devices such as ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) and knee-AFOs, but walking may still <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> effort. Increasing activity will increase chances of recovery.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Reviews {{stated that}} Victorious Boxers {{was one of}} the most technically accurate boxing games of its time. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer described it as dramatically different from the [...] "combo-intensive, somewhat sluggish feel" [...] of Knockout Kings. GameSpot stated the controls gave players [...] "better boxer control", and the [...] "AI of the computer opponents is extremely advanced". While many critics complimented the control scheme, they also commented on its difficulty to master. A common complaint was about characters improperly positioning itself in relation to the opponent while circling the ring. GamePro rated both the controls and fun factor a 4.5 out of 5, and mentioned though the controls were very intuitive and precise, [...] "they <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> brainwork and dexterity". Next Generation commented on the initial controls, stating they are problematic at first but can be reconfigured to suit the player.|$|E
500|$|While {{they had}} {{demonstrated}} that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed, this was still not a chain reaction. Szilard persuaded Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson to try a larger experiment using [...] of uranium. To maximize the chance of fission, they needed a neutron moderator to slow the neutrons down. Hydrogen was a known moderator, so they used water. The results were disappointing. It became apparent that hydrogen slowed neutrons down, but also absorbed them, leaving fewer for the chain reaction. Szilard then suggested Fermi use carbon, {{in the form of}} graphite. He felt he would need about [...] of graphite and [...] of uranium. As a back-up plan, Szilard also considered where he might find a few tons of heavy water; deuterium would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, but would have the similar value as a moderator. Such quantities of materiel would <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money.|$|E

500|$|The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel {{is a small}} spaniel classed as a toy dog by The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club. It {{originated}} in the United Kingdom {{and is one of}} the more popular breeds in many countries. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 18th most popular pure-breed in the United States (2013 Registration Statistics). [...] It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognizes four colours: Blenheim (chestnut and white), Tricolor (black/white/tan), Black and Tan, and Ruby. The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals; however, [...] they <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> human interaction. Since they are a family dog, it is recommended to not leave them alone for long periods at a time. The expected average lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is under ten years.|$|E
500|$|Plans for a {{war against}} the Southern Song began in 1158. That year, Wanyan Liang claimed that the Song had broken the 1142 treaty that banned them from {{acquiring}} horses. In 1159, he began building up his army in preparation for an invasion. He acquired weapons, which he stored in Beijing, as well as horses allegedly numbering 560,000. Wanyan Liang understood that an invasion of the Song would <b>require</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> men. He ensured that Han Chinese soldiers were drafted into the war effort alongside Jurchen soldiers. The recruitment drive lasted until 1161. Naval confrontations were likely because the Jin planned on traveling by river. Ships were seized for the war and 30,000 of the recruits {{were assigned to the}} Jin fleet. Wanyan Liang authorized the building of ships for the war in March 1159, {{under the auspices of the}} Ministry of War. Construction began in the Tong (...) prefecture near Beijing. Wanyan Liang appointed himself head of the army and took personal command of the Jurchen forces. The draft was unpopular. Several revolts erupted against it, many of them in the Jin provinces neighboring the Song. But Wanyan Liang allowed no dissent. He had his stepmother executed after hearing that she was critical of the war effort.|$|E
500|$|Chris Power of BBC Music {{compared}} Homework [...] "less-is-more" [...] {{approach to}} compression's use as [...] "a sonic tribute" [...] to the FM radio stations that [...] "fed Daft Punk's youthful obsessions."

[...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] the lid off the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10.

[...] In his view, [...] "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that [...] "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best." ...|$|E
