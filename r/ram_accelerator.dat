50|$|<b>Ram</b> <b>accelerators</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a cheap method to get payloads into space. Impulsive launched projectiles need some means to circularize their trajectory for orbit insertion, so rockets, such as those designed in the 1960s in Project HARP, are typically incorporated into the projectiles. With multi-stage rocket projectiles the launch cost was estimated at US$500 per kilogram in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Technologies {{related to}} a <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> for direct space launch {{applications}} are: two-stage gas guns (SHARP), multiple sidewall injection gas guns (JVL), railguns, and coilguns.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> {{also uses}} {{chemical}} energy like the space gun {{but it is}} entirely different in that it relies on a jet-engine-like propulsion cycle utilizing ramjet and/or scramjet combustion processes to accelerate the projectile to extremely high speeds.|$|E

50|$|A <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> is {{a device}} for {{accelerating}} projectiles {{or just a}} single projectile to extremely high speeds using jet-engine-like propulsion cycles based on ramjet or scramjet combustion processes.

50|$|PETN {{has been}} {{replaced}} in many applications by RDX, which is thermally more stable and has a longer shelf life. PETN {{can be used in}} some <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> types. Replacement of the central carbon atom with silicon produces Si-PETN, which is extremely sensitive.|$|E
50|$|The chief {{advantage}} of a <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> over a conventional gun is its scalability. In a normal gun, maximum pressure is exerted {{at the time of}} the initial charge detonation. As the projectile moves further down the barrel, the amount of acceleration upon the projectile decreases as the gas behind it expands, eventually reaching amounts trivial enough that a longer barrel is no longer justified (see internal ballistics). With a <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator,</b> the projectile is propelled primarily by the pressure generated by the reaction of the propellant gases burning just behind the projectile. This leads to constant pressure being put both on the gun and the projectile itself. Consequently, far longer barrels are possible than conventional guns, while still delivering a strong constant acceleration to the projectile.|$|E

50|$|In {{a normal}} ramjet, air is {{compressed}} between a spike-shaped centerbody and an outer cowling, fuel is added and burned, and high speed exhaust gases are expanded supersonically {{out of the}} nozzle to generate thrust. In a <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator,</b> a projectile having a shape similar to the ramjet centerbody is fired, (often from a conventional gun), into the accelerator barrel, causing compression between the projectile and the barrel's walls. The barrel contains a pre-mixed gaseous fuel-air mixture. As the <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> projectile compresses the fuel-air mixture, it is ignited and the combustion is stabilized {{at the base of}} the projectile. The resulting pressure differential generates a prodigious amount of thrust that can accelerate projectiles to in-tube Mach numbers greater than 8. Thus, if propellant mixtures with a speed of sound of 1000 m/s (e.g. fuel-rich H2-O2 mixtures) are used, muzzle velocities in excess of 8000 m/s are possible.|$|E
5000|$|To span a {{wide range}} in a typical <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> system, {{multiple}} stages with propellants with different sound speeds are used to maintain high performance.

As such, the ram can be maintained at optimal speeds of [...] Mach 3 - 5 (relative to the mixture that it travels through) during its entire acceleration period. Ram accelerators optimized to use supersonic combustion modes can generate even higher velocities (Mach 6-8) due {{to the ability to}} combust fuel that is still moving at supersonic speed.|$|E

This device {{has the potential to}} double the thrust performance of the conventional smooth-bore <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> while reducing its minimum starting velocity. The baffled-tube <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> utilizes a series of internal baffles to suppress the forward surge of a combustion driven shock wave, thus enabling operation in propellants having two to three times the energy release of those used with conventional smooth-bore ram accelerators. An experimental and theoretical investigation of this device is currently on-going at the University of Washington. Operation at velocities between 620 and 1220 meters per second has been demonstrated to date.

The <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> is a high velocity ramjet-in-tube projectile launcher whose principle of operation {{is similar to that}} of an airbreathing ramjet. The subcaliber projectile travels supersonically through a stationary tube filled with a premixed combustible gas mixture.

Several different <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> propulsive cycles have been experimentally demonstrated over the Mach number range of 3 to 8. 5.

The {{concept of the}} <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> {{is presented as a}} hypervelocity launcher for large-scale aeroballistic range applications in hypersonics and aerothermodynamics research. The <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> is an in-bore ramjet device in which a projectile shaped like the centerbody of a supersonic ramjet is propelled in a stationary tube filled with a tailored combustible gas mixture. Combustion on and behind the projectile generates thrust which accelerates it to very high velocities. The acceleration can be tailored for the 'soft launch' of instrumented models. The distinctive reacting flow phenomena that have been observed in the <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> are relevant to the aerothermodynamic processes in airbreathing hypersonic propulsion systems and are useful for validating sophisticated CFD codes.

The flowing gas radiation receiver is a novel concept for using solar energy to heat a working fluid for space power or propulsion. Focused solar radiation is absorbed directly in a working gas, rather than by heat transfer through a solid surface.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 University of Washington Abstract Projectile Combustion Effects on <b>Ram</b> <b>Accelerator</b> Performance Saarth Anjali Chitale Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Prof. Carl Knowlen William E. Boeing Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics The <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> {{facility}} at the University of Washington {{is used to}} propel projectiles at supersonic velocities. This concept is similar to an air-breathing ramjet engine in that sub-caliber projectiles, shaped like the ramjet engine center-body, are shot through smooth-bore steel-walled tubes having an internal diameter of 38 mm. The <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> propulsive cycles operate between Mach 2 to 10 and {{have the potential to}} accelerate projectile to velocities greater than 8 km/s. The theoretical thrust versus Mach number characteristics can be obtained using knowledge of gas dynamics and thermodynamics that goes into the design of the <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator.</b> The corresponding velocity versus distance profiles obtained from the test runs at the University of Washington, however, are often not consistent with the theoretical predictions after the projectiles reach in-tube Mach numbers greater than 4. The experimental velocities are typically greater than the expected theoretical predictions; which has led to the proposition that the combustion process may be moving up onto the projectile. An alternative explanation for higher than predicted thrust, which is explored here, is that the performance differences {{can be attributed to the}} ablation of the projectile body which results in molten metal being added to the flow of the gaseous combustible mixture around the projectile. This molten metal is assumed to mix uniformly and react with the gaseous propellant; thereby enhancing the propellant energy release and altering the predicted thrust-Mach characteristics. This theory predicts at what Mach number the projectile will first experience enhanced thrust and the corresponding velocity-distance profile. Preliminary results are in good agreement with projectiles operating in methane/oxygen/nitrogen propellants. Effects of projectile surface to volume ratio are also explored by applying the model to experimental results from smaller (Tohoku University, 25 -mm-bore) and larger (Institute of Saint-Louis 90 -mm-bore) bore ram accelerators. Due to lower surface-to-volume ratio, large diameter projectiles are predicted to need to reach higher Mach numbers than smaller diameter projectiles before thrust enhancement due to metal ablation and burning would be experienced. This proposition was supported by published experimental data. The theoretical modeling of projectile ablation, metal combustion, and subsequent <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> thrust characteristics are presented along comparisons to experiments from three different sized <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> facilities...|$|E

Conventional <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> projectiles consist of aluminum, magnesium, or titanium nosecones and bodies.

Experimentation using polycarbonate projectiles has been divided into two series: determining the lower limit for starting velocity (i. e., less than 1100 m/s) and investigating the upper velocity limit. To investigate the influence of body length and starting velocity, a newly developed "combustion gun" was used to launch projectiles to their initial velocities. The combustion gun uses 3 - 6 m of <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> test section as a breech and 4 - 6 m of the <b>ram</b> <b>accelerator</b> test section as a launch tube.
