25|$|Đính {{claimed to}} {{know nothing of}} Có's activities, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> vowing to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to achieve this. Despite their {{distrust}} of Đính, the Ngô brothers told them {{this was not the}} case and that they would promote him. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the Ngô family. One of Nhu's objectives was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another objective of the public relations stunt was to give the public a false impression of the strength of the Ngô regime.|$|E
25|$|Rochester {{opposed the}} {{election}} of William and Mary as king and queen, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> {{for the establishment of}} a regency on behalf of the exiled James. But he soon reconciled himself to the new order, perhaps because he could not retain his pension unless he took the oaths of allegiance. After this he was quickly in the royal favour and again a member of the Privy Council. He advised the queen in ecclesiastical matters, and returned to his former position as the leader of the High Church party. Rochester tried to mediate in the quarrel between Princess Anne and the King and Queen, but with little success. Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, thanked him for his expressions of goodwill, but added sarcastically that she would have valued them much more if she thought that they had been sincere.|$|E
500|$|During the 1933 track season, Ward was so {{dominant}} that he {{was dubbed}} Michigan's “one-man track team” and became a national sensation. [...] He led Michigan to Big Ten championships in both indoor and outdoor track. Going into the Big Ten track meet in May 1933, Ward was expected to dominate. Coach Hoyt described Ward as “a good ‘un,” and praised him for his unassuming character and tolerance of the spotlight of publicity. [...] One report noted: “He is altogether likeable, for he always speaks without <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and never protests a decision. [...] … Ward is a star now, but he is just finishing his first year of competition. Unless injuries hamper him it is likely he will be as great an attraction or possibly even greater than the two Negro track stars who preceded him here, DeHart Hubbard and Eddie Tolan.” ...|$|E

500|$|On a few episodes, Phineas {{shows an}} angrier side of himself, first {{seen in the}} [...] movie, where Phineas gets angry at Perry after finding out his secret {{identity}} because Perry [...] "never trusted him" [...] by telling him the truth, but later realizes that Perry kept his identity hidden because if Phineas and his family found out, Perry {{would be forced to}} relocate to another family. Another episode, [...] again demonstrates Phineas' angry side, when he got angry at Candace when she accidentally caused Baljeet to turn into a Hulk-type version of himself, but they later made amends {{at the end of the}} episode. Later, on [...] "Phineas and Ferb Save Summer", when Candace tries to power-up the machine, Phineas starts <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> at her in order for her to stop, to which Buford breaks the fourth wall by saying: [...] "Must be a special episode, he's yelling at his sister again!".|$|E
500|$|The {{police found}} a {{scattered}} trail of blood {{that led to}} the seventh floor of Block 12. [...] Stepping into the common corridor from the stairwell, Inspector Pereira noticed an eclectic mix of religious symbols (a cross, a mirror, and a knife-blade) on the entrance of the first flat (unit number 467F). [...] The owner of the flat, Adrian Lim, approached the inspector and introduced himself, informing [...] Pereira that he was living there with his wife, Tan Mui Choo, and a girlfriend, Hoe Kah Hong. [...] Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood. [...] Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood. [...] After the police [...] found slips of paper written with the dead children's personal details, Lim tried to allay suspicions by claiming that Ghazali had come to his flat seeking treatment for a bleeding nose. [...] He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's. [...] Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation. [...] Lim overheard them and became agitated, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> at the law enforcers. [...] His ire was mimicked by Hoe as she gestured violently and shouted at the officers. [...] Their actions further raised the investigators' suspicions that the trio were deeply involved in the murders. [...] The police collected the evidence, sealed the flat as a crime scene, and took Lim and the two women in for questioning.|$|E
500|$|My Name Is My Name was {{met with}} {{universal}} acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 27 reviews. Mike Powell of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "He's still a witty, quietly vicious rapper, capable of tearing apart spare street tracks like [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and [...] "Numbers on the Board" [...] while barely <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> But set in the more commercial contexts of Kelly Rowland features and the-Dream's fluorescent R, he can sound like a fish out of some pretty expensive water. Who Pusha was is gone, but who he is still sometimes unclear." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "With Pusha's pen at full force and his performance a proper combination of cold and tense, the album is as if Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury were atom-smashed into something more artful and unstable. My Name Is My Name is a remarkable and vital solo debut." [...] Jesse Cataldo, writing for Slant Magazine, said, [...] "Yet despite its pedigree, the album puts too much overall emphasis on guest spots and not enough on establishing a distinctive identity for the rapper. Full of retrograde lyrical conceits, seemingly at odds with its futuristic backdrops, My Name Is My Name {{is a reminder that}} Pusha T hasn't changed, and his stubborn reliance on maintaining his brand is probably not the wisest strategy in today's shifting hip-hop climate." [...] Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "A few poor production choices and uneven sequencing do slow the album, but it shows flashes of real brilliance. The best tracks here are produced by Kanye and Pharrell, and they're concentrated at the beginning and end. The smattering {{in the middle of the}} tracklist is handled by host of collaborators, not all of them effectively complimenting Pusha's rawness. While not the defining statement it could’ve been, My Name Is My Name shows different sides of Pusha T as he becomes a more multidimensional rapper." ...|$|E

500|$|The opera was {{the first}} by Gluck showing signs of his {{ambition}} to reform opera seria. Self-contained arias and choruses make way for shorter pieces strung together to make larger structural units. Da capo arias are notable by their absence; Gluck instead uses strophic form, notably in act one's [...] "Chiamo il mio ben così", where each verse is interposed with dramatic recitative, – that is, stromentato, where the voice is accompanied by part {{or all of the}} orchestra – and rondo form, such as in act three's famous [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?". Also absent is traditional secco recitative, where the voice is accompanied only by the basso continuo. On the whole, old Italian operatic conventions are disregarded in favour of giving the action dramatic impetus. The complexity of the storyline is greatly reduced by eliminating subplots. Gluck was influenced by the example of French tragédies en musique, particularly those of Rameau. Like them, the opera contains a large number of expressive dances, extensive use of the chorus and accompanied recitative. The coup de théâtre of opening the drama with a chorus mourning one of the main characters is very similar to that used in Rameau's Castor et Pollux (1737). Other elements do not follow Gluck's subsequent reforms; for instance, the brisk, cheerful overture does not reflect the action to come. The role of Orfeo calls for an especially gifted actor, so that the strophic [...] "Chiamo il mio ben così" [...] does not become dull, and so that tragic import can be given both to this aria and to [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?", both of which are based on harmonies that are not obviously mournful in nature. The first Orfeo, Gaetano Guadagni, was reputedly a fine actor who had certainly taken lessons while in London from the renowned Shakespearian actor David Garrick. Guadagni was apparently also able to project a moving and emotive tone without <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> Indeed, Gluck faced criticism of [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?" [...] {{on the grounds that it}} was emotionally uninvolved; he responded by pointing out the absolute necessity of fine execution of the aria: [...] "make the slightest change, either in the movement or in the turn of expression, and it will become a saltarello for marionettes".|$|E
2500|$|Mays was {{mentioned}} numerous times in Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts. One {{of the most}} famous of these strips was originally published on February 9, 1966. In it, Charlie Brown is competing in a class spelling bee and he is asked to spell the word, [...] "Maze". He erroneously spells it M-A-Y-S and screams out his dismay when he is eliminated. When Charlie Brown is later sent to the principal's office for <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> at the teacher regarding the incident, he wonders if one day he will meet Willie Mays and will have a good laugh together about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|The police dashcam video {{shows that}} 40 seconds elapsed between when Yanez first {{started talking to}} Castile through the car window and when Yanez began {{shooting}} at him. According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that I do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move! Fuck!” Of the seven shots fired by Yanez at point blank range, five hit Castile and two of those hit and pierced his heart.|$|E

2500|$|The first mastersingers file {{into the}} church, {{including}} Eva's wealthy father Veit Pogner {{and the town}} clerk Beckmesser. Beckmesser, a clever technical singer who was expecting to win the contest without opposition, is distressed to see that Walther is Pogner's guest and intends to enter the contest. Meanwhile, Pogner introduces Walther to the other mastersingers as they arrive. Fritz Kothner the baker, serving as chairman of this meeting, calls the roll. Pogner, addressing the assembly, announces his offer of his daughter's hand for {{the winner of the}} song contest. When Hans Sachs argues that Eva ought to have a say in the matter, Pogner agrees that Eva may refuse the winner of the contest, but she must still marry a mastersinger. Another suggestion by Sachs, that the townspeople, rather than the masters, should be called upon to judge the winner of the contest, is squelched by the other masters. Pogner formally introduces Walther as a candidate for admission into the masterguild. Questioned by Kothner about his background, Walther states that his teacher in poetry was Walther von der Vogelweide whose works he studied in his own private library in Franconia, and his teachers in music were the birds and nature itself. Reluctantly the masters agree to admit him, provided he can perform a master-song of his own composition. Walther chooses love as the topic for his song and therefore is to be judged by Beckmesser alone, the [...] "Marker" [...] of the guild for worldly matters. [...] At the signal to begin (Fanget an!), Walther launches into a novel free-form tune (So rief der Lenz in den Wald), breaking all the mastersingers' rules, and his song is constantly interrupted by the scratch of Beckmesser's chalk on his chalkboard, maliciously noting one violation after another. When Beckmesser has completely covered the slate with symbols of Walther's errors, he interrupts the song and argues that {{there is no point in}} finishing it. Sachs tries to convince the masters to let Walther continue, but Beckmesser sarcastically tells Sachs to stop trying to set policy and instead, to finish making his (Beckmesser's) new shoes, which are overdue. <b>Raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> over the masters' argument, Walther finishes his song, but the masters reject him and he rushes out of the church.|$|E
