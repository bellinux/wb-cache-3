50|$|Rotenone {{has been}} used as an organic {{pesticide}} dust for gardens. Unselective in action, it kills potato beetles, cucumber beetles, flea <b>beetles,</b> cabbage worms, <b>raspberry</b> <b>beetles,</b> and asparagus beetles, as well as most other arthropods. It rapidly biodegrades under warm conditions, so harmful residues are minimal. A light dusting on the leaves of plants will control insects for several days.|$|R
40|$|The {{matrix of}} {{strawberry}} and alternate host crops, wooded areas, and uncultivated sections that comprises a farm landscape provides not only food resources but also habitat in both a {{spatial and temporal}} context. Reports of the strawberry sap beetle as a pest in strawberry in the northeastern United States have increased along with a trend to produce a wider diversity of fruit crops on individual farms. The three objectives of this study focused on determining which, if any, habitats outside strawberry plantings are important to consider when developing control strategies for strawberry sap beetles. First, sampling of wooded areas and multiple crops showed that strawberry sap beetles overwinter not only in wooded areas but also in blueberry and <b>raspberry.</b> No overwintering <b>beetles</b> were found in strawberry. Second, up to a 70 -fold increase in mean number of strawberry sap beetles in a no-choice food source experiment indicated that considerable reproduction can occur on blueberry, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. Third, sampling summer-bearing raspberry, peach, blueberry, and cherry in 2004 and 2005 confirmed that beetles were present, often in high densities (0. 1 - 108. 5 strawberry sap beetles/m 2), in commercial fields with fruit or vegetable material on the ground. In summary, the beetles are able to feed, complete development, and overwinter in habitats other than strawberry. An effective integrated pest management program to control strawberry sap beetles will {{need to consider the}} type of habitat surrounding strawberry field...|$|R
50|$|Byturidae, {{also known}} as Fruitworms, is a family of beetles, in the {{suborder}} Polyphaga. The larvae develop in fruits. Byturus unicolor affects species of Rubus and Geum, the larvae of <b>Raspberry</b> <b>beetle</b> raspberry plants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>raspberry</b> <b>beetle</b> (Byturus tomentosus) is {{a species}} of beetles in the fruitworm family Byturidae. It is a major pest that is {{widespread}} in north-central Europe, affecting raspberry, blackberry and loganberry plants. Up to 50% of raspberry harvest may be lost due to the beetle.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the larvae}} are {{hidden in the}} {{raspberry}} fruit during most growing stages, natural predators {{do not have a}} large influence on the beetle population. The <b>raspberry</b> <b>beetle</b> is often controlled by use of derris, a pesticide. Although experts in ecological and organic growing no longer consider derris ecologically sound, Rotenone which is made from derris is still sold in the U.S. Some wild raspberry species are resistant against the beetle larvae.|$|E

40|$|Raspberries for {{the fresh}} {{market is a}} new and very {{profitable}} crop in Norway, and the production in polyethylene tunnels is increasing rapidly. In Norwegian organic production, the experience so far is that using tunnels is a prerequisite if growing for the fresh market. The project focuses on the major bottlenecks in organic tunnel production of raspberries. The project will develop methods for controlling the most damaging pests (<b>raspberry</b> <b>beetle,</b> aphids and mites) and methods for secure and efficient supply of organic nutrients in tunnels. The research on <b>raspberry</b> <b>beetle</b> is a co-operation with Sottish Crop Research Institute. An important task in this project is to extend the growing area for tunnel production further north, by utilizing the long coast of Norway. Main growing area for raspberries in Norway is in the Western part of Norway, (61 º N), where the climate {{has proved to be}} very suitable for raspberry production. Going further north along the coastline the summer gets cooler, but the winter climate is quite similar. In Nordland (65 º N), the raspberries grow well, but the fruits get damaged of rain and wind annually. In Troms, (68 º N), the temperature sum during growing season is too low for outdoor production, but tunnels may render raspberry production possible in Troms. The project will develop methods for early growth start, for protection against frost and for extending the season. Different types and combinations of covers and reflective mulches will be tested for that purpose. The project will also obtain more knowledge about climatic and environmental impact on fruit quality, and includes analyses of potential health beneficial components in berries, which is important for the future marketing of the crop. The methods researched in this project will also have a potential for use in conventional growing, and conventional as well as organic growers are participating. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{effective}} control measures, the strawberry blossom weevil (Anthonomus rubi) (SBW) and the <b>raspberry</b> <b>beetle</b> (Byturus tomentosus) (RB) cause large (10 - > 80 %) losses in yield and quality in organically grown raspberry. Attractive lures for both pests were combined into a single multitrap for the economical management of both of these pests at the same time. This {{is one of the}} first approaches to pest management of non-lepidopteran insect pests of horticultural crops using semiochemicals in the EU, and probably the first to target multiple species from different insect orders. The aim is to develop optimized lures and cost-effective trap designs for mass trapping and to determine the optimum density and spatial and temporal patterns of deployment of the traps for controlling these pests by mass trapping. The combination between an aggregation pheromone that attracts Anthonomus rubi and a raspberry flower volatile that attracts Byturus tomentosus seems to be the best combination...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{effective}} control measures, the strawberry blossom weevil (Anthonomus rubi), the European tarnished plant bug (Lygus rugulipennis) and the <b>raspberry</b> <b>beetle</b> (Byturus tomentosus) cause large (10 - > 80 %) losses in yield and quality in organically grown strawberry (A. rubi and L. rugulipennis) and raspberry (A. rubi and B. tomentosus). In this project the natural semiochemical mechanisms of sexual attraction and host plant finding of these key pests will be exploited to develop effective semiochemical traps for their management through mass trapping.

This {{will be one of}} the first approaches to pest management of non-lepidopteran insect pests of horticultural crops using semiochemicals in the EU, and probably the first to target multiple species from different insect orders. Growers of organic raspberry and strawberry crops currently have few options for effective control of these pests and development of semiochemical-based, non-pesticidal management techniques will make a major contribution to reduction of significant economic losses...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of Defra project OF 0150 REASONS FOR STUDY AND KEY OBJECTIVES. There is a strong demand for organic fruit in the UK but the {{majority}} of this is met by imports. The main constraint on home production is a shortage of growers with sufficient acreage to supply wholesalers and supermarkets. The Organic Fruit Focus Group identified lack of technical information and research as a major barrier to growers considering conversion. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to gather technical information on organic growing techniques from growers, advisors and researchers from both the UK and abroad. Research priorities were also identified. Crops reviewed were apples, pears, strawberries, currants, gooseberries and raspberries. MAIN FINDINGS. •	Research review. The most information was found on organic apple and strawberry production. Much of it was obtained by contacting researchers and advisors and is unrefereed literature e. g. conference proceedings, annual reports, advisory booklets and press articles. Relevant research from conventional systems was also reviewed. •	Advisory literature from abroad. The most useful literature was from FiBL in Switzerland, LBI in the Netherlands and The Danish Agricultural Advisory Centre. •	Research and development programmes abroad are producing relevant information of immediate use to UK growers. •	Drafts of two booklets have been written during the review by combining several sources of information, i. e. 'Organic apples - pest and disease management' and 'Organic strawberry production - a growers guide' (see appendix 2 & 3) •	Apples and pears. Technical problems are numerous but organic apple production can be profitable mainly because there is a market for organic class II fruit. However the conversion period is a major financial and technical barrier. Research priorities were identified, these included a) variety trials, b) scab control, c) studies on weed control/water/nutrients e. g. management of the orchard alleyways and the tree strip to encourage beneficial insects, manipulate nutrient supply and provide orchard access d) pest control e. g. optimising the use of floral strips to prevent pest epidemics and specific control methods for numerous major pests. •	Strawberries. These are considered easier to grow. Suitable systems for weed control have been developed. The main problems and research priorities are a) Botrytis, b) powdery mildew, c) soil borne diseases (Verticillium and Phytophthora), d) encouraging beneficials for pest control e) optimising nutrient supply. •	Raspberries, blackcurrants and gooseberries. Few growers with reasonable acreage were identified making it difficult to draw comprehensive conclusions. However, weed control is a major problem. Research priorities include management of the crop pathways and optimising the use of mulches. An important pest is <b>raspberry</b> <b>beetle.</b> Various other pests could become a problem if acreage is increased. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. Four possible avenues of dissemination were identified. •	Collaboration with FiBL in Switzerland to produce adapted translations of grower booklets •	Production of booklets through the Soil Association's Technical Guides for Organic Food Production •	More immediate dissemination of 'less glossy' leaflets through the Organic Fruit Focus Group •	Seminar/workshop/farm walk collaborative events between HDRA, Soil Association, Elm Farm Research Centre, Organic Fruit Focus Group and East Malling Research Association. Two events are already planned. ISSUES RELATED TO POLICY, ORGANIC STANDARDS AND PESTICIDE REGISTRATION a) The three year conversion period, in both top fruit and cane and bush fruit, is a major financial barrier. b) The unpredictable nature of fruit production may mean that financial support after conversion could be required to increase grower confidence. c) Diversification of business enterprise for top fruit could be encouraged. d) Long term and achievable standards of fruit quality should be agreed between supermarkets and growers. e) Products which could be important for organic fruit production were identified for consideration by PSD and/or UKROFS. f) Strategies for the propagation of organic plants for all fruit crops need to be developed; this could be done within a European context for some crops where there are no licensed propagators in the UK. g) Some tentative evidence suggests that the measures used to encourage beneficial fauna for pest control in organic orchards and the absence of soil sterilants in organic soft fruit production are resulting in species diversification; this needs to be explored further...|$|E
