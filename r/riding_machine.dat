50|$|Kirby is {{the only}} playable {{character}} available {{from the start of}} the game, and the only one who can <b>ride</b> different <b>machines</b> and suck up enemies to copy their abilities. Multiple players are represented by different colors of Kirby. Meta Knight, Kirby's rival, is an unlockable character. He doesn't <b>ride</b> <b>machines,</b> but instead uses his wings to float above the ground. He controls like a combination of Wing Kirby and Sword Kirby, as he uses sword attacks automatically when he approaches enemies or other players. Because he has high speed and acceleration in the game, he cannot charge. King Dedede is also unlockable. Controlling him is almost exactly like using the Wheelie Bike, except he can attack automatically with his hammer, similar to Meta Knight's attack.|$|R

50|$|Alessandro Anzani began {{building}} motorcycle engines in France around 1905. Unusually, his motors were air- rather than water-cooled, making them light. His first designs were two-cylinder V-engines, and he <b>rode</b> <b>machines</b> powered by them to records and race success in 1905 and 1906. In {{the same period}} he had developed a three-cylinder version, {{more powerful than the}} twins. As the image shows, the engine fitted neatly into the cycle frame. Engines with cylinders arranged radially but only in the upper half-circle were termed fan type, or semi-radials; by about 1910 other manufacturers were building e.g. five-cylinder fan engines, most notably R.E.P. Three-cylinder fans were alternatively known as W or W-3 engines. The appeal of the fan configuration was that, because all the cylinder were above the horizontal there was little danger of the plugs being fouled by the lubricating oil. The disadvantage, particularly for an aircraft engine, was the extra weight required to counterbalance the pistons.|$|R
5000|$|City Trial is {{a larger}} mode where players must {{navigate}} a city, along with several more sections such as a forest, cave, and volcano, while grabbing Air <b>Ride</b> <b>machine</b> upgrade items, such as boosts, top speeds, charges, offense, defense, and more. Various Air Ride vehicles are randomly scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to switch vehicles {{at any time in}} the game. Players can even collect rare machine pieces to fuse together into [...] "Legendary Machines". This mode also features random events such as falling meteors, UFOs, Dyna Blade, rail station fires, bouncing items, fake power-ups, a strange pillar, a thief, all boxes containing the same items, dense fog, and more. When time expires, players face off in a small competition that tests how well your machine ended up, which can vary between a drag race, a brawl, a contest to destroy the most enemies, a gliding game, and even a lap on one of the Air Ride courses.|$|R
5000|$|The riding {{position}} {{places the}} feet forward and the hands are up relatively high, {{so that the}} spine is erect or leaning back slightly. At low to moderate speeds, cruisers are more comfortable than other styles, but riding for long periods at freeway speeds can lead to fatigue from pulling back on the handlebars to resist {{the force of the}} wind against the rider's chest. Cruisers have limited cornering ability {{due to a lack of}} ground clearance.Choppers are a type of cruiser, so called because they are a [...] "chopped", or cut-down, version of a production cruiser.

The album itself was also a success, being certified gold, and was described by Rolling Stone magazine as being [...] "as good as disco gets." [...] In his history of disco, Shapiro described [...] "You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)" [...] as Sylvester's [...] "greatest record", [...] "the cornerstone of gay disco", and [...] "an epochal record in disco history". Shapiro noted that Sylvester's work brought together elements from both of the main strands of disco; the [...] "gospel/R tradition" [...] and the [...] "mechanical, piston-pumping beats" [...] tradition, but that in doing so he went [...] "way beyond either". Shapiro expressed the view that [...] "Sylvester propelled his falsetto far above his natural range into the ether and <b>rode</b> <b>machine</b> rhythms that raced toward escape velocity, creating a new sonic lexicon powerful, camp, and otherworldly enough to articulate the exquisite bliss of disco's dance floor utopia".|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of horseback <b>riding</b> {{simulation}} <b>machine</b> training on trunk balance and gait of patients with chronic stroke. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 20 patients hospitalized for treatment after being diagnosed with stroke. Horseback riding simulation training was pro-vided for 30 minutes, 5 times a week, for 6 weeks. Trunk balance was assessed using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) and a balance measuring device (Biorescue, RM ingenierie, France), and gait ability was measured using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) and a gait analyzer (GAITRite, CIR system Inc., USA). [Results] There were significant changes in movement area, distance and velocity of body sway as measured by the TIS and the balance measuring device, and in gait velocity, cadence, stride length and double limb support as measured by the FGA and gait analyzer. [Conclusion] Horseback riding simulation training improved the trunk balance and gait of chronic stroke patients. This present study provides preliminary objective data for future research, and useful clinical infor-mation for physical therapists using horseback <b>riding</b> simulation <b>machines</b> as a treatment modality for patients with chronic stroke...|$|R
