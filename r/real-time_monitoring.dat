40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{undertaken}} in Newfoundland and Labrador {{to determine whether}} provision of a real-time feedback device is sufficient to provide residential customers with the information needed to reduce their electricity consumption. A panel based econometric methodology, which controlled for such factors as weather, appliance and housing stock, and demographic determinants influencing electricity consumption, was used to quantify the impacts of the realtime monitor in reducing energy (kWh) use. The study also provided some important insights about socio-economic factors that influence conservation responsiveness, a feature that may assist in developing targeted energy efficiency programs. For example, the electric water heating households showed a higher savings than non-electric water heating households. While positive attitudes toward conservation significantly increase the reduction in electricity when using the <b>real-time</b> <b>monitor,</b> seniors, in their employment of the <b>real-time</b> <b>monitor,</b> do not conserve as much. Overall, the aggregate reduction in electricity consumption (kWh) across {{the study sample was}} 18. 1 %.

25|$|Without {{commenting on}} the {{morality}} of the bill, the Canadian Network Operators Consortium noted that smaller, independent ISPs would likely be unable to afford expensive new equipment to allow authorities <b>real-time</b> <b>monitoring</b> of their customers and may have to discontinue business.

25|$|TNO, a Dutch RD& Institute, has {{developed}} the successful ROBIN (Radar Observation of Bird Intensity) for the Royal Netherlands Airforce. ROBIN is a near <b>real-time</b> <b>monitoring</b> system for flight movements of birds. ROBIN identifies flocks of birds within the signals of large radar systems. This information {{is used to}} give Air Force pilots warning during landing and take-off. Years of observation of bird migration with ROBIN have also provided a better insight into bird migration behaviour, which has had an influence on averting collisions with birds, and therefore on flight safety. Since {{the implementation of the}} ROBIN system at the Royal Netherlands Airforce the number of collisions between birds and aircraft in the vicinity of military airbases has decreased by more than 50%.|$|E
500|$|Descent rate is {{generally}} allowed for in decompression planning by assuming a maximum descent rate {{specified in the}} instructions {{for the use of}} the tables, but it is not critical. [...] Descent slower than the nominal rate reduces useful bottom time, but has no other adverse effect. Descent faster than the specified maximum will expose the diver to greater ingassing rate earlier in the dive, and the bottom time must be reduced accordingly. In the case of <b>real-time</b> <b>monitoring</b> by dive computer, descent rate is not specified, as the consequences are automatically accounted for by the programmed algorithm.|$|E

Since 1993, the NOAA has maintained a <b>real-time</b> <b>monitoring</b> system that alerts the organization whenever an event occurs. The hydrophones are able to detect even very small earthquakes (~ magnitude 1.8) by listening for the acoustic waves generated by T-waves. These waves can propagate over large distances with minimal loss in power, making them an ideal way to record otherwise unnoticeable submarine earthquakes; {{over the course of}} the eruption, only 3 earthquakes were strong enough to register on land-based systems. However, they cannot interpret earthquake depth or what caused them.|$|E

If the IMECA values reach a critical level, an environmental contingency is declared whereby Hoy No Circula is extended to two days per week, industrial activities are reduced, certain gas power plants shut down, and elementary school entry hours are changed.

2500|$|A key {{safety feature}} of the aircraft's main gear box (MGB) is an {{emergency}} oil spraying sub-system present in the lubrication system; this is designed to exceed the JAR 29 Standard's requirements of a 30-minute running time {{in the event of}} the loss of MGB oil pressure, and has demonstrated up to 50-minute running time. The engine also incorporates a [...] "blade shedding" [...] system to ensure engine integrity during an overspeed instance. Energy absorbent self-sealing fuel tanks are contained in the aircraft's sponsons, along with other equipment such as downward-facing illumination and navigation lighting fixtures. The transmission can accommodate more power than the maximum output of the engines; however two aircraft were lost in 2012 due to the cracking of the bevel gear shaft, a gearbox component. In response, the design of the transmission was modified in 2013, and the onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) was upgraded to provide <b>real-time</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the bevel gear shaft against the threat of crack formation.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet. In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded <b>real-time</b> <b>monitoring</b> by Federal law enforcement agencies. Packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network. Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called [...] "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete [...] "message" [...] again. Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, {{in order to examine}} their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool. That is it gathers [...] "messages" [...] but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) traffic.|$|E
