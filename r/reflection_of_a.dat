5|$|Hexagonal and zincblende polymorphs have no {{inversion}} symmetry (<b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crystal {{relative to}} any given point does not {{transform it into}} itself). This and other lattice symmetry properties result in piezoelectricity of the hexagonal and zincblende ZnO, and pyroelectricity of hexagonal ZnO.|$|E
5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus {{for the application of}} the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E
5|$|Another Marcus {{contribution}} to the arts was his own work {{in the area of}} photography. Over the course of his adult life, Marcus took thousands of photographs, both of famous and anonymous subjects, which he turned over to granddaughter Allison V. Smith, a professional photographer, upon moving out of his Nonesuch Road home into a smaller residence in the late 1990s. Two years after his death, Smith began making digital scans of the photos and posting them to the sharing site Flickr; despite the fact that their authorship was not identified, within a year the photographs had drawn 10,000 views. For the 100th anniversary of Neiman Marcus, Smith and her mother, Jerrie Marcus Smith, decided to assemble a representative selection of the nearly 5,000 images into a book; titled <b>Reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Man, the 192-page book was published by Cairn Press in October, 2007, and accompanied by an exhibit at the Dallas Museum of Art.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E

5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
5|$|The ideal he {{expressed}} in a work of the period, Equilibru între antithesi ("A Balance between Antitheses") was moderate progressivism, with the preservation of social peace. In Tudor Vianu's view, partly based on earlier assessments by other critics, Equilibru, with its stress on making political needs coincide with social ones through the means of counterweights, evidenced strong influences from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's thought, as well as vaguer ones from that of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Nonetheless, his system parted with Hegelianism in that, instead of seeking {{a balance between the}} Geist and existence, it considered the three states of human progress (Thesis, antithesis, synthesis) the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mystical number favored throughout history.|$|E
5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a {{reflection}} in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|E

25|$|Childbirth-spirits are ghosts {{which are}} in some way related to birth or pregnancy. A {{significant}} number of them are the malignant spirits of stillborn children, while others prey on infants. All are a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> formerly high infant mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Scholz regards this preoccupation as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{belief in}} a divine will and control of history. Many of the worse omens also {{parallel}} growing dissatisfaction with Louis the Pious, which immediately {{after the end of}} the annals spilled into civil war between him and his sons. Divine intervention through the relics of saints play an important role as well, with mention of Hilduin’s translation of the relics of St. Sebastian to the Abbey of St. Medard, and Einhard’s transport of the relics of SS. Marcellinus and Peter into Francia.|$|E
25|$|Like his {{predecessor}} Pius XII, Paul VI put {{much emphasis on}} the dialogue with all {{nations of the world}} through establishing diplomatic relations. The number of foreign embassies accredited to the Vatican doubled during his pontificate. This was a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new understanding between Church and State, which had been formulated first by Pius XI and Pius XII but decreed by Vatican II. The pastoral constitution Gaudium et spes stated that the Catholic Church is not bound to any form of government and willing to cooperate with all forms. The Church maintained its right to select bishops on its own without any interference by the State.|$|E

25|$|In the 1580s, Pilon {{began work}} on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II at the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis. Among these, the fragmentary Resurrection, now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel. This work owes a clear debt to Michelangelo, who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the Medici chapels in Florence. Pilon openly depicted extreme emotion in his work, sometimes {{to the point of}} the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> society torn by the conflict of the French wars of religion.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear {{frequently in the}} film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.|$|E
25|$|Hip hop {{music has}} spawned dozens of subgenres which {{incorporate}} hip hop music production approaches, such as sampling, creating beats, or rapping. The diversification process {{stems from the}} appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups. There are many varying social influences that affect hip hop's message in different nations. It is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political and/or social injustices. In South Africa the largest form of hip hop is called Kwaito, which has had a growth similar to American hip hop. Kwaito is a direct <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> post apartheid South Africa and is a voice for the voiceless; a term that U.S. hip hop is often referred to. Kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle, encompassing many aspects of life, including language and fashion.|$|E

25|$|The series {{begins with}} the mirror {{appearing}} in the attic of {{a house in the}} country and Daniel traveling to meet his father, and new step-siblings for the first time. When he arrives at the house, he is not made to feel very welcome. His stepsister Mandy is very upset and runs off to the attic. Daniel tries to resolve the upset and goes after her. When he enters the attic he notices the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young girl in the mirror. Daniel tries to investigate but Mandy gets in his way and they stumble through the mirror into 1867. They eventually get back, but later Lily and Mandy go through the mirror. While they are in 1867, the mirror is knocked out of alignment and they cannot travel back to their own time. Trapped in 1867 they spend the night in the de Lutrelle's barn. They finally get back home when the mirror is put back into alignment.|$|E
