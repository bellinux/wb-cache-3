50|$|In 1953 {{a project}} for the {{engineering}} company and bolt manufacturer GKN took the North Bar Tool Company in a new product direction. GKN had designed a bolt called 'Prolong' that had a splined section above the nut. By gripping the splined section of the bolt and counter rotating the nut, the fastener could be tightened {{without the need for}} any external <b>reaction</b> <b>device.</b> In a further development, a shear groove was placed below the spline, so designed that the bolt would fail at the groove when the pre-determined torque had been achieved. This bolting method was known as 'Torshear'. GKN required an air driven tool capable of high torque output to sell with their 'Prolong' bolts. Probably Britain's best known gearbox designer of the time was Dr. Henry Edward Merritt and so Dr. Merritt was contracted to design a suitable range of air driven gearboxes for the Torshear application.|$|E

The reflectance of the black silicon is drastically suppressed over a broad spectral range due to the unique geometry, which is effective for the enhancement of absorption.|$|E

The trouble of lower {{efficiency}} on transfer restricted its rapid development and further application. A large number of experimental studies showed that its efficiency could be improved by pulsed jet, and pulsed jet generated in the device had higher impact on object. Based on massive literatures, generation ways of pulsed jet and study marches of excited pulsed jet were introduced briefly. At the same time, the progress in study and application of self-excited pulsed oscillation jet were focused on. Furthermore, in view of the domestic present situation of reservoir dredging, the next researches of jet dredging combination with artificial density-flow were prospected Foreword Because of jet’s enormous hitting energy, operations of dissection and crush can be accomplished easily.

40|$|Reactions on {{the surface}} of a variety of {{transition}} metal clusters have been studied in the gas phase at near room temperature using a newly developed fast-flow <b>reaction</b> <b>device.</b> Initial examples of the use of this device are provided by survey studies of the reactivity of iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and niobium clusters in contact with low concentrations of D 2, N 2 and CO. Dissociative chemisorption of D 2 is found to occur with dramatic sensitivity to cluster size in the cases of iron, cobalt, and niobium clusters, the detailed pattern of reactivity differing markedly for each metal. The corresponding reaction is also observed with nickel clusters, but here the reactivity shows only a slow, steady increase with cluster size. Copper clusters are found to be completely unreactive to H 2 chemisorption under these conditions. Molecular nitrogen is found to chemisorb readily to clusters of cobalt and niobium, with a reactivity pattern very similar to that observed with D 2. Iron clusters are found to show slight reactivity with N 2; only a small amount of chemisorption is observed on the most reactive clusters at high N 2 concentration, but the pattern of this reactivity with cluster size is consistent with that observed in D 2 chemisorption. In contrast to these highly structured reactivity patterns of D 2 and N 2, carbon monoxide is found to show only a slow, monotonic increase in reactivity with cluster size. It is suggested that these dramatic reactivity patterns for chemisorption on metal clusters provide stringent tests for future theories as to the nature of chemisorption on metal surfaces at a detailed, molecular level...|$|E

Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see torque); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft {{from one place to another}} (see translational force). Reaction wheels work around a nominal zero rotation speed. However, external torques on the spacecraft may require a gradual buildup of {{reaction wheel}} rotation speed to maintain the spacecraft in a fixed orientation.|$|R

40|$|From the archetypical {{example of}} Taylor-Aris {{dispersion}} to chaotic advection in duct flows, transverse mixing is wellknown to suppress both longitudinal dispersion and residence time distribution (RTD) variance in mean translational flows. In this paper {{we consider the}} connection between these transport modes which are quantified in terms of fundamental solutions of the advection-diffusion operator, and demonstrate how asymptotic and pre-asymptotic RTD evolution is governed by the transverse mixing eigenmodes in both axially-constant and axially-periodic duct flows. This formalism is validated via application to a axially-periodic chaotic mixing flow, the Rotated Arc Mixing (RAM) flow, and predictions of RTD evolution based on the transverse mixing eigenmodes agree very well with experimental observations.
