Materials used for calibration can include phase transition standards for an independent check on the calibration function.

However, {{in all of these}} studies, the index group, namely the tolerant recipients, were not receiving immunosuppressive (IS) treatment unlike the rest of the comparator groups. We aimed to assess the confounding effect of these regimens and develop a novel IS-independent signature of tolerance. Analyzing gene-expression in three independent kidney transplant patient cohorts (232 -recipients + 14 -tolerants), we have established that the expression of the previously reported signature was biased by IS regimens, which also influenced transitional B-cells. We have defined and validated a new gene-expression signature that was independent of drug effects and also differentiated tolerant patients from healthy controls (Cross-validated-AUC= 0. 81). In a prospective cohort we have demonstrated that the new signature remained stable before and after steroid withdrawal. Concisely, we report on a validated and highly accurate gene-expression signature that could be used reliably to identify patients suitable for IS reduction (~ 12 % stable patients), irrespective of the IS drugs they are receiving. Only a similar approach will make the conduct of pilot clinical trials for IS-minimization safe, and hence allow critical improvements in kidney post-transplant management...|$|R

50|$|Poisson's {{ratio is}} a measure of the Poisson effect, the {{phenomenon}} in which a material tends to expand in directions perpendicular to the direction of compression. Conversely, if the material is stretched rather than compressed, it usually tends to contract in the directions transverse to the direction of stretching. It is a common observation when a rubber band is stretched, it becomes noticeably thinner. Again, the Poisson ratio will be the ratio of relative contraction to <b>relative</b> <b>expansion</b> and will have the same value as above.

40|$|Two {{greenhouse}} {{trials were}} carried out to evaluate the response pattern of morphological traits of bambara groundnut to short periods of water stress imposed at different developmental stages and also their recuperative ability after rewatering. The treatments consisted of watering plants to 100 % Plant Available Water (PAW), withholding water to 30 % PAW at vegetative, flowering and pod filling growth stages and rewatering the plants after 21 days of each stress treatment. Water stress reduced the <b>relative</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> rate, leaf number, plant height and shoot: root ration depending {{on the stage of}} development when water stress occurred. When plants were rewatered after each stress treatment, the <b>relative</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> rate of plants stressed at pod filling and flowering stages failed to recover from water stress. Seed yield in all stressed plants was reduced by water stress due to reductions in pods per plant, seeds per pod and seed weight. The highest yield amongst the stressed plants was obtained in plants stressed during the vegetative stage, followed by the flowering and lastly the pod filling stage. Bambara groundnuts reduced growth therefore reducing transpirational area thus reducing water loss under water stress. The results also showed that bambara groundnuts have the ability to recover from water stress after rainfall or irrigation and is therefore capable of producing some yield under water limited conditions...|$|R

An expression cassette encoding human IL- 15 (hIL- 15) has been transferred by hydrodynamic injection into the liver of mice, resulting in transient expression of the cytokine that is detectable during the first 48 h. hIL- 15 hydrodynamic gene transfer resulted in an expansion of NK cells and IKDCs. <b>Relative</b> <b>expansions</b> of IKDCs were more dramatic in the IL- 15 gene-transferred hepatic tissue than in the spleen.

50|$|After {{the middle}} of the 17th century, a {{moderate}} rise of Lithuanian-speaking culture took place. Politically it was the time of turmoils and wars. Despite of it towns were growing in Lithuania and various new realities came into life. The number of urban people increased and newcomers (in much cases Lithuanian-speaking) had significant input to it. The degree of communication between state and town officials and ordinary inhabitants increasedas well. This development caused necessary changes in language policy. In non-orthodox regions of G.D.L. the middle and lower strata of urban people used the Lithuanian language. And only some regions in the South of G.D.L. as Grodna, Augustów regions and Vilnius town (not region) were exceptions to it, having however Lithuanian-speaking population parts, mostly in lower strata. This situation caused it to be necessary for the highest stratum of nobles to know the Lithuanian language too.

50|$|Gladman et al. {{found that}} as θ {{approaches}} 0°, the curvature approximates the classical Timoshenko equation and performs similarly to a bimetallic strip. But as θ approaches 90°, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control {{the effects of}} anisotropy and break lines of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more.David Correa et al. is working with wood composite materials that change shape based on their printed grain direction and anisotropic swelling when water is absorbed. This work is 3D printed and studied on the macro scale rather than micro scale, with layer heights at fractions of millimeters rather than microns. The filament used in this research is a wood composite which is 60% co-polyester and 40% cellulose. The co-polyester binds the cellulose together while the cellulose provides the hygroscopic properties to the composite. Two methods {{have been developed for}} this kind of printing. The first method uses only the wood composite material. Designed deformation shape is printed by controlling the grain pattern, grain orientation, print layer thickness, and print layer interaction. In this method, hygroscopic bending occurs perpendicular to the grain direction. The second method uses both the wood composite as well as standard 3D printing plastics. This is an extension of the first method that introduces a separate layer of non-hygroscopic material that will not swell when exposed to water. This idea builds off of previous research of thermal bimetal  properties based on their <b>relative</b> <b>expansion.</b> Hygroscopic bending occurs only within the wood composite layers when prints of this method are exposed to water. Therefore, deformation shape is a product of both the patterning of material layers as well as the grain of the wood composite layers, offering quicker and more severe deformation than wood composite construction alone. Both methods allow their materials to deform when subject to moisture, as well as regain their shape. The quickest method observed for shape change is by fully submerging prints in warm water.|$|E

40|$|According to Stephen Jay Gould, “we have {{a strong}} {{preference}} for seeing trends as entities moving somewhere. ” However, trends may instead be the product of <b>relative</b> <b>expansions</b> and contractions of different subpopulations constituting the system. Variation in attributes of coronary heart disease cases during the decline in coronary heart disease mortality suggests {{a change in the}} primary source-subpopulation of cases over time. It is proposed that an early 20 th-century expansion of a coronary heart disease–prone subpopulation, characterized by high serum-cholesterol phenotype and high case-fatality—which contributed to most of the coronary heart disease cases and deaths during the 1960 s—may have been a late result of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The same unusual immune response to infection that in 1918 killed preferentially men, whites, and those born from 1880 to 1900 (20 – 40 years old) may have “primed” survivors of those birth cohorts to late coronary heart disease mortality. Ecologic evidence in favor of a birth cohort and geographic association between both epidemics is presented. Cross-reactive auto-immune response upon reinfection could explain the excess coronary heart disease deaths reported during influenza epidemics from the late 1920 s onward. Mimicry between the viral hemagglutinin and the apolipoprotein B or the low-density lipoprotein receptor could be the link between infection and hypercholesterolemia. The extinction of those birth cohorts would result in a relative increase in cases coming from a 2 nd subpopulation, which was characterized by insulin resistance and chronic expression of low-grade inflammation markers and was comparatively less vulnerable to die acutely from coronary heart disease...|$|R

As a first step, the solubility curve of hydrogen in Zircloy- 4 was determined by two techniques: differential scanning calorimetry and differential dilatometry. The comparison with classical literature curves showed a good agreement with them, although the calorimetric technique {{proved to be more}} accurate for these determinations. Dilatometry was able to detect the end of hydride dissolution from concentrations around 60 wppm-H up to 650 wppm-H, where the eutectoid reaction: α + δ→α + β takes place (at 550 oC). We assume that this ability is a good indicator of the aptitude of the technique to measure dimensional changes in the given hydrogen concentration range.
