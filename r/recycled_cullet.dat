40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{technological}} development and continuously increasing amount of waste, people aim their emphasis at the enviromental protection and using of secondary raw materials. Glass {{has a high}} potential as a secondary raw material, because it is practically 100 % recyclable. One way {{how to use the}} glass cullet is a production of foam glass. This Bachelor‘s thesis mainly deals with the possibilities of using <b>recycled</b> <b>cullet</b> and forecasting of alternative raw materials that can be used as foaming agents in the manufacture of foam glass...|$|E
30|$|Decorative {{variation}} of chemically similar glass, as {{observed in the}} Jebel Khalid material, could also {{be explained by the}} production in one place of vessel blanks that were distributed to workshops where decoration was cut later. Alternatively, raw glass is known to have been distributed to workshops that both formed and decorated vessels. Both production models could have operated simultaneously alongside a third option where <b>recycled</b> <b>cullet</b> was collected at any number of locations and reworked into new vessels in a one-stop process. There are of course other possible variations on these production models, where different stages of the production of decorated vessels could have occurred in one or more locations.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, soda-lime-silica amber glasses with {{coloured}} (green and amber) cullet content up to 65 % were produced. The glasses were characterised optically, mechanically and chemically. The maximum percentages of coloured cullet {{used in the}} amber glass production were determined so that the final colour would fall within the acceptable colour limits of the amber area. The content of tire reducing components, such as carbon, in the batch were modified correspondingly. The resulting colours of the samples were measured by spectroscopy and expressed their dominant wavelength, purity and brightness. The redox of all the batches was calculated according to Simpson & Myers((1)) factors. The redox contribution of <b>recycled</b> <b>cullet</b> was estimated through the apparent redox number which {{is determined by the}} wavelength of the sample, and a reference curve referred to samples with different redox numbers due to different carbon content. The increase in the percentage of cullet and carbon in the main formula resulted in a slight decrease in the microhardness of the samples and a decrease in their chemical durability, whereas the density was not influenced by these factors...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>recycled</b> glass (RG) <b>cullet</b> on fresh and {{hardened}} properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) were investigated. RG {{was used to}} replace river sand (in proportions of 10 %, 20 % and 30 %), and 10 mm granite (5 %, 10 % and 15 %) in making the SCC concrete mixes. Fly ash {{was used in the}} concrete mixes to suppress the potential alkali-silica reaction. The experimental results showed that the slump flow, blocking ratio, air content of the RG-SCC mixes increased with increasing recycled glass content. The compressive strength, tensile splitting strength and static modulus of elasticity of the RG-SCC mixes were decreased with an increase in recycled glass aggregate content. Moreover, the resistance to chloride ion penetration increased and the drying shrinkage of the RG-SCC mixes decreased when the recycled glass content increased.

40|$|This work aims {{to develop}} a {{technology}} with an instant demoulding ability for making precast architectural tiles with an aesthetically pleasing appearance. To achieve this, double-layer composite consisting of a wet-mixed self-compacting glass mortar as the surface-layer and a dry-mixed mortar as the base-layer was designed. The performance of the surface-layer prepared with <b>recycled</b> glass <b>cullet</b> with different particle sizes, {{and the effects of}} aggregate types and contents on the base-layer mortar were investigated. The results suggest that the non-porous nature and smooth surface of the glass cullet decreased the water absorption and reduced the strength of the mortars. The flexural and pull-out strength results demonstrated that all the architectural tiles produced exhibited good interfacial adhesion between the two layers and complied with the standard requirements for "Terrazzo tiles" for internal and external applications.

40|$|Issue: Container {{manufacturing}} is {{the primary}} market for recycled glass cullet in the United States. Although all container manufacturers use some <b>recycled</b> <b>cullet</b> in glass batches, {{there is a lack}} of uniform specifications for both recycled glass and furnace-ready cullet. This can represent a significant market barrier to processors of recycled glass seeking to access the primary market. Often processors design systems to meet the needs of specific manufacturers. This can leave processors vulnerable to changes in the consumption patterns of a single manufacturer. Industry-wide quality requirements are needed to ensure that suppliers have equal access to container manufacturing markets. Further, specifications written at the corporate level are subject to interpretation at the plant level. Plant engineers may have expectations of cullet that are more or less stringent than the written specifications. As a result, the quality assurance procedures undertaken by those managers may tend to be more subjective than specifications suggest. Best Practice: The next page contains a specification derived from existing specifications and interviews with processors and users. It may serve to educate those unfamiliar with cullet specifications and as a starting point for development of uniform specifications. Implementation:Incipient trading in recycled glass on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) may help to open an industry-wide discussion for the establishment of uniform specifications. Whether or not CBOT trading succeeds, that discussion should continue within the glass manufacturing industry. Benefits: The existence of well-defined industry specifications can potentially be a benefit to both processors and users of furnace-ready cullet. Processors can design their systems knowing that they are not subject to the whims of a single buyer. Buyers can purchase from multiple sources with confidence that processors understand industry quality standards...|$|E
30|$|The {{possibility}} of recycling mixed colour waste glass {{as it is}} for manufacturing decorative architectural mortars, has been investigated. In mortars, the 0 – 33 – 66 – 100 % of calcareous gravel volume has been replaced with <b>recycled</b> glass <b>cullets,</b> with no other inorganic addition. To mitigate the possible alkali–silica reaction, mixes with a hydrophobic admixture were also compared. The obtained results show that the replacement of calcareous gravel with glass cullets of similar grain size distribution permits to reduce the dosage of the superplasticizer admixture to obtain the same workability of fresh mortar; it does not affect significantly the mechanical performances, the water vapour permeability and the capillary water absorption but it reduces significantly the drying shrinkage deformation. The used recycled glass is classified as no reactive in terms of alkali–silica reaction neither in water nor in NaOH solution following the parameters of the current normative, {{even in the absence of}} the hydrophobic admixture. The hydrophobic admixture further delays the expansion trigger but not the speed of its propagation.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} much of the {{published}} literature on the use of glass in concrete has been on its use as a cement replacement material. Recent studies have shown that recycled glass can be used as an aggregate without compromising concrete strength. However little research has been carried out on the thermal properties of such concretes. The temperature of <b>recycled</b> glass <b>cullet</b> after production using an implosion technique remained high for the next 24 h. Thus, an experimental investigation was undertaken in order to study whether concrete made with such material had significantly different thermal properties in comparison to concrete made with natural aggregates. The process of cement hydration resulted in much higher temperatures being produced in concrete made with glass cullet. Further testing revealed that exposure of concrete to both high (60 °C) and low (− 20 °C) temperatures produced, greater temperature stability. These findings suggest that concrete made with recycled glass could have two important applications, namely, cold temperature concreting and in buildings to maintain greater temperature stability...|$|R
40|$|Glass is {{an ideal}} {{material}} for recycling {{and in some cases}} can be used repeatedly without any deterioration in its physical properties. In recent years new legislative and fiscal drivers have contributed to increasing the desirability of recycling glass. This has been the case with the glass manufacturing industry, encouraging them to use more <b>recycled</b> glass <b>cullet</b> in place of virgin raw materials. However as with all markets, pressure from legislation can only be effective if the recycled bottle glass supplier can ensure that using recycled materials meet their customers’ quality requirement. Furthermore, the type of glass available for recycling is not the type most demanded by the end market. To meet demands for higher quality cullet, new glass bottle collection system is been developed and introduced to the glassmaking industry that enables processors to improve cullet quality and make production more efficient. The development of new collection system and alternative markets for recycled glass has further contributed to the development of new technologies. Processing technologies have needed {{to keep pace with the}} variety of specifications introduced by these new end markets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the effectiveness of incorporating air cleaning agents such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2) into the technique of producing concrete paving blocks, using local waste materials to remove nitrous oxide (NO). Factors which would affect the performance of the blocks were studied including the porosity of blocks, the type of waste materials used within the mix design, the types and percentage of TiO 2 added within the mix design. The results show that the photodegradation of NO is related to the porosity of the blocks. When the porosity of the block was increased so was the NO removal ability. Hence the choice, size and content of aggregate material used in the mix design are important. In addition, crushed <b>recycled</b> glass <b>cullet</b> was used to place part of the aggregates in the blocks and was found to benefit the NO removal ability due to its light transmitting characteristic. Three types of TiO 2 were tested in this study and their influence on NO removal was quantified. Based on the experimental results, an optimum mix design was selected which incorporates recycled glass, sand, cement and TiO 2. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{the use of}} photocatalysts with {{cementitious}} {{materials is}} an important development {{in the field of}} photocatalytic air pollution mitigation. This paper presents the results of a systematic study on assessing the effectiveness of pollutant degradation by concrete surface layers that incorporate a photocatalytic material - Titanium Dioxide. The photocatalytic activity of the concrete samples was determined by photocatalytic oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) in the laboratory. <b>Recycled</b> glass <b>cullets,</b> derived from crushed waste beverage bottles, were used to replace sand in preparing the concrete surface layers. Factors, which may affect the pollutant removal performance of the concrete layers including glass color, aggregate size and curing age, were investigated. The results show a significant enhancement of the photocatalytic activity due to the use of glass cullets as aggregates in the concrete layers. The samples fabricated with clear glass cullets exhibited threefold NO removal efficiency compared to the samples fabricated with river sand. The light transmittance property of glass was postulated to account for the efficiency improvement, which was confirmed by a separate simulation study. But the influence of the size of glass cullets was not evident. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of concrete surface layers decreased with curing age, showing a loss of 20 % photocatalytic activity after 56 -day curing.

40|$|Issue: Ceramic {{contaminants}} in <b>recycled</b> glass <b>cullet</b> {{can result in}} inclusions in finished glass products. Ceramic inclusions can lead to eventual fracturing or breakage of the glass container, especially if the container is filled with a pressurized liquid like soda or beer. Providing a cullet supply free of ceramic contaminants is generally {{the responsibility of the}} materials recovery facility (MRF). Many MRFs physically remove ceramic contaminants from the cullet, either manually or with automated systems. An alternative to complete ceramic removal is to reduce the entire cullet supply to No. 12 mesh or smaller. Called “fine-sizing”, this size reduction enables most ceramics to melt in the furnace. This Best Practice describes some prevalent technologies for fine-sizing cullet. Best Practice: This best practice considers two approaches to fine-sizing glass cullet: vertical shaft grinding and flexible impact pulverizing. Moisture control is also discussed. For more information on ceramic removal and moisture considerations, refer to the Best Practices Removal of Ceramics from Recycled Glass and Moisture Considerations in Processing and Distribution of Glass Cullet. Vertical Shaft Impact Grinders A vertical shaft grinder (VSG) uses a multiport, cullet lined rotor to finesize cullet through autogenic particle-to-particle attrition. A steady stream of cullet is fed into the top of a VSG system and accelerated through a turning rotor. The accelerated cullet stream is discharged into...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Glass {{container}} {{manufacturers are}} using {{increasing amounts of}} <b>recycled</b> glass <b>cullet.</b> While reducing the demand for natural resources, the use of cullet is also cost-effective from a manufacturing standpoint. Cullet melts at a lower temperature than raw materials, reducing the demand for energy and lowering production costs. Further energy savings {{can be achieved by}} using furnace exhaust gases to preheat the cullet. One method of preheating involves direct transmission of furnace exhaust through a cullet medium. Another approach involves passing the cullet through a vertical funnel that is heated externally by the furnace exhaust. Preheating cullet also helps to promote a longer furnace life. This best practice explains the benefits of using preheated cullet in the manufacturing of glass containers. Preheater designs using direct and indirect heat transmission are also discussed. Best Practice: Typical glass container manufacturing furnaces are capable of producing from 100 to 400 tons of glass per day. Because recycled glass melts at lower temperatures than raw batch materials, it requires less furnace energy during production. Studies show that every 10 % increase in the amount of cullet used reduces melting energy by about 2 %. Reducing the energy input reduces fuel consumption, and ultimately helps reduce the level of nitrogen emissions produced by the furnace. Preheating cullet with the furnace exhaust gas allows further reduction in the melting energy. The exac...|$|R

5000|$|The {{glass beads}} of Sub-Saharan Africa {{that were not}} melted from {{pre-existing}} glass material were instead formed by grinding glass into a fine powder to be worked further. Sources for such glass included scraps from broken glass bottles, <b>cullets</b> (<b>recycled</b> glass) or pre-existing glass beads which were no longer wanted. The grinding process generally caused colouring to be lost; therefore, various pigments were often added at this stage (see the colouring section below). After the desired colour was achieved, powdered glass was either worked in its dry form or was wetted with water or saliva to create a paste. This paste was next formed by hand into various bead shapes. Powder Glass Beads were then heated, allowed to cool and finally, polished.8 Garden Roller beads, such as the Bodom beads of Ghana.8 were the earliest form of powder glass beads found, made by threading glass in a mould with a mandrel. This process was extremely labour-intensive and expensive as the mould used was unable to be reused.8 More common were the Kiffa beads, typically associated with Mauritania. These beads were produced from the wet-form of powder glass production, and have been found since the 8th century.

40|$|In {{line with}} the growing concern about the {{environmental}} impact of materials in the building sector, Knauf Insulation, a glass wool producer, is performing environmental impact assessment of its products through LCA. Knauf Insulation has several glass wool factories in Europe that produce various products, and for a specific market, the same product can be produced in several factories. As the plants that produce glass wool work with similar pathways, a generic model for LCA usable for every plant and every glass wool product has been designed. Moreover, combination of different factories is also possible. The general principle of glass wool production is the following: the raw materials, sand, limestone, soda ash, borax, sodium carbonate, as well as recycled off-cuts from the production process, are weighed and mixed. Knauf Insulation also uses a large amount of <b>recycled</b> glass (<b>cullet).</b> The mix is sent to a furnace at high temperature (1350 °C). The melted material is then fiberized and the binder is added, a process called forming. Knauf Insulation uses a special binder with ECOSE Technology, a new and formaldehyde-free binder. The wool fibers are collected, by suction, on a conveyor belt, and the mattress then goes through the curing oven. For some product a facing is added. Finally the product is compressed and packed. The model, implemented in GaBi 6, is made as generic as possible by including, for each step, all the raw materials {{that can be used in}} one of the factories as well as all the energy sources. Parameters allow to define the amount of each raw material consumed, therefore the model can be adapted to any factory simply by setting these parameters accordingly. This also simplifies the data collection, since the template is the same for all the factories, it can be supported by data collection tools already existing. A part of the model is dedicated to weighting between factories, so a combination of factories can also be studied. The model can also be adapted to almost all Knauf Insulation products by using parameters where necessary: for example, several products have different binder contents, so a parameter defines the amount of binder. As some materials can be recycled between several parts of the process, special attention has been paid to recycling loops inside the model. The model is flexible enough to be used for Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) as well as for Eco-Design purposes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
2500|$|The main type {{of glass}} {{found in the}} Anglo-Saxon period is a soda-lime-silica glass, {{continuing}} the Roman tradition of producing glass. There is very little evidence for glass making from the raw materials in Roman Britain and even less evidence in Anglo-Saxon Britain. It would have been nearly impossible to transport the natron from the Middle East to Britain. It is therefore far more likely, that as in the Roman period, glass was being produced near the raw materials and then lumps of raw glass transported. Another source of glass was <b>cullet,</b> <b>recycled</b> broken or crushed glass. Recycling was carried out throughout the Roman period, and large deposits of broken glass at Winchester and Hamwic suggest glass was also being recycled in the Anglo-Saxon period. It is possible that by recycling glass in this way {{it was possible to}} keep up to the demand for glass products without new raw glass having to be introduced into the system. Additional cullet may also have been collected from the ruins of abandoned Romano-British sites. In the late 7-8th century with the construction of many ecclesiastical establishments and large windows, the demand for glass grew. At this time political problems in the Delta-Wadi Natrun region caused a shortage of natron in the Middle East where the raw glass was produced. This possibly led to [...] glass makers experimenting with new fluxes, which finally led to the introduction of wood ash glasses using potash as the main alkali flux, which was more readily available.|$|R
