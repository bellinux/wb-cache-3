500|$|A {{review of}} semipalmated sandpiper records {{took place in}} the 1970s, {{resulting}} in seven of the twelve records being rejected. A review of black-headed wagtail records was initiated in 1983. The results were published in 1994 and 1995, and nine previously accepted records were judged to be unsound, due to possible confusion with grey-headed wagtail. A review of <b>rufous</b> <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> records took place in 1994, and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. A review of lesser kestrel records, begun in 1994, and completed in 1995, concluded that six accepted records of this species should no longer be regarded as acceptable. Five of the six were from autumn, whereas the overwhelming majority of records the committee continued to accept are from the spring/summer period. All 24 spring records of Siberian stonechat were reconsidered in 2002–04, in the light of new information on the variability in appearance of European stonechats in spring; the committee decided that all but five should remain accepted. In 2003, the committee revised its assessment criteria for male pine buntings, redefining some birds previously considered hybrids [...] as acceptable, but requiring an overall greater level of precision in descriptions, and reviewed past records in the light of these changes.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} a rare vagrant to {{northern}} and western Europe. A 1986 review by Erik Hirschfeld in Dutch Birding listed around 30 records, mostly in autumn and winter. Prior to this, it had been suggested that European records referred to escapes from captivity, because of their tameness, {{the distance from the}} species' normal breeding range, the suburban habitat of many of the records, and their winter timing; Hirschfeld presented counter-arguments to all these points, and today it is generally accepted that most if not all <b>rufous</b> <b>turtle</b> <b>doves</b> in Europe are wild birds.|$|R

40|$|Soybean {{seeds and}} cotyledons suffer great damage by the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Dove</b> in Japan, {{depending}} upon the time of seed sowing. In our experimental field at Tsukuba, in 1983, almost all plants were eaten {{until the middle of}} May. Doves concentrated in fields where soybean seeds had been planted from the late April to the middle of May. After the middle of May, they came to the fields where wheat and barley had just been cut or the soils had been ploughed. Experiments conducted in the field covered with a large cage and utilizing the same doves showed that the rate of attacking new food (i. e., soybean buds) by doves increased with their experience to eat that food. Doves also frequently return to sites where food had once existed. These results suggest a practical method for avoiding damage by doves: sowing of soybean seeds in fields after the harvesting of wheat or barley. At these times greater effects also will be obtained from bird repellent devices...|$|E

50|$|This small {{species is}} very similar in plumage to its European counterpart, the <b>turtle</b> <b>dove.</b> It is a little larger than that species, {{particularly}} in the case of orientalis, about the same size as a collared dove. It shares the black and white striped patch on the side of its neck, but the breast is less pink, and the orange-brown wing feathers of the <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> are replaced with a browner hue, and darker centres. The tail is wedge shaped, like the <b>turtle</b> <b>dove.</b> The flight is more relaxed and direct than that of its relative.|$|R

40|$|Agri-environment schemes {{such as the}} Environmental Stewardship in England {{provide a}} range of options, {{including}} some targeted at single species, which may benefit {{a wide range of}} other species or taxa. To ascertain whether trials of an agri-environment measure designed for a single species had wider biodiversity benefits, we describe monitoring of pollinators (bumblebees and butterflies) on plots of a novel seed mix aimed at providing a source of seed food throughout the breeding season for the rapidly declining European <b>Turtle</b> <b>Dove</b> Streptopelia turtur. We compare pollinator abundance on these <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> plots to that on six control habitat types: fallow, grass margins, meadow, nectar flower mixture, wild bird cover and floristically enhanced margins. The abundance of foraging bumblebees and butterflies was higher on <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> plots than in fallow and wild bird cover habitats. Surprisingly, foraging bumblebee abundance was higher, and foraging butterfly abundance marginally higher on <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> plots than on nectar flower mixture. Whilst the specific mix described here is to be altered to increase access to foraging <b>turtle</b> <b>doves,</b> we suggest that the modified mix, to be rolled out through Higher Level Stewardship, is also likely to provide valuable resources for pollinators, adding to the growing body of literature demonstrating multi-taxa benefits of agri-environment options designed to benefit one species...|$|R
