40|$|Many {{pulse power}} {{applications}} in {{use at the}} Pegasus facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory require specialized imaging techniques. Due to the short event duration times, visible images are recorded by high speed electronic framing cameras. Framing cameras provide the advantages of high speed movies of back light experiments. These high speed framing cameras require bright illumination sources to record images with 10 ns integration times. High power lasers offer sufficient light for back illuminating the target assemblies; however, laser speckle noise lowers the contrast in the image. Laser speckle noise also limits the effective resolution. This discussion focuses {{on the use of}} telescopes to collect images 50 feet away. Both light field and dark field illumination techniques are compared. By adding <b>relay</b> <b>lenses</b> between the assembly target and the telescope, a high resolution magnified image can be recorded. For dark field illumination, these <b>relay</b> <b>lenses</b> can be used to separate the object field from the illumination laser. The illumination laser can be made to focus onto the opaque secondary of a Schmidt telescope. Thus, the telescope only collects scattered light from the target assembly. This dark field illumination eliminates the laser speckle noise and allows high resolution images to be recorded. Using the secondary of the telescope to block the illumination laser makes dark field illumination an ideal choice for the framing camera...|$|R

50|$|In pure {{rotating}} mirror cameras, film is held stationary {{in an arc}} centered about a {{rotating mirror}}. The image formed by the objective lens is relayed back to the rotating mirror from a primary lens or lens group, and then through a secondary <b>relay</b> <b>lens</b> (or more typically lens group) which relays the image from the mirror to the film. For each frame formed on the film, one secondary lens group is required. As such, these cameras typically do not record {{more than one hundred}} frames. This means they record for only a very short time - typically less than a millisecond. Therefore, they require specialized timing and illumination equipment. Rotating mirror cameras are capable of up to 25 million frames per second, with typical speed in the millions of fps.|$|E
50|$|Most {{telescope}} designs {{produce an}} inverted image at the focal plane; these {{are referred to}} as inverting telescopes. In fact, the image is both turned upside down and reversed left to right, so that altogether it is rotated by 180 degrees from the object orientation. In astronomical telescopes the rotated view is normally not corrected, since it does not affect how the telescope is used. However, a mirror diagonal is often used to place the eyepiece in a more convenient viewing location, and in that case the image is erect, but still reversed left to right. In terrestrial telescopes such as spotting scopes, monoculars and binoculars, prisms (e.g., Porro prisms) or a <b>relay</b> <b>lens</b> between objective and eyepiece are used to correct the image orientation. There are telescope designs that do not present an inverted image such as the Galilean refractor and the Gregorian reflector. These {{are referred to as}} erecting telescopes.|$|E
5000|$|In optics, a <b>relay</b> <b>lens</b> is a lens or lens {{group that}} inverts an image and extends the optical tube.

They may be made of one or more conventional lenses or achromatic doublets, or a long cylindrical gradient-index of refraction lens (a GRIN lens). Relay lenses operate by producing intermediate planes of focus. For example, an objective lens such as an SLR lens produces an image plane where the image sensor would usually go. If you place a lens with focal length f a distance 2f from that image plane and then put an image sensor 2f beyond the lens, that lens will relay the first image to the second with 1:1 magnification (see thin lens formula with object distance , the image distance is calculated to [...] ). Ideally, this second image plane will be identical to the first, so you could put a sensor there and record exactly the same image. If a longer distance is needed, this can be repeated.|$|E

The SWIR spectrometer receives light from the main instrument via an intermediate pupil, and directs this - via a telescope - towards a slit which defines the along-track footprint of the instrument on the ground.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{now under}} development {{is intended to}} enable the precise alignment of sheet arrays of microscopic lenses with the end faces of a coherent bundle {{of as many as}} 1, 000 single-mode optical fibers packed closely in a regular array (see Figure 1). In the original application that prompted this development, the precise assembly of lenses and optical fibers serves as a single-mode spatial filter for a visible-light nulling interferometer. The precision of alignment must be sufficient to limit any remaining wavefront error to a root-mean-square value of less than 1 / 10 of a wavelength of light. This wavefront-error limit translates to requirements to (1) ensure uniformity of both the lens and fiber arrays, (2) ensure that the lateral distance from the central axis of each lens and the corresponding optical fiber {{is no more than a}} fraction of a micron, (3) angularly align the lens-sheet planes and the fiber-bundle end faces to within a few arc seconds, and (4) axially align the lenses and the fiber-bundle end faces to within tens of microns of the focal distance. Figure 2 depicts the apparatus used in the alignment procedure. The beam of light from a Zygo (or equivalent) interferometer is first compressed by a ratio of 20 : 1 so that upon its return to the interferometer, the beam will be magnified enough to enable measurement of wavefront quality. The apparatus includes <b>relay</b> <b>lenses</b> that enable imaging of the arrays of microscopic lenses in a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera that is part of the interferometer. One of the arrays of microscopic lenses is mounted on a 6 -axis stage, in proximity to the front face of the bundle of optical fibers. The bundle is mounted on a separate stage. A mirror is attached to the back face of the bundle of optical fibers for retroreflection of light. When a microscopic lens and a fiber are aligned with each other, the affected portion of the light is reflected back by the mirror, recollimated by the microscopic lens, transmitted through the <b>relay</b> <b>lenses</b> and the beam compressor/expander, then split so that half goes to a detector and half to the interferometer.

40|$|Electronic {{focal plane}} arrays (FPA) such as CMOS and CCD sensors have {{dramatically}} improved {{to the point}} that digital cameras have essentially phased out film (except in very niche applications such as hobby photography and cinema). However, the traditional method of mating a single lens assembly to a single detector plane, as required for film cameras, is still the dominant design used in cameras today. The use of electronic sensors and their ability to capture digital signals that can be processed and manipulated post acquisition offers much more freedom of design at system levels and opens up many interesting possibilities {{for the next generation of}} computational imaging systems. The AWARE gigapixel scale camera is one such computational imaging system.

The major objectives of this work are to move the viewing aperture closer to the plasma so that the optical path does not cut through any adjacent blanket shield module other than the module designated for the port; move optics forward into the port tube to increase the aperture size and therefore improve the spatial resolution; assess the trade-off between spatial resolution and spatial coverage by reducing the field of view; and create a mechanical model with a neutron labyrinth. Here we show an optical design incorporating all these aspects. The new design fits into a 360 mm ID tube, as did the previous design. The entrance aperture is increased from 10 mm to 21 mm, with a corresponding increase in spatial resolution. The Airy disk diameter for 3. 8 {micro}m wavelength IR light is 5. 1 mm at the most distant target point in the field of view. The field of view is reduced from 60 toroidal degrees (full toroidal coverage with 6 cameras) to 50 toroidal degrees.

The sizes of the ejecta particles are recorded using an in-line Fraunhofer holography technique. Because the holographic plate would be destroyed in an energetic environment, a high-resolution lens {{has been designed to}} relay the interference fringes to a safe environment. Particle sizes within a 12 -mm-diameter, 5 -mm-thick volume are recorded onto holographic film. To achieve resolution down to 0. 5 μm, ultraviolet laser (UV) light is needed.

The magnetically focused tubes are EEV P 829 D (5 dynodes), ITT F- 4089 (1 stage), RCA C 33011 (2 stages), and RCA C 70021 AEP 2 (3 stages). The tests included measurements of limiting resolution (of the intensifiers directly and of photographs obtained with the intensifiers), square -wave response, geometrical distortion, shear characteristics in fiber-optic faceplates, photographic speed gain, uniformity of response, light- induced background, dark emission, and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of intensifier -photographic emulsion combinations. The most significant result of the tests is that a comparison among tubes with a similar number of stages (or gain) showed that the magnetically focused intensifiers were generally superior to the electrostatically focused intensifiers in resolving power, geometrical distortion, and uniformity of response. However, the electrostatically focused tubes exhibited only about one fifth the light- induced background of the magnetic tubes.

In the laboratory, the fibers {{have been used in}} wide bandwidth, two-arm, Mach-Zehnder test interferometers as well as a 5 -telescope imaging interferometer connected to an all-fiber beam combiner. Based upon these experiments and some theoretical studies it is shown that fiber optics and fiber optic components such as directional couplers provide an excellent alternative to conventional optics such as mirrors, beamsplitters, and <b>relay</b> <b>lenses.</b> The equations describing the measurement of the complex degree of coherence in an interferometer with a single-mode fiber in each arm are derived. The equations reveal an important feature of the fibers: they filter phase fluctuations due to aberrations and turbulence at the input and convert them to intensity fluctuations at the output. This leads to a simplification of the calibration of measured visibilities. The coupling efficiency of light which has passed through a turbulent atmosphere is also studied as a function of fiber parameters and turbulence conditions for both image motion stabilized and non-stabilized cases. For the former case, coupling efficiency remains greater than 50 % as long as telescope diameter is no larger than the turbulence coherence length. Beam combination architectures using arrays of directional couplers are fully discussed. Arrays accommodating up to 20 input beams are presented. The arrays require only N detector pixels for N input beams. A scheme of temporal multiplexing of the phase of each beam is used to identify individual fringe pairs. One possible scheme allows wide bandwidths even for large numbers of beams. A 5 -telescope interferometer has been constructed and connected to an all-fiber beam combiner.

It is positioned between two <b>relay</b> <b>lenses</b> (or on one of two relay mirrors) in a video imaging system. If the disperser were removed, the system would produce ordinary images of the scene in its field of view. In the presence of the grating, the image on the focal plane of the system contains both spectral and spatial information because the multiple diffraction orders of the grating give rise to multiple, spectrally dispersed images of the scene. By use of algorithms adapted from computed tomography, the image on the focal plane can be processed into an image cube a three-dimensional collection of data on the image intensity as a function of the two spatial dimensions (x and y) in the scene and of wavelength (lambda). Thus, both spectrally and spatially resolved information on the scene at a given instant of time can be obtained, without scanning, from a single snapshot; this is what makes the CTIS such a potentially powerful tool for spatially, spectrally, and temporally resolved imaging. A CTIS performs poorly in imaging some types of scenes in particular, scenes that contain little spatial or spectral variation. The computed spectra of such scenes tend to approximate correct values to within acceptably small errors near the edges of the field of view but to be poor approximations away from the edges. The additional structure imposed on a scene according to the present method enables the CTIS algorithms to reconstruct acceptable approximations of the spectral data throughout the scene...|$|R
50|$|Criteria for {{selecting}} a borescope are usually image clarity and access. For similar-quality instruments, the largest rigid borescope that will fit the hole gives the best image. Optical systems in rigid borescopes {{can be of}} 3 basic types: Harold Hopkins rod lenses, achromatic doublets and gradient index rod lenses. For large diameter borescopes (over 12mm), the achromatic doublet relays work quite well, but as {{the diameter of the}} borescope tube gets smaller the Hopkins rod lens and gradient index rod lens designs provide superior images. For very small rigid borescopes (under 3mm), the gradient index <b>lens</b> <b>relays</b> are better.|$|R
