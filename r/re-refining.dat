50|$|Used oil <b>re-refining</b> is {{the process}} of {{restoring}} used oil to new oil by removing chemical impurities, heavy metals and dirt. Used Industrial and automotive oil is recycled at re-refineries. The used oil is first tested to determine suitability for <b>re-refining,</b> after which it is dehydrated and the water distillate is treated before being released into the environment. Dehydrating also removes the residual light fuel {{that can be used to}} power the refinery, and additionally captures ethylene glycol for re-use in recycled antifreeze.|$|E

5000|$|Physicochemical {{methods are}} based on the use of coagulants and {{adsorbents}} [...] Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil <b>re-refining</b> and transformer oil regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.|$|E
40|$|We have <b>re-refined</b> the X-ray {{structure}} of the heme site in cytochrome c 553, supplementing the crystallographic data with quantum chemical geometry optimizations, instead of the molecular mechanics force field used in standard crystallographic refinement. By comparing the resulting structure, obtained using medium-resolution data (170 pm), with an atomic-resolution structure (95 pm) of the same protein, we show that the inclusion of quantum chemical information into the refinement procedure improves the structure significantly. Thus, errors in the Fe-ligand distances are reduced from 3 to 32 pm in the low-resolution structure to 0 - 5 pm in the <b>re-refined</b> structure, one side-chain atom changes its conformation (a movement by 214 pm toward {{its position in the}} high-resolution structure), and the R factors are improved by up to 0. 018.

Arrowhead Refining Company incorporated in 1961 and continued the <b>re-refining</b> activities until 1977.

5000|$|The 58-acre Brio Refinery {{site was}} home to several {{chemical}} companies between 1957 and 1982, when the owner, Brio Refinery Inc. declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. During that period, the site had been used for copper recovery and petroleum <b>re-refining,</b> typically the processing of tar, sludge, and other residue from oil tanks and other sources, as also occurred at the adjacent Dixie Oil Processors site. [...] Throughout the years, at both sites, unprocessed petroleum and waste materials were stored in 12 large earthen pits, ranging from 14 to 32 feet deep and extending into porous soil and, thus, groundwater. Leaks from these pits also spilled into a local drainage ditch, Mud Gulley, and subsequently, via the adjoining Clear Creek, into Galveston Bay. By the late 1980s, the EPA had detected copper, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, fluorene, styrene, ethylbenzene, toluene, benzene and other toxic chemicals, including numerous chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{in the air and}} groundwater.|$|E
50|$|Improvement in {{filtration}} {{technologies and}} processes has now made recycling {{a viable option}} (with rising price of base stock and crude oil). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and recover the base oil. The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated {{much the same as}} virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and <b>re-refining</b> (distilling, isomerisation, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} hybrid quantum {{mechanical}}/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations {{was performed on}} models of a DNA duplex with artificial silver(I) -mediated imidazole base pairs. The optimized structures were compared to the original experimental NMR structure (Nat. Chem. 2 (2010) 229 - 234). The metal⋯metal distances are significantly shorter (~ 0. 5 Å) in the QM/MM model than in the original NMR structure. As a result, argentophilic interactions are feasible between the silver(I) ions of neighboring metal-mediated base pairs. Using the computationally determined metal⋯metal distances, a <b>re-refined</b> NMR solution structure of the DNA duplex was obtained. In this new NMR structure, all experimental constraints remain fulfilled. The new NMR structure shows less deviation from the regular B-type conformation than the original one.
