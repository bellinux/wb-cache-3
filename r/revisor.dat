5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe Tyrannosaurus rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first <b>revisor</b> by selecting Tyrannosaurus as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E
5|$|Gregory Mathews {{described}} the western subspecies perplexus in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting {{that it was}} smaller than the nominate subspecies. He called C. coronoides coronoides the eastern crow, listing its range as New South Wales, and described {{what is now the}} Australian crow as another subspecies, C. coronoides cecilae, calling it the north-western crow and recording its range as northwestern Australia. In the same work he listed the raven as Corvus marianae, with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its range as New South Wales. He listed the little raven and forest raven as subspecies. Mathews had erected C. marianae in 1911 as the name after declaring Corvus australis Gould to be preoccupied; French-American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First <b>Revisor</b> under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black nunbird—to preserve the stability of the name. This has been followed by later authors.|$|E
25|$|First {{described}} by John Latham as Mycteria asiatica, this species was later {{placed in the}} genus Xenorhynchus based on morphology. Based on behavioural similarities, Kahl suggested {{the placement of the}} species in the genus Ephippiorhynchus, which then included a single species, the saddle-billed stork. This placement of both the black-necked stork and saddle-billed stork in the same genus was later supported by osteological and behavioural data, and DNA-DNA hybridisation and cytochrome – b data. The genera Xenorhynchus and Ephippiorhynchus were both erected at the same time, and as first <b>revisor,</b> Kahl selected the latter as the valid genus for the two species. This and the saddle-billed stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis are the only stork species that show marked sexual dimorphism in iris colour.|$|E

40|$|Translators in {{international}} contexts are often invisible, though {{their role in}} the making of international politics is crucial as shown in this paper by Zanettin. The paratextual material concerning two crucial political episodes in times of crisis pave the way to the analysis of translation in the hands of mediating agents such as “journalists, <b>revisors</b> and editors”. Apparently, the intralingual translation that occurs in the rewriting and recontextualization of political speeches follows a domestication process that satisfies the expectations of the public, sometimes even manipulating the source translation in terms that fit existing political currents. Therefore, translation can become a “rather powerful political weapon” to redefine international relations for specific purposes...|$|R

The general <b>revisors</b> of the Society unanimously rendered an unfavorable opinion on the work, and accordingly, in 1674, the Superior General Giovanni Paolo Oliva refused permission for its publication. González received encouragement from Pope Innocent XI and by his order the Holy Office issued a decree, in 1680, ordering the superiors of the Society to allow their subjects to defend probabiliorism, a permission that had never been denied.|$|R

40|$|Ariane-G 5 is an {{integrated}} environment initially designed {{to facilitate the}} development of multilingual MT systems for <b>revisors</b> (MT-R), where output quality is obtained by using the heuristic programming facilities of its 5 rule-based languages to specialize the lingware components to the sublanguage at hand. It can support many MT architectures and linguistic methodologies and accepts whole paragraphs or pages as units of translation rather than separate sentences. For MT-R, B. Vauquois' mutltilevel transfer approach has given excellent results on {{a large number of}} MT-R mockups and prototypes, as well as two large scale operational systems. As both the computer tools and the linguistic methodology are not embodiments of a particular theory, they are quite easy to adapt to new problems. In the last few years, they have actually been revised and further developed in the framework of new research on high quality MT for monolingual authors (MT-A), relying on a disambiguation dialogue with the author (DBMT), following an all-paths analysis. The evolution of Ariane-G 5 /LIDIA and associated linguistic methodologies is now motivated by two projects of different aims and requirements. The UNL project of personal multilingual high-quality communication over the Internet requires the construction of a large lexical database from which coherent dictionaries for MT and for interactive disambiguation will be generated.
