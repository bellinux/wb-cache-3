The VH Hardtop models used body panels that were made entirely in Australia, unlike the previous VG Hardtops which had used imported sheet metal for all panels rear of the windscreen.

50|$|After {{reports of}} the Lewis and Clark Expedition were {{published}} in about 1807, a small and steadily increasing stream of isolated pioneer groups began settling the valley and improving routes from the east set up by fur traders and mountain men. From the 1841 Oregon Trail opening, when the effort of many years finally widened the fur traders' mule trails into an improved rough road just capable of carrying {{the width of a}} <b>wagon,</b> settlers <b>charged</b> into the region along the new trail, creating new settlements centered about Oregon City as the early capital, even before ownership of the region was settled. So many people came that the valley led the way to achieving statehood less than 16 years after it was claimed by the United States in 1846. A small part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion is in southwestern Washington around the city of Vancouver, which was once the site of an early colonial-era settlementFort Vancouver. The Willamette Valleyserved with its sawmills, lush productive farms, handy river transport network, and nearby timber and mineral resourcesdeveloped naturally as a cultural and major commercial hub, as the Oregon Country became the Oregon Territory.|$|R
25|$|On July 3, 1863, {{reports of}} a slow moving Confederate wagon train were {{reported}} {{in the vicinity of}} Fairfield, Pennsylvania and attracted the attention of newly commissioned Union Brigadier General Wesley Merritt of the Reserve Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps. He ordered the 6th U.S. Cavalry under (Brevet Colonel) Major Starr to scout Fairfield and locate the wagons, resulting in the Battle of Fairfield. Starr dashed forward under orders after the Confederate supply train. His scouts spotted the <b>wagons</b> and Starr <b>charged</b> forward. When his forward units under Lieutenant Christian Balder encountered Virginia cavalry and came racing back, Starr decided to fight. He deployed his men in a defensive posture with a portion of them mounted ready for offensive action on the road.|$|R
50|$|At about 22:17 on 22 March 1945 a <b>wagon</b> {{containing}} depth <b>charges</b> in a southbound {{freight train}} caught fire on approaching Bootle. The train crew, driver H. Goodall and fireman H.N. Stubbs, on {{becoming aware of}} the fire, stopped the train south of Bootle station. Despite the fierce fire, the crew isolated the burning wagon by uncoupling the rear portion of the train, then drawing it forward to before uncoupling the burning wagon. With the wagon isolated, the fireman went forward to protect the northbound line while the driver went back in a possible attempt to fight the fire. At this point the depth charges violently exploded, killing the driver and creating a crater 105 feet long {{to a depth of}} 50 feet. The line was closed for three days whilst the crater was filled in and the track relaid.|$|R
5000|$|Forming line of battle, the 43rd Indiana's Norris {{ordered his}} command to charge Fagan's {{dismounted}} cavalry. As the charge commenced, Confederate General William Cabell's mounted cavalry revealed itself from concealed {{positions in the}} trees on the south, or right flank. What began as a skirmish at around 8:30 am quickly developed into a very hot firefight with the federals firing in two directions to beat off the assault. The well-aimed fire from the veteran federal infantry was devastatingly effective and temporarily slowed Fagan’s advance. Drake ordered the train to pull off the road into an empty field and then ordered Major Hamilton to deploy the first battalion of the 36th Iowa Infantry up and onto the firing line on the 43rd Indiana’s left flank. Just as Companies A, B and C came on line, the Confederates charged the center and took another devastating musket volley from the federals. Drake then ordered up Peetz's 2nd Missouri Battery at the double-quick. As Peetz’s gun crews swung their cannon into position, the federal infantry was ordered to move to both flanks to open a hole in the center. This was done with alacrity and Peetz's gun crews opened fire on the rebels with grapeshot at less than 200 yards. This stunned the Confederates, resulting in a momentary lull in the battle, but musket fire quickly resumed. As the Iowa and Indiana infantrymen were concentrating on the rebels to their front and right flank. General Joe Shelby's cavalry brigade swooped down on them from the left flank. Three companies of the Thirty-sixth Iowa, the entire Forty-third Indiana and Captain Peetz’s battery of the Second Missouri Light Artillerywere now pressed on three sides and were in danger of being encircled. Drake ordered the remainder of the 36th Iowa Infantry, still positioned near the <b>wagons,</b> to <b>charge</b> into Cabell's troopers on the right to push them back, prevent encirclement and attempt a link-up with the Seventy-seventh Ohio, which was now moving forward to join the battle. Before this charge could be accomplished however, the rebels closed the trap. As the federal troops were surrounded, it quickly became a confused entanglement of small units fighting small units and then it became, according to Captain Seth Swiggett, [...] "Every man for himself." ...|$|R
