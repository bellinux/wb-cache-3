40|$|Polysaccharides are food {{ingredients}} that critically determine rheological properties and shelf life. A {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment on food-specific polysaccharide mixtures by 1 H NMR is presented. The method {{is based on the}} identification of intact polysaccharides, combined with a quantitative analysis of their monosaccharide constituents. Identification of the polysaccharides is achieved by 1 H NMR line shape fitting with pure compound spectra. The monomeric composition was determined using the Saeman hydrolysis procedure, followed by direct monosaccharide quantification by 1 H NMR. In the quantification, both the monosaccharide degradation during hydrolysis, as well as a correction for the non-instantaneous polysaccharide dissolution were taken into account. These factors were particularly important for the quantification of pectins. The method showed overall good repeatability (<b>RSD</b> <b>r</b> = 4. 1 ± 0. 9 %) and within-laboratory reproducibility (<b>RSD</b> <b>R</b> = 6. 1 ± 1. 4 %) for various food polysaccharides. Polysaccharide mixtures were quantitatively resolved by a non-negative least squares estimation, using identified polysaccharides and their molar monosaccharide stoichiometry as prior knowledge. The accuracy and precision of the presented method make it applicable {{to a wide range of}} food polysaccharide mixtures with complex and overlapping 1 H NMR spectra. </p...|$|E

The test portion of the sample was extracted with hydrochloric acid, and the analyte was derivatized with 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde, with 1, 2 (15 N 2, 13 C) SEM as an internal standard. The extract was neutralized and then purified on a solid-phase extraction cartridge. The SEM was determined by reversed-phase LC with detection by MS/MS. Apple putee, rice pudding, and meat/vegetable meal baby food materials, spiked with SEM at levels of about 3, 10, and 30 ng/g, respectively, were sent to 20 laboratories in 12 different European countries, which submitted results from 17 participants. Recoveries ranged from 88. 8 to 106. 1 %.

40|$|Penicillins {{are used}} universally in {{both human and}} {{veterinary}} medicine. The European Union (EU) has established maximum residue levels (MRLs) for most ß-lactam antibiotics in milk and animal tissues and included them in the National Residue Monitoring Programs. In this study, a novel method is described for the determination and confirmation of eight penicillins in porcine tissues, milk and animal feed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). To prevent degradation of penicillin residues during workup, a derivatisation procedure was developed, by which penicillins were converted to stable piperidine derivatives. Deuterated piperidine derivatives were synthesised for all relevant penicillins, enabling the use of isotope dilution for accurate quantification. Penicillin residues were derivatised in the crude extract with piperidine and isolated using solid-phase extraction. The penicillin piperidine derivatives were determined by LC–MS/MS. The method was validated at the current MRLs, which range from 25 – 300  µg kg− 1 in muscle and kidney to 4 – 30  µg kg− 1 in milk {{as well as at}} the target value of 100  µg kg− 1 chosen for animal feed, according to the EU requirements for a quantitative confirmatory method. Accuracy ranged from 94 – 113 % (muscle), 83 – 111 % (kidney) and 87 – 103 % (milk) to 88 – 116 % (animal feed). Intra-day precision (relative standard deviation (<b>RSD)</b> <b>r)</b> ranged from 5 – 13 % (muscle, n[*]=[*] 18), 4 – 17 % (kidney, n[*]=[*] 7) and 5 – 18 % (milk, n[*]=[*] 7) to 11 – 32 % (animal feed, n[*]=[*] 18). Inter-day precision (RSDRL, n[*]=[*] 18) ranged from 6 – 23 % (muscle) to 11 – 36 % (animal feed).

40|$|A new {{reversed}} phase {{high performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with florescence detection and two solid phase extraction (SPE) {{methods have been}} developed, optimised and validated for determining salbutamol in human urine after an inhalation. SPE methodology for unchanged salbutamol (USAL) and salbutamol plus its metabolites (USALMET) concentrations in urine has been developed using terbutaline as the internal standard. Confirm HCX cartridges were used for USAL and Oasis HLB for USALMET. Calibration lines of salbutamol urine standards were linear over the range 25 – 300 μg/L with mean (<b>RSD)</b> <b>r</b> 2 values of 0. 9983 (0. 06 %) for USAL and 0. 9976 (0. 202 %) for USALMET. The HPLC method was accurate (mean bias − 0. 40 % for USAL and 0. 46 % for USALMET) and precise (mean RSD 5. 0 % for USAL and 2. 90 % for USALMET). The calculated LOD and LOQ for salbutamol using a 1 mL urine sample were 4. 0 and 12. 12 μg/L for USAL, and 4. 80 and 14. 56 μg/L for USALMET, respectively. The mean (RSD) SPE recoveries of salbutamol were 90. 82 % (2. 32 %) for USAL and 91. 54 % (2. 96 %) for USALMET. Both HPLC and SPE methods were applied to quantify unchanged and metabolised salbutamol excreted in urine after the inhalation of 200 μg salbutamol from metered dose inhalers (MDIs) by 14 healthy volunteers. Charcoal slurries were also ingested to prevent gastro-intestinal absorption. Urine samples were collected at 30 min post-inhalation and then pooled for the next 24 h. All urine concentrations were within the sensitive portion of the assay. The volunteer study revealed that following inhalation from an MDI about 20 % of the nominal dose is deposited into the lungs and 46 % is delivered to the systemic circulation. The results confirm the application, sensitivity, reliability and robustness of the HPLC and SPE methods for urinary pharmacokinetic studies after salbutamol inhalations using therapeutic doses...|$|E
