25|$|Generally {{the courts}} have taken a deferential {{approach}} to reviewing unions' decisions challenged as a breach of their duty of fair representation. Recognizing that the collective bargaining process typically requires compromises, which may favor some workers {{at the expense of}} others, {{the courts have}} held that a union only breaches its duty if it acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily. Practical considerations have also led the courts to refuse to second-guess unions' decisions: if a court or jury could substitute its judgment as to whether a particular grievance had merit, then unions could not function, since their decisions would rarely be final in any practical sense. Accordingly, the courts have refused to overturn union decisions as arbitrary so long as they were based on a <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> by the union, even if the court might believe that this decision was wrong.|$|E

SCA knowingly and independently waived any right to make further claims to any of the money it paid." [...] SCA's Jeff Dorough stated that on October 30, 2012, Armstrong was sent a formal request for the return of $12m in bonuses. It is alleged that Armstrong's legal team has offered a settlement of $1 million.|$|E

5000|$|Discrimination: Discrimination {{occurs when}} a {{conscious}} decision is taken regarding the appropriate course of action. A tiger stalks its prey and attacks from a selected vantage point. This is discrimination. A robber enters a house and calculates which room to plunder first, based on most likely gain. This is discrimination. A <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> regarding pros and cons is taken. When discrimination goes one step further, considering a choice {{between right and wrong}} (proper and improper), then conscience (viveka) is invoked. At that point, discrimination rises to the level of rationality. Compared to instinct and sentiment, discrimination is a slow process. It takes more time to exercise discrimination.|$|E
5000|$|The key issue, {{according}} to Lord Millett, in upholding the trust concept is ascertaining where the beneficial {{interest in the}} money lies.

Lord Millett then analysed all of the foregoing, and determined that the beneficial interest remains with the lender, until the purpose for which the funds are lent is fulfilled. The only other <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> was Lord Hoffmann, who agreed with Lord Millett, though disagreed as to whether it was an express or resulting trust.|$|E

50|$|Legal {{representation}} is not permitted, except when special permission is granted {{in cases where}} the dispute raises complex questions of law. The written procedure is simplified. The judges explain the rules of evidence and procedure to the parties. They direct the proceedings, question witnesses, hear the parties, and decide the issues in dispute. They provide each party with fair and impartial assistance, so as to render the substantive law effective and ensure that it is carried out. Where circumstances allow, the judges endeavour to bring the parties to an agreement. When judgment is rendered, it is a <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> and cannot be appealed. Judges in this division also decide tax-related summary appeals.|$|E
