5000|$|... "Sluice gate" [...] {{refers to}} a movable gate {{allowing}} water to flow under it. When a sluice is lowered, water may spill over the top, {{in which case the}} gate operates as a weir. Usually, a mechanism drives the sluice up or down. This may be a simple, hand-operated, chain pulled/lowered, worm drive or <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>drive,</b> or it may be electrically or hydraulically powered.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{variants}} of the ST-26 (with a sliding system of bridge laying {{and with a}} tipping system of bridge laying) were also tested from 1932. The first had a massive guide frame and a special boom (the bridge could be laid in 3 min 20 sec, the raise operation took 6-7 min), while the second was equipped with a special swinging-boom with a <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>drive.</b> All three {{variants of}} the ST-26 participated in military maneuvers of the Leningrad Military District {{in the summer of}} 1933; subsequently series production of the ST-26 with a cable system of bridge laying was begun as it proved to be more reliable and less complicated to maintain. The Defence Committee of the USSR ordered the production of 100 ST-26 to the end of 1933, but only 44 vehicles were assembled by the Factory No. 174 by 1934, and 20 in 1935. The delay was attributed to the manufacture of the metal bridges, carried out by the Gipstalmost Factory and several workshops using semi-handicraft techniques.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} a novel {{prismatic}} drive is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The design of Slide-o-Cam was reported elsewhere. This drive thus provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of <b>rack-and-pinions</b> and linear <b>drives.</b> Such properties {{can be used to}} design new transmissions for parallel-kinematics machines.

40|$|International audienceThe multiobjective {{optimization}} of Slide-o-Cam {{is reported}} in this paper. Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of <b>rack-and-pinions</b> and linear <b>drives.</b> A Pareto frontier is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii) the Hertz pressure {{used to evaluate the}} stresses produced on the contact surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism, characterized by the number of cams and their width...|$|R
