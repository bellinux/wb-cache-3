Haploid cells have been elusive for culture, {{due to their}} inferior growth and genomic instability. Here, we generated gynogenetic medaka embryos and obtained three haploid ES cell lines that retained pluripotency and competitive growth. Upon nuclear transfer into unfertilized oocytes, the haploid ES cells, even after genetic engineering, generated viable offspring capable of germline transmission. Hence, haploid medaka ES cells stably maintain normal growth, pluripotency, and genomic integrity.

Antisense RNA from a transactivated promoter introduced randomly into transcribed genes throughout the genome of mouse 3 T 3 fibroblasts was used to knock out alleles of chromosomal genes adjacent to promoter inserts, generating clones that grew in 0. 5 % agar and formed metastatic tumors in nude mice. Removal of the transactivator restored normal growth. The protein encoded by tsg 101 cDNA encodes a coiled–coil domain that interacts with stathmin, a cytosolic phosphoprotein implicated previously in tumorigenesis.

50|$|Haemophilia and red-green colour {{blindness}} are recessive, X-linked, pseudodominant genetic disorders, expressed mainly in human males because human females {{need to be}} homozygous (i.e., to have inherited the recessive allele from both parents) to show these traits. Pseudodominance is also observed in some autosomal recessive conditions. This could happen {{in the cases of}} loss of the dominant allele (deletion) or of a deficiency mutation in the dominant allele in one homologue. The heterozygous condition is therefore lost at that particular locus. The individual becomes homozygous and the <b>recessive</b> <b>phenotype</b> is revealed. In a study on ectrodactyly with aplasia of long bones syndrome involving eight-generation consanguineous family in the United Arab Emirates in 2006, the condition was observed in 23 out of 145 individuals. There were 10 consanguineous marriages in the pedigree, and this suggests possible pseudodominace in the family due to high frequency of the mutant allele. Imprinting, where one chromosome is 'switched off', can also produce pseudodominant patterns of inheritance.|$|E
50|$|Mitotic {{recombination}} {{can happen}} at any locus but is observable in individuals that are heterozygous {{at a given}} locus. If a crossover event affects that locus, then both homologous chromosomes will have one chromatid containing each genotype. The resulting phenotype of the daughter cells depends on how the chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate. If the chromatids containing different alleles line up {{on the same side}} of the plate, then the resulting daughter cells will appear heterozygous and be undetectable, despite the crossover event. However, if chromatids containing the same alleles line up on the same side, the daughter cells will be homozygous at that locus. This results in twin spotting, where one cell presents the homozygous <b>recessive</b> <b>phenotype</b> and the other cell has the homozygous wild type phenotype. If those daughter cells go on to replicate and divide, the twin spots will continue to grow and reflect the differential phenotype.|$|E

50|$|Rare {{recessive}} disorders {{would not}} have single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in public databases such as dbSNP. More common <b>recessive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> may have disease-causing variants reported in dbSNP. For example, the most common cystic fibrosis variant has an allele frequency of about 3% in most populations. Screening out such variants might erroneously exclude such genes from consideration. Genes for recessive disorders are usually easier to identify than dominant disorders because the genes {{are less likely to}} have more than one rare nonsynonymous variant. The system that screens common genetic variants relies on dbSNP which may not have accurate information about the variation of alleles. Using lists of common variation from a study exome or genome-wide sequenced individual would be more reliable. A challenge in this approach is that as the number of exomes sequenced increases, dbSNP will also {{increase in the number of}} uncommon variants. It will be necessary to develop thresholds to define the common variants that are unlikely to be associated with a disease phenotype.|$|R
40|$|Results: I do, however, contend that, if so much {{speciation}} occurs, it must {{result from}} a process of natural selection, whereby it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce preferentially within a group and reduce their breeding {{with the rest of}} the population, leading to a model whereby new species arise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small inbreeding groups &#x 201 c;budding&#x 201 d; from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by several advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous <b>recessive</b> <b>phenotypes,</b> which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding. Reproductive barriers would thus not arise passively as a consequence of drift in isolated populations, but under the selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Most documented cases of speciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more speciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, many recessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation, with these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited genomic diversity. |$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} five independent allelic mutations, defining the gene cha- 1, {{that result in}} decreased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Four of the mutant alleles, when homozygous, lead to ChAT reductions of> 98 %, as well as <b>recessive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> of uncoordinated behavior, small size, slow growth and resistance to cholinesterase inhibitors. Animals homozygous for the fifth allele retain approximately 10 % of the wild-type enzyme level; purified enzyme from this mutant has altered Km values for both choline and acetyl-CoA and is more thermolabile than the wild-type enzyme. These qualitative alterations, together with gene dosage data, argue that cha- 1 is the structural gene for ChAT. cha- 1 has been mapped to the left arm of linkage group IV and is within 0. 02 map unit of the gene unc- 17, mutant alleles of which lead {{to all of the}} phenotypes of cha- 1 mutants except for the ChAT deficiency.

40|$|We have {{previously}} described the gene mei- 1, which encodes {{an essential component}} of the Caenorhabditis elegans meiotic spindle. When ectopically expressed after the completion of meiosis, mei- 1 protein disrupts the function of the mitotic cleavage spindles. In this article, we describe the cloning and the further genetic characterization of mel- 26, a postmeiotic negative regulator of mei- 1. mel- 26 was originally identified by a gain-of-function mutation. We have reverted this mutation to a loss-of-function allele, which has <b>recessive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> identical to the dominant defects of its gain-of-function parent. Both the dominant and recessive mutations of mel- 26 result in mei- 1 protein ectopically localized in mitotic spindles and centrosomes, leading to small and misoriented cleavage spindles. The loss-of-function mutation was used to clone mel- 26 by transformation rescue. As suggested by genetic results indicating that mel- 26 is required only maternally, mel- 26 mRNA was expressed predominantly in the female germline.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{targeted}} drugs can unplug gain-of-function tumor pathways has revitalized pharmaceutical research, but the survival {{benefits of this}} strategy have so far proven modest. A weakness of oncogene-blocking approaches {{is that they do}} not address the problem of cancer progression as selected by the <b>recessive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> of genetic instability and apoptotic resistance which in turn arise from loss-of-function - i. e., undruggable - defects of caretaker (e. g., BRCA, MLH 1) or gatekeeper (e. g., TP 53, PTEN) suppressor genes. Genetic instability ensures that rapid cell kill is balanced by similarly rapid selection for apoptotic resistance and hence for metastasis; doubt is thus cast on the assumption that cytotoxicity (&# 39;response&# 39;) {{is the best way to}} identify survival-enhancing drugs. In the absence of gene therapy, it is proposed here that caretaker-defective (high-instability) tumors may be best treated with low-lethality drugs inducing replicative (RAS-RAF-ERK) arrest or dormancy, causing &# 39;stable disease&# 39; rather than tumorilytic remission. Gatekeeper-defective (death-resistant) tumors, on the other hand, may be best managed by combining survival (PI 3 K-AKT-mTOR) pathway blockade with metronomic or sequential pro-apoptotic drugs...|$|R
