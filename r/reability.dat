Internal consistency and re-test application were carried out to determine the validity of the inventory. Cronbach Alpha coefficient was of found to be ?= 0, 89 and re-test correlation coefficient was found to be r = 0, 97. As a result in the research that the validity and <b>reability</b> of Inventory of Professional Attitude at Occupation were high and that it was an efficient instrument of measurement to determine nurses’ and midwives’ professional attitude at occupation...|$|E
40|$|The {{background}} of the research was the existence of fluctuation of the transaction number upon the counter of telephone bill payment in Pedurungan. From the condition, there was an attraction of the research question of “Does the gap of customer’s wishes againt the service performance evaluated from Tangibles, <b>Reability,</b> Responsiveness, Assurance and Empathy exist in the counter of telephone bill payment in Pedurungan”.

The taken sample was 100 respondents, by using Accidental Sampling tecnique. The used data analysis and hypothesis testing of Wilcoxon Match Pairs Test. 	The research result shows that upon the tangibles dimension, the respondent equivalent level is 88. 16 percent, it means that the respondent stated enough satisfaction with the given performance.
