5000|$|Many fish swim {{through water}} by {{creating}} undulations {{with their bodies}} or oscillating their fins. The undulations create components of forward thrust complemented by a <b>rearward</b> <b>force,</b> side forces which are wasted portions of energy, and a normal force that is between the forward thrust and side force. Different fish swim by undulating different parts of their bodies. Eel-shaped fish undulate their entire body in rhythmic sequences. Streamlined fish, such as salmon, undulate the caudal portions of their bodies. Some fish, such as sharks, use stiff, strong fins to create dynamic lift and propel themselves. It is common for fish to use more than one form of propulsion, although they will display one dominant mode of swimming [...] Gait changes have even been observed in juvenile reef fish of various sizes.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the overall mass of the gun, reciprocating parts of the gun will affect how the shooter perceives recoil. While these parts {{are not part of}} the ejecta, and do not alter the overall momentum of the system, they do involve moving masses during the operation of firing. For example, gas-operated shotguns are widely held to have a [...] "softer" [...] recoil than fixed breech or recoil-operated guns. (Although many semi-automatic recoil and gas-operated guns incorporate recoil buffer systems into the stock that effectively spreads out peak felt recoil forces.) In a gas-operated gun, the bolt is accelerated rearwards by propellant gases during firing, which results in a forward force on the body of the gun. This is countered by a <b>rearward</b> <b>force</b> as the bolt reaches the limit of travel and moves forwards, resulting in a zero sum, but to the shooter, the recoil has been spread out over a longer period of time, resulting in the [...] "softer" [...] feel.|$|E
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} the probable {{cause of this}} accident was {{the disintegration of the}} No. 3 engine fan assembly {{as a result of an}} interaction between the fan blade tips and the fan case. According to the NTSB, [...] "the precise reason or reasons for the acceleration and the onset of the destructive vibration could not be determined conclusively," [...] but enough was learned to prevent the occurrence of similar events. The speed of the engine at the time of the accident caused a resonance wave to occur in the fan assembly when the tips of the fan blades began to make contact with the surrounding shroud. The engine was designed to have a rearward blade retaining force of 18,000 pounds to prevent the blades from moving forward in their mountings slots and subsequently departing the fan disk. The <b>rearward</b> <b>force</b> was not enough. As a result of this accident, GE re-designed the engine so that the blade retaining capability was increased to 60,000 pounds, and that change was incorporated into all engines already in service.|$|E

One of these, the VG 1-5 (Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), used a gas-delayed blowback action based on the Barnitzke system, whereby gas bled from the barrel near the chamber created resistance to the rearward impulse of the operating parts, which ceases when the projectile leaves the muzzle, allowing the operating parts to be <b>forced</b> <b>rearward</b> by the residual pressure of the cartridge case.

50|$|Connected to the {{midpoint}} of the rotating lever is a long metal arm. The motion of the lever causes this arm to be <b>forced</b> <b>rearward,</b> pushing the entire breech mechanism with it.

Continued motion slides the bolt rearward against the spring, while also operating the mechanism that feeds the ammunition belt and readies the next round. When it reaches the end of its motion the spring pushes everything forward again, carrying the new bullet with it and seating it in the barrel before locking again.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the line}} of Dye and Proto matrix, the SLG is not a Matrix {{although}} it does share some characteristics and says Matrix {{on the top of}} the box. It is a sear tripper that uses the [...] "unbalanced" [...] spool-valve design and has a mechanical solenoid unlike pneumatic solenoids used in electropneumatic markers. The SLG's bolt is not a FUSE bolt system either. The bolt is held back by a sear which is tripped by the solenoid when the user pulls the trigger. After firing, when the air in the dump chamber has fired the ball, a small forward face on the bolt which is constantly pressurized with air (at operating pressure from the regulator) provides the <b>rearward</b> <b>force</b> to reset the bolt. This is in contrast to unbalanced electropneumatic spools where this face is drained of pressure by the solenoid to fire. This face has less surface area than rearward faces in contact with dump chamber air, creating an imbalance of force which pushes the bolt closed.|$|E
50|$|The roller-locked recoil {{operation}} {{functions as}} follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in tracks on the bolt head, are pushed outwards into matching {{tracks in the}} barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the bolt in place against the breech. Upon firing, <b>rearward</b> <b>force</b> from the recoil of the cartridge ignition pushes the striker assembly back and allows the rollers to move inwards, back to their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly to recoil, extracting the spent cartridge and ejecting it down. The return spring then pushes the bolt assembly forwards again, pushing a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech, and the sequence repeats {{as long as the}} trigger is depressed. The MG 42 is only capable of fully automatic fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon's rate of fire. The usual training objective {{is to be able to}} fire a burst of no more than three rounds. The weapon features a recoil booster at the muzzle to increase rearwards force due to recoil, therefore improving functional reliability and rate of fire.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} laser optical {{trapping}} and nanometer-level motion analysis {{to investigate the}} cytoskeletal associations and surface dynamics of beta 1 integrin, a cell-substrate adhesion molecule, on the dorsal surfaces of migrating fibroblast cells. A single-beam optical gradient trap (laser tweezers) was used to restrain polystyrene beads conjugated with anti-beta 1 integrin mAbs and place them at desired locations on the cell exterior. This technique was used to demonstrate a spatial difference in integrin-cytoskeleton interactions in migrating cells. We found a distinct increase in the stable attachment of beads, and subsequent rearward flow, on the lamellipodia of locomoting cells compared with the retracting portions. Complementary to the enhanced linkage of integrin at the cell lamellipodium, the membrane was more deformable at the rear versus the front of moving cells while nonmotile cells did not exhibit this asymmetry in membrane architecture. Video microscopy and nanometer-precision tracking routines were used to study the surface dynamics of integrin on the lamellipodia of migrating cells by monitoring the displacements of colloidal gold particles coated with anti-beta 1 integrin mAbs. Small gold aggregates were rapidly transported preferentially to {{the leading edge of}} the lamellipod where they resumed diffusion restricted along the edge. This fast transport was characterized by brief periods of directed movement ("jumps") having an instantaneous velocity of 37 +/- 15 microns/min (SD), separated by periods of diffusion. In contrast, larger aggregates of gold particles and the large latex beads underwent slow, steady rearward movement (0. 85 +/- 0. 44 micron/min) (SD) at a rate similar to that reported for other capping events and for migration of these cells. Cell lines containing mutated beta 1 integrins were used to show that the cytoplasmic domain is essential for an asymmetry in attachment of integrin to the underlying cytoskeletal network and is also necessary for rapid, intermittent transport. However, enhanced membrane deformability at the cell rear does not require integrin-cytoskeletal interactions. We also demonstrated that posttranslational modifications of integrin could potentially play a role in these phenomena. These results suggest a scheme for the role of dynamic integrin-mediated adhesive interactions in cell migration. Integrins are transported preferentially to the cell front where they form nascent adhesions. These adhesive structures grow in size and associate with the cytoskeleton that exerts a <b>rearward</b> <b>force</b> on them. Dorsal aggregates more rearward while those on the ventral side remain fixed to the substrate allowing the cell body to move forward. Detachment of the cell rear occurs by at least two modes: (a) weakened integrin- cytoskeleton interactions, potentially mediated by local modifications of linkage proteins, which lead to weakened cell-substratum interactions and (b) ripping of integrins and the highly deformable membrane from the cell body...|$|E

The angular deflection is small and has {{little effect on the}} lift. However, there is an increase in the drag equal to the product of the lift force and the angle through which it is deflected. Since the deflection is itself a function of the lift, the additional drag is proportional to the square of the lift.|$|R

40|$|AbstractProper {{functioning}} of the innate immune response depends on migration of circulating neutrophils into tissues at sites of infection and inflammation. Migration of highly motile, amoeboid cells such as neutrophils has significant physiological relevance, yet the traction forces that drive neutrophil motion in response to chemical cues are not well characterized. To better {{understand the relationship between}} chemotactic signals and the organization of forces in motile neutrophils, force measurements were made on hydrogel surfaces under well-defined chemotactic gradients created with a microfluidic device. Two parameters, the mean chemoattractant concentration (CM) and the gradient magnitude (Δc/Δx) were varied. Cells experiencing a large gradient with CM near the chemotactic receptor KD displayed strong punctate centers of uropodial contractile force and strong directional motion on stiff (12  kPa) surfaces. Under conditions of ideal chemotaxis—cells in strong gradients with mean chemoattractant near the receptor KD and on stiffer substrates—there is a correlation between the magnitude of force generation and directional motion as measured by the chemotactic index. However, on soft materials or under weaker chemotactic conditions, directional motion is uncorrelated with the magnitude of traction force. Inhibition of either β 2 integrins or Rho-associated kinase, a kinase downstream from RhoA, greatly reduced <b>rearward</b> traction <b>forces</b> and directional motion, although some vestigial lamellipodium-driven motility remained. In summary, neutrophils display a diverse repertoire of methods for organizing their internal machinery to generate directional motion...|$|R
50|$|Garand's {{original}} {{design for the}} M1 used a complicated gas system involving a special muzzle extension gas trap, later dropped {{in favor of a}} simpler drilled gas port. Because most of the older rifles were retrofitted, pre-1939 gas-trap M1s are very rare today and are prized collector's items. In both systems, expanding gases from a fired cartridge are diverted into the gas cylinder. Here, the gases meet a long-stroke piston attached to the operating rod, which is pushed <b>rearward</b> by the <b>force</b> of this high-pressure gas. Then, the operating rod engages a rotating bolt inside the receiver. The bolt is attached to the receiver via two locking lugs, which rotate, unlock, and initiate the ejection of the spent cartridge and the reloading cycle when the rifle is discharged. The operating rod (and subsequently the bolt) then returns to its original position.|$|R

40|$|Motility is a {{fundamental}} part of cellular life and survival, including for Plasmodium parasites [...] single-celled protozoan pathogens responsible for human malaria. The motile life cycle forms achieve motility, called gliding, via the activity of an internal actomyosin motor. Although gliding {{is based on the}} well-studied system of actin and myosin, its core biomechanics are not completely understood. Currently accepted models suggest it results from a specifically organized cellular motor that produces a <b>rearward</b> directional <b>force.</b> When linked to surface-bound adhesins, this force is passaged to the cell posterior, propelling the parasite forwards. Gliding motility is observed in all three life cycle stages of Plasmodium: sporozoites, merozoites and ookinetes. However, it is only the ookinetes [...] formed inside the midgut of infected mosquitoes [...] that display continuous gliding without the necessity of host cell entry. This makes them ideal candidates for invasion-free biomechanical analysis. Here we apply a plate-based imaging approach to study ookinete motion in three-dimensional (3 D) space to understand Plasmodium cell motility and how movement facilitates midgut colonization. Using single-cell tracking and numerical analysis of parasite motion in 3 D, our analysis demonstrates that ookinetes move with a conserved left-handed helical trajectory. Investigation of cell morphology suggests this trajectory may be based on the ookinete subpellicular cytoskeleton, with complementary whole and subcellular electron microscopy showing that, like their motion paths, ookinetes share a conserved left-handed corkscrew shape and underlying twisted microtubular architecture. Through comparisons of 3 D movement between wild-type ookinetes and a cytoskeleton-knockout mutant we demonstrate that perturbation of cell shape changes motion from helical to broadly linear. Therefore, while the precise linkages between cellular architecture and actomyosin motor organization remain unknown, our analysis suggests that the molecular basis of cell shape may, in addition to motor force, be a key adaptive strategy for malaria parasite dissemination and, as such, transmission...|$|R

40|$|Fish keratocytes can {{generate}} <b>rearward</b> directed traction <b>forces</b> within front {{portions of the}} lamellipodium, suggesting that a retrograde flow of actin may also occur here {{but this was not}} detected by previous photoactivation experiments. To investigate the relationship between retrograde flow and traction force generation, we have transfected keratocytes with GFP-actin and used fluorescent speckle microscopy, to observe speckle flow. We detected a retrograde flow of actin within the leading lamellipodium that is inversely proportional to both protrusion rate and cell speed. To observe the effect of reducing contractility, we treated transfected cells with ML 7, a potent inhibitor of myosin II. Surprisingly, ML 7 treatment led to an increase in retrograde flow rate, together with a decrease in protrusion and cell speed, but only in rapidly moving cells. In slower moving cells, retrograde flow decreased, whereas protrusion rate and cell speed increased. These results suggest that there are two mechanisms for producing retrograde flow. One involves slippage between the cytoskeleton and adhesions, that decreases traction force production. The other involves slippage between adhesions and the substratum, which increases traction force production. We conclude that a biphasic relationship exists between retrograde actin flow and adhesiveness in moving keratocytes...|$|R
