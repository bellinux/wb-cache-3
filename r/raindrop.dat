5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a <b>raindrop</b> hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|When a <b>raindrop</b> {{hits the}} {{interior}} of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5000|$|Consider <b>raindrops</b> {{falling on}} a rooftop. The rooftop is the region , while the <b>raindrops</b> can be {{considered}} the hits of our system. It {{is reasonable to assume}} that the number of <b>raindrops</b> that fall in any particular region of the rooftop follows a poisson distribution. The Poisson Scatter Theorem, states that if one was to subdivide the rooftops into k disjoint sub-regions, then the number of <b>raindrops</b> that hits a particular region [...] with intensity [...] of the rooftop is independent from the number of <b>raindrops</b> that hit any other subregion. Suppose that 2000 <b>raindrops</b> fall in 1000 subregions of the rooftop, randomly. The expected number of <b>raindrops</b> per subregion would be 2. So the distribution of the number of <b>raindrops</b> on the whole rooftop is Poisson with intensity parameter 2. The distribution of the number of <b>raindrops</b> falling on 1/5 of the rooftop is Poisson with intensity parameter 2/5.|$|R

30|$|In summary, the one-moment bulk scheme {{creates a}} larger amount of precipitation, because the {{saturation}} adjustment was {{adopted in the}} one-moment bulk scheme, and <b>raindrops</b> are subsequently produced by the fast conversion from cloud to <b>raindrops.</b> This results in earlier onset and larger amounts of surface precipitation. The evaporative cooling by <b>raindrops,</b> which occurs actively below the cloud, stabilized the boundary layer in the one-moment bulk scheme.|$|R
5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled <b>raindrop</b> roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, <b>raindrop</b> impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRecent studies of underwater sound produced by <b>raindrops</b> have identified trapped bubbles as the principle sound source. Two mechanisms have been described, one for small drops (Type I) {{and one for}} large drops (Type II). A study of sound produced by large <b>raindrops</b> (Jacobus, 1991) showed that the underwater sound radiated by the <b>raindrops</b> is 45 % less in salt water (salinity, 35 ppt) than in fresh water. The same studies also showed that bubbles radiate more energy as {{the magnitude of the}} temperature difference between the drop and surface increases. These findings are examined in more detail using the pressure decay curve of both large and small <b>raindrops.</b> Using small <b>raindrops</b> it is shown that bubbles in salt water have a larger damping constant and smaller initial peak pressures than bubbles in fresh water. Reviewing data from Jacobus (1991) for large <b>raindrops,</b> increasing the absolute temperature difference between the drop and bubble showed little effect on the damping constant, but did increase peak pressure. Since the sound energy radiated by a bubble is directly proportional to the peak pressure squared and inversely proportional to the damping constant, the energy radiated by bubbles from <b>raindrops</b> increases with absolute temperature difference and decreases with salinity.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyzed}} a mechanism of soil erosion by <b>raindrops.</b> Recent experimental {{studies have shown}} that in addition to the soil moved downslope by flowing surface water, some soil is carried downslope by the splash from <b>raindrops.</b> When falling <b>raindrops</b> strike either the soil surface or a thin film of water covering the surface, soil and water particle are splashed into the air. If the <b>raindrops</b> fall vertically to the surface of a hillside they tend to strike glancing blows and the splashed soil is mostly thrown down hill. Another cause for the splash moving soil toward the base of the hill is that the particles moving downslope travel greater horizontal distances than those directed upslope...|$|R

25|$|These roundabouts do {{not form}} a {{complete}} circle {{and have a}} <b>raindrop</b> or teardrop shape. They appear at U.S. Interstate interchanges to provide a free-flowing left turn to the on-ramps and {{eliminating the need for}} turn signals and lanes. Since the entry and exit slip roads are one-way, a complete circle is unnecessary. This means that drivers entering the roundabout from the bridge do not need to give way, and that prevents queuing on narrow, two-lane bridges. These roundabouts have been used at dumbbell roundabout junctions, replacing traffic signals that are inefficient without a turning lane. Several junctions along Interstate 70 near Avon, Colorado use teardrop roundabouts.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the exact shape of falling <b>raindrops</b> {{is essential for the}} retrieval of rainfall rate from measurements with polarimetric weather radar. Polarimetric radar parameters depend only on the drop shape. Despite the large number of studies performed in the past, no common parameterisation of the shape of falling <b>raindrops</b> is available yet. Equilibrium shapes have been determined by Pruppacher and Pitter (1971) or Beard et al. (1989). However, falling <b>raindrops</b> tend to oscillate, rotate, and tumble. All those motions affect the polarimetric radar parameters like differential reflectivity (ZDR) or differential propagation phase (KDP). Both parameters are commonly used to provide a better estimation of rainfall rate, than it would be possible with a classical Z-R relation. In the present study a simple oscillation model and canting angle model are used to simulate <b>raindrops</b> with various shapes. The scattering amplitudes at C-band frequencies are estimated and are recursively used to estimate an apparent drop shape of falling <b>raindrops.</b> Besides reflectivity weighting of different oscillation modes, this approach also considers deviations from Rayleigh scattering. The latter is relevant at C-band frequencies for <b>raindrops</b> with axis dimensions larger than about 3 mm. The apparent drop shape is also compared to polarimetric radar measurements...|$|R

500|$|Rain {{forms in}} a cumulus cloud via a process {{involving}} two non-discrete stages. The first stage occurs after the droplets coalesce onto the various nuclei. Langmuir writes that surface {{tension in the}} water droplets provides a slightly higher pressure on the droplet, raising the vapor pressure by a small amount. The increased pressure results in those droplets evaporating and the resulting water vapor condensing on the larger droplets. Due to the extremely small size of the evaporating water droplets, this process becomes largely meaningless after the larger droplets have grown to around 20to 30micrometres, and the second stage takes over. In the accretion phase, the <b>raindrop</b> begins to fall, and other droplets collide and combine with it to {{increase the size of}} the <b>raindrop.</b> Langmuir was able to develop a formula, with [...] being the time to infinite radius, [...] being the viscosity of air, [...] being the fractional percentage of water droplets accreted per unit volume of air that the drop falls through, [...] being the concentration of water in the cloud in grams per cubic meter, and [...] being the initial radius of the droplet. which predicted that the droplet radius would grow unboundedly within a discrete time period.|$|E
