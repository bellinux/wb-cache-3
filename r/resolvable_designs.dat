The resolvability of combinatorial designs is intensively investigated because of its applications. This research focuses on <b>resolvable</b> <b>designs</b> with an additional property - they have resolutions which are mutually orthogonal. Such designs are called doubly resolvable. Their specific properties {{can be used in}} statistical and cryptographic applications. Therefore the classification of doubly <b>resolvable</b> <b>designs</b> and their sets of mutually orthogonal resolutions might be very important. We develop a method for classification of doubly <b>resolvable</b> <b>designs.</b> Using this method and extending it with some theoretical restrictions we succeed in obtaining a classification of doubly <b>resolvable</b> <b>designs</b> with small parameters. Also we classify 1 -parallelisms and 2 -parallelisms of PG(5, 2) with automorphisms of order 31 and find the first known transitive 2 -parallelisms among them.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} the traitor tracing problem. We study c-frameproof codes and c-traceability schemes. We derive lower bounds on {{the maximum number of}} codewords in a class of frameproof codes and traceability schemes, and give constructions for both with more codewords than the best known. We propose a new kind of traitor tracing scheme, called sequential traitor tracing, that can efficiently identify all traitors and requires small real-time computation. We analyse the scheme and give constructions. We obtain the convergence time of these schemes and compare it with the convergence time of the known dynamic schemes. We study unconditionally secure asymmetric and anonymous traceability schemes. In asymmetric schemes the merchant, who embeds the fingerprint, is not trusted. The merchant may attempt to 2 ̆ 7 frame 2 ̆ 7 a buyer by embedding the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s codeword in a second copy of the object. We introduce a third party called the 2 ̆ 7 arbiter 2 ̆ 7 who is trusted and can arbitrate between the buyer and the merchant when a dispute occurs. We propose a construction and prove its security. In anonymous traceability the buyer only provides his pseudo-identity to the merchant. The model uses two subsystems: an authentication code with arbiter (A 3 -code) and an asymmetric traceability with unconditional security. We analyse security of the system and show that security parameters of the system can be described in terms of those of the two subsystems. We give an example construction for the model. We propose q-ary fingerprinting for stored digital objects, such as images, videos and audio clips, where the bit representation of the object may change due to various compression and processing methods. We construct codes that allow correct recovery of the fingerprint when part of the fingerprint is corrupted or removed. In the appendix chapter, we give new results on asymmetric authentication codes: A 2 -codes, A 3 -codes, respectively. We derive information-theoretic lower bounds on success probability of various attacks on A 2 -code and A 3 -code, and give combinatorial structure of ℓ-optimal A 2 -codes and A 3 -codes.
