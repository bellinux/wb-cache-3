50|$|The Rhenish Railway Company {{expected}} a high {{volume of traffic}} and planned to operate five ferries. It would have five ramps for ferry pontoons with passenger carriages and freight wagons crossing independently between two wire ropes over the Rhine. In fact, however, only four ferries were placed in service. The tracks were laid on ramps with a slope of 1 in 48 down to the marshalling yards on both banks of the river. The major basins were dredged to keep the moorings clear.Five pontoons for the transport of wagons were ordered from Cologne Maschinenbau AG (a subsidiary of the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company) in Cologne-Bayenthal. The 47 metre-long pontoons, Ruhr, Lahn and Mosel could carry eight freight wagons cars or five carriages. The fourth pontoon, the 63 metre-long Rhein carried ten freight wagons or seven carriages. The fifth pontoon, Eisponte carried five wagons. A 30 horsepower steam engine was installed {{at each end of}} the ferry route, which hauled a cable across the Rhine, connected via a 2.5 metre-long pulley to each pontoon. The wagons ran over a mobile pier on to the pontoon or off it on the other shore. The pontoons ran on a 65 mm-thick <b>rope</b> <b>guide</b> cable over the river. A second cable was used to tow; it was hauled by the pontoon steam engine by means of two pulleys.|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a damping and positioning device for the active damping of the swinging motion of loads suspended from cranes, said device comprising <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> running between the crane and the load to dampen the swinging motion of the load. The proposal according to the invention is to provide at least two <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> (6 a, 6 h) for each swinging motion plane, and to arrange <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> drums (5) on the crane attached to a frame (3, 14) suspended from the latter. The <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> (6 a, 6 h) are loaded by a tensile force which acts constantly against the swinging motion of the load. The tensile force is produced by a drive unit whose driving force is controlled independently {{of the speed of}} the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> drum. The length of the <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> (6 a, 6 h) is independent of each other and is variable while the crane is in operation...|$|R
50|$|Some shafts {{do not use}} guide beams {{but instead}} utilize steel wire <b>rope</b> (called <b>Guide</b> <b>ropes)</b> kept in tension by massive weights at shaft bottom called cheese weights (because of their {{resemblance}} to a truckle or wheel of cheese) as these are easier to maintain and replace.|$|R

50|$|Harau Canyon {{is called}} as Indonesian Yosemite. There are 4 waterfalls here with height among 50-90 meters. The cliffs are around 80 to 300 meters and (<b>rope)</b> {{climbing}} <b>guides</b> are available.|$|R
50|$|A solar Montgolfiere will sink at night, {{and will}} have a <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> {{attached}} {{to the bottom of}} the gondola that will curl up on the ground and anchor the balloon during the darkness hours. The <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> will be made of low friction materials to keep it from catching or tangling on ground features.|$|R

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the Funifor system is its stability in high wind conditions owingto the horizontal distance between the two <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> comprising each track.|$|R
50|$|In British {{mountain}} rescue terminology, a barrow boy is {{the person}} who guides a stretcher during a crag (steep rugged mass of rock) rescue. Conventionally there are two barrow boys, one at each end of a horizontal stretcher (though it may be vertical) which may contain a casualty. The barrow boys may operate on fixed or moving <b>ropes,</b> and <b>guide</b> the progress of the stretcher to safer ground.|$|R
5000|$|Gimme a Hand: Teams {{have to walk}} on {{a tightrope}} {{suspended}} high above ground, from one nine-story building to another at Prosek Point in Prague. Players try to advance on the tightropes in pairs, with their hips and ankles attached to their partner, and have to use overhead <b>ropes</b> to <b>guide</b> them on the tightropes. The team with the most players advancing from building to building in the fastest time wins.|$|R
50|$|In January 1868 an {{extraction}} cage detached {{and damaged}} the <b>guide</b> <b>ropes,</b> {{which led to}} a two-week layoff for the miners. On 24 January 1868, the mine suffered a firedamp explosion that left eight dead and damaged 250 m of its structural timbers.|$|R
25|$|Releasable abseil - Used by some guides with inexperienced abseilers. A rope {{is set up}} by {{anchoring}} it with a munter hitch and locking off the non-rappelling {{strand of}} the rope. The client descends on the non-locked strand of the <b>rope.</b> The <b>guide</b> unlocks the other strand and lowers the client or the rappeller if the client gets into trouble. Useful with an inexperienced rappeller or when the rappeller gets into trouble, for example, by getting {{a piece of clothing}} or hair entangled in the descender.|$|R
50|$|In 1868 the Moggill Methodist Church {{was built}} {{at the corner of}} Moggill Road and Kangaroo Gully Road. Originally it was it had neither lining or ceiling, and had a shingle roof and cedar window frames. The church remains {{on the grounds of the}} Moggill Uniting Church.In 1877 Moggill and the Moggill {{residents}} were described thus in The Queensland Times newspaper:"The Moggill farmers are a well-to-do class, not with standing the fact that their holdings are comparatively small, and they are dependent entirely on agricultural pursuits, there being no outside country to be made use of for the running of cattle. The land is, for the most part, composed of rich alluvial deposits, and its quality is such that it is very hard to exhaust it. There are parts of the district where the soil is patchy, and there are places where it is rather difficult to cultivate, but these disadvantages are more than counterbalanced by the richness of the remaining portions, from which crops of more than average yield are taken each successive season."The Moggill punt (ferry) was important as a means of transport across the Brisbane River. In 1884 the ferry sank and was eventually replaced with a hand pulled, <b>rope</b> <b>guided</b> ferry.|$|R
40|$|The modern way of {{producing}} tomatoes involves a high wire system with metal hooks, holding a <b>rope</b> that <b>guides</b> the growing tomato plant. Each rope {{is to be}} lowered periodically. The standard working technique requires one-handed lifting of the hook. This is generally experienced to be physically very heavy. An alternative hook, the Tomahaôk, claims a strong reduction of the physical load, because lifting is eliminated. The present research aimed to investigate the load reduction claim in practice, and to eventually indicate further improvements of this new hook...|$|R
50|$|A {{rescue team}} entered {{the main shaft}} but damage meant the winding gear could only reach 295 yards down. John Harris climbed down <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> and rescued several men. After several hours in the pit the rescue team was {{withdrawn}} over concerns of further explosions. In all, some 90 colliers were saved.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of bridges, tidal ferries provided the only means to cross the river. Tides propelled the ferries along <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> anchored on both sides. However, the ferries were unable to operate during bad weather, and travelers could be stranded on each side. Replacing the ferries with bridges would be a major advance in transportation.|$|R
5000|$|Tim & Anh Đức {{were further}} assed an {{additional}} 30-minute penalty because Tim held onto the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> during the Roadblock, which was explicitly prohibited in the clue. Their 45-minute penalty {{caused them to}} fell to last place; however, they were notified the Leg was non-elimination, and their 45-minute penalty would instead be assessed {{at the start of}} the next Leg.|$|R
50|$|Another {{commercial}} bungee jump {{currently in}} operation is just 13m smaller, at 220 m. This jump, made without <b>guide</b> <b>ropes,</b> {{is from the}} top of the Verzasca Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. It appears in the opening scene of the James Bond film GoldenEye. The Bloukrans Bridge Bungy in South Africa and the Verzasca Dam jumps are pure freefall swinging bungee from a single cord.|$|R
50|$|As Rob helps Doug descend, a {{blizzard}} strikes {{the mountain and}} Doug's oxygen bottle runs out, causing him to suffer hypoxia. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously unclips himself from the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.|$|R
50|$|They {{are made}} of silk, are {{rectangular}} and hang from a cross member, from which <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> are held by those carrying it. Traditionally banners were draped in black cloth when {{there had been a}} death in the pit during the previous year. More recently following the closure of pits across the county they are draped with black cloth on significant anniversaries of disasters at the colliery they represent.|$|R
5000|$|Lube Me Up: Players run {{and slide}} down a {{slippery}} course, {{and have to}} advance oversize balls up the slope, while using <b>ropes</b> to <b>guide</b> them, and break a plane halfway {{toward the top of}} the course. The challenge is played in multiple rounds, alternating between male and female. In each round, there is one fewer ball than there are players. If a player does not advance a ball toward the goal {{at the end of the}} round, that player, along with their partner, is eliminated from remainder of the challenge. The process continues until the player who advances the last ball up the slope wins the challenge for their team, while the team who's eliminated first is automatically sent to [...] "The Dome." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{similar but}} even more {{dangerous}} tradition of non-violent bull-leaping, recortes, is practiced {{in some parts of}} Spain. Athletes, known as recortadores, compete at dodging and leaping over bulls without the use of the cape or sword. Some recortadores use a long pole to literally pole-vault over the charging animal, which is both larger than the type used in the French sport, and unrestrained by any <b>guiding</b> <b>rope</b> or similar safety device.|$|R
50|$|Chariots: Each warrior {{sits in a}} chariot {{that they}} must move forward by pulling on a <b>guide</b> <b>rope,</b> and tug {{themselves}} over the bumps that block an otherwise speedy path. They must collect the pieces of tube along the way that, when constructed, allows them to unhook a jewel bag strung high overhead. Failure to do retrieve a jewel and {{make it back to}} the start within the time limit will end the warrior's quest.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, Cousteau and Dumas {{dove into}} the Fountain of Vaucluse, a mysterious spring {{in the village of}} Vaucluse, hoping to {{discover}} the secret of its yearly flooding. Maurice Fargues was the operation's surface commander, in charge of the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> which allowed Cousteau and Dumas to communicate with the surface. When Cousteau and Dumas became affected by carbon monoxide in their air cylinders, Fargues saved their lives by pulling them back up to the surface.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church has}} {{a ring of}} eight bells, with the tenor bell {{weighing}} 15½ hundredweight (787 kilos). [...] In 1765 there were four bells, increased to six in 1767, and to the present eight in 1882. Unusually for Cumbria, they are rung from the ground floor, and consequently have a elaborate system of <b>rope</b> <b>guides.</b> Ringing can be easily observed by the public through the glass partition windows. The first full peal on the bells was 5,040 changes of Grandsire Triples on 17 December 1895 and was conducted by Stephen Hogarth. There is a remarkable set of the ringers rules dating from 1826, which is displayed in a large frame in the ringing chamber; they were penned by the English master from St Bees School. Outside in the graveyard several of the bell ringers are buried together in their own area. The church has Tudor consecration crosses, both inside and out. It is unique in having a complete surviving set of twelve exterior crosses. Nine interior crosses remain; the other three {{are thought to have}} been inadvertently destroyed during 19th century attempts at restoration. According to Wilson and Kaye the existence of the crosses shows that the church was consecrated [...] "to the 'English use' (secundum consuetudinem)" [...] and not according to Roman Catholic rite. In a 1960s guide John Betjeman drew attention to some of the above and to the finely carved 14th century font, a number of 15th century effigies, the reredos by the Keswick School of Industrial Art and the altar draped with a banner bearing the Greek motto [...] "εν τούτῳ νίκα", meaning [...] "in this sign you will conquer", a motto adopted by Constantine the Great and by the Knights Templar. [...] The reredos incorporates three repoussé panels by Edith Rawnsley and John Birkett, who were also responsible for the hanging lights, the mosaics and the pulpit.|$|R

60|$|Bickley nodded, and {{suggested}} that we should go on deck {{to see what was}} happening. So we went. Not a breath of wind was stirring, and even the sea seemed to be settling down a little. At least, so we judged from the motion, for we could not see either it or the sky; everything was as black as pitch. We heard the sailors, however, engaged in rigging <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> fore and aft, and battening down the hatches with extra tarpaulins by the light of lanterns. Also they were putting ropes round the boats and doing something to the spars and topmasts.|$|R
50|$|At an {{ascension}} on 1 September 1858, he {{experimented with}} the use of a drag <b>rope</b> as a <b>guide.</b> In starting, he allowed 75 pounds of rope to trail along the ground. As the balloon gradually became heated by the sun, its buoyant power was increased without discharging ballast, and by the time five miles had been traversed the rope was lifted from the ground, and it continued to be lifted until a height of two miles had been reached. After a passage of nearly thirty miles, the drag rope was detached, and he continued a similar distance farther.|$|R
50|$|A funifor {{is a type}} of {{aerial lift}} or aerial tramway {{patented}} by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group which consists of two <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> and a haul rope loop per cabin.The drives of the two cabins are not interconnected with two reversible cabins running on parallel tracks. At the top of each track, the haul rope for that track loops back to the bottom instead of looping over to serve the other track as occurs with a normal aerial tramway. In other words, a funifor's propulsion is not returned to the opposite direction for use by the other vehicle.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{compared the}} accuracy of spatial updating of targets in front with that of targets behind. The participant viewed a target on the ground several meters away and then, without vision, sidestepped along a <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> while trying to mentally update {{the location of the}} target. On some trials, the target location was in front as the person sidestepped and, on other trials, the target location was behind. Participants responded by facing the updated target location with eyes closed. The results indicate that people are able to update target locations behind them very nearly as well as target locations in front...|$|R

50|$|Worried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to {{cooperate}} to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning {{to complete the}} ascent and turn around by 2 pm, the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> are not installed on {{upper reaches of the}} climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about over-exertion.|$|R
5000|$|Survey usually {{involves}} walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, {{the area to}} be surveyed is staked {{into a series of}} square or rectangular survey [...] "grids" [...] (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or marked <b>ropes</b> as a <b>guide</b> when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Early surveys recorded readings by hand, but computer controlled data logging and storage are now the norm.|$|R
