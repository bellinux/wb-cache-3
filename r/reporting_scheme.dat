There are many location management schemes, Location Areas and Reporting Centers are two classical and popular location management schemes. To the best of our knowledge, no performance comparison between Reporting Centers and Location Areas has been reported in the literature. The paper compares the performance of the Location Areas <b>scheme</b> and the <b>Reporting</b> Centers <b>scheme.</b> The motivation for the study is that the location areas can be derived from a given set of reporting centers such that the location update cost difference between the <b>Reporting</b> Centers <b>scheme</b> and the Location Areas scheme is small whereas the paging cost in the <b>Reporting</b> Centers <b>scheme</b> is larger than that in the Location Areas scheme. Given a set of reporting centers, this paper shows how to derive the location areas from the reporting centers, and compares the performance of Location Areas and <b>Reporting</b> Centers <b>schemes</b> under various mobility models and incoming call arrival rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a {{collection}} of many nodes with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. Although there are many algorithms and protocols the major issue is with routing and total energy consumption. In our paper we proposed a hybrid data collecting scheme that dynamically shifts between time driven and event driven data collecting method. Due to time driven data <b>reporting</b> <b>scheme</b> data accuracy will be high and because of event data <b>reporting</b> <b>scheme</b> longer lifetime of the network can be achieved. In our paper we combined both collection schemes so that the accuracy of the data and the network lifetime is increased. The Parameter based Event Detection algorithm is used here for the switching between the data collecting schemes. Data is send to the observer, only when the temperature approaches the fixed threshold value and here the energy is consumed, otherwise the transmission remains ideal and the energy is not all used. Because of this energy saving the lifetime of the network is protracted...|$|E

40|$|We <b>report</b> an imaging <b>scheme,</b> termed aperture-scanning Fourier ptychography, for 3 D {{refocusing}} and super-resolution macroscopic imaging. The <b>reported</b> <b>scheme</b> scans an aperture at the Fourier {{plane of}} an optical system and acquires the corresponding intensity {{images of the}} object. The acquired images are then synthesized in the frequency domain to recover a high-resolution complex sample wavefront; no phase information is needed in the recovery process. We demonstrate two applications of the <b>reported</b> <b>scheme.</b> In the first example, we use an aperture-scanning Fourier ptychography platform to recover the complex hologram of extended objects. The recovered hologram is then digitally propagated into different planes along the optical axis to examine the 3 D structure of the object. We also demonstrate a reconstruction resolution better than the detector pixel limit (i. e., pixel super-resolution). In the second example, we develop a camera-scanning Fourier ptychography platform for super-resolution macroscopic imaging. By simply scanning the camera over different positions, we bypass the diffraction limit of the photographic lens and recover a super-resolution image of an object placed at the far field. This platform’s maximum achievable resolution is ultimately determined by the camera’s traveling range, not the aperture size of the lens. The FP <b>scheme</b> <b>reported</b> in this work may find applications in 3 D object tracking, synthetic aperture imaging, remote sensing, and optical/electron/X-ray microscopy...|$|R

40|$|Chief pharmacists in 209 {{hospitals}} were surveyed about ADR <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes,</b> the priority given to ADR reporting, and attitudes towards ADR reporting. ADR reporting had a low managerial priority. Local <b>reporting</b> <b>schemes</b> {{were found to}} be operating in 37 % trusts, but there were few plans to start new schemes. Few problems were discovered by the introduction of pharmacist ADR reporting. Chief pharmacists had concerns about the competence of hospital pharmacists to detect ADRs and were in favour of increased training. Lack of time on wards, and recruitment difficulties were suggested as reasons for hospital pharmacist under-reporting. Teaching hospitals appeared to have an increased interest in ADR reporting. A retrospective analysis of reporting trends within the West Midlands region from 1994, showed increasing or stable reporting rates for most sectors of reporters, except for general practitioners (GPs). The West Midlands region maintained higher ADR reporting rates {{than the rest of the}} UK. National reporting figures showed a worrying decline in ADR reports from healthcare professionals. Variation was found in the ADR reporting rates of Acute NHS Hospital Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in the West Midlands region, including correlations with prescribing rates and other PCT characteristics. Qualitative research into attitudes of GPs towards the Yellow Card scheme was undertaken. A series of qualitative interviews with GPs discovered barriers and positive motivators for their involvement in the Yellow Card scheme. A grounded theory of GP involvement in the Yellow Card scheme was developed to explain GP behaviour, and which could be used to inform potential solutions to halt declining rates of reporting.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of medication errors {{in a major}} teaching hospital was investigated using several methodologies. The existing ward stock drug distribution system was assessed and a new system designed based on a novel use of failure mode and effects analysis. The existing system was compared to the new unit supply individual patient dispensing system on two wards in terms of medication errors, nursing time, pharmacy time, drug costs, drug security and nurses' opinion. A review of a one year sample of reports submitted under the existing incident <b>reporting</b> <b>scheme</b> was also undertaken. Errors were categorised according to drug group, error type, reason cited for the error, and probability ranking (probability of occurrence, detection and harm). In addition, a "no-blame" medication error <b>reporting</b> <b>scheme</b> was implemented and assessed. Results of the study showed that in the newly designed individual patient dispensing system there was a reduction in nursing time associated with medication activities of approximately 29 %, an increase in pharmacy staff time of 64 %, a reduction in drug costs {{and an increase in}} drug security. Using the disguised observer methodology a reduction in medication errors by 23. 5 % (including timing errors) and 7. 3 % (excluding timing errors) was seen on Ward A. Similarly a reduction of 21. 1 % (including timing errors) and 9. 8 % (excluding timing errors) was observed on Ward B. Significant support for the individual patient dispensing system was given by nursing staff. Of the errors self-reported under the existing incident/accident <b>reporting</b> <b>scheme</b> {{the most common type of}} error was omissions (32. 2 %), the most common drug group was cardiovascular drugs (19. 8 %), and the most common cause of the error cited was a faulty check (42. 3 %).
