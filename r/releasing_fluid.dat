40|$|Anyone working, playing, or exercising {{in a cold}} {{environment}} {{runs the}} risk of dehydration. The amount of fluid lost can add up to 8 % of his/her body mass. This loss is due to several factors, which include the amount of fluid consumed, fluid lost through respiration, and fluid lost as sweat. Exposure to cold also stimulates diuresis, or urination, which further increases losses of body fluid. One of the reasons for this increase in urination is the prompting action of the hormone atrial natiuretic peptide, or ANP. When exposed to cold, the body will constrict blood vessels under the skin of the lower arms and legs in order to prevent too much heat being lost from the body. This action, termed peripheral vasoconstriction, moves blood to the core of the body. The increase in central blood volume does two things to the body. First, it increases the volume of blood entering the heart and the amount the heart stretches during contraction. The stretch, particularly of the atria chamber of the heart, stimulates the release of ANP. Second, the increase in central fluid volume and release of ANP signal the kidneys that there is too much fluid and that this condition needs to be corrected. This leads to the kidneys <b>releasing</b> <b>fluid</b> through diuresis. Therefore, due to the body’s belief that it is experiencing an increase in blood volume, the intake of more fluid is not perceived to be necessary, even when fluid is needed. So, people don’t tend to get thirsty when either at rest or when exercising in the cold...|$|E

40|$|Trace element {{systematics}} in convergent margin metamorphic and volcanic rocks {{show that}} subducting slabs <b>release</b> <b>fluids</b> of changing composition {{as a function}} of depth. Volcanic transects across arcs record declines in H 2 O-soluble elements (B, Cs, As, and Sb) with increasing depth that parallel declines with increasing metamorphic grade in “subduction complex” associations. These paired, prograde declines point to decreasing inputs of H 2 O-rich fluids from the subducting slab. Uniform K, Ba, REE and 10 Be levels across arcs suggest that slab-derived fluxes of different compositions persist to greater depths.

40|$|Ultrahigh-pressure (UHP, depths ≳ 100 km) {{eclogite}} {{samples from}} the Dulan area of the North Qaidam Terrane, western China, preserve evidence of <b>fluid</b> <b>release</b> along a prograde pressure-temperature (P-T) path. Eclogite sample D 126 A, Grt + Omp + Qtz + Zo + Amp + Phe + minor Rt + Hem, contains garnet porphyroblasts that preserve strong Ca zoning, recording higher core values (Grs 34), lower inner mantle values (Grs 25), increasing outer mantle values (Grs 28), and lower rim values (Grs 26). Isochemical phase diagrams (pseudosections), assuming H 2 O saturation, produce a P-T path constrained by multiple points. The P-T path begins at 16 kbar, 3 ̆c 400 °C and reaches peak P conditions at 28. 5 kbar, 675 °C. A P reversal on the prograde path is interpreted to represent an episode of exhumation, followed by further subduction (yo-yo subduction), but, the P reversal may also be an artifact of chemical disequilibrium within garnet zones. The P-T path ends at retrograde conditions estimated between 17 - 21 kbar, 611 - 675 °C. Predicted <b>fluid</b> <b>release</b> rates from D 126 A are highly variable along the P-T path.

We would also stress the relationship between the circulating fluids and active tectonic structures, as we detected modifications in some springs that were apparently not located anywhere near the local faults. The tem-poral variations in the geochemical features of the investigated cold waters are related to the local faulting activity that occurs during seismogenesis. The geochemical monitoring that provided information on fault movements during the seismic crisis, is also able to give us information regarding fault-ing activity in its earlier stages...|$|R
40|$|At {{subduction}} zones, oceanic lithosphere {{that has}} interacted with sea water {{is returned to}} the mantle, heats up during descent and <b>releases</b> <b>fluids</b> by devolatilization of hydrous minerals. Models {{for the formation of}} magmas feeding volcanoes above subduction zones require largescale transport of these fluids into overlying mantle wedges(1 - 3). Fluid flow also seems to be linked to seismicity in subducting slabs. However, the spatial and temporal scales of this fluid flow remain largely unknown, with suggested timescales ranging from tens {{to tens of thousands of}} years(3 - 5). Here we use the Li-Ca-Sr isotope systems to consider fluid sources and quantitatively constrain the duration of subduction-zone <b>fluid</b> <b>release</b> at similar to 70 km depth within subducting oceanic lithosphere, now exhumed in the Chinese Tianshan Mountains. Using lithium-diffusion modelling, we find that the wall-rock porosity adjacent to the flowpath of the fluids increased ten times above the background level. We show that <b>fluids</b> <b>released</b> by devolatilization travelled through the slab along major conduits in pulses with durations of about similar to 200 years. Thus, although the overall slab dehydration process is continuous over millions of years and over a wide range of pressures and temperatures, we conclude that the fluids produced by dehydration in subducting slabs are mobilized in short-lived, channelized fluid-flow events...|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of arc subduction is well {{understood to be}} the location where new continental crust is formed and is presumably also the site of subcontinental mantle genesis. Firstly, hydrated oceanic crust slabs begin subducting which <b>releases</b> <b>fluids</b> (subduction zone metamorphism) to the mantle wedge above. Continued subduction of the slab leads to further hydration of the mantle which causes partial melting in the mantle wedge. It is expected then that the modern subcontinental mantle is a former, melt-depleted mantle wedge. If the connection between continental crust and the subcontinental lithospheric mantle does not exist, and rather a different Earth process formed both reservoirs, then it further complicates the mechanisms for how the Archean subcontinental mantle formed.|$|R

Mineral modes of altered oceanic crust as a function of pressure and temperature along a given subduction path can be derived from thermodynamic calculations using the program PerpleX.
