40|$|Roller element {{bearings}} {{provide the}} primary mechanical interface between rotating and nonrotating {{components in the}} high performance turbomachinery of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Knowledge of bearing behavior under various loading and environmental conditions is essential to predicting and understanding the overall behavior of turbopumps, including rotordynamic stability, critical speeds and bearing life. The objective is to develop mathematical models and computer programs to describe the mechanical behavior of ball and cylinder roller bearings under the loading and environmental conditions encountered in the SSME and future high performance rocket engines. This includes characteristics such as nonlinear load/motion relationships, stiffness and damping, rolling element loads for life prediction, and <b>roller</b> <b>and</b> <b>cage</b> stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} two investigations, one to {{determine}} {{the relative merits of}} four experimental and two conventional design 75 -millimeter-bore (size 215) cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearings <b>and</b> one {{to determine the}} relative merits of nodular iron <b>and</b> bronze as <b>cage</b> materials for this size and type of bearing, are presented in this report. Nine test bearings were operated over a range of dn values (product of bearing bore in mm and shaft speed in r. p. m) from 0. 3 x 10 (6) to 2. 3 x 20 (6), radial loads for 7 to 1613 pounds, and oil flows from 2 to 8 pounds per minute with a single-jet circulatory oil feed. Of the six bearings used to evaluate designs, four were experimental types with outer-race-riding <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> inner-race-guided <b>rollers,</b> <b>and</b> two were conventional types, one with outer-race-guided <b>rollers</b> <b>and</b> <b>cage</b> <b>and</b> one with inner-race-guided <b>rollers</b> <b>and</b> <b>cage.</b> Each of these six test bearings was equipped with a different design cage made of nodular iron. The experimental combination of an outer-race-riding cage with a straight-through outer race <b>and</b> inner-race-guided <b>rollers</b> was found to give the best over-all performance based on limiting dn values and bearing temperatures...|$|R

5000|$|Spherical roller thrust {{bearings}} constitute of a shaft washer (for radial bearings often called [...] "inner ring"), a housing washer (for radial bearings often called [...] "outer ring"), asymmetrical <b>rollers</b> <b>and</b> a <b>cage.</b> There are also bearing units available {{that can take}} axial loads in two directions.|$|R
50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} are separable into a cone assembly and a cup. The non-separable cone assembly {{consists of the}} inner ring, the <b>rollers,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>cage</b> that retains & evenly spaces the rollers. The cup is simply the outer ring. Internal clearance is established during mounting by the axial position of the cone relative to the cup, although preloaded installations without clearance are common.|$|R
50|$|Spherical roller {{bearings}} consist of an inner ring with two raceways inclined {{at an angle}} to the bearing axis, an outer ring with a common spherical raceway, spherical <b>rollers,</b> <b>cages</b> <b>and,</b> in certain designs, also internal guide rings or center rings. The bearings can also be sealed.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to know their mechanical properties and their failure mechanism during the impact in order to increased the safety of any vehicle. This thesis focuses on the design of bumper, spring <b>and</b> roll <b>cage</b> for lesser weight and better performance. Also it describes about the stress analysis on a car frontal protection system (bumper) simulations. Research concentrates on composite material. It is considering their function, geometry, and other parameters that influence the compatibility of the bumper <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> In future research, these parts will face the static test and analysis will be done on their load distributions by applying the variation of load and locations. We analyze the basic concepts for improving the safety on the car by doing analysis on the car bumper <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> [...] This analysis was carried out by using ANSYS for structural physics that could simulate static (stationary), dynamic (moving) and thermal (heat transfer) problems to evaluate the behaviour of bumper system <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> <b>cage.</b> Another additional innovative step for improving crashworthiness is the use of material to produces the part to absorb energy during the process of a crash and that part is spring. Here we will use spring on the front side of the vehicle to absorb the energy of sudden impact and this will secure the driver as well as produce less injury to the person outside.

5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating roller screw system. [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating roller screw system, rollers disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression rings, or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between <b>rollers</b> <b>and</b> nut, synchronizing <b>roller</b> rotation <b>and</b> thrusting the <b>rollers</b> into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears <b>and</b> <b>roller</b> <b>cage,</b> cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw shaft diameters.|$|R
30|$|The above models {{calculate}} the thermogenesis {{value of the}} rolling bearing as a whole, {{and they do not}} involve the the surface friction power loss calculation of the inner concrete components of the bearing. Rumbarger, et al. [31], used the established fluid traction torque model to {{calculate the}} friction power loss of the bearing <b>roller,</b> <b>cage,</b> <b>and</b> inner and outer ring raceway respectively. But their model ignored the heating mechanism differences between the local heat sources. Chen, et al. [32], calculated the total thermogenesis of the bearing from the local heat sources with different heating mechanisms. Moorthy and Raja [33] calculated the thermogenesis value of the local heat sources, they also took into consideration the change in the diametral clearance after the assembly and during operation that was attributed to the thermal expansion of the bearing parts, which influenced the gyroscopic and spinning moments contributing to the heat generation. Hannon [34] detailed the existing thermal models for the rolling-element bearing.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Lack of {{kinematics}} {{models and}} imperfection {{of the known}} dynamics models of the roller bearings of railway rolling stock axle-boxes do not allow designing the optimal structure of bearing cages, providing the required service life and reliability of bearing units of wheel sets for cars and locomotives. The studies of kinematics <b>and</b> dynamics of <b>roller</b> bearings of axle boxes for cars and locomotives and modeling of their parts interaction to create the analytical method of bearing cages calculation are necessary. Methodology. This purpose has been achieved due to the modeling of kinematics of the ideal (without gaps) and real (taking account the gaps, manufacturing and installation errors) bearings, substantiation of the transfer mechanism of motion from the rollers to bearing cage, modeling the dynamics of rolling, research of interaction forces of the rollers with bearing cage. Findings. It is established that the kinematics of ideal bearing {{is determined by the}} contact deformations of the <b>rollers</b> <b>and</b> rings, when the kinematics of real bearing depends mainly on the side gaps in the windows of the bearing cage. On the basis of studies of the real bearing kinematics the dynamics models of the <b>rollers</b> <b>and</b> bearing <b>cage</b> interaction were constructed. The conducted studies of kinematics and dynamics of rolling bearings have changed our view of them as of the planetary mechanism, explained the reason of bearing <b>cage</b> loading, <b>and</b> confirmed the possibility of destruction during operation. Originality. It was first proposed a mechanism for motion transfer from the rollers to the bearing cage of roller bearings, consisting in that the side gap in the bearing cage window is reduced gradually multiple of the number of rollers of radial loading area according to the bearing cage motion. The models of roller bearing dynamics, which allow calculating the interaction forces of parts for all modes of operation, were improved. Practical value. Use of the offered models of kinematics and dynamics of the roller bearings will develop analytical calculation method of the bearing cage for the choice of its optimal design according to criterion of maximum service life and reliability of the bearing unit of wheel sets of the railway rolling stock...|$|R
