50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sails {{were invented}} by Stephen Hooper in 1789. As with spring sails, the sail {{is divided into}} a number of bays, each with a number of spars with cloth wound around them. The cloth is {{extended}} or retracted by a rod and lever system, and connected with a shutter bar on each sail. Adjustment of the <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sail can be made without stopping the mill. This type of sail was popular in Yorkshire, although the only remaining mill with <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sails intact is Ballycopeland Windmill in Northern Ireland.|$|R
25|$|The {{anodized}} aluminum deck stepped mast and boom are aluminum type 6351 alloy {{and have}} integral sail slots and non-geared <b>roller</b> <b>reefing.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>Reefing</b> Sails, {{invented in}} 1789 by Stephen Hooper, use a canvas strip wound around a roller {{in the place}} of shutters. The mill {{does not have to be}} stopped in order to adjust the sails.|$|R
50|$|The Illusion is a one-design, single-handed keelboat {{based on}} {{the lines of a}} 12-metre yacht. Its {{features}} include foot pedal steering, genoa <b>roller</b> <b>reefing,</b> full trimming facilities, large buoyancy tanks, and car-top mounting. It was designed by Jo Richards and Neil Graham in 1981.|$|R
50|$|Patent sails {{were invented}} by William Cubitt in 1807. They combine the {{shutters}} {{of the spring}} sail with automatic adjustment of the <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sail. Their construction {{is similar to that}} of the spring sail. Adjustment of patent sails can be made without stopping the mill.|$|R
25|$|Patent Sails, {{invented in}} 1819 by William Cubitt, combine the {{shutters}} of the Spring Sail with the automatic adjustment of the <b>Roller</b> <b>Reefing</b> Sail. Single Patents have shutters on the trailing {{side of the}} sail, Double Patents have shutters {{on both sides of}} the sail for its whole length.|$|R
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>reefing</b> rolls or wraps {{the sail}} around a wire, foil, or spar {{to reduce its}} {{exposure}} to the wind. In mainsail furling systems the sail is either wrapped around the boom by a mechanism in the gooseneck or hardware inside the boom winds it around a rotating foil.|$|R
50|$|The Swan 38 was {{designed}} by Olin Stephens and first launched in 1974. The first 9 hulls were fitted with in <b>boom</b> <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> and later boat with slab reefing with 116 boats built in total. There were two rig plans with one ton and a taller IOR Mk3 version also produced.|$|R
50|$|Furling systems {{controlled}} {{with lines}} {{led to the}} cockpit allow reefing without crew having to go on deck in heavy weather. <b>Roller</b> <b>reefing</b> also allows more variable sail area than conventional or jiffy reefing. Countering these advantages are the furled sail possibly not having an optimal shape and sail repair or replacement being more difficult.|$|R
25|$|Fiery Cross {{had been}} the first tea clipper home in 1861, 1862, 1863 and 1865. As a {{slightly}} older ship, built in 1860, she predated the widespread acceptance of composite construction, so was built of wood. Nevertheless, she was full of the latest technology; for example steel masts and Cunningham's patent <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> topsails and t'gallants.|$|R
50|$|Most serious {{cruising}} boats, {{even if only}} day-cruising, set dedicated cruising sails; {{these are}} constructed differently from racing sails and from heavier but more supple cloth, and are nearly always equipped with a means of reefing. The original design, with the small jib, provided for square gooseneck <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> for the main; modern boats usually prefer slab/jiffy reefing for the main, and some set fully reefable genoas {{by means of a}} headsail reefing drum and associated equipment (including a reefing spar).|$|R
50|$|Holgate tower {{windmill}} {{was built}} in 1770 of brickstones by its first owner and miller George Waud. He, his son and grandson ran the mill until 1851, and a dwelling-house was erected around the same time. The mill was originally fitted with five <b>Roller</b> <b>Reefing</b> sails although these were later replaced by Double Patent sails. In 1841, the mill was described as having three pairs of French Burr millstones, two dressing machines and five Patent sails. A fourth pair of stones had been added by 1858.|$|R
50|$|Jiffy reefing, {{also called}} slab or single line reefing, is an {{alternative}} to conventional or <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> where the sail is folded in sections, or slabs, along the boom. One or two reefing lines reeved through the sail's luff and leach reef cringles create a new tack and clew for the sail by pulling those points tight to the boom. These can be led back to the cockpit to allow crew members to reef without going on deck in heavy weather. Intermediate reef cringles are not used.|$|R
5000|$|At 3000 lbs it {{included}} a 1250 lbs cast iron keel. Tempest 23 came standard with eight foot (8') Self-bailing cockpit, self-draining seats with storage, molded insulated ice box, Philippine mahogany trim, deck stepped mast, main <b>roller</b> <b>reefing,</b> full width mainsheet traveler, wirehalyards, two jib winches, separate galley and head enclosures, two (2) 6'6" [...] berths with storage, and a 2-year warranty.The sail plan {{consisted of a}} 115.00 sq. ft. mainsail, 113.10 sq. ft. jib and 339.00 sq. ft. spinnaker. [...] It can be sailed with a Tri-radial headsail.|$|R
2500|$|She {{was built}} in 1900 by Ferguson and Baird at their Connah's Quay, Flintshire yard, for local {{shipping}} company Coppack Bros. Constructed with a doubled frame of oak, these were covered by [...] thick seasoned pitch pine planks, fastened to the frames with treenails and iron bolts. Equipped with the first known fitting of Appledore <b>roller</b> <b>reefing,</b> the sails are reefed by a ratchet lever that engaged the cogs on the Gaff boom, thereby winding the sail around it, and then locked to prevent the sail unwinding from the boom. Launched in April 1900 under Captain John Coppack, she was named Lizzie May after the Captainâ€™s daughters.|$|R
50|$|The Mirror 16 is a {{class of}} sailing dinghy which was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Mirror newspaper in 1963 and the design project was headed by Jack Holt. Its design was based upon the easy to construct stitch and glue principle introduced by Barry Bucknell for the Mirror 11 dinghy. The Mirror 16 was designed for the racing enthusiast and also the camping/potterer dinghy sailor. The concept was a relatively light dinghy with a large sail area that could easily be reefed. The main sail was designed for slab reefing and the large genoa had <b>roller</b> <b>reefing.</b> The Mirror 16, like the Mirror 11, was produced with distinctive red sails. The Mirror 16 was faster than the Proctor-designed Wayfarer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{initially}} {{designed as a}} cargo ship. The ship was of a medium clipper design which had an unusually sharp bow, tall masts and was broad amidships. The design was considered stable and able to withstand the punishment of the open sea. Marco Polo was a 184 ft long with a beam of 36 ft and a draught of 29 ft. The ship had a hold depth of 30 ft. Marco Polo weighed 1,625 tons. The ship was square rigged and fitted with the <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> system that allowed the sails to be reefed from the deck rather than have the crew go up into the sails. The vessel had three masts and carried up to [...] of sail. Marco Polo was later reduced to barque rig in 1874.|$|R
60|$|It was toward dusk on {{the second}} evening when they steamed into sight of a little schooner, which showed as a gray smear of slanted canvas {{scarcely}} distinguishable from the crag {{a couple of miles}} to lee of her. Jimmy wondered what she was doing there in that weather with only one jib and a <b>reefed</b> <b>boom</b> foresail set, until his glasses showed him that her mainmast was broken off. That made the thing clearer, and in case more should be wanted, a flag fluttered aloft and blew out half-way up her foremast upside down. It was an appeal that is very seldom made in vain at sea, and meant in that particular case that she would be ashore in an hour or two unless somebody towed her off.|$|R
50|$|The oyster {{dredging}} sailboats of the Chesapeake Bay, bugeyes and skipjacks, were inevitably {{equipped with}} lazy jacks, as their huge sail plans, {{combined with the}} changeable conditions on the bay, made it necessary {{to be able to}} reef quickly and with a small crew. Of late they have been revived as a feature of pleasure yachts as an alternative to <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> and furling. The latter methods can distort the sail, and are not compatible with battens in the reefed or furled portion of the sail. Lazy jacks are also cheaper, and can be easily applied after-market. However, they are not without disadvantages. The extra lines provide something else for the sail to foul upon when it is being raised, particularly if it is battened, and the lines and the connections between them can chafe and beat upon the sail, shortening its life and making unwanted noise. Also, unlike the roller systems, some crew member(s) must be on deck to secure the sail.|$|R
40|$|Erosion, sedimentation, {{sea level}} rise, tsunami, sea water pollution, coralreef and {{mangrove}} forest destruction are problems, {{that have to}} beconsidered during planning, development {{and management of the}} coastal,sea and marine tourism activity. Alternative technology such as naturaland man made coastal and sea protections (revetment, bulkhead, seawall, jetty, groin, breakwater, submerged artificial <b>reef,</b> oil <b>boom,</b> oilskimmer) and information technology can be used and applied for thispurpose...|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, Irwin {{returned}} to the Royal Airship Works to command the newly completed R101, which first flew on 14 October. However, the ship's second flight on 18 October ended in an unfortunate incident, reminiscent of {{the one that had}} ended the R36's career and again involving Scott, who by now was Officer in Charge of Flying and Training at the Works. Scott [...] "not only insisted on taking over for the landing from Irwin but also made a mess of the job," [...] upsetting the ship's trim and permitting it to over-ride the Cardington mooring mast. Irwin and Atherstone were [...] "thoroughly upset" [...] by the episode. Subsequently, on 21 October, Scott took over from Irwin while moving the R101 from the mast to its shed and [...] "so confused the issues" [...] that the task was greatly protracted. Other incidents took place on the ship's third flight on 1 November when Scott released ballast during the landing without Irwin's knowledge and on the subsequent flight, when Scott took charge while landing at Cardington on 3 November and caused damage to one of the ship's <b>reefing</b> <b>booms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While {{the initial}} flight trials were being carried out, the design team {{examined}} the lift problem. Studies identified possible weight savings of 3.16 tons. The weight-saving measures included deleting {{twelve of the}} double-berth cabins, removing the <b>reefing</b> <b>booms</b> from the nose to frame 1 and between frames 13 to 15 at the tail, replacing the glass windows of the observation decks with Cellon, removing two water ballast tanks, and removing the servo mechanism for the rudder and elevators. [...] Letting the gasbags out would gain 3.18 tons extra lift, although Michael Rope considered this unwise, [...] since {{there were thousands of}} exposed fixings protruding from the girders; chafing of the gasbags would have to be prevented by wrapping these in strips of cloth. To further increase lift, an extra bay of [...] capacity could be installed. This would deliver an extra nine tons disposable lift. After much consultation, all these proposed measures were approved in December. Letting out the gasbags and the weight-saving measures were begun. Delivery by Boulton Paul of the metalwork for the extra bay was expected to take place in June.|$|R
50|$|Most R-22 {{boats are}} now {{equipped}} with Inner Mast Furling (IMF) {{as well as}} <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> jibs. The R-22 can be sailed single handed from the large, self-bailing cockpit. The cockpit features a flat floor bottom, comfortable seating, and an optional Boom Room. The boom can be raised or lowered, allowing the boat to be sailed with a Bimini top in place providing shade from the sun. The cabin features a partitioned V-berth, 4' long galley with stove and icebox, {{as well as an}} enclosed head. The cabin ceiling features two standing room hatches and an optional pop top and canvas enclosures. The sailboat also uses the swing keel as a self-centering feature when loading onto the trailer. Unlike most sailboats in its class, this boat features positive foam flotation that render it unsinkable, even if holed. The sturdy mast is supported by 9 stays and 9 chain plates: one forward jib stay, 3 stays on each side, and two back stays. The mast can remain upright with any broken stay, even the single forward jib stay. One R-22 boat was caught in hurricane-force winds in Long Island Sound and knocked down 3 times. The R-22 is unsinkable and self-righting, but hurricane-force winds tested its mettle. It broke one shroud and one stay, but was never de-masted and sailed back to Mamaroneck Harbor when the winds died to about 30 mph.|$|R
60|$|They {{drove past}} the <b>reef,</b> the long <b>boom</b> lurched across, and Red Rose rolled violently. Dark rocks towered above her mast and the sails thrashed and {{filled in the}} {{conflicting}} gusts, but the water got smooth and the harbor opened up. Presently Marston jumped {{to the foot of}} the mast and the peak of the mainsail swung down.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} a furling jib is usually {{attributed}} to Major E du Boulay in England who invented a device similar to a <b>roller</b> blind for <b>reefing</b> a jib. Major Wykeham-Martin used one of Boulay's rollers and improved the system by incorporating roller bearings in 1907 when the system was patented. The original castings were made by London-based toilet makers Bouldings. By the 1940s nearly every British cruising yacht was fitted with this furling system.|$|R
5000|$|R101 {{made its}} first flight on 14 October. After a short circuit over Bedford course was set for London, where it passed over the Palace of Westminster, St Paul's Cathedral and the City, {{returning}} to Cardington after a flight lasting 5 hr 40 min. During this flight the servos were not used, without any difficulty being experienced in controlling the airship.A second flight lasting 9 hr 38 min followed on 18 October with Lord Thomson among the passengers, after which R101 was briefly returned to the shed to enable some modifications {{to be made to}} the starting engines. [...] A third flight lasting 7 hr 15 min was made on 1 November, during which it was flown at full power for the first time, recording a speed of 68.5 mph: even at full speed it was not found necessary to use the control servos. During this flight it paid a visit to the Boulton and Paul works near Nottingham and also circled over Sandringham House, observed by the King and Queen. [...] On 2 November the first night flight was made, slipping the mast at 8:12 pm before heading south to fly over London and Portsmouth before attempting a speed trial over a 43 mi circuit over the Solent and the Isle of Wight. These trials were frustrated by pipe breakages in the cooling systems of two of the engines, a problem later solved by replacing the aluminium piping with copper. It returned to Cardington at around 9:00 am, the mooring operation ending in a minor accident, damaging one of the <b>reefing</b> <b>booms</b> at the bow.|$|R

60|$|The fresh {{northwest}} breeze that crisped the Inlet {{swept in}} through the open ports and set the cigar smoke eddying about the table, when Jimmy sat with Jordan and another man in the Shasta's little stern cabin. Looking forward through the hooked-back door, {{he could see the}} lower yards and serried shrouds of a big iron ship that was lying half-loaded on the Shasta's starboard side. Beyond her there rode a little schooner with <b>reefed</b> mainsail and <b>boom</b> foresail thrashing, while the musical clinketty-clank of her windlass betokened that she was just going to sea. Jimmy's face grew a trifle hard as he heard it, for she was the Tyee.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Biological Sciences) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. The {{waters of}} Maui County are {{essential}} to the economic livelihood of Maui County???s residents. In addition to sustenance value, annual revenue from international tourism and marine activities along the coastlines of Maui County keeps the island's economy afloat. Ironically, it is this revenue that may lead to the demise of Maui???s coral <b>reef</b> ecosystems and <b>booming</b> tourism industry. Overuse of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), due to their appeal as aesthetically vivid, conservation districts, has potential to degrade the very systems that the MPAs are intended to protect. Maui Counties MPAs are exploited as ideal snorkel and dive destinations and potentially used to a higher degree than non-conserved areas and therefore are more prone to degradation than areas with no protected status. Marine ecotourism activities have been previously indicated as factors involved in coral reef degradation. Here, I attempted to establish {{whether or not there was}} a notable decline in benthic substrate biodiversity in the MPA-managed areas of Maui County relative to that of non-conserved areas. Based on biodiversity indices, I hypothesized that there would be lower benthic biodiversity at MPA sites (designated as ???conserved???) relative to those sites with no such designations, within the boundaries of Maui County. It was my prediction that because of the high use of these marine protected areas, relative to control areas, a more-degraded, less-diverse substrate would be described in the MPAs of Maui County despite their designation as conservation districts. Photographic quadrats of benthic organisms and substrate from four tourist-accessible conservation sites and eight biogeographically similar controls were quantified and assessed through the use of biodiversity indices at two depth ranges. Using MANOVAs of Shannon diversity indices, Species Richness and percent cover, I found significantly lower biodiversity indices in MPAs relative to control areas. These results were consistent throughout the three assessed biodiversity indices in both site by site comparisons and an overall comparison of all MPA data points compared to all control data points. Given the lengthy establishment of MPAs in Maui County and the importance of marine preservation for the aesthetics, economy and biology of Maui county, these results suggest the need for change in the level of MPA usage and regulation of that usage.
