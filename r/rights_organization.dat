5|$|Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights {{serve as}} direct {{links between the}} LGBT-related {{activism}} of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, {{a young man named}} Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, {{a man who had been}} a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT <b>rights</b> <b>organization</b> in the United States.|$|E
