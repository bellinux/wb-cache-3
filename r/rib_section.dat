To determine the effects of source and level of dietary Zn on performance, carcass characteristics and tissue Zn concentration, Angus steers (n = 120; initial weight = 325 kg ? 2. 57) were assigned to diets containing five levels of added Zn (5, 35, 95, 215, or 445 mg/kg) from Zn methionine (ZnMet) or ZnSO 4 in a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement of treatments. Total dietary Zn was 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 mg/kg. Within treatment groups, steers were assigned to one of two kill groups (kill group I = d 77; kill group 2 = d 126). Steers were housed four to a pen and fed ad libitum a 90 % concentrate diet of primarily corn and cottonseed meal by electronic Calen gate feeders.

40|$|There is {{too much}} fat on beef {{carcasses}} today. Research in beef cattle production is directed towards solving this problem by maximizing partitioning of dietary nutrients to lean muscle growth and minimizing deposition of carcass fat. Partitioning agents called β - adrenergic agonists are able to cause this type of nutrient partitioning. Earlier work showed two of these compounds, clenbuterol and cimaterol, can be fed and are effective in many species including pigs, sheep, and cattle. At levels that did not depress gain, clenbuterol feeding increased protein content of the 9 th to 11 th <b>rib</b> <b>section</b> by 13 % and decreased fat content by 20 % in cattle. Even more dramatic carcass changes were observed in cattle in response to cimaterol.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{bones of}} bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) {{were used by}} Mackenzie Inuit groups in {{producing}} a number of items essential to transportation and procurement. However, the whale bone industry, {{and its relationship to}} Mackenzie Inuit economic and social systems, is poorly understood. A recently excavated archaeological assemblage from McKinley Bay, Northwest Territories, provides a record of intensive Nuvugarmiut whale bone tool manufacture, which can be used to reconstruct a reduction sequence. Bowhead bone reduction at McKinley Bay focused on ribs, which were transversely worked into large sections. Cortical blanks were isolated from central <b>rib</b> <b>sections,</b> but proximal and distal <b>rib</b> <b>sections</b> were treated directly as blanks and preforms for the production of large durable tools, such as harpoon heads, adze sockets, mattock blades, and picks. The intensive whale bone reduction at McKinley Bay was part of a broader gearing-up strategy focused on the manufacture and repair of sleds and harpoons needed for the late winter migration and spring seal hunt. More generally, because the whale bone industry was intimately related to the bowhead hunt and its proceeds, it may provide fundamental insights about key aspects of coastal whaling societies, such as social organization, redistribution, and inter-territorial trade.

40|$|The aim of {{this trial}} was to compare the growth {{performance}} and meat yield and composition of SimGoud (Italian Simmental Goudali, SG) crossbreed young bulls with those of pure Goudali (G) breed. Twenty-five G and 25 SG, from 20 to 41 months, reared together in Cameroon on native pasture were considered. Body size, growth and meat composition were compared. The SG crosses were more sized than the coetaneous pure G, having almost all body dimensions and mass index higher than G. Moreover, SG showed higher body weight at farm and ante-mortem than G, with about four times higher growth rate, but showed a marked loss of weight during transfer to slaughterhouse and lairage time. SG showed higher carcass weight and killing out percentage, {{in addition to a}} higher weight of rib steak and ribeye muscle at eighth–ninth <b>rib</b> <b>section</b> level than G. Despite the greater growth, differences between G and SG in beef proximate composition were not found. Genotype had a limited effect on fatty acids profile.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of high or low energy intake on carcass composition and expression of hypothalamic genes related to the onset of puberty. Twenty-four prepubertal Nellore heifers, 18 - 20 - months-old, with 275. 3 ± 18. 0 kg body weight (BW), and 4. 9 ± 0. 2 (1 - 9 scale) body condition score (BCS) were randomly assigned to two treatments: high-energy diet (HE) and low-energy diet (LE). Heifers were housed in two collective pens and fed diets formulated to promote average daily gain of 0. 4 (LE) or 1. 2 kg (HE) BW/day. Eight heifers from each treatment were slaughtered after the first corpus luteum detection - considered as age of puberty. The 9 - 10 - 11 th <b>rib</b> <b>section</b> was taken and prepared for carcass composition analyses. Samples from hypothalamus were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C. Specific primers for targets (NPY, NPY 1 R, NPY 4 R, SOCS 3, OXT, ARRB 1, and IGFPB 2) and control (RPL 19 and RN 18 S 1) genes were designed for real-time PCR and then the relative quantification of target gene expression was performed. High-energy diets increased body condition score, cold carcass weight, and Longissimus lumborum muscle area and decreased age at slaughter. High-energy diets decreased the expression of NPY 1 R and ARRB 1 at 4. 4 -fold and 1. 5 -fold, respectively. In conclusion, the hastening of puberty with high energy intake is related with greater body fatness and lesser hypothalamic expression of NPY 1 receptor and of β-arrestin 1, suggesting a less sensitive hypothalamus to the negative effects of NPY signaling...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{entrance}} geometries on the heat transfer in a narrow aspect ratio (AR= 1 : 4) rectangular internal cooling channel, representative of a leading edge of a gas turbine blade. Detailed heat transfer coefficient distributions are measured for three different entrance geometries: S-shape entrance, 90 degree bend entrance and a twisted entrance with changing AR. Both smooth and ribbed channels are used in a two pass channel configuration. A baseline straight-entry channel {{is used as a}} reference for comparison. The tests are done for Reynolds number ranging from 15000 to 55000. The ribs are placed at an angle of 45 ° to the mainstream flow. The results show that the effects of entrance geometry persist throughout the first pass (up to a distance of 9 times the hydraulic diameter) for the smooth channel. All the entrance geometries provided enhancement in heat transfer compared to the straight fully developed entrance, with the 90 degree bend entrance providing the highest enhancement. The effect of entrance is less pronounced for the <b>ribbed</b> test <b>section</b> case with the effects confined more in the early developing regions.
