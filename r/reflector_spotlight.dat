25|$|The Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) Source Four (also known unofficially as Source 4 or S4) is an {{ellipsoidal}} <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> (ERS) used {{in stage}} lighting. First released in 1992, the Source Four {{was invented by}} David Cunningham and features an improved lamp and reflector compared to previous ERS designs, tool-free lamp adjustment, and a rotating, interchangeable shutter barrel. The Source Four is widely used by professional theaters across the globe.|$|E
25|$|The {{ellipsoidal}} <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> (ERS), {{also known}} as profile (after its ability to project the silhouette or profile of anything put in the gate) (UK) and Découpe (French), is the most abundant instrument type currently in theatrical use. The flexibility of the ERS allows it to fulfill the bulk of lighting roles in the theater. They are sometimes known as a profile spotlight (in Europe) or by their brand names, especially the Source Four (a popular lantern from ETC) and 2 the Leko (short for Lekolite, from Strand lighting).|$|E
2500|$|The gobo {{is placed}} in the focal plane of the lantern (generally an {{ellipsoidal}} <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> or a moving head). [...] The gobo is inserted upside-down and back-to-front. The lighting instrument inverts the projected image.|$|E
50|$|Tungsten halogen lamps {{are used}} in the {{majority}} of theatrical and studio (film and television) fixtures, including Ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlights,</b> Source Four, and Fresnels. PAR Cans are also predominately tungsten halogen.|$|R
50|$|Instead of a {{metallic}} coating, a dichroic optical coating may be used. Depending on its characteristics, {{the ratio of}} reflection to transmission will vary {{as a function of}} the wavelength of the incident light. Dichroic mirrors are used in some ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlights</b> to split off unwanted infrared (heat) radiation, and as output couplers in laser construction.|$|R
5000|$|Certain lensed {{lighting}} instruments (i.e. Ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlights)</b> have a {{good deal}} of [...] "throw" [...] and do not lose much intensity as distance increases. These light sources tend to be more effective at large distances than soft light sources. At large distances, an effective soft light source would have to be very large. The (mostly) parallel rays of such instruments tends to cast hard shadows, unlike soft light sources.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of spotlights, the name [...] "Klieg light" [...] became synonymous with any {{ellipsoidal}} <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> (ERS), another carbon-arc source or any bright source. Initially developed for film, the Klieg light was adapted to an incandescent stage fixture in 1911.|$|E
5000|$|Although not {{completely}} certain, {{the title of}} the first ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> often goes to the 1933 Klieglight, which was first used to light an outdoor pageant in New York. Century Lighting introduced their Lekolite, developed by Levy & Kook, hence the [...] "Leko", in the same year.|$|E
50|$|The gobo {{is placed}} in the focal plane of the lantern (generally an {{ellipsoidal}} <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> or a moving head). The gobo is inserted upside-down and back-to-front. The desired pattern is then projected by the lantern onto whatever surface it is pointed at such as a wall or dance floor.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, the Kliegl {{brothers}} installed {{their new}} ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlights</b> in the Center Theatre in Radio City. Based {{on the new}} GE T14 medium bipost lamps, these had triple {{the efficiency of the}} standard plano convex spots. They were demonstrated to a meeting of the Illuminating Engineering Society on April 19, 1933 and introduced as a standard product in Catalog B of 1933 as [...] "Klieglights" [...] and billed on pages 42-45 of Catalog 40 of 1936 as [...] "The New Klieglight".|$|R
2500|$|Profile spots (UK) or {{ellipsoidal}} <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlights</b> (US) tend to {{be longer}} fixtures containing convex lenses and having a gate at their focal point which enables the insertion of gobos or irises to shape the beam of light. They give a hard-edged beam most often associated {{in the public mind}} with [...] "spotlights". Large versions are operated by a technician as a 'followspot' to follow performers on the stage. The term Profile Spot used in the UK refers to a focussing spotlight which may, or may not use the ellipsoidal reflector design, this design was not common in the UK until the 1970s and many UK and European manufacturers have still to adopt this design instead preferring a twin PC lens design.|$|R
2500|$|Direction {{refers to}} the shape, quality and {{evenness}} of a lamp's output. [...] The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by three factors. [...] The first are {{the specifics of the}} lamp, reflector and lens assembly. [...] Different mounting positions for the lamp (axial, base up, base down), different sizes and shapes of reflector {{and the nature of the}} lens (or lenses) being used can all affect the pattern of light. [...] Secondly, the specifics of how the lamp is focused affect its pattern. [...] In ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlights</b> (ERS) or profile spotlights, there are two beams of light emitted from the lamp. [...] When the cones of both intersect at the throw distance (the distance to the stage), the lamp has a sharply defined 'hard' edge. [...] When the two cones do not intersect at that distance, the edge is fuzzy and 'soft'. [...] Depending on which beam (direct or reflected) is outside the other, the pattern may be 'thin and soft' or 'fat and soft'. Lastly, a gobo or break up pattern may be applied to ERSs and similar instruments. [...] This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. [...] It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. [...] Gobos, or templates, [...] come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.|$|R

50|$|A Lekolite (often {{abbreviated}} to Leko) is {{a brand of}} ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> (ERS) used in stage lighting.

The instrument was widely used in theatre and entertainment venues into the 1990s, particularly in the United States, and modern fixtures, such as the Electronic Theatre Controls Source 4, are direct descendants of Levy's and Kook's design.|$|E

50|$|Spin casting {{can also}} be used, often with {{materials}} other than glass, to produce prototype paraboloids, such as <b>spotlight</b> <b>reflectors</b> or solar-energy concentrators, which {{do not need to}} be as exactly paraboloidal as telescope mirrors. Spin casting every paraboloid that is made would be too slow and costly, so the prototype is simply copied relatively quickly and cheaply and with adequate accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|The first [...] "Klieglight" [...] was a {{powerful}} carbon arc light designed for the motion picture industry. It {{was not the first}} arc light offered by the company (arc floods are offered in their bulletin [...] "Stage Lighting Apparatus and Effects of Every Description", published prior to 1906), and nor was it a spotlight. Its first listing is in Catalog G of 1913, where it is shown as a horizontal wide flood. None of the surviving catalogs, through to its disappearance from the company's product line, describe any other lighting instrument as a [...] "Klieglight", with all arc spotlights uniformly described as [...] "arc spotlights". [...] "Klieglight", however, reappears on pages 42-45 of Catalog 40 of 1936 as the name of their new line of ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> incandescent <b>spotlights,</b> and this usage continued as long as the company was in existence. Oddly enough, the company apparently did not attempt to trademark the name, although there was a filing for a logo that was never carried through.|$|R
50|$|Like many {{lighting}} {{designers to}} follow, Stanley McCandless {{was not only}} interested in the artistic side of lighting design, but he {{also contributed to the}} technical aspect of the art as well. In his early work as a theatrical consultant, McCandless designed specific house lights for the Center Theatre in New York’s Radio City. These fixtures incorporated the use of ellipsoidal shaped reflectors, which were later developed into the ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight.</b> This lighting fixture has become the staple for theatre lighting inventories in America due to its ability to shape light with shutters and gobos or templates.|$|E
5000|$|Century Lighting founders and the instrument's inventors, Joseph Levy and Edward Kook, {{combined}} {{the first two}} letters of their own last names and called the unit [...] "Leko." [...] Rival lighting company, Kliegl Brothers, released their own Elipsoidial <b>Reflector</b> <b>Spotlight</b> that same year, calling it [...] "Klieglight". It is unclear which company was first to develop the new technology, but both had developed the technology earlier and {{had to wait until}} a lamp was developed by GE that would work in the new fixture. The Leko nickname became widely used to refer to any ERS. Strand lighting has begun to use the [...] "Lekolite" [...] name again.|$|E
5000|$|LED {{instruments}} {{cannot be}} used to create a hard edged beam, which is needed for gobos and other effects which require the use of an ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight,</b> though LED fixtures are now made that {{through the use of a}} small number of high-output diodes now allow the beam to be focused to a [...] "hard edge", allowing full use of gobo/beam effects. Because color mixing is done using three or more colors of LEDs, mixed colors will have multiple edges to shadows where different colors are showing; however, several manufacturers have introduced instruments that group three or more LEDs behind a single lens to make the multiple shadow lines less noticeable.|$|E
5000|$|Dmitri Maksutov {{may have}} been working with the idea of pairing a spherical primary mirror in {{conjunction}} with a negative meniscus lens as far back as 1936. His notes from that time on the function of Mangin mirrors, an early catadioptric <b>spotlight</b> <b>reflector</b> consisting of negative lens with silvering on the back side, include a sketch of Mangin mirror with the mirror part and the negative lens separated into two elements. Maksutov seems to have picked up the idea again in 1941 war-torn Europe as a variation on an earlier design that paired a spherical mirror with a negative lens, Bernhard Schmidt's 1931 [...] "Schmidt Camera". Maksutov claimed to have come {{up with the idea of}} replacing the complex Schmidt corrector plate with an all-spherical [...] "meniscus corrector plate" [...] while riding in a train of refugees from Leningrad. Maksutov is described as patenting his design in May, August, or October 1941 and building a [...] "Maksutov-Gregorian"-style prototype in October 1941. Maksutov came up with the unique idea using an [...] "achromatic corrector", a corrector made of a single type of glass with a weak negative meniscus shape that departed from the pure concentric spherical symmetrical shape to correct chromatic aberration.|$|R
5000|$|Sabbatini {{developed}} and described {{a number of}} novel stage lighting techniques, such as dimming mechanism to darken the whole stage, directed spotlights for illuminating {{certain parts of the}} stage (it is believed that he invented the first <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight,</b> by attaching a polished basin behind a light source) and several others, thus effectively being, together with Sebastiano Serlio and Leone de Somi, one of the creators of stage lighting for dramatic purposes, including scripting lighting changes in synchronization with the play or opera. He developed a number of acoustic effects machinery, such as a [...] "thunder box", a contraption which had heavy (15 kg) iron or stone balls which rolled down a case of wooden stairs when the effect was called for.|$|E
50|$|Ellipsoidal <b>reflector</b> <b>spotlight</b> (abbreviated to ERS, or colloquially {{ellipsoidal}} or ellipse) is {{the name}} for a type of stage lighting instrument, named for the ellipsoidal reflector used to collect and direct the light through a barrel that contains a lens or lens train. The optics of an ERS instrument are roughly {{similar to those of}} a 35 mm slide projector. There are many types of ERS that are designed for the myriad applications found in the entertainment industry. ERS instruments come in all shapes and sizes. Each particular model of ERS has its own set of characteristics. Generally, ERS instruments are the most varied and utilized type of stage lighting instrument. ERS may also be referred to as Profile Spotlights (especially in Europe) because the beam can be shaped to the profile of an object. Ellipsoidal reflectors are used for their strong, well-defined light and their versatility. Leko and Source Four are brand names which are often, but inaccurately, used to refer to any sort of ellipsoidal.|$|E
