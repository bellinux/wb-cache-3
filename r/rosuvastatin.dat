25|$|<b>Rosuvastatin</b> has {{multiple}} contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with <b>rosuvastatin,</b> including hypersensitivity to <b>rosuvastatin</b> or any {{component of the}} formulation, active liver disease, elevation of serum transaminases, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. <b>Rosuvastatin</b> must not be taken while pregnant as it can cause serious harm to the unborn baby. In the case of breastfeeding, it is unknown whether <b>rosuvastatin</b> is passed through breastmilk, but due to the potential of disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism, patients should not breast feed while on <b>rosuvastatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Rosuvastatin</b> has {{structural}} similarities {{with most}} other synthetic statins, e.g., atorvastatin, cerivastatin and pitavastatin, but unlike other statins, <b>rosuvastatin</b> contains sulfur (in sulfonyl functional group).|$|E
25|$|<b>Rosuvastatin</b> is metabolized {{mainly by}} CYP2C9 and not {{extensively}} metabolized; approximately 10% is recovered as metabolite N-desmethyl <b>rosuvastatin.</b> It is excreted in feces (90%) primarily and the elimination half-life is approximately 19 hours.|$|E
25|$|Crestor is {{actually}} a calcium salt of <b>rosuvastatin,</b> i.e. <b>rosuvastatin</b> calcium, in which calcium replaces the hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group {{on the right of}} the skeletal formula at the top right of this page.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rosuvastatin</b> is {{approved}} in the United States {{for the treatment}} of high LDL cholesterol (dyslipidemia), total cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), and/or triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia). In February 2010, <b>rosuvastatin</b> was approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016 Mylan gained {{approval}} for its generic <b>rosuvastatin</b> calcium.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>rosuvastatin</b> {{is for the}} {{treatment}} of dyslipidemia.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016 the FDA {{approved}} the first generic version of <b>rosuvastatin</b> (from Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc).|$|E
25|$|<b>Rosuvastatin</b> is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, having a {{mechanism of action}} {{similar to that of}} other statins.|$|E
25|$|As of 2004, <b>rosuvastatin</b> {{had been}} {{approved}} in 154 countries and launched in 56. Approval in the United States by the FDA came on August 12, 2003.|$|E
25|$|The {{main patent}} {{protecting}} <b>rosuvastatin</b> (RE37,314 â€” due to expire in 2016) was challenged {{as being an}} improper reissue of an earlier patent. This challenge was rejected in 2010, confirming protection until 2016.|$|E
25|$|First {{launched}} in 2003, sales of <b>rosuvastatin</b> were $129 million and $908 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively, {{with a total}} patient treatment population of over 4 million {{by the end of}} 2004.|$|E
25|$|Putative {{beneficial}} effects of <b>rosuvastatin</b> therapy on chronic heart failure may be negated by increases in collagen turnover markers {{as well as}} a reduction in plasma coenzyme Q10 levels in patients with chronic heart failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rosuvastatin</b> (INN), marketed {{under the}} tradename Crestor, {{is a member}} of the drug class of statins, used in {{combination}} with exercise, diet, and weight-loss to treat high cholesterol and related conditions, and to prevent cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>rosuvastatin</b> on LDL {{cholesterol}} are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious {{in improving the}} lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.|$|E
25|$|All statins {{have the}} same {{pharmacophore}} so the difference in their pharmacodynamic effect is mostly based on the substituents. The activity of each statin {{is dependent on the}} binding affinity of the compound for the substrate site and the length of time it binds to the site. Type 2 statins havejk unique fluorophenyl group that causes additional polar interaction between the enzyme and the statins, which results in a tighter binding to the enzyme. The newest statin, <b>rosuvastatin</b> has a unique polar methane sulfonamide group, which is quite hydrophilic and confers low lipophilicity. The sulfonamide group forms a unique polar interaction with the enzyme. As a result, <b>rosuvastatin</b> has superior binding affinity to the HMGR enzyme compared to the other statins, which is directly related to its efficiency to lower LDL cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|These drugs include <b>rosuvastatin</b> (CRESTOR), {{lovastatin}} (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, {{one of the}} fungal {{sources from}} which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring cholesterol-lowering molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or lovastatin (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic lovastatin).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that statins bind {{reversibly}} to the HGMR enzyme. The affinity of statins for HGMR enzyme is in the nanomolar range, while the natural substrate's affinity is in the micromolar range. Studies {{have shown that}} statins use the conformational flexibility of the HMGR enzyme that causes a shallow hydrophobic groove that the statins exploit and is used to accommodate their hydrophobic moieties. The specificity and the tight binding of statins is due to orientation and bonding interactions that form between the statin and the HMGR enzyme. Polar interactions are formed between the HMG-moiety and residues that {{are located in the}} cis loop of the enzyme. These polar interactions are between Ser684, Asp690, Lys691 and Lys692 (Figure 4). The terminal carboxylate of the HMG moiety forms a salt bridge with the cationic Lys735 of the enzyme. In addition to the polar interaction, Lys691 participates in a hydrogen bonding network with Glu559, Asp767 and the O5 hydroxyl group of the hydroxyglutartic acid component of the statins. Van der Waals interactions are formed between the hydrophobic side chains of the enzyme, which involve the Leu562, Val683, Leu853, Ala856 and Leu857 and the statins. Type 2 statins form polar interaction between the fluorine atom on the fluorophenyl group and the guanidinium group of Arg590. In addition to these interactions atorvastatin and <b>rosuvastatin</b> also form unique hydrogen bonds between Ser565 residue and either a carbonyl oxygen atom (atorvastatin) or a sulfone oxygen atom (<b>rosuvastatin).</b> A unique polar interaction between the Arg568 side chain and the electronegative sulfone group on <b>rosuvastatin</b> makes it the statin that has the greatest number of bonding interactions with HGMR.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the {{consumer}} interest organization Public Citizen filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA, asking that Crestor be {{withdrawn from the}} US market. On March 11, 2005, the FDA issued a letter to Sidney M. Wolfe, M.D. of Public Citizen both denying the petition and providing an extensive detailed analysis of findings that demonstrated no basis for concerns about <b>rosuvastatin</b> compared with the other statins approved for marketing in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Lovastatin {{is derived}} from a fungus source and {{simvastatin}} and pravastatin are chemical modifications of lovastatin {{and as a result}} do not differ much in structure from lovastatin. All three are partially reduced napthylene ring structures. Simvastatin and lovastatin are inactive lactones which must be metabolized to their active hydroxy-acid forms in order to inhibit HMGR. Type 2 statins all exist in their active hydroxy-acid forms. Fluvastatin has indole ring structure, while atorvastatin and <b>rosuvastatin</b> have pyrrole and pyrimidine based ring structure respectively. The lipophilic cerivastatin has a pyridine-based ring structure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} rare {{side effects}} are more serious. Like all statins, <b>rosuvastatin</b> can possibly cause myopathy, rhabdomyolysis. Stop taking <b>rosuvastatin</b> and contact the prescribing doctor {{if any of}} these occur: ...|$|E
2500|$|Meta-analysis {{showed that}} <b>rosuvastatin</b> {{is able to}} {{modestly}} increase levels of HDL cholesterol as well, as with other statins. A 2014 Cochrane review determined there was good evidence for <b>rosuvastatin</b> lowering non-HDL levels linearly with dose. [...] HDL increases by 7% with no dose effect noted.|$|E

2500|$|Absolute {{bioavailability}} of <b>rosuvastatin</b> {{is about}} 20% and Cmax is reached in 3 to 5 hours; administration with food {{did not affect}} the AUC according to the original sponsor submitted clinical study and as per product label. However, a subsequent clinical study has shown a marked reduction in <b>rosuvastatin</b> exposure when administered with food. It is 88% protein bound, mainly to albumin. [...] Fraction absorbed of <b>rosuvastatin</b> is frequently misquoted in the literature as approximately 0.5 (50%) due to a miscalculated hepatic extraction ratio in the original submission package subsequently corrected by the FDA reviewer. It is likely that closer to 0.25 (25%) of the administered dose is absorbed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} {{drugs can}} have negative interactions with <b>rosuvastatin</b> {{and should be}} discussed with the prescribing doctor: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the JUPITER trial (2008) {{suggested}} <b>rosuvastatin</b> may decrease the relative {{risk of heart attack}} and stroke in patients without hyperlipidemia, but with elevated levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein. This could strongly impact medical practice by [...] placing many patients on statin prophylaxis who otherwise would have been untreated. As a result of this clinical trial, the FDA approved <b>rosuvastatin</b> for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drug was}} billed as a [...] "super-statin" [...] during its {{clinical}} development; the claim was that it offers high potency and improved cholesterol reduction compared to rivals in the class. The main competitors to <b>rosuvastatin</b> are atorvastatin (Lipitor) and simvastatin (Zocor). However, people can also combine ezetimibe with either simvastatin or atorvastatin and other agents on their own, for somewhat similar augmented response rates. [...] some published information for comparing <b>rosuvastatin,</b> atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin results is available, {{but many of the}} relevant studies are still in progress.|$|E
2500|$|The AURORA trial {{randomized}} 2776 patients undergoing hemodialysis due to kidney {{damage to}} receive either <b>rosuvastatin</b> or placebo. The randomized, double-blind study (2005 to 2009) found {{no difference in}} the two groups in the primary end-point, a combination of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. [...] The study found no difference in all-cause mortality among this population at a mean follow-up of 3.8 years.|$|E
2500|$|... {{a number}} of statins are on the market: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, <b>rosuvastatin</b> and simvastatin. Several {{combination}} preparations of a statin and another agent, such as ezetimibe/simvastatin, are also available. In 2005, sales were estimated at US$18.7billion in the United States. The best-selling statin is atorvastatin, which in 2003 became the best-selling pharmaceutical in history. The manufacturer Pfizer reported sales of US$12.4billion in 2008. Due to patent expirations, several statins became available in 2016 as less expensive generics.|$|E
2500|$|Lipophilicity of the statins is {{considered}} to be quite important since the hepatoselectivity of the statins is related to their lipophilicity. [...] The more lipophilic statins tend to achieve higher levels of exposure in non-hepatic tissues, while the hydrophilic statins tend to be more hepatoselective. The difference in selectivity is because lipophilic statins passively and non-selectively diffuse into both hepatocyte and non-heptatocyte, while the hydrophilic statins rely largely on active transport into hepatocyte to exert their effects. High hepatoselectivity is thought to translate into reduced risk of adverse effects. It has been reported that the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) is important for the hepatic uptake of hydrophilic statins such as <b>rosuvastatin</b> and pravastatin. OATP-C is expressed in liver tissue on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and {{is considered}} to be a potential contributor for the low IC50 for <b>rosuvastatin</b> in hepatocytes. Of the marketed statins, cerivastatin was the most lipophilic and also had the largest percentage of serious adverse effects due to its ability to inhibit vascular smooth muscle proliferation and as a result was voluntarily removed from the market by the manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|All statins are (metabolized) by the liver, {{which causes}} their low {{systemic}} bioavailability. Lovastatin and simvastatin are administered in their lactone forms, {{which is more}} lipophilic than their free acid forms, and therefore {{they have to be}} activated by hydrolysis to the active anionic carboxylate form. Cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of the statins, with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes being the most dominant. CYP3A4 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin. CYP2C9 isoenzyme is the most predominant isoform involved in metabolism of Fluvastatin, but CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 isoenzymes also contribute to the metabolism of Fluvastatin. <b>Rosuvastatin</b> is [...] metabolized to a small degree by CYP2C9 {{and to a lesser extent}} by CYP2C19 isoenzymes. Pravastatin is not metabolized by CYP isoenzymes to any appreciable extent. The statins that have the ability to be metabolized by multiple CYP isoenzymes may therefore avoid drug accumulation when one of the pathways is inhibited by co-administered drugs.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, {{several months}} after its {{introduction}} in Europe, Richard Horton, {{the editor of the}} medical journal The Lancet, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. [...] "AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, <b>rosuvastatin,</b> raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines," [...] according to his editorial. The Lancet's editorial position is that the data for Crestorâ€™s superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in The Lancet, AstraZeneca's CEO Sir Tom McKillop called the editorial [...] "flawed and incorrect" [...] and slammed the journal for making [...] "such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine." ...|$|E
