5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming <b>readjustments.</b> For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

At 5 a.m. on September 20, Polk was awakened on the cold and foggy battlefield to find that Hill was not preparing to attack. He prepared new written orders, which reached Hill about 6 a.m. Hill responded with a number of reasons for delaying the attack, including <b>readjustments</b> of the alignment of his units, reconnaissance of the enemy line, and issuing breakfast rations to his men.

40|$|In {{realization}} of local physical plans, land <b>readjustment</b> method {{is that the}} most important method in Turkey. Land <b>readjustment</b> is a method whereby the ownership of scattered and irregular plots of agricultural land is polled, roads and main infrastructure are built, and the land then subdivided into urban plots (35 % of the total land in Turkey). Each plot contributes a portion of their previous land holding to provide space for roads. The land <b>readjustment</b> has to be realized by municipalities without request. For redistribution in the process of the land <b>readjustment</b> is determined as a size criterion in Turkey. The land <b>readjustment</b> is named as Article 18 in Turkey. Although the Article 18 (the land <b>readjustment)</b> is an obligatory for municipalities, the municipalities cannot be commonly applied the Article 18. Instead of Article 18, the Articles 15 - 16 are usually applied by voluntary reallocation. The Articles 15 - 16 is more fractional than Article 18. However, any detailed research related to the use of land <b>readjustment</b> in municipalities in Turkey has been not made so far.

Two months later, a sketch design was presented for consideration, {{but it was not}} well liked by the participants. This design retained all three main gun turrets and the flight deck was deemed too short to be useful.

The Director of Naval Gunnery was particularly pungent in his assessment of the design, [...] "The functions and requirements of carriers and of surface gun platforms are entirely incompatible ...the conceptions of these designs ...is evidently the result of an unresolved contest between a conscious acceptance of aircraft and a subconscious desire for a 1914 Fleet ...these abortions are the results of a psychological maladjustment.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of recent {{developments}} {{in the study of}} <b>readjustment,</b> a comprehensive formal theoretical framework was suggested, predicting the factors enhancing and impeding <b>readjustment</b> after a traumatic irrevocable loss (bereavement and disability) and empirically supported. Empirical investigation and application of multivariate techniques of data analysis revealed an identical structure of the content universe of <b>readjustment</b> for three groups: was windows, bereaved parents and army veterans, The structure ascertained the hypothesized predominance of individual resources [...] and particularly those which facilitate affective interaction relationship [...] as well as of primary groups' emotional support in enhancing <b>readjustment,</b> compared to the limited efficacy of formal rehabilitation agencies. In the realm of instrumental coping assistance, data ascertained the efficacy of 'resource enhancing' support (e. g. vocational training) in advancing <b>readjustment.</b> Data also ascertained that the weight of individual resources and primary group support in facilitating <b>readjustment</b> is greater than the effect of the severity of the disability, and plays a greater role in <b>readjustment</b> than lapse of time since the loss. The significance of the study is in the development and empirical verification of a formal comprehensive and testable framework of <b>readjustment</b> to change following a traumatic loss. Though the universal validity of the framework needs further proof, there seems to be sufficient basis for assuming such validity until empirically verified. It is suggested to view this study as a first step toward a general model of <b>readjustment.</b> The study seems particularly contributing to the body of knowledge in the realm of stress and coping in light of the difficulties in arriving at a valid empirical verification of the stressful life events [...] >coping [...] >homeostasis relationship. ...|$|R

40|$|Many repatriates find it {{challenging}} to readjust to their heritage culture {{after spending a}} significant period of time abroad. Research on predictors of <b>readjustment,</b> however, remains limited. The present study in particular investigated the identification of third culture individuals (TCIs) - that is, individuals who spent their formative years outside of their heritage culture - with an abstract, third culture. Our findings demonstrated that TCIs' identification with the third culture was empirically distinct {{from that of the}} heritage and host cultures. The present study further examined whether several variables - sojourner type (TCI vs. non-TCI), perceived conflict between heritage and host culture, perceived cultural distance, and cultural identification with heritage and other cultures - predicted psychological <b>readjustment</b> (stress, anxiety, depression and overall psychological <b>readjustment).</b> The results showed that strong heritage culture identification was associated with better psychological <b>readjustment,</b> whereas cultural conflict was generally associated with poorer <b>readjustment.</b> Furthermore, sojourner type significantly moderated the latter association, such that cultural conflict predicted the stress aspect of psychological <b>readjustment</b> for non-TCIs, but not for TCIs. As the present investigation is the first study to empirically establish identification with a 'third culture' we discuss implications for the literature on third culture individuals and psychological adjustment upon re-entry...|$|R

They have revived the quest for liberty, which was growing somewhat dimmed under the regime of Parliamentary Socialism, and they have reminded men that what our modern society needs is not a little tinkering here and there, nor the kind of minor <b>readjustments</b> to which the existing holders of power may readily consent, but a fundamental reconstruction, a sweeping away of all the sources of oppression, a liberation of men's constructive energies, and a wholly new way of conceiving and regulating production and economic relations. This merit is so great that, in view of it, all minor defects become insignificant, and this merit Syndicalism will continue to possess even if, as a definite movement, it should be found to have passed away with the war.|$|E
