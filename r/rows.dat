5|$|A classic {{error is}} {{the attempt to}} use the equals {{operator}} = {{in combination with the}} keyword NULL to find <b>rows</b> with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid syntax and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the syntax and evaluate such expressions to UNKNOWN. The consequence is that no <b>rows</b> are found - regardless of whether <b>rows</b> with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve <b>rows</b> with Nulls is the use of the predicate IS NULL instead of = NULL.|$|E

5|$|The {{most obvious}} feature of Scelidosaurus is its armour, {{consisting}} of bony scutes {{embedded in the}} skin. These osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel <b>rows</b> down the animal's body. Osteoderms are today found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The osteoderms of Scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape. Most were smaller or larger oval plates with a high keel on the outside, the highest point of the keel positioned more to the rear. Some scutes were small, flat and hollowed-out at the inside. The larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal <b>rows.</b> There were three <b>rows</b> of these along {{each side of the}} torso. The scutes of the lowest, lateral, row were more conical, rather than the blade-like osteoderms of Scutellosaurus. Between these main series, one or two <b>rows</b> of smaller oval keeled scutes were present. There were in total four <b>rows</b> of large scutes on the tail: one at the top midline, one at the midline of the underside, and one at each tail side. Whether the midline tail scutes continued over the torso and neck to the front is unknown and unlikely for the neck, though Scelidosaurus is often pictured this way.|$|E
