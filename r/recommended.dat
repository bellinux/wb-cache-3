His final report was finished in 1913, and although it <b>recommended</b> adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E

Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also <b>recommended</b> to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E

One student provided a compromised response in saying that “Yes, I <b>recommend</b> it. But I won’t <b>recommend</b> it to beginners though”. Another student was hesitating in regard to whether he should <b>recommend</b> it because his native speaker language partner was very quiet and he wished he had a different language partner. When prompted why they <b>recommend</b> the task, participants said “putting what you have learnt into practice is really good”, “it is important to use the target language outside classroom” and “the task {{is a good way to}} supplement our classroom learning”. In sum, the interview data strongly support the findings from the questionnaire.
