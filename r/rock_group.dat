40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the relatively fresh host rock and altered rock samples associated with the Pantingan Gold System exposed in Mount Mariveles, Bataan yield several notable observations that are useful in pinpointing potential gold pathfinder elements. Geochemical and petrologic analysis showed that the altered rocks can be subdivided into rocks that underwent propylitic alteration (<b>group</b> 1), argillized <b>rocks</b> with silica contents {{similar to those of}} the fresh host <b>rocks</b> (<b>group</b> 2), argillized but not strongly silicified <b>rocks</b> (<b>group</b> 3) and argillized and strongly silicified <b>rocks</b> (<b>group</b> 4). Selected element ratio patterns in the altered rocks and gold concentrations in gold-bearing quartz veins vary between the <b>rock</b> <b>groups.</b> Moreover, mass balance calculation also reflected the geochemical observations pertaining to the gains and losses of SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 + MgO, CaO + Na 2 O and K 2 O, which are believed to be chemical reactions (i. e. breakdown of plagioclase, silica inundation or leaching, sulfide and calcite formation) caused by the influx of hydrothermal fluids. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 The Society of Resource Geology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
