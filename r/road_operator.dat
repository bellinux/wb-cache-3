40|$|ADA {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly available in the market. Although the number of ADA systems sold is small, the variety and functionality of systems is increasing. This paper aims {{to contribute to the}} different aspects that affect the introduction of ADA systems. It reviews, in particular based on results of the EC project ADASE II, aspects about development of the market, trends in R&D, public policy, scenarios for market introduction, legal aspects and the expected effects on traffic safety, throughput and comfort. We conclude that the introduction of ADA systems in a very early stage, in which uncertainty is a key issue. Car manufacturers are uncertain about financial risks and the usability of ADA systems and employ a conservative strategy for market introduction. Governments and <b>road</b> <b>operators</b> need more certainty about the impact of ADA systems on traffic safety and throughput (reliability, predictability), before they can decide to take measures to facilitate, stimulate or regulate the introduction of ADA systems. Reduction of uncertainty for car manufacturers, governments and <b>road</b> <b>operators</b> can be accomplished through field operational tests, impact assessment and development of framework for cooperation between car manufacturers, governments and <b>road</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of ICT in the traffic domain showed great potential, but the many opportunities this brings {{seems to have}} distracted engineers. To solve urban traffic problems, many potentially effective solutions have been developed, but deployment rates are low. The main reason {{seems to be that}} stakeholder interests are often not understood. Moreover, a common understanding of the severity of traffic problems, their background, as well as the expectations and priorities of <b>road</b> <b>operators</b> is diminishing. Results from a survey showed that <b>road</b> <b>operators</b> currently experiences four main traffic problems: (1) inefficient and inappropriate use of roads, (2) connection between motorway and urban networks, (3) road works, and (4) air quality. Other findings show that some traffic problems are merely perceived problems without quantitative prove. To accelerate deployments a „package-scheme‟ is proposed. In a package, solutions are combined to contribute to achieving objectives and benefits for multiple stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Road {{visibility}} {{is used as}} {{a performance}} index by both road lighting and automobile lighting engineers. We propose a road network visibility index devoted to <b>road</b> <b>operators,</b> in order to assess the quality of their inter-urban networks in terms of night-time visibility. On rural roads at night (without public lighting), an object on the road is only visible to the driver if it is illuminated by the headlights. Its visibility depends on its geometric and photometric properties, on the photometric properties of the headlamps, and on the retro-reflection properties of the road in the background. Our goal is to compute a “visibility level ” index along a road itinerary, to serve as a tool of diagnosis for <b>road</b> <b>operators</b> who may want to know where on their network the night-time visibility is poor. This tool may also assess the improvement brought by modifications of the infrastructure. We use an instrumented vehicle (Ecodyn), calibrated it in order to measure the retro-reflection of the road pavement. We get a profile of the retro-reflectivity along the road, then we consider average headlamp photometric data (UMTRI European low-beam), and compute the profile of the visibility level, as indicated in Adrian’s model, for a given target along the road. This methodology was tested on two itineraries of several kilometers. As a conclusion, we propose a night-time road visibility index for roads without street lighting, and show the feasibility of the measurement with an existing photometric system. This methodology is mainly dedicated to <b>road</b> <b>operators,</b> but may also find applications in the conception of advanced front-lighting systems through the in-vehicle use of “visibility level ” digital maps of road networks...|$|R
