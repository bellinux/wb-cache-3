They built a state-of-the-art refinery in Port Hope, Ontario in 1933. Radium production took place between 1933 and 1940 when World War II closed European markets for radium material. The other byproduct of the company was silver, copper, and uranium salts. Uranium was useless until scientists realized the enormous energy potential of the uranium atom. The company reopened the mine at Port Radium in 1942 to supply the United States military with uranium products. The Canadian Government took over the company by purchasing share control in 1943, and in early 1944 the name was changed to Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited.|$|R

40|$|There {{are various}} {{possibilities}} for radioactive sources {{to end up}} in a shipment of scrap metal. These sources could be artificial ones or for instance tubing from the oil and gas extraction industry containing natural <b>radioactive</b> <b>deposits.</b> In any case, it is undesirable that these sources end up in a smelter or blast-furnace and be mixed with clean material in some new ironwork. Beside the fact that scrap metal dealers do not like to encounter radioactivity in their scrap, the government makes it mandatory starting 2003 for some of the larger traders to examine the incoming shipments. If scrap is delivered by truck this inspection usually is carried out using gate monitors. The truck slowly drives through a corridor with several detectors. If activity is detected an alarm is given. To get a better overview of the gate monitors installed, and to check whether they conform to some minimal requirements or not, an intercomparison campaign is under development. On the basis of measurements with some gate monitors and supporting calculations, the possibility of a list of demands necessary for such an intercomparison was explored.

For purposes including fate and transport studies of radionuclides in the environment, decommissioning and decontamination of radiation facilities, and nuclear forensics, an in situ, nondestructive method for ascertaining the subsurface distribution of radioactivity is desired. The method developed here obtains a polynomial expression for the radioactivity depth profile, using a small set of gamma-ray count rates measured by a collimated detector directed towards the surface at a variety of angles with respect to the surface normal. To demonstrate its capabilities, this polynomial method is applied to the simple case where the radioactivity is maximal at the surface and decreases exponentially with depth below the surface, and to the more difficult case where the maximal radioactivity is below the surface.

50|$|The largest, and {{therefore}} the most <b>radioactive</b> particles, are <b>deposited</b> by fallout {{in the first few}} hours after the blast. Smaller particles are carried to higher altitudes and descend slower, reaching ground in less radioactive state as the isotopes with the shortest half-lives decay the fastest. The smallest particles can reach stratosphere and stay there for weeks, months, even years and reach an entire hemisphere via atmospheric currents. The high-danger, short-term, localized fallout is deposited primarily downwind from the blast site, in a cigar-shaped area, assuming a constant-strength, constant-direction wind. Crosswinds, wind direction changes, and precipitation greatly alter the fallout pattern.|$|R
