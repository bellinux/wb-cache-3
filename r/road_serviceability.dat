30|$|Surface defects {{are visible}} {{indicators}} of <b>road</b> <b>serviceability</b> and {{are closely related}} to roughness, which is often utilized for road condition evaluations. There are a variety of available remote sensing applications for the identification, measurement, and classification of surface defects and thus, also to provide estimations of road roughness. The following subsections describe the usual features associated with surface defects that may be identified with remote sensing methods.|$|E
40|$|The {{decrease}} of <b>road</b> <b>serviceability</b> {{is indicated by}} the increase in types and severity level of road damage. This could be contributed by several factors, such as flooding due to poor drainage system, excessive loads and low quality of construction. This study aims to evaluate the influence of flood, excessive loads and quality of road construction towards the <b>road</b> <b>serviceability</b> by reviewing flood-prone roads and roads that suffered excessive loads. The study was conducted at Jalan Raya Timur Kendal km 25 + 600 - 27 + 800 in Central Java Province. Data were obtained through road condition survey and drainage condition observation {{at the time of}} flooded, post-flood and during 3 -month maintenance works. Secondary data, such as SDI (Surface Distress Index) and IRI (International Roughness Index), traffic loads, and rainfall, were also collected to support the analysis. The results show that there is an empirical significant impact of the flooding exacerbated by excessive loads on the road damage. Strategic efforts and coordination of relevant ministries are required to address this problem...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{functions}} {{required for}} a pavement management system (PMS) {{is its ability to}} evaluate and predict future pavement conditions within an analysis period. This evaluation involves the use of pavement performance indicators and performance prediction models. While performance indicators deal with evaluation of pavement structural and functional performance from different perspectives of <b>road</b> <b>serviceability</b> level, performance prediction models are used to relate future pavement conditions with its current condition in conjunction with a number of influential factors such as age, traffic, and pavement structural and environmental conditions. This paper presents the performance indicators and their prediction models used in the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario’s PMS (MTO PMS). This paper covers the main issues related to pavement evaluation indicators and pavement condition prediction models, with the emphasis on examination of the general properties of the individual indicators such as sensitivity, rationality, economy and practicality. A list of pavement condition evaluation indicators used in MTO PMS for measuring and predicting pavement performance are analyzed by road functional class, pavement structure and surface type.

Well-planned highway projects add to the quality of life. The main question is how to provide innovative and high <b>serviceability</b> <b>roads</b> all by preserving the environment. In this paper, the practical and conceptual aspects of sustainable highway are presented. Additionally, it is pointed out how traditional highway construction pro-cess can be improved by incorporating the basic guidelines of sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|A {{landslip}} in {{the village}} of Stanton Lees, Derbyshire, UK, was reported in November 2000 following a period of torrential rainfall. The slip resulted in the gradual and progressive down-slope movement of a relatively steeply sloping embankment that had supported an existing gabion retaining wall and a minor road which was subsequently closed to vehicular traffic. This paper describes the site, an interpretation of the ground conditions, onsite monitoring data and the design and construction of the remedial works necessary to return the <b>road</b> to <b>serviceability.</b> The landslip occurred due to the superficial deposits moving over the weathered bedrock under conditions of elevated groundwater following a period of heavy rainfall. Autumn 2000 was the wettest season since local records began in 1870. A stability analysis indicated that the embankment slope was at limiting equilibrium and was particularly sensitive to relatively minor fluctuations in the groundwater levels. The remedial works involved replacing the existing gabion wall with a cantilevered, 600 -mm diameter, bored pile retaining wall that comprised two rows of piles, staggered in plan arrangement, and located along the southern verge of the road...|$|R
40|$|A good road {{structure}} may help {{in reducing the}} number of accident. Wearing course is the top layer of {{road structure}} which is the layer that exposed to the vehicle tires and environment. The International Roughness Index (IRI) and Present Serviceability Index (PSI) are both index that can be used as indicators of <b>road</b> roughness and <b>serviceability.</b> IRI was measured by using the walking profilometer. PSI data was collected manually. Both IRI and PSI was measured along the 100 m section of road. This study only focused on one type of road which was asphaltic pavement located in UTM (University Teknologi Malaysia). The objectives of this study are to determine the IRI, PSI and relationship between IRI and PSI. The statistical analysis which is R 2 value was used to evaluate the relationship between IRI and PSI. From this study, {{it was found that the}} IRI value increased when the PSI value is decreased. Mostly, the roughness of tested road for this study is unacceptable based on JKR (Jabatan Kerja Raya) Specification. While the PSI rating shows the tested road for this study is still in good condition...|$|R
40|$|Life cycle cost {{analysis}} of existing road {{is becoming more}} significant to determine the proper time of maintenance and the proper action, which should be taken for maintenance. An efficient maintenance policy is essential for a cost-effective, comfortable and safe transportation system. But, the decision to maintain the road facilities, consider {{a number of possible}} ways from routine maintenance action to reconstruction of the road network. Moreover, an economic analysis of a road network is dependent upon a number of factors, which are responsible for deciding <b>road</b> <b>serviceability</b> level. Optimization model is an analytical model, which helps to make a cost benefit analysis and compare that with various possible alternatives to give out the best possible activity within the allocated budget, before being carried out in field work. In the present study, the aim was to develop a general optimization model to give the most cost-effective activity. The choice of maintenance action is divided in four groups from no action to rehabilitation. Various factors like traffic growth, environmental conditions are taken into account, along with the International Roughness Index (IRI). ‘C’ language program is used to formulate the model...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the current research}} related to the speed of traffic flow on the <b>roads</b> of high <b>serviceability.</b> It analyses the speed of vehicle {{as one of the}} main causes of traffic accidents. A flat four-lane motorway section, motorway section in the tunnel and a city bypass section were chosen for this research, and several speed limit scenarios for the vehicles have been applied with the aid of variable signalling. The survey results show that few vehicles respect the speed limits in traffic {{in the case of a}} straight section of motorway or city stretch of the motorway which has good geometric elements; however, speed limits are exceptionally well respected in tunnels. Although a large number of drivers do not respect the signs, a certain group of drivers can be influenced by variable signs of limitations, and thus positive changes can be achieved in traffic flow which will result in increasing the traffic safety on the motorways. Thus, increasing the degree of respect for speed limits on the motorways directly affects the increase in the level of traffic safety. It is necessary to influence the group of drivers who do not respect the speed limits with other measures, including repressive ones. </p...|$|R
40|$|With {{the current}} surge in {{national}} economy the industrial traffic has increased many folds {{in terms of}} quantity of load and traffic volume. This results in early deterioration of the <b>roads.</b> Also the <b>serviceability</b> reduces hampering the industry’s supply of raw material and transport of finished goods. An efficient road transportation system is of vitally important for smooth operations of industrial units. Construction of new roads needs an enormous investment. However, once constructed the road network system requires huge resources to maintain serviceability and to ensure safe passage at an appropriate speed and with low VOC (Vehicle Operating Cost). Road maintenance is therefore an essential function and should be carried out on a timely basis. The cost of providing and maintaining the roads for the industrial areas at an acceptable serviceability level is quite high. It is therefore essential for a transportation engineer to attempt establishing an acceptable pavement condition level from economic, safety and environmental point of view. In today's economic environment of constrained budgets, as the existing road infrastructure has aged, a more systematic approach towards determining maintenance and rehabilitation needs is necessary. The efficient pavement management system shall provide objective information and useful analysis to ensure consistent and cost effective decisions related to preservation of existing industrial road network in healthy condition.

40|$|South America’s Amazon River basin {{rainforest}} contains {{perhaps the}} world’s greatest abundance of life, supporting {{over half of}} all known species of plants. Over the millennia, organic materials of similar origin have become buried and transformed into deep reservoirs of heavy crude oil. Commercial quantities are available within the Amazon’s headwaters region in the Colorado-sized country of Ecuador. In a country whose economy is largely dependent on oil, the formidable challenge is one of developing this vital resource in an environmentally sound and responsible manner, recognizing both {{the sensitivity of the}} rainforest and the rights of its indigenous peoples. The “lifeline” of the development (i. e., exploration, recovery, and transport) of the oil resource is the main road which serves as the haul-and-access corridor for personnel and equipment as well as the means by which pipeline is constructed and serviced. Left unsecured, the road could also create a conduit for unwanted colonists - speculators seeking to clear-cut the fragile forest for farmland or livestock pasture. Clearly, the patrolled road must be as narrow and inconspicuous as possible, {{while at the same time}} being economical and functional over the service life of the oilfield, and beyond. These challenges are further compounded by the area’s tropical and geological setting, forcing the project’s planners, engineers and builders to deal with the 500 -cm (200 -in) annual rainfall; weak, saturated, and highly plastic jungle floor subgrade; and acutely limited aggregates. Conventional road construction in this part of the world has been graveled “log corduroy rip-rap” — split tree trunks laid side-by-side, perpendicular to the road alignment like so many matchsticks to create a stiffened roadbed. With about 70 percent of the felled timber requirement coming from beyond the road’s edge, this methodology is environmentally prohibitive and economically unfeasible over the long term. A better solution was imperative. This paper describes the design, construction, maintenance, and performance of a 150 -km (90 -mi) long, 6 -meter (20 -ft) wide road comprising dredged river-sand subbase sandwiched between and reinforced by two layers of stiff polymer geogrid, confined along its edges by a non-woven geotextile and topped with a single course of processed, unbound aggregate base/surfacing. By eliminating the use of felled timber, the road’s right-of-way “take” could be minimized, and the resulting environmental and ecological impacts mitigated. Further, the use of geosynthetics permitted maximum structural utilization of precious sand and gravel, reducing borrow and haul requirements as well as enhancing the <b>road’s</b> long-term <b>serviceability,</b> while maintaining the thinnest possible section. Now 10 years after construction, the road continues to perform well. Government officials have realized the benefits of the new geosynthetic technology, and have re-written their environmental regulations for road building to encourage its use...|$|R
