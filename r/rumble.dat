5|$|Former WWF Champion Randy Savage was {{the last}} wrestler to enter the match. The wrestlers fought and several men were {{eliminated}} in quick succession, leaving Backlund, Martel, Yokozuna, and Savage. Backlund eliminated Martel but was then eliminated by Yokozuna. Backlund was in the ring for one hour, one minute, and ten seconds, which set a new record for time spent in a Royal <b>Rumble</b> match. Savage gained the advantage over Yokozuna; he knocked him down and performed a diving elbow drop from the top rope. He tried to pin Yokozuna, although pinfalls are not counted during a Royal <b>Rumble.</b> Yokozuna pushed Savage off of him so hard that Savage flew over the top rope and onto the arena floor. As a result, Yokozuna was named {{the winner of the}} 1993 Royal <b>Rumble</b> match. During the match, he eliminated seven wrestlers, which broke the previous record for most eliminations in a Royal <b>Rumble</b> match.|$|E
