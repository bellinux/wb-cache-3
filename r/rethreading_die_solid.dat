40|$|Due to {{the high}} cost of metal forming tools (especially in hot extrusion), one of the major goals in tool design is a longer service life.

Fracture and wear usually coexist as failure modes, and final die breakdown occurs due to the mechanism that becomes dominant. Therefore, a competing fracture-wear, model has been later developed to represent the complete die failure situation. Attempt has been made to correlate the stochastic nature of various fatigue and wear related die parameters to die life.

Analysis revealed no consistent pattern of association between birth weight and subsequent cancer death. Girls who <b>died</b> of <b>solid</b> tumors between ages 1 and 10 had a significantly higher mean birth weight and an excess of high birth weights separate from the influence of maternal age, birth order, and socioeco-nomic status. Boys who <b>died</b> of <b>solid</b> tumors between birth and 2 years had a significantly lower mean birth weight and exhibited a significant, progressive linear decrease in representation across the birth-weight distribution in the controlled analysis. However, this study, the largest to date, did not support previous claims that birth weight may be an important predictor of childhood cancer risk. -JNCI 1987; 78 : 1095 - 1100. Numerous investigations have found elevated birth weight among children with leukemia and other cancers (1 - 7). However, only one of these studies (5) used an appropriate comparison group (i. e., one that survived past infancy and thereby excluded the low-birth-weight neonatal deaths) and also controlled for potentially con-founding effects of maternal age, birth order, and socio-economic status. The present report, the largest study to date, analyzes the relation between birth weight and childhood cancer before age 15 in Great Britain from 1965 to 1970. Matched controls, alive at the time of the case child's death, constituted an appropriate comparison group, and information on confounding factors was available for both cases and controls. To investigate the hypothe-sis that elevated birth weight characterizes children dying from cancer, we compared mean birth weights of case and control children and also employed a Mantel-Haenszel approach to contrast the birth-weight distribu-tions of these groups.

After {{gaining a}} huge success in {{applying}} stamping simulations and formability analysis to validate die face developments, GM moves forward to winning total manufacturability in stamping process. Of which, ensuring die structure integrity and minimizing weight {{is one of the}} important initiatives. Stamping <b>die</b> design (or <b>solid</b> modeling of stamping dies) was traditionally conducted by following the die design manuals and standards. For any design changes beyond the standards, however, there are no math-based tools available to die designers to verify the outcome of the changes. Die structural analysis (DSA) provides a math-tool to validate the design changes and quantify the safety factors. Several years ago, GM Manufacturing Engineering – Die Center started die structural analysis to meet the increasing demands of customer needs in various areas: (1) to validate design changes; (2) to identify root cause of die breakage during the tryout and stamping operations and propose repair schemes; (3) to optimize the die design for weight reduction; (4) to improve press throughput via optimizing the scrap chute openings, and (5) to provide a math-based tool to validate revisions to the current die design standards. In the integrated forming and die structural analysis, after successful line die surface developments, the forming loads (binder force, pad force, and forming tonnages) are extracted from forming simulations and applied to <b>solid</b> <b>die</b> members for structural analyses of stress, strains, and deflections. In the past few years, Die Center conducted static, dynamic and fatigue analysis for many dies that covers the die design changes requested by die design, die construction and stamping plants.

The cutting surface of the die is the edge of {{hardened}} steel strips, known as steel rule. These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the steel rule to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die.

The substance of MPF is replacing the conventional <b>solid</b> <b>dies</b> {{by a set}} of discrete punches called ‘‘punch group’’. Because the reconfigurable discrete punches are used, part manufacturing costs are reduced and manufacturing time is shortened. However due to the discrete contacts between the workpiece and punches, the dimple defects occurred, which are inevitable and particular for MPF. For thick plate, the surface defect is the mainly dimple defect during its MPF process. In this study, elastic cushion was proposed to prevent these surface defects. The dynamic explicit finite element method was chosen to implement the simulation of MPF process. The Hill’s anisotropic yield criterion was used to describe the workpiece material behavior, and the elastic cushion was described with using the hyperelastic material model. The method to determine each punch position to construct forming surface was introduced. The MPF process with and without using elastic cushion was simulated to study the effect of the elastic cushion on preventing the surface defects.

Special emphasis is given to uniaxial <b>die</b> pressing of <b>solid</b> lubricant particles mixed with matrix powders and to metal injection moulding associated with in situ generation of solid lubricant particles. Initially, a microstructural model/processing route (powder injection moulding followed by plasma-assisted debinding and sintering) produced a homogeneous dispersion of in situ generated solid lubricant particles. Micrometric nodules of graphite with diameter smaller than 20 μm were formed, constituting a nanostructured stacking of graphite foils with nanometric thickness. Micro Raman analysis indicated that the graphite nodules were composed of turbostratic 2 D graphite having highly misaligned graphene planes separated by large interlamellae distance. Large interplanar distance between the graphene foils and misalignment of these foils were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and were, probably, {{the origin of the}} outstandingly low dry friction coefficient (0.04). The effect of sintering temperature, precursor content, metallic matrix composition and surface finish is also reported. Furthermore, the influence of a double-pressing/double-sintering (DPDS) technique on the tribological performance of self-lubricating uniaxially die-pressed hBN + graphite-Fe-Si-C-Mo composite is also investigated.

These results were incorporated into the description of the paste’s rheological response to temperature. The thermal and rheological parameters yielded by the above characterisations were incorporated into a 2 -D axisymmetric model of the TPP die system using the finite element method (FEM). The numerical code performance was compared against three suitable benchmark problems reported in the literature. The results from one case concerning the melting of gallium in a square cavity revealed a possible cause of circulation cell instability observed in many numerical results, but not respond experimentally. Predictions from the numerical simulations were compared with equivalent experimental data from an instrumented TPP die system. The formulation variations demonstrate poor to good agreement with experimental data. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract––In extrusion, {{the desired}} shape is {{obtained}} by plastic deformation of the billet material achieved by forcing {{it through a}} die. In any simple homogeneous and uniaxial compression (or tension), the metal flows plastically when the stress reaches {{the value of the}} flow stress. Once the applied force exceeds the shear strength of the material, sticking friction at the container surface becomes the dominant friction mode, and deformation takes place through shear in the bulk of the material. Non homogeneous metal flow through an extrusion die can directly affect product quality, productivity and die life. The complexity of a die profile is an indicator of {{how difficult it is to}} extrude the profile. Some investigations about the effect of die complexity on extrusion pressure, product quality and die life can be found in this published literature. However the effect of profile complexity on metal flow through the extrusion die has not been explored much. such a study can directly contribute toward die design improvement and reduction of extrusion defects related to metal flow. This article investigates the effect of shape complexity on the dead metal zone(DMZ) and metal flow through cold extrusion experiments and finite element simulations on some solid profiles. Experiments were performed using flat face dies & conical dies of different complexities and different billet materials. A 2 D & 3 D finite element simulations were carried out to perform these operations. One significant conclusion is that currently existing definitions of extrusion shape complexity cannot satisfactorily explain the variation in DMZ size under different conditions. The factors such as die profile symmetry and extrusion ratio may play a significant roles in the formation of DMZ and distortion of metal flow through the <b>die.</b> Keywords––Cold extrusion, <b>solid</b> profiles, shape complexity, Dead Metal zone(DMZ),metal flow simulation(FEM) I...|$|R
40|$|Cellular ceramics, {{possessing}} both open {{or closed}} porosity, find use in several demanding engineering applications {{because of their}} favorable set of properties. [1] Several processing methods have been proposed for their fabrication, including the replication {{of the structure of}} polymeric foams, direct blowing, the use of sacrificial fillers, extrusion through special <b>dies</b> (for honeycombs), <b>solid</b> freeform techniques, the mimicking of natural templates (e. g. wood) or the assemblage of fibers or hollow bodies. [2, 3] Preceramic polymers, in particular silicones, have been successfully used for obtaining ceramic components (such as foams and membranes) possessing a large amount of porosity, in the micro-, meso- and macro-size scale. [4, and references therein] However, some of the fabrication methods have some limitations: for instance, direct foaming techniques often lead to a gradient in the porosity amount and pore size along the main expansion axis;[5, 6] the infiltration of a silicone resin within organic sacrificial fillers requires a burn out step that has to be carried out in a very controlled fashion in order to produce components without defects (besides often requiring warm pressing – depending on the rheological characteristics of the preceramic polymer – to obtain a well controlled morphology), thus limiting {{the size and shape of}} the component that can be produced;[7] the use of supercritical CO 2 is regulated by the diffusion within the solid polymer, and works well only for components of limited thickness. [8] In recent years, it has been shown that blending preceramic polymers with different characteristics (molecular weight, molecular architecture, ceramic yield) allows to produce cellular ceramics. [9, 10] This paper further explores this possibility, with the specific aim of directly developing a large amount of porosity within the resulting ceramic body during a one-step pyrolysis treatment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{analysis}} of extruded products by Forge 2009 ® and EBSD produced by the investigator in the BOAL plant. The 3 D FEM module was used to study the required load, the temperature evolution, surface formation of the extrudate and material flow during the process. The effect of varying process conditions on the selected geometries were investigated and verified by means of experiment. Considering the difficulty in performing the experiments (high temperature and high strain rates) the simulation results can {{be considered to be}} acceptable. The simulations were performed with the implicit finite element code Forge 2009 ® with user input written in Visual Fortran®. Alloy EN AW- 6082 was selected on the basis that is a commonly used extrusion material in industry. A range of simulations were designed which would produce differing structures to those experienced within the industry. The effect of variation of the bridge design for hollow dies and the effect of variation of the sink in for <b>solid</b> <b>dies</b> was investigated. 3 D simulations were performed to investigate the effect of these variations in the design features on extrusion process parameters. The process parameters which are likely to be affected are load, deflection, velocity and temperature. The results indicated that the design of the die affected the process parameters. The microstructure evolution during the extrusion process was investigated for the selected complex geometries. The following microstructure features were included in the investigations: Recrystallised grain size, subgrain size, misorientation, dislocation density and volume fraction recrystallised. Simulations were performed using physically-based mathematical microstructure models integrated into FEM through its Fortran® subroutine interface. Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of varying process conditions on the microstructure. For hollow section, the emphasis was placed on the study of the complicated metal flow and the seam welding quality. EBSD analyses were performed to investigate the substructure. Surface cracking was modelled and compared with experiments. The agreement between the predicted microstructures using associated models and experimental measurements were acceptable. Predicted cracking show good correlation with experimental result...|$|R
