40|$|We propose an {{integrative}} {{cognitive neuroscience}} {{framework for understanding}} the cognitive and neural foundations of <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> Our analysis reveals 3 psychological dimensions of <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> (God's perceived level of involvement, God's perceived emotion, and doctrinal/experiential religious knowledge), which functional MRI localizes within networks processing Theory of Mind regarding intent and emotion, abstract semantics, and imagery.

40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss what}} Cognitive Science of Religion {{is and what}} its {{implications}} are for theism and the veracity of <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> Findings in CSR, and its counterpart Evolutionary Psychology, aim to explain the origin of <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> Some critics of religion, however, brandish the findings of CSR in support of their agenda. Their arguments attempt to either argue against the truth of religion or the justification for <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> I will argue that neither of these two kinds of arguments accomplishes its goal. Using CSR to falsify <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> commits the genetic fallacy. The evolutionary debunking argument for undermining justification for <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> is a more sophisticated approach, but it fails on account of making too many unjustified assumptions. I outline three brief responses {{to the challenge of}} unjustified religious belie...|$|R
40|$|William Alston {{has written}} that <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> is justifiable because it is based upon epistemic {{practices}} similar to those justifying belief in sensory facts. In this paper I argue for a different understanding of <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> What is called for in <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> is not affirmation of factual truth-claims but devotion to God. The significance and validity of creedal formulae lie in their capacity to elicit and express such devotion, not in their factual and/or informational character. My paper considers four fundamental questions with respect to religious belief: 1. What is a <b>religious</b> <b>belief?</b> 2. What is the basis upon which one should adopt a <b>religious</b> <b>belief?</b> 3. What is the relation between belief and salvation/sanctification? 4. What attitude should one adopt toward alternate belief systems? I argue that these questions are best answered when we recognize the radical dissimilarity of creedal formulae to empirical truth-claims...|$|R

5|$|Roman <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> and how conservative such <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
40|$|The logical {{treatment}} {{of the nature of}} <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> (here I will concentrate on belief in Christianity) has been distorted by the acceptance of a false dilemma. On the one hand, many (e. g., Braithwaite, Hare) have placed the significance of <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> entirely outside the realm of intellectual cognition. According to this view, religious statements do not express factual propositions: they are not made true or false by the ways things are. <b>Religious</b> <b>belief</b> consists in a certain attitude toward the world, life, or other human beings, or in what sorts of things one values. On the other hand, others (such as Swinburne, 1981, Chapers 1 and 4) have taken <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> to include (at least) being certain of the truth of particular factual religious propositions. The strength of a person's <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> is identified with his degree of confidence in the truth of those propositions, measured by the "subjective probability " which those propositions have for that person. I propose a third alternative, according to which, (1) contrary to the first view, <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> does involve a relation to factual religious propositions, such as that God exists, that Jesus was God and man, etc., [...] propositions which are made true or false by the way things actually are [...] but, (2) contrary to the second view, the strength of <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> i...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} an attempt to {{understand}} the nature of <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> through the lens of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s philosophical perspective. Chapter One outlines Wittgenstein’s approach to language and meaning and explores the tension that many contemporary analytic philosophers of religion find in Wittgensteinian approaches to <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> Chapter Two addresses concerns Wittgenstein had with Frege’s understanding of logic and the limits of thought and ties it to criticism from Wittgensteinian philosophers about the possibility of making any sense of <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> Chapter Three pulls together the concerns of the previous two chapters and attempts to reconcile them.

5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E

40|$|Hume's 'Natural History of Religion' {{offers a}} {{naturalized}} {{account of the}} causes of religious thought, an investigation into its 'origins' rather than its 'foundation in reason'.

5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort.

The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b>|$|E
