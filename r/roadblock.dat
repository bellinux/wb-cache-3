5|$|The <b>roadblock</b> was {{preventing}} {{evacuation of}} the wounded. Troops attempted to drive wounded in jeeps through the <b>roadblock,</b> but this exposed them to machine-gun fire. By 16:00 supply columns were also piling {{up at the}} block, unable to proceed as armor and airstrikes attempted to dislodge the North Koreans. Five hundred men from the regiment were gathered waiting to break the <b>roadblock</b> while heavy armor units from Taejon moved against it from the other side. During this time, U.S. troops from the 19th Infantry, desperate to move around the <b>roadblock</b> to obtain supplies and care for wounded, began moving through the surrounding hills. One tank {{was able to make}} it through the <b>roadblock</b> to evacuate the 19th Infantry's wounded commander, but by 19:00 commanders ordered the regiment to move its wounded along the ridges to the east of the <b>roadblock.</b>|$|E

5|$|North Korean troops {{promptly}} {{set up a}} <b>roadblock</b> {{directly behind}} the 19th Infantry's line in its main route of supply along the road {{near the village of}} Tuman, just south of Yusong on Taejon's western outskirts. The <b>roadblock</b> quickly became a serious problem for U.S. forces trying to move ammunition and wounded to and from the Kum River line. Around 13:00 on July 16, the 19th Infantry Regimental commander contacted Dean, who ordered him to break the <b>roadblock.</b> However, North Korean troops had set up at least six machine-gun nests above the road at Tuman, and repeated attacks against it were unable to drive the North Korean troops away.|$|E
50|$|According to Israeli authorities, during 2008-09, a {{significant}} number of checkpoints were removed. As of July 2009, Israeli authorities reported that 27 checkpoints and 140 <b>roadblocks</b> had been removed in order to ease security restrictions in the West Bank. An additional 140 <b>roadblocks</b> were said to have been opened to traffic in 2008. As of 2009, there were 504 dirt <b>roadblocks</b> and 14 checkpoints in the West Bank.|$|R

5000|$|The Schuster Line {{consisted}} of 41 sets of concrete blocks and iron gates; 18 bridgeblocks on the German border, 18 <b>roadblocks</b> on the German border, and five <b>roadblocks</b> on the French border. The <b>roadblocks</b> {{were set up}} a mile inland in a zigzag pattern covered by barbed wire entanglements on either side. Nine radio outposts were erected along the German border, with a central receiving station in the St. Espirit barracks in the capital.|$|R
5|$|On 10 April, Rane got {{up early}} and resumed work on an {{obstacle}} {{that had not been}} cleared the previous night. Within a span of two hours, he cleared the <b>roadblock</b> of five large pine trees in the midst of mines and machine-gun fire. This allowed the 4th Dogra Battalion to advance another thirteen kilometers until it encountered another major <b>roadblock.</b> The Pakistani forces were situated on the adjoining hills and able to fire on all approaches to the block, making its destruction problematic. Rane drove a tank to the <b>roadblock</b> and took cover behind the tank while blasting open the <b>roadblock</b> with mines, opening the road {{before the end of the}} night.|$|E
5|$|Operating at the Kum River {{during the}} Battle of Taejon, {{troops of the}} U.S. Army's 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, were cut off from {{resupply}} by a <b>roadblock</b> established by North Korean troops of the NK 3rd Division. The <b>roadblock</b> proved difficult to break, and forced U.S. troops to move through nearby mountains to evacuate their wounded.|$|E
5|$|While the Chinese {{were making}} a {{concentrated}} attack against the South Korean front, the North Korean forces that had infiltrated the UN rear were cutting the South Korean withdrawal route. In {{the days before the}} Chinese Third Phase Campaign, the KPA II Corps established a major <b>roadblock</b> to the north of Hoengsong with an estimated strength of 10,000 soldiers, which blocked the retreat of the ROK III Corps. In response, the ROK II Corps and the US 2nd Infantry Division conducted a siege operation against the <b>roadblock</b> from both the north and the south, and the <b>roadblock</b> was forced open by January 2. Although the UN forces managed to eliminate a North Korean division at the <b>roadblock,</b> the ROK II Corps was nearly destroyed during the fighting, and it was disbanded on January 10.|$|E
50|$|Kimhi and Sagy {{investigated}} {{the association between}} moral justification of army <b>roadblocks</b> and Israeli soldiers' feelings of adjustment.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 30, the 9th Infantry Regiment led the {{withdrawal}} by attacking the <b>roadblock.</b> Four tanks were first sent {{down the road and}} the Chinese held their fire. Encouraged by this development, Colonel Sloane ordered the 9th Infantry Regiment to press forward, but Chinese machine gun and mortar fire immediately stopped the advance at 9 a.m. The ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment attached to the 2nd Infantry Division was sent to reinforce the US 9th Infantry Regiment, but it was routed by friendly fire. With no contacts between the American commands and the British units, the Middlesex Regiment advanced to {{the south end of the}} valley without attacking the <b>roadblock.</b> Believing that the <b>roadblock</b> was short and the British were attacking up the road, Keiser ordered the 2nd Infantry Division to run through the blockade at 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Infantry Division, however, did {{not know}} the {{strength}} of the <b>roadblock</b> on the night of November 29. At the same time, the US 25th Infantry Division Military Police mistakenly reported that the alternative retreat route from Kunu-ri to Anju was also blocked by Chinese. Later, Coulter ordered Keiser to withdraw by breaking the <b>roadblock</b> with the 27th Commonwealth Brigade. On the early morning of November 30, Keiser made the decision to withdraw through the valley.|$|E

5|$|The next day, American M24 tanks {{attacked}} the <b>roadblock</b> behind the 2nd Battalion {{four times in}} an attempt to break it, but all were unsuccessful, and Lieutenant Colonel Eugene J. Field, the 2nd Battalion commander, was wounded at the <b>roadblock.</b> Palmer sent the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, and the 16th Reconnaissance Company toward the cut-off battalion. By 12:00, North Korean troops were attacking the 99th and 61st Field Artillery Battalions which were supporting the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, indicating that the North Korean infiltration had been extensive by that point.|$|E
