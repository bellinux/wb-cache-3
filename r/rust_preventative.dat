2500|$|Several months later, in February 1924, Judge Thayer {{asked one}} of the {{firearms}} experts for the prosecution, Capt. Charles Van Amburgh, to reinspect Sacco's Colt and determine its condition. With District Attorney Katzmann present, Van Amburgh took the gun from the clerk and started to take it apart. Van Amburgh quickly noticed that the barrel to Sacco's gun was brand new, being still covered in the manufacturer's protective <b>rust</b> <b>preventative.</b> Judge Thayer began private hearings to determine who had tampered with the evidence by switching the barrel on Sacco's gun. During three weeks of hearings, Albert Hamilton and Captain Van Amburgh squared off, challenging each other's authority. [...] Testimony suggested that Sacco's gun had been treated with little care, and frequently disassembled for inspection. [...] New defense attorney William Thompson insisted that no one on his side could have switched the barrels [...] "unless they wanted to run their necks into a noose." [...] Albert Hamilton swore he had only taken the gun apart while being watched by Judge Thayer. [...] Judge Thayer made no finding as to who had switched the [...]32 Colt barrels, but ordered the rusty barrel returned to Sacco's Colt. [...] After the hearing concluded, unannounced to Judge Thayer, Captain Van Amburgh took both Sacco's and Vanzetti's guns, along with the bullets and shells involved in the crime to his home where he kept them until a Boston Globe expose revealed the misappropriation in 1960. [...] Meanwhile, Van Amburgh bolstered his own credentials by writing an article on the case for True Detective Mysteries. [...] The 1935 article charged that prior to the discovery of the gun barrel switch, Albert Hamilton had tried to walk out of the courtroom with Sacco's gun but was stopped by Judge Thayer. [...] Although several historians of the case, including Francis Russell, have reported this story as factual, nowhere in transcripts of the private hearing on the gun barrel switch was this incident ever mentioned. [...] The same year the True Detective article was published, a study of ballistics in the case concluded, [...] "what might have been almost indubitable evidence was in fact rendered more than useless by the bungling of the experts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pennsylvania Meadville, PA The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) fined Veolia ES Solid Waste of Pennsylvania Inc. $160,278 for {{violations}} related to vehicle licensing {{and failing to}} abide by the terms of its permit and more than $11,200 for residual and municipal waste violations amid complaints a Veolia truck driver draining an estimated 100 gallons of dilute coolant and <b>rust</b> <b>preventative</b> into a storm drain leading to the Driftwood Branch of Sinnemahoning Creek.

5000|$|Popular {{explanations}} {{of the use of}} the word [...] "Brown" [...] include that it was a reference to either the colour of the walnut stocks, or to the characteristic brown colour that was produced by russeting, an early form of metal treatment. Others argue that mass-produced weapons of the time were coated in brown varnish on metal parts as a <b>rust</b> <b>preventative</b> and on wood as a sealer (or in the case of unscrupulous contractors, to disguise inferior or non-regulation types of wood). However, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) notes that [...] "browning" [...] was only introduced in the early 19th century, well after the term had come into general use. the author confuses simple varnishing with the browning of metal, two entirely different things ...|$|E

Soon the manufacturers of shaving soap, paint, lubricants, perfume, plant sprays, hand creams, spot removers, water repellents, weedkillers, and <b>rust</b> <b>preventatives</b> were packaging their products in aerosol bombs. Even whipped cream is stored in them under refrigeration.|$|R
5000|$|Some vehicle {{manufacturers}} provide mounting points {{in some of}} their vehicles designed to accept cargo barriers. [...] In other cases, for reasons of safety, rather than utilizing mounting points designed for child restraints and other purposes, many cargo barriers require specialized mounting brackets, sockets, <b>rust</b> <b>preventatives</b> and trim accessories to be fitted to the vehicle. In these cases, manufacturers may recommend that installation is performed by a trained fitter, as high technical competence is required to correctly install such mounting equipment. A trained fitter may require {{a few hours to}} perform such an installation.|$|R

40|$|Because {{of health}} and {{environmental}} concerns, many regulations have been passed in recent years {{regarding the use of}} chlorinated solvents. The Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant has had an active program to find alternatives for these solvents used in cleaning applications for the past 7 years. During this time frame, the quantity of solvents purchased has been reduced by 92 %. The program has been a twofold effort. Vapor degreasers used in batch cleaning-operations have been replaced by ultrasonic cleaning with aqueous detergent, and other organic solvents have been identified for use in hand-wiping or specialty operations. In order to qualify these alternatives for use, experimentation was conducted on cleaning ability as well as effects on subsequent operations such as welding, painting and bonding. Cleaning ability was determined using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) which are capable of examining monolayer levels of contamination on a surface. Solvents have been identified for removal of <b>rust</b> <b>preventative</b> oils, lapping oils, machining coolants, lubricants, greases, and mold releases. Solvents have also been evaluated for cleaning urethane foam spray guns, swelling of urethanes and swelling of epoxies...|$|E
