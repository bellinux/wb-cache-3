A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event.|$|E
25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} SCNT {{is used for}} cloning is because somatic cells can be easily {{acquired}} and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s somatic cell nucleus. The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, {{the same way it}} would on sperm cells.|$|E

500|$|Dave Mustaine {{served as}} the lead guitarist for Metallica during their early days. However, due to drinking, {{substance}} abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with band mates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was soon fired from Metallica. Two months after being dismissed, he and bassist David Ellefson formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: [...] "After getting fired from Metallica, all I <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them." [...] Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as [...] "Mechanix", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced [...] "The Four Horsemen". Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to [...] "straighten Metallica up", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and {{said he could not}} play guitar.|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E

A useful rule of thumb to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> 50Ω at 1Hz bandwidth correspond to 1nV noise at room temperature.|$|E

5000|$|After officially {{ordering}} <b>that</b> Tsarnaev <b>be</b> executed, O'Toole told him, [...] "No {{one will}} <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> your teachers <b>were</b> fond of you, <b>that</b> you <b>were</b> funny, a good athlete... Whenever {{your name is}} mentioned, what will <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> the evil you have done.... What will <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you murdered and maimed... It was a monstrous self-deception. You had to forget your own humanity. The common humanity you shared with your brother Tamerlan." ...|$|R
2500|$|Michael Jerryson, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Ohio's Youngstown State University and {{co-editor of}} the book Buddhist Warfare, said that [...] "Buddhism differs in {{that the act of}} killing is less the focus than the 'intention' behind the killing" [...] and [...] "The first thing to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people have a penchant for violence, {{it just so happens that}} every {{religion}} has people in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1969 – Kimball {{released}} his book The Miracle of Forgiveness, {{in which he}} teaches that masturbation can lead to acts of homosexuality. His book was quoted in a 1979 church manual: [...] "the glorious thing to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] is curable .... Certainly it can be overcome .... How can you say the door cannot be opened until your knuckles are bloody, till your head is bruised, till your muscles are sore?" [...] Kimball viewed many homosexuals as [...] "basically good people who have become trapped in sin" [...] and that [...] "some totally conquer homosexuality in a few months." [...] However, {{he also says that}} homosexual behavior can lead to sex with animals.|$|E
2500|$|Rebbe Nachman {{also wrote}} Sefer HaGanuz ("The Hidden Book") and the Sefer HaNisraf ("The Burned Book"), {{neither of which}} is extant. Rebbe Nachman told his disciples that these volumes {{contained}} deep mystical insights that few {{would be able to}} comprehend. While he dictated the Sefer HaNisraf to Reb Noson, the latter said that he did not understand it at all; later he said, [...] "What I do <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it spoke about the greatness of the mitzvah of hospitality and preparing the bed for a guest". Rebbe Nachman never showed the Sefer HaGanuz to anyone. In 1808 Rebbe Nachman burned all the copies of the Sefer HaGanuz and the Sefer Ha-nisraf.|$|E

Poor M. Claude was utterly forgotten.|$|R
2500|$|More particularly, two {{incidents}} involving Trudeau <b>are</b> <b>remembered</b> {{as having}} fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During {{a visit to}} Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met {{with a group of}} farmers who were protesting the Canadian Wheat Board. The widely <b>remembered</b> perception <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with [...] "Why should I sell your wheat?"– however, he had asked the question rhetorically and then proceeded to answer it himself. Years later, on a train trip through Salmon Arm, British Columbia, he [...] "gave the finger" [...] to a group of protesters through the carriage window– less widely <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the protesters <b>were</b> shouting anti-French slogans at the train.|$|R

Faster!' but Alice felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.|$|R
2500|$|After {{his return}} in 1855, Hunt founded the first American {{architectural}} school at his Tenth Street Studio Building (beginning with only four students), co-founded the American Institute of Architects and from 1888 to 1891 {{served as the}} Institute's third president, brought the first apartment building to Manhattan {{in a burst of}} scandal, and set a new ostentatious style of grand houses for the social elite and the eccentric, competitive new millionaires of the Gilded Age. His philosophy of architectural work may be summed up in his quote [...] "The first thing you've got to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's your client's money you're spending. Your goal is to achieve the best results by following their wishes. If they want you to build a house upside down standing on its chimney, it's up to you to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the chaotic}} situation, {{there is no}} {{consensus}} on the number of people killed during the genocide. Unlike the genocides carried out by Nazi Germany and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, authorities made no attempts to record deaths. The succeeding RPF government has stated that 1,071,000 were killed, 10% of whom were Hutu. The journalist Philip Gourevitch agrees with an estimate of one million, while the UN estimates the death toll to be 800,000. Alex de Waal and Rakiya Omar of African Rights estimate the number to be [...] "around 750,000," [...] while Alison Des Forges of Human Rights Watch stated that it was [...] "at least 500,000." [...] James Smith of Aegis Trust notes, [...] "What's important to <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there was a genocide. There was an attempt to eliminate Tutsis – men, women, and children – and to erase any memory of their existence." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is tempting}} to {{speculate}} on the possible origin of such a structure, but {{in view of the}} complexity of the history of carbonaceous chondrites it is probably also of little value. What may <b>be</b> worth <b>remembering</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the mineralogy has similarities to that of certain achondrite fragments recorded in Leoville by Keil, Huss, and Wiik (i 969), and the zoning is reminiscent of gehlenite-spinel zones found round calcium-rich achondrite fragments in Vigarano (Michel-L 6 vy, 1968) ...|$|R
50|$|The park next {{hosted the}} July classic in 1950, a game best remembered for Ted Williams' {{collision}} with the outfield wall that broke his elbow and ended his playing season. Less <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it began a turnaround for the Nationals, {{who won the}} game in extra innings and started to win frequently, a trend that continued {{for more than three}} decades, building up an astounding 30 wins against only 6 losses and 1 tie (during 1959-1962, two games were held each year).|$|R
6000|$|... "Why you--you little--fool!" [...] he exclaimed, with emotion. And that emotion {{seemed to}} exasperate him. Turning away from her, he gazed {{out between the}} logs.

6000|$|The {{next thing}} I <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was morning: breakfast was just over: Sylvie was lifting Bruno {{down from a}} high chair, and saying to a Spaniel, who was {{regarding}} them with a most benevolent smile, [...] "Yes, thank you we've had a very nice breakfast. Haven't we, Bruno?" ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{another reason}} that the Logan Rock of Treen <b>is</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{the center of a}} famous drama. In April 1824, Lieutenant Hugh Goldsmith, R. N. (nephew of the famous poet Oliver Goldsmith), and 10 or 12 of his crew of the cutter HMS Nimble, armed with bars and levers, rocked the huge granite boulder until it fell from its cliff-top perch. Goldsmith was {{apparently}} motivated to disprove the claim of Dr. Borlase, who wrote in Antiquities of Cornwall in 1754 that: ...|$|R

The narrator's wife is upset, believing he was with another woman that night.

50|$|Bishop {{emerges in}} the 90's; however, {{due to the}} trauma of his time-travelling, he has amnesia and cannot recall who the target or the assassin <b>is.</b> All he <b>remembers</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an X-Man <b>is</b> the killer, and {{he was sent to}} {{terminate}} him. After hijacking a bus, Bishop crashes through the doors of the X-Mansion and engages the team. He defeats most of them; however, Wolverine gets the jump on him, which triggers some of his memories. Professor X stops Wolverine from killing Bishop, and instead the X-Men interrogate him about his mission.|$|R
5000|$|After {{only one}} {{series of the}} programme, Simon Woodroffe left the panel. Woodroffe stated that the reason behind his {{departure}} was [...] "The show became a battle of egos — not a forum for business innovation.
