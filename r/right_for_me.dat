Individually, I {{was not ready to}} accept that {{responsibility}} quite yet. Going through the playoffs and having that experience has probably given me more confidence. I understand {{there is going to be}} a lot more responsibility on my shoulders with this, but it's something I'm ready for, I feel very comfortable with it and I'm just excited to get things going." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What a video!" [...] Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody enthused to Q. [...] "I {{have become}} obsessed with it {{and not just because}} I'm in love with Kimbra. Gotye himself is an {{engaging}} character for sure... his solemnly expressive eyes finish a journey his lyrics only begin. 'Told myself that you were <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> but felt so lonely in your company' – simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the title line when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality: 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice. Oh, and Kimbra... my poor heart..." ...|$|E
500|$|LeMond has {{acknowledged}} since 2010 that the increasing prevalence of doping in cycling {{contributed to his}} lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: [...] "Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me. At the time, the team I was on, Team Z, {{became more and more}} demanding, more and more concerned..." [...] He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again. LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: [...] "I figure I had three months that went <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> after the hunting accident," [...] three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. [...] "The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones, who {{had always}} envisaged herself playing Rachel Bailey when {{the idea of the}} project came in to mind, was given the role, though at the programme's {{pre-production}} stages the character had a different first name, Cathy. It was originally intended that Lindsay would star with Jones in Scott & Bailey, but she became pregnant with twins, so the role of Janet was given to Lesley Sharp instead; Lindsay received the smaller role of Rachel's sister, Alison. Lindsay approved of Sharp playing the role; Jones also felt pleased at the prospect of working with Sharp, saying [...] "I was really excited {{on the day of the}} read-through". Sharp's husband Nicholas Gleaves was awarded the role of Scott's lover, DS Andy Roper. Despite the actors' relationship, Sharp stated that it was not a contributing factor in his casting, stating: [...] "Nick's an actor and I'm an actress— we don't have the same agent. There's a script with a role in it that was right for him and it so happened that there was a role that was <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and we both got cast, but it wasn't a conversation that we had that it would be a good idea if we did a television series together because that's not the way life works".|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{wrote the}} role of Earl Partridge for Jason Robards, but Robards was {{initially}} unable {{to do it because}} of a serious staph infection. Anderson approached George C. Scott, who turned him down. Eventually, Robards was able to do the film. Robards said of his character, [...] "It was sort of prophetic that I be asked to play a guy going out in life. It was just so <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do this and bring what I know to it". According to Hall, much of the material with Partridge was based on Anderson watching his father die of cancer.|$|E
2500|$|... "Start All Over", a song co-written by Dobson and {{featuring}} her on background vocals, {{was recorded}} by Miley Cyrus for her album [...] (2007) {{and was released}} as a single, reaching number 57 on the Billboard Pop 100. During a 2009 interview Dobson said, [...] "I wrote a song, she dug it, and she sang it. But I didn't want it for my record. It just wasn't <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and I just {{felt like it was}} better for someone else, and she does a great job on it. I was really impressed. She sounded great. I'm actually happier she did it than I did it." ...|$|E

The referendum was held on 23 June 2016 and the British electorate voted by 52% to 48% in favour of leaving the European Union. On 24 June, a few hours after the results became known, Cameron announced that he would resign the office of Prime Minister by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016. In a farewell speech outside 10 Downing Street, he stated that, on account of his own advocacy on behalf of remaining in the EU, [...] "I do not think it would be <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination." ...|$|E
