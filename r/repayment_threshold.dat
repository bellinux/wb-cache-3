40|$|In early 2008 {{the federal}} {{government}} instructed the Productivity Commission (PC) to enquire into {{the social and economic}} policy issue of paid parental leave (PPL). In their draft report, the PC (2008) has called for a taxpayer funded scheme of 18 weeks duration, despite Australian governments having so far resisted the introduction of a broad grants-based system. A case for government subsidy of PPL can be made on the basis that the social benefits exceed the advantages accruing directly to families. However, as there are also indisputable private benefits accruing to the parents taking leave, there is a case for private contributions. We identify a market failure in that commercial banks will not provide funds in the absence of collateral due to repayment uncertainty during parental leave, a situation quite similar to the market failure inherent with respect to the financing of tuition for higher education (Gans, 2008). To address this financing impasse, we consider how an income contingent loan (ICL) could be used as an optional supplement to a taxpayer funded PPL scheme. Moral hazard and adverse selection are critical policy issues and these are addressed in the scheme design by: restricting loan duration and size; restricting eligibility to parents with workforce attachment; reducing minimum <b>repayment</b> <b>thresholds</b> to below those of HECS; imposing a loan surcharge, and; making the debt an obligation of both parents. We explain and present simulations of debt, repayment and subsidies for different households. The results show that an optional top-up ICL would not require major contributions from taxpayers, yet would introduce flexibility and choice, and provide consumption-smoothing and lifetime income distribution advantages over possible alternatives. paid parental leave; income contingent loans; public policy; industrial relations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} changes to Australia’s student financing system on various hypothetical students who choose the Government’s proposed deferred payment options, HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP. The present values of their HECS repayments under the existing (2004) system are compared with the present values of repayments under various alternative systems. These alternative systems relate to increasing the HECS charge by 25 per cent for HECS-HELP students and introducing a fee paid with a debt of $ 12, 500 per year for FEE-HELP students. For HECS-HELP students {{it is found that}} the impact of an increase of 25 per cent in the charge is likely to be small. For example, we show that for ‘average’ males and females, an increase of 25 per cent in the HECS charge will result in a much smaller true financial cost than this. Further, graduates earning relatively low incomes are protected from the 25 per cent increase in the HECS charge by the higher <b>repayment</b> <b>thresholds</b> and they (especially female graduates) will pay substantially less HECS compared with the current system. High income graduates, however, will experience true price increases which are considerable and of the order of 20 per cent or more. For FEE-HELP students, not surprisingly, the present values of HECS repayments are substantial given debt accumulations of $ 12, 500 per year for a four-year period of study [...] However and importantly, it is found that many low-income graduates will not fully repay debts of this amount. As well, because debt totals are to be limited to $ 50, 000 per student it is possible to model the effect of the need for some to pay a proportion of the charge up-front, and it is clear that in this case FEE-HELP adds very substantially to a student’s payment obligation and is also arguably very regressive. A commentary is offered on ways in which the proposed 2005 changes to financing might be improved. HECS, higher education, financing...|$|R

Unlike Australia, New Zealand requires debtors who move overseas to continue loan repayments, however overseas-based borrowers are estimated to be responsible for over 80 per cent of the debt currently in default.

40|$|We use {{the rise}} and {{dispersion}} of sovereign spreads {{to tell the story}} of the emergence and escalation of financial tensions within the eurozone. This process evolved through three stages. Following the onset of the Subprime crisis in July 2007, spreads rose but mainly due to common global factors. The rescue of Bear Stearns in March 2008 marked the start of a distinctively European banking crisis. During this key phase, sovereign spreads tended to rise with the growing demand for support by weakening domestic financial sectors, especially in countries with lower growth prospects and higher debt burdens. As the constraint of continued fiscal commitments became clearer, and coinciding with the nationalization of Anglo Irish in January 2009, the separation between the sovereign and the financial sector disappeared.

Loan payments may not exceed the student’s financial need; there is no other upper limit on the amount borrowed (loan program permits full coverage of tuition and expenses). In the case of applying loan towards both tuition/school fees and in-study living expenses, the lower limit is KRW 600,000 (at least KRW 100,000 for tuition/school fees plus at least KRW 500,000 for living expenses).Under the income contingent repayment system, a borrower does not have to pay the loan principal amount or interest until he or she has income above a certain minimum <b>threshold</b> level for <b>repayment.</b> Once the borrower’s annual income is greater than the <b>repayment</b> minimum <b>threshold</b> level, the borrower is under obligation to begin repayment.|$|R

Our findings suggest that there is a negative marginal relationship between debt and growth at intermediate levels of debt, but not at very low debt levels, below the “debt overhang” threshold, or at very high levels, above the “debt irrelevance” threshold. Countries with good policies and institutions face overhang when debt rises above 15 - 30 percent of GDP, but the marginal effect of debt on growth becomes irrelevant above 70 - 80 percent.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} student loan borrowers living in New Zealand 20 to 50 {{years of age}} with pre-study incomes below the student loan <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold.</b> Summary: The average incomes of these New Zealand student loan borrowers, and their rate of {{increase}} in income, are higher if they complete a higher-level qualification like a diploma or bachelors degree, {{compared to those who}} complete a certificate-level qualification. Women generally have lower average graduate incomes, and lower rates of increase in their income compared to men, although older women completing bachelors degrees have higher income trajectories than their male counterparts. Those on a benefit, indicating some difficulty in accessing the labour market, generally have smaller increases in income on completing the same level of qualification, and relatively flat rates of increase in income after graduating, compared to those not on a benefit, on average. Younger graduates generally have higher rates of increase in their incomes than older graduates, on average. Average incomes increase with time, generally. These factors and their interactions are associated with both whether a low-income student loan borrower living in New Zealand crosses the loan repayment threshold—that is, has an income after study that obliges them to start repaying their student loan—and the timing of when this occurs. Younger men generally have average incomes which are above the loan <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold</b> one year after completing a qualification at any level, and under most circumstances, men have average incomes above the threshold after some years even if they don’t complete their qualification. Only women who complete diploma or bachelors degrees have average incomes above the <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold</b> soon after graduating, though in the longer term, most women’s average graduate incomes cross the <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold,</b> although it is only just above the threshold for those who complete lower-level qualifications. If any individual student loan borrower finds ongoing paid employment after completing their study, they are likely to have an income above the student loan <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold.</b> It is therefore the interplay between their access to the labour market, and how that is facilitated by their qualification, and their personal characteristics and circumstances, which will determine whether they will have sufficient income to be obliged to repay their student loan...|$|E

40|$|Overview Reducing the {{thresholds}} {{at which}} former students repay their {{debt to the}} Higher Education Loan Program would increase repayments by an initial $ 500 million a year and more over time. Without change, HELP costs will soar, putting teaching and research at risk of cuts. An estimated $ 1. 6 billion lent to students in 2014 - 15 – a fifth of all lending under the program that year – will not be repaid. Interest subsidies on outstanding debt add $ 200 {{million a year to}} HELP’s costs, but would be five times higher if interest rates return to previous levels. Reducing the initial <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold</b> to $ 42, 000 next year from its current level of $ 54, 126 would cut interest costs and HELP’s rapidly expanding doubtful debt bill while maintaining the fairness and effectiveness of the program. Since 1989 nearly four million Australians have taken out HELP loans, greatly expanding access to tertiary education. It is a vital program, but today too many borrowers either do not repay what they owe, or take too long to clear their debts. Without change, HELP’s costs will escalate, putting teaching and research at risk of cuts. A major cause of HELP’s problems is that a growing proportion of all graduates work part-time, but most part-time jobs earn less than the current threshold. In addition, vocational education diploma students now get HELP, and are less likely than higher education graduates to earn the <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold</b> of $ 54, 126 or more. International experience suggests that even with a lower threshold, students are still attracted to tertiary education. The English student loan <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold</b> is set at a level similar to $ 42, 000, while in New Zealand the threshold is much lower. The reform would affect more women than men, due to high rates of part-time work. Yet half of the debtors who would be affected live with a partner, and the combined disposable income of 70 per cent of these couples exceeds $ 80, 000 a year. With this reform, the subsidies built into HELP loans would be more targeted toward people facing real financial hardship. In tough times, it’s a reform Australia can’t afford to ignore...|$|E

Abstract This brief explores the potential impact on the time students take to repay their tuition loans of changes proposed by the Australian Government in its May 2014 budget to the funding and operations of the Australian higher education sector. The key results of the analysis are: Result 1 : Total loan repayments vary substantially across the graduate income distribution, increasing by more than double the higher tuition charges for about 20 % of graduates, since these graduates {{take a long time to}} repay the debt. Result 2 : The additional time taken to repay tuition loans also varies substantially across the graduate income distribution, increasing most at incomes a little above the first <b>repayment</b> <b>threshold.</b> Across the graduate income distribution, repayment periods are typically about double under the new arrangements studied compared with existing arrangements, if repayments are made at all. Result 3 : Loan default will increase. An increased proportion of individuals will never repay their tuition loans. The proportion who never repays anything will not change much, but the proportion making only partial payments will increase, especially among female graduates. Result 4 : Even in the absence of any increase in fees from university fee deregulation, the package of other measures results in an increase in the time to repay loans of over ten years for some groups of graduates. Increases in fees of the magnitudes envisaged here as part of the fee deregulation element of the package increase the additional time to repayment beyond fifteen years for some individuals. Result 5 : Variations to the base case or analysis of specific groups do not result in qualitatively different results – typically, the average years required to repay the loan approximately doubles under variations to the new arrangements...|$|E
