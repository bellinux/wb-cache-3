40|$|A {{petrochemical}} plant producing {{terephthalic acid}} faced a saturation of its wastewater treatment facilities {{due to an}} increase in production. In fact, the plant has been growing in the last years, and the effluents have been treated by reproducing the original design of three aerobic tanks in series. However, due to lack of space, as well as energy consumption and sludge production reaching a certain level, the plant considered other options for coping with the new effluent flow and organic load. Based on the authors' previous experience with this wastewater, the consultant designed a process consisting of a modification of an existing pond, in order to add an anaerobic step previous to the aerobic tanks already in operation. The anaerobic pond is a three stage process, all included in the same adapted basin, with a distribution system in the bottom of each stage, that creates an upflow pattern. Terephthalic acid wastewater is a mixture of several organic acids, with different anaerobic degradation kinetics, acetic and benzoic acids being more rapidly removed; the staged design takes this into account. The first two stages have a plastic floating cover (5813 m 3 and 8719 m 3 volume, respectively), while the third one is a conventional UASB type reactor (6276 m 3 volume) with a gas-liquid-solid separation device on top. The design wastewater flow is 230 m 3 /h, with 10300 mg/ 1 COD, a pH of 4. 5 and a temperature of 40 °C.

Utilizing the existing set of edge diagnostics, especially the high- resolution multi-pulse edge Thomson scattering system, in combination with long discharge plateaus, radial sweeps and advanced averaging techniques, detailed radial mid-plane profiles of diverted plasmas are obtained. Profiles are smooth across the separatrix, indicating strong radial correlation, {{and there is no}} remarkable variation across the second separatrix either. Together with measured input, <b>recycling,</b> <b>pumping</b> and bypass fluxes, a corrected separatrix position is determined and transport characteristics are derived in the different radial zones generally identified in the profile structure.

The results were compared with the maximum admissible threshold values in the Romanianenvironmental protection regulations, for less sensitive soils. Exceeding concentrations for the analyzed elements weredetermined, especially in the proximity of the Aurul tailing dam pump station used to recycle the water inside the dam.

40|$|Puffing of {{impurities}} (neon, argon) and deuterium gas in {{the main}} chamber is used to simultaneously feedback-control the total radiated power fraction and the divertor neutral particle density in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. The variation of P_s_e_p=P_h_e_a_t-P_r_a_d(core) by impurity radiation during H-mode shows a similar effect on the ELM behaviour as that obtained by a change of the heating power. For radiated power fractions above 90 %, the ELM amplitude becomes very small and detachment from the divertor plates occurs, whilst no degradation of the global energy confinement is observed (Completely Detached High-confinement mode). Additional deuterium gas puffing is found to increase the radiated power per impurity ion in the plasma core due to the combined effect of a higher particle recycling rate and a lower core penetration probability. The outer divertor chamber, which is closed for deuterium neutrals, builds up a high neutral pressure the magnitude of which {{is determined by the}} balance of particle sources and pumping. For this particular situation, the effective pumping time of neon and argon is considerably accelerated to less than 0. 3 s mainly due to an improved divertor retention capability.

The monitoring of > 200 tube wells revealed nitrate concentrations from I to 360 mg/L. Three configurations of groundwater level and elevation gradient were identified: i) NO 3 hot spots associated to deep groundwater levels (30 - 60. m) and low groundwater elevation gradient suggest small groundwater reserve with absence of lateral flow, then degradation of groundwater quality due to <b>recycling</b> through <b>pumping</b> and return flow; ii) high groundwater elevation gradient, moderate NO 3 concentrations suggest that significant lateral flow prevented NO 3 enrichment; iii) low NO 3 concentrations, low groundwater elevation gradient and shallow groundwater indicate a large reserve.

Then, wells located in low groundwater elevation gradient zones are likely to be suitable for assessing the impacts of local agricultural systems, while wells located in zones with high elevation gradient would reflect the average groundwater quality of the catchment, and hence should be used for regional mapping of groundwater quality. Irrigatiori with NO 3 concentrated groundwater induces a "hidden" input of nitrogen to the crop which can reach 200 kgN/ha/yr in hotspot areas, enhancing groundwater contamination.

40|$|Puff and pump' {{radiating}} divertor scenarios [1, 2] {{were applied}} to upper SN and DN H-mode plasmas. Under similar operating conditions, argon (Ar) accumulated in the main plasma of single-null (SN) plasmas more rapidly and reached a higher steady-state concentration when the B x {del}B ion drift direction was toward the divertor than when the B x {del}B ion drift direction {{was out of the}} divertor. The initial rate that Ar accumulated inside double-null (DN) plasmas was more than twice that of comparably-prepared SNs with the same B x {del}B direction. One way to reduce power loading at the divertor targets is to 'seed' the divertor plasma with impurities that radiatively reduce the conducted power. Studies have shown that the concentration of impurities in the divertor are increased by raising the flow of deuterium ions (D{sup +}) into the divertor by a combination of upstream deuterium gas puffing and active particle exhaust at the divertor targets, i. e., puff-and-pump. An enhanced D{sup +} particle flow toward the divertor targets exerts a frictional drag on impurities, and inhibits their escape from the divertor. A puff-and-pump approach using Ar as the impurity was successfully applied in recent DIII-D experiments to SN plasmas [3] while maintaining good H-mode performance. Studies on DIII-D and other tokamaks have shown that both the direction of the toroidal magnetic field B{sub T} and the degree of magnetic balance between divertors [i. e., {{the degree to which the}} plasma shape is considered SN or DN] are important factors in determining <b>recycling</b> and particle <b>pumping</b> [4, 5]. It is unclear whether the favorable results of Ref. [3] can be extended to cases with different magnetic balance and/or B{sub T} direction. We show in this paper that reversing the direction of B{sub T} or altering the divertor magnetic balance does have an impact on how plasmas behave under puff-and-pump conditions. Our study takes advantage of DIII-D's capabilities to actively pump SN and DN shapes with high-triangularity. In-vessel pumping of deuterium and Ar, shown schematically in Fig. 1, was done by cryopumps located inside the upper outer ('plus'), upper inner ('minus'), and lower outer (dotted) divertor pumping plenums. To increase the ion D{sup +} flow toward these pumps, deuterium gas was introduced at an outboard location, as shown. Argon was injected directly into the private flux region (PFR) of the upper outer divertor...|$|R
