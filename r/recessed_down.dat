5000|$|Daniell first {{constructed}} {{his cell}} in 1836. [...] His original design {{consisted of a}} 3.5 inch diameter copper cylinder. A copper disc perforated with numerous holes was placed across the cylinder <b>recessed</b> <b>down</b> from the top. A tube of ox gullet hung from a large hole in {{the centre of the}} perforated copper disc. A 0.5 inch diameter zinc rod hung inside this ox-gullet tube suspended from wooden supports. The copper vessel was filled with sulfuric acid solution saturated with copper sulfate to above the level of the perforated disc. The ox-gullet tube was filled with sulfuric acid solution. Copper sulfate crystals were piled on the perforated copper disc to keep the solution saturated. The ox-gullet acts as a porous membrane allowing passage of ions. Daniell states that a porous earthenware tube may be used instead of the ox gullet for practical ease but this arrangement will produce less power. Another suggestion made by Daniell to improve the cell was to replace the copper with platinum and copper sulfate with platinum chloride, but he remarks [...] "such an arrangement would be perfect, but too costly for ordinary applications". [...] It is the porous pot form of the cell that came to be widely used in telegraphy.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{development of}} hierarchical reliability assessment models for novel LED-based lighting systems. Much of the chapter {{is excerpted from}} references (Arik et al., IEEE Trans Compon Packag Tech 33 : 668 – 679, 2010; Song et al., IEEE Trans Compon Packag Tech 33 : 728 – 737, 2010; Song et al., Microelectron Reliab 2011) and technical details omitted in the chapter {{can be found in}} the references. After a brief introduction about the motivation of LED-based <b>recessed</b> <b>down</b> lighting systems, Sect. 18. 2 is devoted to luminaire subcomponent development and the challenges to realize a high-lumen luminaire at an affordable cost. In Sect. 18. 3, a hierarchical reliability prediction model to assess the lifetime of LED-based lighting systems is first described, and the model is subsequently implemented for the LED-based <b>recessed</b> <b>down</b> lighting system cooled by synthetic jets...|$|E

[...] He dropped it, together with King James' letter, back into the <b>recess,</b> snapped <b>down</b> the trap, and replaced the drawer. Whereupon Mr. Caryll took his leave, promising to advise his lordship of whatever he might glean, and so departed from Stretton House.|$|R
6000|$|I looked {{round at}} Mr., Mrs., and Miss Greene, {{and saw that}} they were all looking at me. I looked round at them, and as their eyes met mine I felt that I turned as red as fire. I {{immediately}} jumped up and rushed away to my own room, hearing as I went that all their steps were following me. I rushed to the inner <b>recess,</b> pulled <b>down</b> the portmanteau, which still remained in its old place, tore away my own carpet rug which covered the support beneath it, and there saw--a white canvas-covered box, with a hole in the canvas on the side next to me! ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Bornstedt [...] serfdom in {{the state}} was {{abolished}} with the [...] "Recess of 17 May 1433" [...] by Henry the Peaceful. According to Bornstedt, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel was therefore the first principality in the Holy Roman Empire {{to do away with}} feudalism. The <b>recess</b> laid <b>down</b> that all arbitrariness (Willkür) in the levies on stewards, or Meier, of feudal manors, particularly on the death of the farmer, were cancelled. the Grundherr or 'lord of the manor' continued to be the owner of the Meier estate, but now the Meier could also quit. This change usually meant that the Meier family did not move out when the contract expired or when the farmer died; i.e. that the family were not prematurely evicted as would have been the case before. In 1563 it was decreed by Henry the Younger that every 6 years Meier and Grundherr had to negotiate the extension of the estate lease; later this was increased to 9 years. In his Landtag farewell in 1597, [...] "Duke" [...] Henry Julius made the farms inheritable.|$|R

60|$|The Vicar {{felt that}} the heavens had fallen. He sat {{crumpled}} up in his chair, a shattered man. Lady Hammergallow {{sat down next to}} him without appearing to see him. She was breathing heavily, but her face was terribly calm. Everyone sat down. Was the Angel grossly ignorant or only grossly impertinent? The Angel was vaguely aware of some frightful offence, aware that in some mysterious way he had ceased to be the centre of the gathering. He saw reproachful despair in the Vicar's eye. He drifted slowly towards the window in the <b>recess</b> and sat <b>down</b> on the little octagonal Moorish stool by the side of Mrs Jehoram. And under the circumstances he appreciated at more than its proper value Mrs Jehoram's kindly smile. He put down the violin in the window seat.|$|R
50|$|The {{inclusion}} of the highway authority name {{took the form of}} raised or <b>recessed</b> lettering written <b>down</b> the poles or as part of a finial or roundel (when the centre is hollow, called an annulus) design, either in full or as initials (e.g. K.C.C. for Kesteven County Council). Roundel designs can also include junction names (for example, Molly Brown's Corner, in Lytchett Matravers, Dorset) or village names. County Council coats of arms feature in counties such as West Sussex. The Ministry for Transport asked the County Councils in Dorset and the West Riding of Yorkshire to experiment with the {{inclusion of}} a grid reference and these remain common in these areas. The roundel on a 2005 replacement at West Wellow (Hampshire) directing travellers to St Margaret's Church bears a portrait of Florence Nightingale who is interred at the churchyard.|$|R
6000|$|Soames stared after them. That boy was good-looking, with a Forsyte chin, {{and eyes}} deep-grey, deep in; but with {{something}} sunny, like {{a glass of}} old sherry spilled over him; his smile perhaps, his hair. Better than they deserved--those two! They passed from his view into the next room, and Soames continued to regard the Future Town, but saw it not. A little smile snarled up his lips. He was despising the vehemence of his own feelings after all these years. Ghosts! And yet as one grew old--was there anything but what was ghost-like left? Yes, there was Fleur! He fixed {{his eyes on the}} entrance. She was due; but she would keep him waiting, of course! And suddenly he became aware of a sort of human breeze--a short, slight form clad in a sea-green djibbah with a metal belt and a fillet binding unruly red-gold hair all streaked with grey. She was talking to the Gallery attendants, and something familiar riveted his gaze--in her eyes, her chin, her hair, her spirit--something which suggested a thin Skye terrier just before its dinner. Surely June Forsyte! His cousin June--and coming straight to his <b>recess!</b> She sat <b>down</b> beside him, deep in thought, took out a tablet, and made a pencil note. Soames sat unmoving. A confounded thing cousinship! [...] "Disgusting!" [...] he heard her murmur; then, as if resenting the presence of an overhearing stranger, she looked at him. The worst had happened.|$|R
40|$|The InAlN/AlN/GaN HEMT {{has a high}} {{breakdown}} field which allows for excellent power performance. In order to increase frequency operation, a reduction in device size is required, inherently increasing the short-channel effects and limiting device efficiency and linearity. It is possible to mitigate DIBL and subthreshold swing by increasing the carrier confinement in the 2 DEG channel of the HEMT through optimizing the buffer design {{with the use of}} GaN-buffer C-doping. The impact of different C-doping profiles on short-channel effects is investigated by the fabrication and characterization of two-finger U-shaped HEMTs with 2 x 25 μm gate widths and 50, 100 and 180 nm gate footprints. DC and S-parameter analysis show an increased immunity to short-channel effects for devices with constant levels of intentional C-doping to the buffer, but that the high frequency and power performance is impaired by a reduction of the on-state conductance. Best RF performance was achieved for a ramped C-doping profile with values of and of 66 and 180 GHz respectively. Although, these devices showed a deteriorated performance in terms of short-channel effects, including pinch-off, output conductance and current leakage. Consequently, there is a trade-off between the reduction of short-channel effects and an increase of and. Ohmic contact formation and the reduction of contact resistance and specific contact resistivity is important to consider in order to increase the efficient operation of HEMTs. Ohmic contacts induce negligible voltage drop and heat generation compared to the bulk resistance of the semiconductor, but are difficult to realize in wide-bandgap materials. It is possible to assist the formation of ohmic contacts and lower the resistivity by contact <b>recess</b> etching <b>down</b> to the substrate channel and by altering the metallization. Ta-based contacts are considered for their low optimum anneal temperature, improving the sheet resistance of the heterostructure material. Ta/Al/Ta contacts to AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterostructures {{have been found to be}} reproducible and to have good performance with concern to contact resistance, specific contact resistivity, surface morphology and line edge acuity. The exclusion layer formed in between the contacts and the semiconductor during anneal, causes N-vacancies in the buffer and promotes tunnelling of carriers through the barrier, which in turn lowers the contact resistance. The lower resistivity of ZrN compared to TaN, yields an interest in Zr-based contacts. Zr/Al/Zr/Ta/Au contacts to AlGaN/AlN/GaN show low optimum anneal temperature and contact resistance but further research is required...|$|R
6000|$|... § 8. The {{valley of}} Chamouni, largely viewed, and {{irrespectively}} of minor ravines and irregularities, {{is nothing more}} than a deep trench, dug between two ranges of nearly continuous mountains,--dug with a straightness and evenness which render its scenery, in some respects, more monotonous than that of any other Alpine valley. On each side it is bordered by banks of turf, darkened with pine forest, rising at an even slope to a height of about 3000 feet, so that it may best be imagined as a kind of dry moat, which, if cut across, would be of the form typically shown in Fig. 20; the sloping bank on each side being about 3000 feet high, or the moat about three fifths of a mile in vertical depth. Then, on the top of the bank, on each side, and a little way back from the edge of the moat, rise the ranges of the great mountains, in the form of shattered crests and pyramids of barren rock sprinkled with snow. Those on the south side of the valley rise another 3000 feet above the bank on which they stand, so that each of the masses superadded in Fig. 21 may best be described as a sort of Egyptian pyramid,[53] of the height of Snowden or Ben Lomond, hewn out of solid rock, and set on the shoulder of the great bank which borders the valley. Then the Mont Blanc, a higher and heavier cluster of such summits, loaded with deep snow, terminates the range. Glaciers of greater or less extent descend between the pyramids of rock; and one, supplied from their largest <b>recesses,</b> even runs <b>down</b> the bank into the valley. Fig. 22[54] rudely represents the real contours of the mountains, including Mont Blanc itself, on its south side. The range of peaks, b, p, m, is that already spoken of, known as the [...] "Aiguilles of Chamouni." [...] They form but a very small portion of a great crowd of similar, and, for the most part, larger peaks which constitute the chain of Mont Blanc, and which receive from the Savoyards the name of Aiguilles, or needles, in consequence of their peculiarly sharp summits. The forms of these Aiguilles, wonderful enough in themselves, are, nevertheless, perpetually exaggerated both by the imagination of the traveller, and by the artists whose delineations of them find most frank acceptance. Fig. 1 in Plate 30 is faithfully copied from the representation given of one of these mountains in a plate lately published at Geneva. Fig. 2 in the same plate is a true outline of the mountain itself. Of the exaggerations in the other I shall have more to say presently; meantime, I refer to it merely as a proof that I am not myself exaggerating, in giving Fig. 22 as showing the general characters of these peaks.|$|R
6000|$|And in {{this case}} she was right, since it is {{probable}} that few of her visitors failed to say to themselves that her not having gone would {{have had something to do}} with Dormer. That could pass for an explanation with many of Mrs. Dallow's friends, who as a general thing were not morbidly analytic; especially with those who met Nick as a matter of course at dinner. His figuring at this lady's entertainments, being in her house whenever a candle was lighted, was taken as a sign that there was something rather particular between them. Nick had said to her more than once that people would wonder why they didn't marry; but he was wrong in this, inasmuch as there were many of their friends to whom it wouldn't have occurred that his position could be improved. That they were cousins was a fact not so evident to others as to themselves, in consequence of which they appeared remarkably intimate. The person seeing clearest in the matter was Mrs. Gresham, who lived so much in the world that being left now and then to one's own company had become her idea of true sociability. She knew very well that if she had been privately engaged to a young man as amiable as Nick Dormer she would have managed that publicity shouldn't play such a part in their intercourse; and she had her secret scorn for the stupidity of people whose conception of Nick's relation to Julia rested on the fact that he was always included in her parties. [...] "If he never was there they might talk," [...] she said to herself. But Mrs. Gresham was supersubtle. To her it would have appeared natural that her friend should celebrate the parliamentary <b>recess</b> by going <b>down</b> to Harsh and securing the young man's presence there for a fortnight; she recognised Mrs. Dallow's actual plan as a comparatively poor substitute--the project of spending the holidays in other people's houses, to which Nick had also promised to come. Mrs. Gresham was romantic; she wondered what was the good of mere snippets and snatches, the chances that any one might have, when large, still days à deux were open to you--chances of which half the sanctity was in what they excluded. However, there were more unsettled matters between Mrs. Dallow and her queer kinsman than even Mrs. Gresham's fine insight could embrace. She was not on the Sunday evening before Easter among the guests in Great Stanhope Street; but if she had been Julia's singular indifference to observation would have stopped short of encouraging her to remain in the drawing-room, along with Nick, after the others had gone. I may add that Mrs. Gresham's extreme curiosity would have emboldened her as little to do so. She would have taken for granted that the pair wished to be alone together, though she would have regarded this only as a snippet. The company had at all events stayed late, and it was nearly twelve o'clock when the last of them, standing before the fire in the room they had quitted, broke out to his companion: ...|$|R
