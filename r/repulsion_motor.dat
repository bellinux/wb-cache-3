50|$|Most {{commutator}} motors {{are limited}} to about 1,500 volts because higher voltages {{give rise to a}} risk of arcing across the commutator. <b>Repulsion</b> <b>motors</b> can be used at higher voltages because the rotor circuit is not electrically connected to the supply.|$|R
50|$|These {{were used}} where high {{starting}} torque was required. They started as <b>repulsion</b> <b>motors,</b> {{but once they}} were running at a sizable fraction of full speed, the brushes were lifted mechanically and all commutator bars were short-circuited together to create {{the equivalent of a}} squirrel-cage induction motor.|$|R
5000|$|In 1912-1913, the Rhaetian Railway {{purchased}} seven {{examples of}} the Ge 2/4, numbered 201 to 207, for the newly constructed and electrified Engadin line.

Their mechanical components were manufactured by the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM), while Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) furnished the electrical components. To drive the Ge 2/4s, <b>repulsion</b> <b>motors</b> were used, as these motors were characterised by a high torque and shock-fee startup.|$|R

50|$|Types of <b>repulsion</b> <b>motor</b> {{are listed}} below. It {{is likely that}} the {{different}} types were developed to match the torque/speed characteristics of the motor as closely as possible to the service it was required to provide.|$|E
40|$|We have {{obtained}} the following results by our comparative {{test of the}} single-phase farm motor and the three-phase farm motor on the same rated horse power and their values are shown in the 5 th fig. (1) The single-phase <b>repulsion</b> start induction <b>motor</b> is inferior to the three-phase inductionmotor on every characteristic curves. (2) If one represents the input of the single-phase <b>repulsion</b> start induction <b>motor</b> by W_, {{and that of the}} three-phase induction motor by W_, then, we have the next result. The consumption of W_ is about fifty watts more than that of W_ on the same output. (3) If one represents the efficiency of the single-phase <b>repulsion</b> start induction <b>motor</b> by η_s, and that of the three-phase induction motor by η_T, then, we have the next result. η_T is seven percent higher than η_s on one horse power. (4) If one represents the power factor of the single-phase <b>repulsion</b> start induction <b>motor</b> by CosΦ_s, and that of the three-phase induction motor by CosΦ_T, then, we have the next result. CosΦ_T is fifteen percent higher than CosΦ_s on one horse power. (5) If one represents the torque of the single-phase <b>repulsion</b> start induction <b>motor</b> by τ_s, and that of the three-phase induction motor by τ_T, then, we have the next result. τ_T is a little better than τ_s on the same output...|$|R
50|$|<b>Repulsion</b> <b>motors</b> {{are based}} on the {{principle}} of repulsion between two magnetic fields. Consider a 2-pole salient pole motor with a vertical magnetic axis. The armature is connected to a commutator and brushes. The brushes are short circuited using a low-resistance jumper.When alternating current is supplied to the field (stator) winding, it induces an electromotive force (emf) in the armature. The direction of alternating current is such that it creates a north pole at the top and a south pole at the bottom. The direction of induced emf is given by Lenz's law, according to which the direction of induced emf opposes the cause producing it. The induced emf induces current in the armature conductors and the direction of the induced current depends on the position of the brushes.|$|R
5000|$|This is the [...] "compensated" [...] <b>repulsion</b> <b>motor</b> devised {{independently}} by Latour and by Winter-Eichberg. There are, again, {{two pairs}} of brushes but they are fixed {{at right angles to}} each other. One pair is short-circuited while the other pair is fed with variable-voltage alternating current from tappings on the secondary winding of a small transformer. The primary winding of the transformer is in series with the stator winding of the motor. This motor has the same torque/speed characteristics as an ordinary series-wound motor.|$|E
50|$|A <b>repulsion</b> <b>motor</b> {{is a type}} of {{electric}} motor for using on alternating current (AC). It was formerly used as a traction motor for electric trains (e.g. SR Class CP and SR Class SL electric multiple units) but has been superseded by other types of motors. Repulsion motors are classified under single phase motors. In repulsion motors the stator windings are connected directly to the AC power supply and the rotor is connected to a commutator and brush assembly, similar to that of a direct current (DC) motor.|$|E
50|$|If {{the brush}} axis is along the {{direction}} of the magnetic field, the armature behaves like an electromagnet and a N-pole is formed directly below the N-pole of the stator and a S-pole is formed directly above the S-pole of the stator. The net torque in this condition is zero. Both the N-poles repel each other and both the S-poles repel each other. The two repulsion forces are in direct opposition to each other and hence no torque will be developed. This is very fast process in this <b>repulsion</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Repulsion motors are wound-rotor {{single-phase}} AC motors {{that are}} a type of induction motor. In a <b>repulsion</b> <b>motor,</b> the armature brushes are shorted together rather than connected in series with the field, as is done with universal motors. By transformer action, the stator induces currents in the rotor, which create torque by repulsion instead of attraction as in other motors. Several types of repulsion motors have been manufactured, but the repulsion-start induction-run (RS-IR) motor has been used most frequently. The RS-IR motor has a centrifugal switch that shorts all segments of the commutator so that the motor operates as an induction motor once it is close to full speed. Some of these motors also lift the brushes out of contact with source voltage regulation. Repulsion motors were developed before suitable motor starting capacitors were available, and few repulsion motors are sold as of 2005.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War II, the company had a narrow escape during the Rotterdam Blitz, or bombing of Rotterdam. The fire wall (Dutch verb: brandgrens) {{came very close to}} the factory, located at the Van Speykstraat 102. During World War II under the occupation of the German Regime the factory continued to work almost up {{to the end of the}} war. Mr. van Gelder had to end the cooperation on behalf of German orders received and went into hiding and stayed under cover. Also the name of the trade company Firma G.Ph. van Gelder could no longer be used and was replaced by Handelsonderneming H.S.M.-HOLLAND.In 1941 the factory was declared as enemy of the Germany Regime and in 1943 the factory was forced to work for the German industry. The company Elin Schorch Reydt (the socalled Patenschaft) raised an order to manufacture refrigerator motors for the company Alfred Teves. The production of the motors was sabotaged by the employees and management, endangering personal lives. On 1st 1944 in small committee the 25 anniversary of the company was celebrated. A few days later during the Rotterdam Razzia (or Roundup) on 6 November 1944 all the raw materials were collected from the factory and on 10 November all the machinery were collected and transported to Germany. Mr. Heinke who had German roots and NSDAP sympathies, had gained the titel of Rüstung-Inspektor der Rüstung und Kriegsprodukten in the Netherlands, assisted the transport. Mr. Heinke wanted to continue the development of the <b>repulsion</b> <b>motor,</b> on which a patent was pending for his own account. Mr. J. Vos an emloyee of the company and Head of the test laboratory was put to work as a forced laborer in Zwickau. After the war Mr. Vos managed to find the machinery taken from the Pelger factory, as he stayed in contact with Mr. Heinke. He found the maschinery were stored at the Tischlerei Max Siegert in Frankhausen, also Mr. Heinke's former home. The machinery which were in the possession of Mr. Heinke's widow, as Mr. K.W. Heinke passed away shortly after the war. The machinery were officially confiscated by the American Occupation Authorities in Crimmitschau and were brought back to the Netherlands.|$|E
