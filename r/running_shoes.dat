5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese <b>running</b> <b>shoes</b> to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese <b>running</b> <b>shoes.</b> In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E

Niskanen entered Abebe Bikila and Abebe Wakgira in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympics, which would be run on September 10. In Rome, Abebe Bikila purchased new <b>running</b> <b>shoes,</b> but they did not fit well and gave him blisters. He consequently decided to run barefoot instead.|$|E

25|$|The cycling stage {{proceeds}} {{around a}} marked course, typically on public roads. In many cases, especially smaller triathlons, roads are not closed to automobiles; however, traffic coordinators are often present to help control traffic. Typically, the cycling stage finishes {{back at the}} same transition area. Racers enter the transition area, rack their bicycles, and quickly change into <b>running</b> <b>shoes</b> before heading out for the final stage. The running stage usually ends at a separate finish line near the transition area.|$|E
25|$|As barefoot running {{became popular}} {{by the late}} 20th and early 21st century, many modern shoe {{manufacturers}} have recently designed footwear that mimic this experience, maintaining optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree of protection. Termed as Minimalist shoes, their purpose is to allow one's feet and legs to feel more subtly the impacts and forces involved in running, allowing finer adjustments in running style. Some of these shoes include the Vibram FiveFingers, Nike Free, and Saucony's Kinvara and Hattori. Mexican huaraches are also very simple <b>running</b> <b>shoes,</b> similar to the shoes worn by the Tarahumara people of northern Mexico, who {{are known for their}} distance running abilities. Wrestling shoes are also very light and flexible shoes that are designed to mimic bare feet while providing additional traction and protection.|$|E

In recent years {{there has been}} an increase in participation in timed running events. With this increase, the motivation for individuals to run their best has motivated the <b>running</b> <b>shoe</b> industry to make design changes to traditional running foot wear in an effort to improve running economy (RE) and decrease running times. One such design change has been to incorporate mechanical springs (MS) into the midsole of the <b>running</b> <b>shoe.</b> Evaluation of this technology has yet to be performed. This study recruited 17 runners (12 male) and had them run at a submaximal steady state speed for 2 bouts of five minutes at a speed of 3. 13 m·sec- 1. The order of shoe condition was randomly assigned and the subjects ran one interval in their own <b>running</b> <b>shoe</b> (OS) and one interval in MS shoes. Metabolic data and heart rate data were averaged over the last three of the five minute efforts. No significant difference was found between MS and OS with regards to <b>shoe</b> weight. <b>Running</b> in MS resulted in lower, non-significant values for steady state ventilation and steady state heart rate.
