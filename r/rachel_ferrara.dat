25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, <b>Rachel</b> <b>Ferrara.</b> Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E
