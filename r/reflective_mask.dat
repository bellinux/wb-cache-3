40|$|Advanced {{formation}} flying occulter designs utilize a large occulter mask flying in formation with an imaging telescope to block and null starlight to allow imaging of faint planets in exosolar systems. A paper describes {{the utilization of}} subscale reflective occultation masks to evaluate {{formation flying}} occulter designs. The use of a <b>reflective</b> <b>mask</b> allows mounting of the occulter by conventional means and simplifies the test configuration. The innovation alters the test set-up to allow mounting of the mask using standard techniques to eliminate {{the problems associated with}} a standard configuration. The modified configuration uses a reflective set-up whereby the star simulator reflects off of a reflective occulting mask and into an evaluation telescope. Since the mask is sized to capture all rays required for the imaging test, it can be mounted directly to a supporting fixture without interfering with the beam. Functionally, the reflective occultation mask reflects light from the star simulator instead of transmitting it, with a highly absorptive carbon nanotube layer simulating the occulter blocking mask. A subscale telescope images the star source and companion dim source that represents a planet. The primary advantage of this is that the occulter can be mounted conventionally instead of using diffractive wires or magnetic levitation...|$|E

We employ rigorous computation of light diffraction from lithographic masks in combination with aerial image simulation to study the root causes of these effects and their dependencies from mask and optical system parameters.

40|$|Extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) microscopy is {{an important}} tool for {{the investigation of the}} performance of EUV masks, for detecting the presence and the characteristics of defects, and for evaluating the effectiveness of defect repair techniques. Aerial image measurement bypasses the difficulties inherent to photoresist imaging and enables high data collection speed and flexibility. It provides reliable and quick feedback for the development of masks and lithography system modeling methods. We operate the SEMATECH Berkeley Actinic Inspection Tool (AIT), a EUV microscope installed at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The AIT is equipped with several high-magnification Fresnel zoneplate lenses, with various numerical aperture values, that enable it image the <b>reflective</b> <b>mask</b> surface with various resolution and magnification settings. Although the AIT has undergone significant recent improvements in terms of imaging resolution and illumination uniformity, there is still room for improvement. In the AIT, an off-axis zoneplate lens collects the light coming from the sample and an image of the sample is projected onto an EUV-sensitive CCD camera. The simplicity of the optical system is particularly helpful considering that the AIT alignment has to be performed every time that a sample or a zoneplate is replaced. The alignment is sensitive to several parameters such as the lens position and orientation, the illumination direction and the sample characteristics. Since the AIT works in high vacuum, there is no direct access to the optics or to the sample during the alignment and the measurements. For all these reasons the alignment procedures and feedback can be complex, and in some cases can reduce the overall data throughput of the system. In this paper we review the main strategies and procedures that have been developed for quick and reliable alignments, and we describe the performance improvements we have achieved, in terms of aberration magnitude reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry growth is driven {{to a large}} extent by steady advancements in microlithography. According to the newly updated industry roadmap, the 50 nm generation is anticipated to be available in the year 2012. This paper discusses the basic concepts of VUV lithography (VUVL), a relatively new form of lithography that uses vacuum ultraviolet radiation (VUV) with a wavelength in a range of 50 to 100 nm to carry out projection imaging. This approach uses a self amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) free electron laser (FEL) as a source of radiation, a <b>reflective</b> <b>mask,</b> and a 4 X reduction all reflective imaging system. The reflective elements for VUVL use SiC mirrors to produce normal incidence reflectivities nearly 40 %. The mask in a VUV system also uses the same type of SiC material. Recent advances in SASE FEL systems suggest the feasibility of flexible sources for microelectronic production facilities. Any lithography must satisfy cost-ownership requirements. A VUV SASE FEL source is economical for high-volume production, because it can feed multiple steppers. The average SASE radiation on wafers is about 1 W, and throughput of each stepper is 90 wafer/hr. Estimated SASE FEL source portion of total cost is about $ 0. 5 per 300 mm wafer. We believe that the underlying simplicity of the technology, particularly the mask and mirror and low source portion of total cost will make VUVL a cost effective solution for lithography at 100 nm and below. Since the wavelength of SASE FEL source is adjustable, selection of new materials needed for photoresists may be much easier than for the case of fixed wavelength source. SiC mirrors with characteristics required for VUVL optics are produced by industry. All components of the proposed SASE FEL source equipment have been demonstrated in practice. This is guaranteed success in the time requirement. (orig.)

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis was performed {{in the context of}} the European Sixth Framework Program FP 6 project “Disposable Dot Field Effect Transistor for High Speed Si Integrated Circuits”, referred to as the D-DotFET project. The project had the goal of realizing strain-enhanced mobility in CMOS transistors by transferring strain from a self-assembled germanium dot to the channel of a transistor fabricated above the dot. The initial idea was to dispose of the Ge dot underneath the channel after the gate processing so that the gate-stack would also serve to stabilize the channel-bridge and maintain the strain induced in the channel silicon by the Ge dot. The advantage of using a SiGe dot as a strain source is its scalability to as low as 10 nm gate dimensions, which is not obvious for currently used methods for imparting strain on the Si channel. Furthermore, the D-DotFET structure offers advantages for the electrostatic and electrothermal behavior of MOS devices. For example, SOI devices with fully-depleted channel are a solution for short-channel effects but the insulating oxide beneath the device introduces a thermal management issue. This problem is solved in Silicon-on-Nothing (SON) devices because the insulating region is then only found under the gate with the source and drain regions still being anchored to the thermally conductive bulk silicon. The D-DotFET resembles the SON transistor but with the added advantage of strain-enhanced device gain and speed. In that way the D-DotFET combines four potential improvements: strain enhanced performance, scalability to future ~ 10 nm generations, suppression of short-channel effects, and good heat dissipation. Research was done in several areas to assure that the stringent requirements on uniformity, reproducibility and reliability could potentially be met to transfer the D-DotFET concept to advanced CMOS. The growing of silicon germanium (SiGe) dots with the necessarily high Ge content was first developed, and uniformity and reproducibility were brought to a high level of perfection. The strain of both bare and overgrown dots was extensively analyzed both experimentally and theoretically. Then, the strain that could be transferred to the channel of a MOSFET was evaluated in terms of mobility enhancement via device simulations, and lastly, the actual integration of dots was demonstrated in a low-complexity n-MOSFET research process that was specially tailored to this application, which is the topic of this thesis. The Dimes cleanrooms were not equipped to set up a state-of-the-art CMOS process to investigate the D-DotFET concept. However, the available expertise and equipment was suitable for running a more advanced process, where excimer laser annealing could be implemented to replace the standard rapid thermal annealing and a metal gate could replace the standard polysilicon gate. Furthermore, the patterning of ~ 100 nm gate features was performed by e-beam lithography by the project partner Forschungszentrum Jülich. To avoid as many nanoscale lithography steps as possible, geometry with large source-drain contacting areas was devised so that only one step, the ~ 100 nm gate definition itself, needed to be patterned by e-beam. Additionally, since the goal was in first instance to verify the strain-enhanced gain induced by the dot, it was decided to significantly simplify the transistor processing by retaining the dot throughout. A “DotFET” rather than a “D-DotFET” was therefore fabricated. This meant that only low-temperature processing steps could be performed after the dot formation, in order to avoid intermixing of Si and Ge and consequent strain relaxation. This was realized in a dedicated n-MOSFET process where the temperature was kept below 400 ?C after epitaxy by using low-temperature gate dielectrics and a metal gate self-aligned to implanted and laser annealed source/drain regions. The SiGe dots used for the DotFET fabrication were grown in a self-assembling Stranski-Krastanow mode that allows single-crystalline dots of SiGe to grow in three-dimensions on predefined seedholes. Under appropriate conditions this growth is defect free and can easily be scaled down. The 3 D growth of the SiGe allows a higher Ge content inside the dot before the onset of crystal dislocations as compared to the growth of 2 D SiGe layers of similar thickness. The smaller the SiGe dots the higher the Ge content that can be maintained without defect formation and consequently a higher strain can be exerted on any Si layer grown over the dot. For the devices described in this thesis, the dots were grown by MBE on a regular seedhole pattern of submicron periodicity etched into the Si. The growth was investigated in detail to determine the optimum growth conditions and seedhole-patterns for achieving a dot-size and strain level suitable for constructing a MOSFET over the center of the dot structure where the biaxial tensile strain could be exploited for channel mobility enhancement. For a uniform and reproducible SiGe dot growth, excellent results were achieved by a location-controlled growth method where large, regular arrays of seedholes are patterned on an otherwise flat Si substrate. In the present work, both i-line optical lithography and e-beam lithography (EBL) were used to pattern such holes in (100) Si wafers. In the case of e-beam lithography a very good control of the seedhole positions and size is obtained and the resulting dots are extremely regular. The present DotFET fabrication required a dot size that could accommodate a gate of length ~ 100 nm. For this purpose the most suitable seedhole arrays were the ones with a periodicity of 800 nm that rendered a maximum dot diameter in the range of 230 nm. EBL patterning of this configuration was used for the device fabrication, while analysis of the dot properties was also performed on samples processed with optical lithography. The growing of the dots on the seedhole pattern starts with the deposition of a Si buffer layer which smoothes the surface. The dots are then grown at 720 ?C from a pure Ge source In Chapter 2, a simple, low-temperature process flow for achieving good quality ultrashallow n+p junction diodes has been demonstrated for 5 keV As+ implants activated by excimer laser annealing. Much research has recently been done using ELA techniques due to the extremely short annealing times that potentially eliminate transient enhanced diffusion effects, reach high levels of dopant activation and give abrupt junctions. Compared to conventional rapid thermal anneal procedures ELA offers the advantage of a good control of the junction depth, where a reduction of the vertical implantation range can serve as a direct means of also decreasing the junction depth. The laser processing research performed at Dimes in the past, rather than being aimed at the fabrication of source and drain regions for CMOS, has been motivated by the need to have access to good quality diodes in integration situations where only very low temperatures are permitted, such as in silicon-on-glass processing. With respect to the bulk laterally-uniform part of the diode away from the perimeter, it is important that the Si-surface to be implanted is smooth and native-oxide free before implantation. The implant needs to be so shallow that the melt region encompasses the whole implanted region but deep enough to avoid laser-induced-surface-structuring effects on the Si surface from affecting the underlying metallurgic junction region. Tilted implants can reduce the final junction depth of the 5 keV implants to below 20 nm. With respect to the perimeter of the diode, the key to achieving diodes of good quality is the termination of the metallurgic junction at an oxide-to-silicon interface that is of good quality. In the presented experiments this is achieved by using a thin layer of thermal oxide to cover the Si under a thicker low-temperature isolation layer. The oxide at the interface is a 30 -nm-thin layer of thermal oxide, which is still sufficiently thick to avoid excessive widening of the contact window during the dip-etch used to remove native oxide before metallization. After the growth of the isolation oxide, all processing steps are performed at temperatures below 400 ºC. A <b>reflective</b> <b>mask</b> of Al is applied to localize the laser melting of the silicon to the desired diode region and to protect the perimeter. The tilted implants also increase the overlap of the oxide isolation with the diode perimeter, making the process more robust which in turn reduces perimeter leakage. The completeness of the laser melt at the perimeter depends on the thermal conductivity of the surroundings. Less melting of the perimeter with respect to the bulk is identified by TEM analysis in diodes processed in Dimes and this may be a source of extra perimeter leakage that needs to be taken into account when designing a specific process flow and diode structure. The best results are achieved here with an implant of 2 x 1015 cm- 2 at tilt of 30 ?. For diodes with an area of 80 ?m 2 this gives an ideality factor of 1. 04 and reverse leakage at 2 V in 10 - 5 A/cm 2 range. The low-temperature processing needed for the DotFET transistor puts heavy demands on the processing temperature of the gate dielectric which conventionally is a high-quality thermal oxide grown at temperatures above 850 ?C. In Chapter 3 a study is presented of a number of dielectric layer-stacks formed at temperatures below 400 ?C that could potentially be used as DotFET gate material. MIS capacitors were fabricated with different gate- dielectric layer stacks and electrically characterized, and a comparison was made to capacitors with a SiO 2 interface layer thermally-grown at ? 700 ?C. It was chosen to investigate atomic-layer deposited Al 2 O 3 layers because this technique gives an excellent uniformity, conformality, precise control of the thickness of the films, and it is possible to deposit high-quality layers at low temperature. Cycles of TMA and water were applied in order to deposit the Al 2 O 3 layers at a temperature of 300 ?C. The SiOxNy films with a low concentration of N were grown by inductively coupled plasma at a temperature of 250 ?C. The results of capacitance-voltage and current-voltage measurements demonstrated that ALD Al 2 O 3 and ICP SiOxNy exhibited a dielectric constant of 4 and 8, respectively. With ICP SiOxNy, capacitors were fabricated with low interface trap level density and low effective charge density, < 1011 cm- 2 eV- 1 and < 1011 cm- 3 eV- 1, respectively, as well as low leakage current density (< 10 - 7 A/cm 2). For pure Al 2 O 3 layers the interface quality to Si was poor and in order to improve this situation, a high-quality interface layer was either grown or deposited between the alumina and Si substrate. Due to the simple, fast processing and good quality of the ICP SiOxNy dielectric at low temperature, the SiOxNy was finally chosen for the fabrication of the MOSFETs and DotFETs. The processing techniques for the fabrication of n+p diodes with ultrashallow junction annealed by excimer laser technique and capacitors using Al 2 O 3 and SiOxNy gate dielectrics were combined to create a simple MISFET device {{presented in}} Chapter 4. The fabrication of n- and p-MISFET devices was demonstrated for processing temperatures below 400 ?C. Four important processing steps need to be performed in order to have good electrical device performance: (i) for a good quality growth of ICP-SiOxNy, the Si surface must be cleaned immediately before the growth, achieved with a HF dip-etch; (ii) a dip in BHF is performed immediately before source/drain implantation to remove the native oxide on the Si surface and achieve a uniform implantation of the low-energy ions; (iii) a RIE process with low RF power is used for oxide etching to open the source/drain contact windows in order to reduce damage to the implanted silicon surface; (iv) a HF dip-etch is used to remove native oxide before source/drain metallization and ensure a low-ohmic contacting. Both n- and p-MISFET devices show good performance, especially with respect to drain current driving capability. By increasing the laser energy, the sheet resistance of source/drain regions is reduced due to higher dopant activation. The source to drain resistance was also extracted from the measurements and an increase was observed when the channel length increases. Ultrashallow source/drain junctions were activated and the TEM images show junctions of 10 - 12 nm deep for 1000 mJ/cm 2 laser energy. The overlapping of the laser spot was studied for 66 % and 1 % overlap. The drain current is higher for 66 % overlap, again due to higher dopant activation but at a cost of some extra heating. In Chapter 5, the demonstration of high performance n-DotFET devices, successfully fabricated by adapting the n-MISFET process to the dot structure, is presented. Transistors with a minimum gate-length dimension of 50 nm using TiN/Al(1 %Si) metal-gates were processed. A SiGe dot grown by MBE was used as stressor material. The best energies for excimer laser annealing of these structures were found to be between 850 mJ/cm 2 and 900 mJ/cm 2. E-beam lithography was used to define nanoscale gate dimensions in the central region of the dot and a 1 -µm-wide gate finger is defined to contact this narrow gate. Thus a part of the current between the source and drain flows around the dot structure rather than through the silicon channel over the SiGe dot. Despite this effect, it is still possible to determine the influence of the strain on the drain current. The electrical characteristics show a drain current enhancement between 2 % and 35 %. The simulations show enhancements due to the strained Si layer of 20 % - 22 %. The small dimensions of the channel result in a large spread of measured characteristics, but nevertheless, the impact of the strain Si layer can be indentified. On a test sample the SiGe dot was removed using ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and deionized water, which shows the possibility of fabricating a D-DotFET device in the future. Simulations of D-DotFETs and DotFETs fabricated on SOI substrates were done and the results show a reduction of self-heating for D-DotFET devices. Conclusions to the thesis are given in Chapter 6. The two most important results of this thesis are the demonstration of the applicability of (1) SiGe dots as stressor material and (2) full-melt high-power laser annealing as a technique for lowering the source/drain series resistance in a manner self-aligned to the gate.

In this contribution we apply an indirect metrology method to periodic EUV line masks with different critical dimensions (140 nm and 540 nm) over a large range of duty cycles (1 : 2, [...] ., 1 : 20). We quantitatively compare the reconstructed absorber pattern parameters to values obtained from direct AFM and CD-SEM measurements. We analyze the reliability of the reconstruction for the given experimental data. For the CD of the absorber lines, the comparison shows agreement of the order of 1 nm.

40|$|High {{performance}} coronagraphic imaging of faint structures around {{bright stars}} at small angular separations requires fine control of tip, tilt and other low order aberrations. When such errors occur upstream of a coronagraph, they results in starlight leakage which reduces the dynamic {{range of the}} instrument. This issue has been previously addressed for occulting coronagraphs by sensing the starlight before or at the coronagraphic focal plane. One such solution, the coronagraphic low order wave-front sensor (CLOWFS) uses a partially <b>reflective</b> focal plane <b>mask</b> to measure pointing errors for Lyot-type coronagraphs. To deal with pointing errors in low inner working angle phase mask coronagraphs which {{do not have a}} <b>reflective</b> focal plane <b>mask,</b> we have adapted the CLOWFS technique.

This reflective Lyot-based wavefront sensor is a linear reconstructor which provides high sensitivity tip-tilt error measurements with phase mask coronagraphs. Simulations show that the measurement accuracy of pointing errors with realistic post adaptive optics residuals are ≈ 10 − 2 λ/D per mode at λ = 1. 6 µm for a four quadrant phase mask.

However, unlike a traditional coronagraph design, we insert a <b>reflective</b> focal plane <b>mask</b> at 45 degree to the optical axis. We also used an intermediate secondary mask ("Mask_ 2 ") before a final image in order to block additional mask-edge diffracted light. The test bench simulates the 8. 1 m Gemini North telescope. It includes one spider vane, different mask radii (r= 1. 9, 3. 7, 7. 4 lambda/D) and two types of <b>reflective</b> focal plane <b>masks</b> (hard-edged "Top Hat" and "Gaussian" tapered profiles). In order to investigate the relative performance of these competing coronagraphic designs with regard to extra-solar planet detection sensitivity, we utilize the simulation of realistic extra-solar planet populations (Nielson et al. 2006). With an appropriate translation of our laboratory results to expected telescope performance, a "Gaussian" tapered mask radius of 3. 7 lambda/D with an additional mask ("Mask_ 2 ") performs best (highest planet detection sensitivity). For a full survey with this optimal design, the simulation predicts ~ 30 % more planets detected compared to a similar sized "Top Hat" function mask with "Mask_ 2. " Using the best design, the point contrast ratio between the stellar PSF peak and the coronagraphic PSF at 10 lambda/D (0. 4 " in H band if D = 8. 1 m) is ~ 10 times higher than a classical Lyot "Top Hat" coronagraph. Hence, we find a Gaussian apodized mask with an additional blocking mask is a superior (~ 10 x higher contrast) than use of a classical Lyot coronagraph for ExAO-like Strehls.

40|$|Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) is the {{favourite}} {{next generation}} lithography candidate for IC device manufacturing with feature sizes beyond 32 nm. Different stacks and manufacturing concepts {{have been published}} for the fabrication of the <b>reflective</b> EUVL <b>masks</b> [1]. Patterning processes for two different absorber-buffer combinations {{on top of the}} reflective multi layer mirror have been developed. A TaN/SiO 2 absorber-buffer stack was provided by supplier A and TaBN/Cr by supplier B. In addition both absorbers were covered by an anti reflective coating (ARC) layer. An e-beam patterned 300 nm thick film of Fuji FEP 171 was used as resist mask. We optimized the etching processes for maximum selectivities between absorber, buffer and capping layers {{on the one hand and}} rectangular profiles and low etch bias on the other hand. While both TaN based absorbers have been dry etched in an UNAXIS mask etcher III, wet and dry etch steps have been evaluated for the two different buffer layers. The minimum feature size of lines and holes in our test designs was 100 nm. After freezing the processes a proximity correction was determined considering both, the influence of electron scattering due to e-beam exposure and the influence of the patterning steps. Due to the correction an outstanding linearity and iso/dense bias on different test designs was achieved. Various masks for printing experiments at the small-field Micro Exposure Tool (MET) in Berkeley and the fabrication of the ASML α-tool setup mask within the European MEDEA+ EXTUMAS project were done using the developed processes. Finally, we will compare and discuss the results of the two stack approaches...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports {{simulation}} {{and experimental}} {{details of a}} novel phase shifting technique based o laser interferometry. Phase shifting {{is one of the}} most promising techniques for the fabrication of high density DRAM's. In recent years many kinds of phase shifting methods have been proposed to extend the resolution limit and contrast of image patterns. These techniques however, have several problems that result from the phase shift elements on the mask, especially when applied to UV excimer laser illumination. A new technique will be described that is based on a one-layered reticle which is used as both a <b>reflective</b> and transmissive <b>mask,</b> irradiated from both the front and the back sides. A combination of both off-axis illumination, as well as phase shift are used in this method. Both the relative path length of the two beams as well as their amplitude can be manipulated in such a way that near 100 % contrast can be achieved in the final image. Experimental as well as simulation data are used to demonstrate this new method. National Science Foundatio...|$|R
40|$|Online {{reflective}} {{practices that}} are high-stakes – summatively assessed, or used as evidence for progression or membership in a professional body – are increasingly prevalent in higher education, especially in professional and vocational programmes. A combination of factors is influencing their emergence: an e-learning agenda that promises efficiency and ubiquity; a proliferation of employability, transferable skills and personal development planning policies; a culture of surveillance which prizes visibility and transparency; and teacher preference for what are seen as empowering pedagogies. This thesis analyses qualitative interview data to explore how students and teachers negotiate issues of audience, performance and authenticity in their high-stakes online <b>reflective</b> practices. Using <b>mask</b> metaphors, and taking a post-structuralist and specifically Foucauldian perspective, the work examines themes of performance, trace, disguise, protection, discipline and transformation. The central argument is {{that the effects of}} both compulsory reflection, and writing online, destabilise and ultimately challenge the humanist ideals on which reflective practices are based: those of a ‘true self’ which can be revealed, understood, recorded, improved or liberated through the process of writing about thoughts and experiences. Rather than revealing and developing the ‘true self’, reflecting online and for assessment produces fragmented, performing, cautious, strategic selves. As a result, it offers an opportunity to work critically with an awareness of audience, genres of writing and shifting subjectivity. This is rarely, if ever, explicitly the goal of such practices. Instead, online reflective practices are imported wholesale from their offline counterparts without acknowledgement of the difference that being online makes, and issues of power in high-stakes reflection are disguised or ignored. Discourses of authentic self-knowledge, personal and professional development, and transformative learning are not appropriate to the nature of high-stakes online reflection. The combination creates passivity, anxiety and calculation, it normalises surveillance, and it produces rituals of confession and compliance. More critical approaches to high-stakes online reflection, which take into account addressivity, experimentation and digitality, are proposed...|$|R
