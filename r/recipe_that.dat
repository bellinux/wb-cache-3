The Ricasoli family traces their lineage in the Chianti region to Lombard barons who ruled during the 11th century. The family estate in Brolio is located in what is now known as the heart of the Chianti Classico region in the province of Siena. Orphaned at a young age, his family estate was crippled with debt and in disarray shortly after Ricasoli got married. Restoring the estate and its vineyard became his primary focus. Ricasoli traveled throughout France and Germany, studying the latest winemaking methods and brought back with him vine cuttings of new grape varieties. He began to experiment in his vineyard and cellar on which grapes produced the best wines at his estate. His work eventually settled on a blend of three Tuscan grapes-Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Malvasia.|$|E

Increasing a refinery’s economic performance depends, among other things, on obtaining optimum blending recipes for the available components. To determine the optimum blending recipe, knowing the mathematical blending model for blending properties estimation and a linear optimization algorithm are necessary. As a blending properties estimation model, the authors used {{a mathematical model}} {{which can be found}} in the literature, validated through own laboratory experiments. Based on the Simplex algorithm developed by Jean-Pierre Moreau, the authors elaborated a software program, program that was used to study different blending recipes.
