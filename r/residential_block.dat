25|$|Other castles {{begun in}} the 11th century were built on {{elevated}} sites that {{took advantage of the}} steep slopes for defense, rather than on moats. The central tower became the final defensive layer of the castle, while the main domestic quarters were built against the walls around the perimeter, allowing plenty of room for a variety of functions. Conisborough Castle is an English example, with the shell keep rising on the earlier motte, and a wall with the residential and service quarters built into it, enclosing the bailey. The ruins within the bailey show remains of a great hall with central fireplace, a kitchen and a two storeyed <b>residential</b> <b>block</b> with adjacent latrines. The keep itself contains a room for the lord, complete with a hooded fireplace, while a small vaulted chapel was built into the thick outer wall of the keep. Ludlow Castle, Shropshire {{begun in the}} 11th century, was lived in by a number of members of the Tudor royal family and had both its fortifications and living quarters improved over several centuries.|$|E
25|$|Later on, {{the tenor}} of town {{development}} shifted northward. Two fisherman harbours, Tsing Yi Tong and Mun Tsai Tong were reclaimed for residential use. Many fishermen were relocated from their boats parked in the typhoon shelter to the Ching Tao House, a new <b>residential</b> <b>block</b> on land, of Chueng Ching Estate. The land inhabitants were put together into several designated areas so as to re-build their villages. The primary sectors had all died out owing to the drastic town development. Tsing Yi Estate, Cheung On Estate, Cheung Fat Estate, Ching Tai Court and Tsing Yi Garden were built after all reclamations were accomplished. Ching Wah Court was built adjoining to Cheung Hong Estate. At the same time, Tsing Yi Bridge was seriously overburdened and its structure was unable to cope with increasing traffic. There was only a one-way road in each direction on the bridge. Traffic congestion became the burning problem in the community, and subsequently aroused protest. Finally, Tsing Yi North Bridge, a connection to Tsuen Wan Town was built to ease off the congestion, {{as well as to}} accommodate the local residential population boom.|$|E

500|$|In 1967 {{an urban}} renewal program {{demolished}} a <b>residential</b> <b>block</b> {{east of the}} main building to create a running track and various athletic fields. The project doubled Manual's campus to its modern size of [...] This {{was a part of}} a larger city-funded effort which created Noe Middle School north of Manual and increased the size of the University of Louisville campus, which was originally touted as a plan to create a continuous chain of schools over many blocks. Manual even became a home for two of the university's women's athletic teams. In the 1980s, the U of L women's basketball team used Manual's gym as a part-time home, playing a total of 40 games in eight seasons there. The U of L volleyball team used the Manual gym as its primary home from 1977 through 1990, after which the team moved into the newly built Cardinal Arena on its own campus. In 1992, Manual began a $3.5 million renovation of the main building which included a new roof and a glass-enclosed cafeteria for juniors and seniors.|$|E
500|$|From the beginning, Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, and it {{is still}} {{considered}} to be [...] "one of Brighton's best sea-facing squares". By the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels, and in early 1969 a surface-level car park was planned for the Brighton Corporation owned central garden; this was changed to a 520-space underground car park which was created using the cut and cover method in which the garden was dug up, the car park with roof constructed, and the lawns and flowerbeds restored. [...] Richard Seifert's , Modernist 24-storey <b>residential</b> <b>block,</b> Sussex Heights, was built in 1968 on land immediately to the east of the square, and was criticised for affecting the character of the square because of its contrasting style and height. During the early 1970s the hotels sought permission from Brighton Corporation to erect neon signs advertising themselves; after negotiation with the Regency Society, a Brighton-wide conservation group formed in 1945, the Corporation made the square and the surrounding area into a conservation area in 1973. [...] Conservation area status gives the council firmer control over planning permission and changes to buildings or street furniture, especially in respect of their effect on [...] "the character and appearance of the area". The original conservation area has since been enlarged twice to its present size of [...]|$|E

2500|$|In 1909, {{the society}} moved its base to Brooklyn.

A former Plymouth church building at 13–17 Hicks Street was also purchased and converted into Watch Tower headquarters, with room for 350 staff. It contained an 800-seat assembly hall, shipping department and printing facilities. The Watch Tower announced: [...] "The new home we shall call 'Bethel,' and the new office and auditorium, 'The Brooklyn Tabernacle'; these names will supplant the term 'Bible House.'" [...] In October 1909, an adjoining building at 122 Columbia Heights was bought. In 1911, a new nine-story <b>residential</b> <b>block</b> was built {{at the rear of the}} headquarters, fronting on Furman Street and overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront.

2500|$|As choirmaster, Augustinussen was {{entitled}} to a municipal curate's farm at Sandenes {{at the end of}} Ranfjorden. However, he chose to live in a cramped apartment in the school building. The school building was in 1856 (after renovations in 1853) 20,5 x 9 ells. On the ground floor were the teaching room, kitchen and parlor for the curate, while the rooms on the first floor were used for housing. Originally there was a dormitory in the attic for pupils who lived far away. It was used as a school building up until 1886, and then became housing for the curate. After becoming a pensioner in 1878, Augustinussen built himself a private <b>residential</b> <b>block</b> on the west wall of the teaching room where he lived {{for the rest of his}} life. This house has since been moved a little away. Both the schoolhouse and Augustinussen's house still stand at Nesna. The schoolhouse is considered to be [...] "the region's oldest building for permanent, organized teaching for the common people".|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{redevelopment}} scheme {{in the city}} since Churchill Square has been the laying out of the New England Quarter mixed-use area on the site formerly occupied by Brighton railway works and Brighton station's car park. [...] The early buildings (2004–07 by Chetwood Associates; mostly residential) are [...] "standard 21st-century developers' fare"; but a second phase of building (2007–09 by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios), with retail buildings integrated with residential blocks under the name One Brighton, is more distinctive. [...] BioRegional and the World Wide Fund for Nature's [...] "One Planet Living" [...] design principles were used to ensure the development was sustainable. [...] The best building, a <b>residential</b> <b>block,</b> comes to [...] "a dramatic sharp point" [...] at an acute road junction. Sustainable design also informs smaller developments around the city: Conran and Partners' Atlanta Apartments (2007) in Bevendean have chestnut wood cladding, recycled copper and living roofs of sedum; the Sea Saw Self-Build scheme in Whitehawk (1993) consists of 24 timber-framed houses; the Hedgehog Housing development at Bevendean (2000) is similar; and a multiple award-winning scheme for the South London Family Housing Association at Hollingdean (1988) was also built according to sustainable principles.|$|E
