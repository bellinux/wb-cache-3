40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to reveal the special {{features}} of <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> <b>link</b> model in LR-WPAN under operating conditions of interference of the reflected and the line-of-sight component and to evaluate the <b>radio</b> <b>link's</b> range of positive light source control. The results of development and practical implementation of controlled spectrally tunable light emitting diode (LED) light sources with ISM- and ZigBee (IEEE 802. 15. 04) -based radio frequency transceivers are presented. A software application developed in LabVIEW simulation of a <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> <b>link</b> for light sources and used for evaluating the <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> <b>link's</b> range of various combinations of polarization of transmitting and receiving antennas has been discussed. It was established and experimentally verified that the received energy was able to be computed using the two-ray model: a line-of-sight ray and the reflected one. This approach is simpler as compared to cellular networks in which multiple reflections from various objects result in multi-path propagation without line-of-sight component...|$|R
5000|$|The Broadcast/Multicast control (BMC) is a {{sublayer}} of layer 2 protocol of Radio Interface Protocol Architecture as per BMC-STD. It {{exists in}} the user plane only. It is located above the <b>Radio</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Control</b> (RLC), a layer 2 responsible for mapping logical channels. It is similar to 802.11's LLC layer which supports multimode operations and it works in three different modes: a) Transparent [...] b) Unacknowledged data transfer [...] c) Acknowledged data transfer.

50|$|The UE (User Equipment) {{interface}} of the RAN (Radio Access Network) primarily {{consists of}} RRC (Radio Resource Control), PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol), RLC (<b>Radio</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Control)</b> and MAC (Media Access Control) protocols. RRC protocol handles connection establishment, measurements, radio bearer services, security and handover decisions. RLC protocol primarily divides into three Modes—Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledge Mode (UM), Acknowledge Mode (AM). The functionality of AM entity resembles TCP operation whereas UM operation resembles UDP operation. In TM mode, {{data will be}} sent to lower layers without adding any header to SDU of higher layers. MAC handles the scheduling of data on air interface depending on higher layer (RRC) configured parameters.|$|E
50|$|In EGPRS/EDGE, the Modulation and Coding Schemes MCS-1 to MCS-9 {{take the}} place of the Coding Schemes of GPRS, and {{additionally}} specify which modulation scheme is used, GMSK or 8PSK. MCS-1 through MCS-4 use GMSK and have performance similar (but not equal) to GPRS, while MCS-5 through MCS-9 use 8PSK. In all EGPRS Modulation and Coding Schemes, a convolutional code of rate 1/3 is used, and puncturing is used to achieve the desired code rate. In contrast to GPRS, the <b>Radio</b> <b>Link</b> <b>Control</b> (RLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) headers and the payload data are coded separately in EGPRS. The headers are coded more robustly than the data.|$|E
50|$|When using a <b>radio</b> <b>link,</b> {{remotely}} <b>controlling</b> {{an auxiliary}} base station consists of sending the primary signal (voice or data) {{along with some}} form of control signal, such as DTMF tones, to another station to change its operating parameters i.e. turn it on or off, change frequency or transmitter power level, rotate the antenna, etc. These signals are considered one form of primary station control, for which the station licensee, and/or a control operator are primarily responsible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of various layers of the general packet radio service (GPRS) protocol stack, including <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> control/medium-access <b>control</b> (RLC/MAC) layer and logical link-control (LLC) layer on the uplink. In the GPRS MAC protocol, several time-slotted uplink radio-frequency channels are shared by the mobiles on a request-reservation-based multiple-access scheme. Using the theory of Markov chains, we derive expressions for the average throughput and delay performance of the GPRS MAC protocol. We evaluate {{the performance of}} the RLC layer (in acknowledged mode) using block-level retransmission (BLR), as defined in the current GPRS standard, and compare it with that of using slot-level retransmission (SLR). We show that SLR at the RLC layer performs significantly better than the BLR, particularly when the channel-error rates are moderate to high. We further investigate the choice of parameters (e. g., number of retransmission attempts) for the automatic repeat request schemes at the RLC and LLC layers. Our results show that it is more beneficial to do error recovery by allowing more retransmission attempts at the RLC layer than at the LLC layer. We also evaluate the performance of transmission-control protocol with BLR and SLR at the RLC layer.
