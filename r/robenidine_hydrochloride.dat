40|$|Digestive {{disorders}} like coccidiosis, Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy and colibacillosis {{are responsible}} for severe economical losses in rational rabbit production. <b>Robenidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is widely used to prevent coccidiosis, a disease which has detrimental effects on zootechnical performance and which acts synergistically with Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy. Although the exact cause of the latter disease is yet unknown, Clostridium perfringens is often isolated from diseased animals. The present study describes the in-vitro effect of <b>robenidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> on 39 Clostridium perfringens isolates from rabbits. <b>Robenidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> concentrations of 4 Âµg/ml were able to inhibit the in-vitro growth of all examined isolates, which might be relevant for the in-vivo situation...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or {{substances}} used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the compatibility of microbial feed additive Bacillus subtilis PB 6 with the coccidiostats maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and <b>robenidine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> The in vivo compatibility of the coccidiostats with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 was assessed {{as part of a}} larger trial in which performance characteristics were measured. A negative control group was included, while the other groups received the recommended dose of Bacillus subtilis PB 6 in the presence or absence of the tested coccidiostats at their maximum authorised levels. Intestinal samples from six birds per treatment group were analysed for aerobic spore formers. Heat treatment of the samples was included to distinguish spores from vegetative cells. No significant differences in numbers of bacilli were observed between the coccidiostat-treated groups and the group treated with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 alone. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is compatible with maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and <b>robenidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> when added to diets for chickens for fattening...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA multi-residue HPLC-ESI-MS/MS {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the simultaneous extraction, detection, and confirmation of the 11 coccidiostats concerned by Regulation 2009 / 8 /EC (lasalocid sodium, narasin, salinomycin sodium, monensin sodium, semduramicin sodium, maduramicin ammonium alpha, <b>robenidine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> decoquinate, halofuginone hydrobromide, nicarbazin, and diclazuril) in feedingstuffs at carry-over level. The sensitivity of the method allows quantification and confirmation for all coccidiostats below target concentration. The method was in-house validated and meets all criteria of European legislation (2002 / 657 /EC). The precision of the method was determined under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions; RSDr and RSDR were below the maximum permitted values for every tested concentration. The specificity was checked by analysing representative blank samples and blank samples fortified with potentially interfering substances (benzimidazoles, corticosteroides, triphenylmethane dyes, quinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenicols) and no interference were found. Concerning quantification, a quadratic regression model was fitted to every calibration curve with a regression coefficient R 2 above 0. 99 on each data set. Finally, the expanded uncertainty U was calculated with data obtained within the laboratory while applying the method during validation and in routine tests...|$|E
