Sergei Makarov was a controversial winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1989–90. He won the {{rookie of the year}} award at the age of 31 after spending 13 seasons in the Soviet League.

The British Army, which organises Ten Tors, initially stated that the 2007 event would proceed as planned.

5|$|The {{description}} of a cognitively real polylectal grammar came with 's set of <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> speech of Norwich that, presumably, could generate any possible output for a specific population of speakers and was psychologically real for such speakers such that native residents who normally exhibited sound mergers (e.g. between the vowels of days and daze) could accurately and consistently make the distinction if called upon to imitate older Norwich speakers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the {{matching}} <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E

The other three teams were able to field {{a large number of}} Major League players. Of players born outside the United States on 2006 Major League Opening Day rosters, the Dominican Republic (85) and Venezuela (43) had more than all other {{countries}} and between them accounted for more than 57% of foreign-born players in the leagues. Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian-American players under the eligibility <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tournament. Thus, Australia was considered the underdog in the pool.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{was born}} in Wales to Anglo-Irish parents. In 1817, after holding several ranks in the army, he became the equerry of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. Edward died two years later, leaving a widow and infant daughter. Holding the {{position}} of comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household for the next nineteen years, Conroy also acted as her confidant and political agent, among other roles. Together, they designed the Kensington System, an elaborate and strict system of <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> upbringing of young Victoria, designed to render her weak-willed and utterly dependent upon them {{in the hope of}} allowing them one day to wield power through her.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the system}} suggest that <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of DRS have created an {{inconsistency}} of approach to lbw decisions depending on {{the circumstances of the}} referral. Opponents also doubt that the ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests have shown the system to be 100% accurate. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have consistently declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to their concerns regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation.|$|E

5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.|$|E
