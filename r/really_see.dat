500|$|Despite {{his early}} optimism, Noades soon {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that a League club in Milton Keynes would not draw crowds much higher than those Wimbledon already attracted in south London.

[...] "I really couldn't see any future in it. I can't actually see that there is a means of drawing large attendances to Milton Keynes." [...] Abandoning his interest in MK City, Noades sold Wimbledon to Hammam in 1981 for £40,000. Later that year Noades bought nearby Crystal Palace and briefly explored merging that club with Wimbledon.|$|E
500|$|In the Japanese {{animated}} {{adaptations of}} Fullmetal Alchemist, Alphonse was voiced by Rie Kugimiya.

In Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Dismuke was replaced by Maxey Whitehead, as Dismuke's voice had changed with age.

Leonard Maltin has {{characterized}} her editing as [...] "sensational". Gerald Peary, who interviewed Fields in 1980, wrote that, [...] "Jaws scared the world, brought in a fortune for Universal, and made Verna Fields, who won an Academy Award, about as famous 'overnight' as an editor ever gets."

Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more.

500|$|Of {{the various}} fields Stratton studied, {{it is his}} {{experimentation}} in binocular vision and perception that has had the most impact. Whether during the inversion experiment people <b>really</b> <b>see</b> an upside-down world as being normal, or whether they adapt to it only behaviorally, has been debated for a long time. Neuroimaging studies done a century after the original experiment have shown no difference in early levels of visual processing, which indicates the perceptual world stays inverted at that level of cognition. [...] The research has been put to use in both practical and esthetic ways. The mirror-experiment experience of disconnect between vision and feeling has parallels in, and applications for researching, phantom limb syndrome. [...] The art exhibit Upside-down Mushroom Room by Belgian artist Carsten Höller, a tunnel installation with an inverted environment, builds on Stratton's work.|$|E

500|$|Once Warner Bros. Television {{secured the}} rights to the show, Gough and Millar set out to write the script and find a {{director}} for the pilot. Gough and Millar were fans of director David Nutter's previous work; they considered him to be a [...] "preeminent pilot director". David Nutter joined the project because he wanted to make a pilot that respected the audience but that was still fun and smart. Nutter also believes in creating shows that appeal {{to a wide variety of}} audiences. He wanted the final scene for the pilot, in which Clark fantasizes about dancing with Lana, to express the show's essence.

500|$|Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier/Lord Caldlow (The Great Danton), {{an aristocratic}} magician. After reading the script, Jackman {{expressed}} interest in playing the part. Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to <b>really</b> <b>see</b> what he can do as an actor, and this is a character that would let him do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
500|$|Sell said God of War {{has very}} few flaws {{and that the}} only one worth {{mentioning}} is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, [...] "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or you fail to make a jump because you couldn't <b>really</b> <b>see</b> the jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts [...] "a little bothersome". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their [...] "brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied".|$|E

500|$|A third {{official}} trailer debuted on iTunes on May 3, 2012. The trailer {{was attached}} to the 3D première of The Avengers, the day after. The trailer contains what most reporters called a better and more fleshed Lizard. Adam Chitwood of Collider said, [...] "The webslinging has an edge to it and The Lizard has much more texture. I like Andrew Garfield a whole lot, and the biggest draw for me here is the character work between Garfield and Emma Stone. They look to have some great chemistry and Garfield brings out a... side of Peter Parker that we didn't <b>really</b> <b>see</b> in Sam Raimi's trilogy." [...] Sandy Schaefer of ScreenRant felt that [...] "the darker color palette and 3D visuals shown here look overall quite crisp, even without the benefit of the big screen." [...] Webb felt that [...] "there's a small, intimate little indie movie at the heart of Spider-Man".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones.

He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we <b>really</b> <b>see</b> George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't <b>really</b> <b>see</b> a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{appeared}} as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer (Sean Combs), in the 2001 feature film Monster's Ball. Her performance {{was awarded the}} National Board of Review and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress; in an interesting coincidence {{she became the first}} woman of color to win the Academy Award for Best Actress (earlier in her career, she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge, the first African American to be nominated for Best Actress, and who was born at the same hospital as Berry, in Cleveland, Ohio). The NAACP issued the statement: [...] "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [...] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part. Berry responded: [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>see</b> a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there, {{and it would be a}} really special script that would require something like that again." ...|$|E

Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror also disliked Adam's introduction, describing [...] "the introduction of a puppy-love sequence between Rose and a cute English boy" [...] as [...] "very, very irritating". SFX Magazine commented on the similarity between Adam's introduction to the future and that of Rose in [...] "The End of the World" [...] stating [...] "it was clearly a deliberate parallel on Russell's part, as part of his scheme to contrast and compare the reactions of Rose and Adam". Their website reviewer observed that Adam's [...] "comedy faint" [...] marked him out as an unsuitable traveller. Marc Edward DiPaulo of the University of Oklahoma notes that Adam's role in [...] "The Long Game" [...] is to provide satire on the media and to function as [...] "a condemnation of those who cannot stop immersing themselves in television, the Internet, iPods, and other nonstop broadcasters of what the Doctor calls [...] "useless information."" [...] Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog describes him as a [...] "craven meddler" [...] and a [...] "social climber". By virtue of his failures, Adam becomes [...] "the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions".|$|E
500|$|A {{sequel to}} her first {{greatest}} hits album, The Immaculate Collection (1990), GHV2 included fifteen singles released during Madonna's second decade in the recording industry, starting from [...] "Erotica" [...] (1992) to [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] (2001). Unlike the former release, GHV2 did not feature any new material. In an interview with BBC's Jo Whiley, Madonna spoke about {{the selection of the}} tracks, [...] "I only wanted songs that I could listen to five times in a row." [...] She also added that [...] "If you listen to the record, you can <b>really</b> <b>see</b> my evolution as a singer, songwriter, and, more important, a human being." [...] Madonna felt that because it was a [...] "greatest hits", it should only contain previously released hit songs. Several of her popular singles of that period were excluded from the album. Despite being a worldwide number-one hit in 2000, [...] "American Pie" [...] was not included because Madonna had regretted putting it on her eighth studio album, Music (2000). [...] "It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn't belong on the album so now it's being punished... My gut told me not to , but I did it and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn't deserve a place on GHV2." [...] she said. Other notable exclusions were [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", [...] "Rain", [...] "I'll Remember" [...] and [...] "You'll See"—all of which had been included on her ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995).|$|E
