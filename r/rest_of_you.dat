500|$|During Corzine's {{campaign}} for the United States Senate, he made some controversial off-color statements. [...] When introduced to {{a man with an}} Italian name who said he was in the construction business, Corzine quipped: “Oh, you make cement shoes!" [...] according to Emanuel Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee. Alfano reported that when introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine said: [...] "He's not Italian, is he? Oh, I guess he's your Jewish lawyer who is here to get the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> out of jail." [...] Corzine denied mentioning religion, but did not deny the quip about Italians, stating that some of his own ancestors were probably Italian, or maybe French.|$|E
500|$|Warren {{spoke at}} the 2012 Democratic National Convention {{immediately}} before Bill Clinton on the penultimate night of the convention. Warren contrasted President Obama's economic plan with Mitt Romney's in the 2012 election and rebuked the Republican Party's economic policy stating: [...] "Their vision is clear: 'I've got mine, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are on your own.'" [...] Warren positioned herself {{as a champion of}} a beleaguered middle class that, as she said, [...] "has been chipped, squeezed and hammered." [...] Brown attended the 2012 Republican National Convention, but was not a speaker there. According to Brown, he had rejected an offer to play a larger role, and limited his attendance to a single day because of scheduling demands.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{achieved}} mainstream {{success in}} the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April. During their Royal Variety Show performance that was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at his audience: [...] "For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For {{the people in the}} cheaper seats, clap your hands... and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> if you'll just rattle your jewellery." [...] After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E

500|$|The Wolverines {{were the}} {{unanimous}} pre-season Number 1 pick in 1981 but lost their opener to Wisconsin 2114. In the team meeting the next day, Schembechler {{walked into the}} room and wrote [...] "Ed Muransky" [...] and [...] "Stan Edwards" [...] on the chalkboard, and then barked out, [...] "The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> are quitters. I want nothing more to do with you," [...] and left. According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked at everyone and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. If we start to play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E
500|$|They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, {{followed}} by {{three days of}} rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order decided {{on the eve of}} the event. At the beginning of their performance of [...] "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the audience: [...] " [...] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you...</b> we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd." [...] At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of that hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters commented on their almost twenty years of animosity: [...] "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1867, Truth {{moved from}} Harmonia to Battle Creek. In 1868, she {{traveled}} to western New York and visited with Amy Post, and continued traveling {{all over the}} East Coast.

One evening {{when he had finished}} everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then he sat back on his folded legs, with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E

2500|$|On August 1, 1781, {{having been}} {{promoted}} to Colonel, Callis reported on the fleet in the Portsmouth area to Brig Gen. Weedon at Williamsburg. [...] Louis L. Kean relates how his great-great-great-grandmother Anne (Price) Callis told her grandchildren that Callis met with Benedict Arnold on the James River to arrange for the exchange of prisoners of war. As {{they waited for the}} papers to be processed, Arnold asked what would happen if he, Arnold, were taken prisoner. Callis replied, [...] "Sir, the leg that was wounded in the service of your country would be buried with full military honors. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> they would hang!"

2500|$|The Introduction closes with Arthur – still {{refusing to}} claim that the play is real – facilitating its {{publication}} anyway. Arthur meditates on the artificiality of endings, and points out that the reader's reaction to The Tragedy of Arthur rests on how they interpret the story told in the Introduction. He sums up the project by claiming that those [...] "who know [...] personally know to a fine degree how much of all this is true, how much an apology (and how sincere), how much a boast or a con job. To the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> it's a muddle or it's a thing of beauty. And if it pleased you, and you found in its candor and lies and sobbing cross-dressed confessions some hours' entertainment, then well and good." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2004, Hunt was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to have it done in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, [...] "Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all you get is your cleavage back; you don't get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your back, skin from your thighs, fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> was fine. Now half your body is hacked about – and for what?" [...] The day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.|$|E
