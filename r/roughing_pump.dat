5000|$|One {{consideration}} for choosing a <b>roughing</b> <b>pump</b> {{is whether the}} pump uses lubricating oil that's exposed to the vacuum. This concern of [...] "hydrocarbon backstreaming" [...] where pump oil as a gas makes {{its way into the}} vacuum chamber, has led to oil-free pump designs on the market.|$|E
50|$|Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or {{molecular}} drag pump) {{as their}} last stage {{to increase the}} maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1-10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump {{could be used to}} back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called <b>roughing</b> <b>pump)</b> that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the <b>roughing</b> <b>pump</b> becomes significant.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum {{is created}} and {{maintained}} {{by a series}} of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a <b>roughing</b> <b>pump,</b> most commonly a standard rotary vane pump. This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often turbomolecular pumps. Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.|$|E
50|$|Two main {{types of}} <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps</b> are oil-sealed <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps</b> and dry <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps.</b> Within the two {{categories}} are {{various kinds of}} designs with differences among them based on maintenance issues, initial costs, pump lifespan and vacuum level.

40|$|Micromachined {{vacuum pumps}} {{are one of}} the key {{components}} in miniature systems for chemical and biological analysis. Miniature sensors and analyzers are normally operated at the pressure range lower than a few millitorr. We are developing a micromachined vacuum pump that is comprised of a mechanical <b>rough</b> <b>pump</b> integrated with micromachined ion-pumps. The <b>rough</b> <b>pump</b> generates a low vacuum of tens of torr from atmospheric pressure for the ion-pumps to initialize. Field ionization and electron impact ionization pumps that connect to the <b>rough</b> <b>pumps</b> continue to pump from the low vacuum of tens of torr to high vacuum of millitorr or even microtorr. The focus of this thesis work is {{on the development of the}} micromachined <b>rough</b> <b>pump.</b> A micromachined displacement pump concept is adopted for the development of the chip scale vacuum <b>rough</b> <b>pump.</b> The micro displacement pump is designed with the aid of analytical and numerical modeling. The <b>rough</b> <b>pump</b> is fabricated by deep-reactive ion etching and other standard micromachining techniques. Systematic study into operation of this class of pumps allows us to now report on a pump that achieves 164 torr absolute pressure, which is to our knowledge the lowest measured pressure in a micromachined vacuum pump operated from atmospheric pressure. This performance improvement is significant in that it enables a base pressure of less than 35 torr for a two-stage design, which allows integration with the ion pump, thus leading to realization of miniature chemical and biological analyzers. More importantly, the understanding of the micromachined displacement pumps for vacuum generation has been greatly improved and a universal model has been developed, which is very powerful to describe and predict the micromachined displacement pump behavior for vacuum generation. by Hui Zhou.

Pumps that operate in the high vacuum ranges typically don't operate, or only operate inefficiently, at atmospheric pressures, whereas pumps that work efficiently at atmospheric pressure usually cannot produce a vacuum lower than approximately 1x10−3 torr.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} forms of routine maintenance is replacing sample and waste tubing on the peristaltic pump, as these tubes can get worn fairly quickly resulting in holes and clogs in the sample line, resulting in skewed results.

50|$|The {{sorption}} pump is a vacuum pump {{that creates a}} vacuum by adsorbing molecules on a very porous material like molecular sieve which is cooled by a cryogen, typically liquid nitrogen. The ultimate pressure is about 10−2 mbar. With special techniques this can be lowered till 10−7 mbar. The main advantages are the absence of oil or other contaminants, low cost and vibration free operation {{because there are no}} moving parts. The main disadvantages are that it cannot operate continuously and cannot effectively pump hydrogen, helium and neon, all gases with lower condensation temperature than liquid nitrogen. The main application is as a <b>roughing</b> <b>pump</b> for a sputter-ion pump in ultra-high vacuum experiments, for example in surface physics.|$|E

40|$|We {{improved}} our {{inductively coupled plasma}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ICP-MS) whole blood method [1] for determination of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) by including manganese (Mn) and selenium (Se), and expanding the calibration range of all analytes. The method is validated on a PerkinElmer (PE) ELAN 2 DRC II ICP-MS (ICP-DRC-MS) and uses the Dynamic Reaction Cell (DRC) technology to attenuate interfering background ion signals via ion-molecule reactions. Methane gas (CH 4) eliminates background signal from (40) Ar 2 (+) to permit determination of (80) Se(+), and oxygen gas (O 2) eliminates several polyatomic interferences (e. g. (40) Ar(15) N(+), (54) Fe(1) H(+)) on (55) Mn(+). Hg sensitivity in DRC mode is a factor of two higher than vented mode when measured under the same DRC conditions as Mn due to collisional focusing of the ion beam. To compensate for the expanded method's longer analysis time (due to DRC mode pause delays), we implemented an SC 4 -FAST autosampler (ESI Scientific, Omaha, NE), which vacuum loads the sample onto a loop, to keep the sample-to-sample measurement time to less than 5 min, allowing for preparation and analysis of 60 samples in an 8 -h work shift. The longer analysis time also resulted in faster breakdown of the hydrocarbon oil in the interface <b>roughing</b> <b>pump.</b> The replacement of the standard <b>roughing</b> <b>pump</b> with a pump using a fluorinated lubricant, Fomblin 2, extended the time between pump maintenance. We optimized the diluent and rinse solution components to reduce carryover from high concentration samples and prevent the formation of precipitates.

40|$|Abstract. The Knudsen Compressor is a {{solid-state}} micro/meso-scale gas <b>roughing</b> <b>pump</b> {{based on}} the rarefied gas phenomena of thermal transpiration. Knudsen Compressors operate by imposing a temperature gradient across a high porosity, low thermal conductivity transpiration membrane, typically a silicon aerogel membrane. Previous optimization studies have concluded that significant reductions of both energy consumption and device volume per unit throughput and pressure difference can be achieved when each stage of the cascade operates with a Knudsen Number {{based on the}} mean pore radius of approximately one. Perforated aerogels (using the same bulk aerogel material, but with machined arrays of properly sized parallel capillaries) are appealing candidate low-pressure transpiration membranes and {{are the focus of}} this investigation. Conventional drilling techniques using micro drills have successfully demonstrated perforated aerogel with pore diameters ranging from 210 µm to 1 mm. This range of pore sizes corresponds to efficient Knudsen Compressor operation between roughly 1 Torr and 10 mTorr. The other issue at low pressures is the larger Kn of the connector section which can introduce “reverse ” thermal transpiration. Two conventionally perforated carbon doped aerogel membranes, with the mean pore diameters of 210 µm and 380 µm, have been tested at the operating pressure range of 2 Torr to 10 mTorr. Comparison with the predicated results showed the evidence of rarefied gas effects such as “reverse ” thermal transpiration. I...|$|E
40|$|Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of {{thin films}} from {{molybdenum}} carbonyl (Mo (CO) 6) at 300 °C under atmospheric pressure {{has resulted in}} either reflective or black molybdenum, depending on the absence or presence of an oxygen bleed during the deposition. After post-deposition anneal, the reflective film exhibits an infrared reflectance of 98. 7 % at 10 microns while the black film exhibits a solar absorptance of a = 0. 74 and a thermal (500 °C) emittance of en = 0. 08, (en referring to the normal emittance). The reflectance of both films, before and after anneal, has been related to their composition, grain size, and crystal structure. In particular this {{has been done in}} the infrared for the reflective films and in the visible for the black films. The solar absorptance of both film types can be enhanced by one or two antireflection layers with only slight increases in the emittance. A bilayer of CVD silicon (700 Å) and silicon nitride (700 Å) on the annealed reflective film results in a = 0. 75 and e (500 °C) = 0. 05. A layer of CVD silicon nitride (750 Å) on the black film results in a = 0. 91 and en (500 °C) = 0. 11.

A project is currently in progress at JPL to develop a miniaturized Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system, incorporating and/or developing miniature system components including turbomolecular pumps, scroll type <b>roughing</b> <b>pump,</b> quadrupole mass filter, gas chromatograph, precision power supply and other electronic components. The preponderance of the system elements will be fabricated using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) techniques. The quadrupole mass filter will be fabricated using an X-ray lithography technique producing high precision, 5 x 5 arrays of quadrupoles with pole lengths of about 3 mm and a total volume of 27 cubic mm. The miniature scroll pump will also be fabricated using X-ray lithography producing arrays of scroll stages about 3 mm in diameter. The target detection range for the mass spectrometer is 1 to 300 atomic mass units (AMU) with are solution of 0. 5 AMU.

This paper will discuss the design approach, the current state-of-the art regarding the system components and the progress toward development of key elements.

40|$|Miniature {{scroll pumps}} have been {{proposed}} as <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps</b> (low - vacuum pumps) for miniature scientific instruments (e. g., portable mass spectrometers and gas analyzers) that depend on vacuum. The larger scroll <b>pumps</b> used as <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps</b> in some older vacuum systems are fabricated by conventional machining. Typically, such an older scroll pump includes (1) an electric motor with an eccentric shaft to generate orbital motion of a scroll and (2) conventional bearings to restrict the orbital motion to a circle. The proposed miniature scroll pumps would differ from the prior, larger ones in both design and fabrication. A miniature scroll pump would include two scrolls: one mounted on a stationary baseplate and one on a flexure stage (see figure). An electromagnetic actuator {{in the form of}} two pairs of voice coils in a push-pull configuration would make the flexure stage move in the desired circular orbit. The capacitance between the scrolls would be monitored to provide position (gap) feedback to a control system that would adjust the drive signals applied to the voice coils to maintain the circular orbit as needed for precise sealing of the scrolls. To minimize power consumption and maximize precision of control, the flexure stage would be driven at the frequency of its mechanical resonance. The miniaturization of these pumps would entail both operational and manufacturing tolerances of < 1 m. Such tight tolerances cannot be achieved easily by conventional machining of high-aspect-ratio structures like those of scroll-pump components. In addition, the vibrations of conventional motors and ball bearings exceed these tight tolerances by an order of magnitude. Therefore, the proposed pumps would be fabricated by the microfabrication method known by the German acronym LIGA (lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung, which means lithography, electroforming, molding) because LIGA {{has been shown to be}} capable of providing the required tolerances at large aspect ratios...|$|R
40|$|Pneumatically {{actuated}} miniature peristaltic {{vacuum pumps}} {{have been proposed}} for incorporation into advanced miniature versions of scientific instruments that depend on vacuum for proper operation. These pumps {{are expected to be}} capable of reaching vacuum-side pressures in the torr to millitorr range (from. 133 down to. 0. 13 Pa). Vacuum pumps that operate in this range are often denoted <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps.</b> In comparison with previously available <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps,</b> these pumps are expected to be an order of magnitude less massive and less power-hungry. In addition, they would be extremely robust, and would operate with little or no maintenance and without need for oil or other lubricants. Portable mass spectrometers are typical examples of instruments that could incorporate the proposed pumps. In addition, the proposed pumps could be used as <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps</b> in general laboratory applications in which low pumping rates could be tolerated. The proposed pumps could be designed and fabricated in conventionally machined and micromachined versions. A typical micromachined version (see figure) would include a rigid glass, metal, or plastic substrate and two layers of silicone rubber. The bottom silicone layer would contain shallow pump channels covered by silicone arches that could be pushed down pneumatically to block the channels. The bottom silicone layer would be covered with a thin layer of material with very low gas permeability, and would be bonded to the substrate everywhere except in the channel areas. The top silicone layer would be attached to the bottom silicone layer and would contain pneumatic- actuation channels that would lie crosswise to the pump channels. This version is said to be micromachined because the two silicone layers containing the channels would be fabricated by casting silicone rubber on micromachined silicon molds. The pneumatic-actuation channels would be alternately connected to a compressed gas and (depending on pump design) either to atmospheric pressure or to a partial vacuum source. The design would be such that the higher pneumatic pressure would be sufficient to push the silicone arches down onto the substrates, blocking the channels. Thus, by connecting pneumatic- actuation channels to the two pneumatic sources in spatial and temporal alternation, waves of opening and closing, equivalent to peristalsis, could be made to move along the pump channels. A pump according to this concept could be manufactured inexpensively. Pneumatic sources (compressors and partial vacuum sources) similar those needed for actuation are commercially available; they typically have masses of. 100 g and power demands of the order of several W. In a design-optimization effort, {{it should be possible to}} reduce masses and power demands below even these low levels and to integrate pneumatic sources along with the proposed pumps into miniature units with overall dimensions of no more than a few centimeters per side...|$|R

40|$|This study forms part of {{a larger}} study to develop a MEMS scale {{turbomachinery}} based vacuum pump. This would allow very high vacuum to be drawn for handheld mass spectroscopy. This thesis concentrates on the roughing portion of the turbo pump where flow can still be treated as a continuum but the no slip boundary condition is not accurate. The first portion of this thesis investigates flow at Knudsen numbers ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 1. By using a first order analysis, the wall shear stress can be specified in a commercial computational fluid dynamics code allowing slip flow to occur. This method was validated against a basic Poiseuille flow at these higher Knudsen numbers where slip flow was present. This demonstrated {{that it was possible to}} use a commercial code to model Knudsen number flows between 0. 001 to 0. 1. The second part of the thesis focused on the design of a <b>roughing</b> <b>pump</b> stage consisting of three blade rows a stationary inlet and outlet surrounding the rotor blade row. The no slip condition was not imposed as the simulated stage was assumed to be the outlet stage, and thus operating at a very low Knudsen number. A two dimensional analysis was developed to define the initial blade shape to achieve a maximum pressure ratio. A three dimensional simulation was developed to investigate the effects of tip leakage losses. The simulations are able to predict pressure ratio and power consumption of a particular stage of a MEMS scale turbopump.

A unique attosecond pump-probe apparatus using a compact Mach-Zehnder interferometer is developed. The interferometer system is compact (∼ 290 cm 2) and completely located outside of the vacuum chamber. The location reduces the mechanical vibration from vacuum components such as turbopumps and <b>roughing</b> <b>pumps.</b> The stability of the inter-ferometer is ∼ 50 as RMS over 24 hours, stabilized with an active feedback loop.

Contamination by fine particles settling from the air inside laboratories has not been considered a serious threat.

When stowed, the inflatable habitat measured approximately 241 cm (95 inches) in diameter by 152 cm (60 inches) high and weighed close to 1361 kg (3, 000 pounds). Two vacuum chambers connected by a large vacuum line were used to perform this test. The inflatable habitat was mounted in the smaller chamber, which was 396 cm (13 feet) in diameter and 1128 cm (37 feet) high. The larger chamber, which was 823 cm (27 feet) in diameter and 2, 591 cm (85 feet) high, was <b>rough</b> <b>pumped</b> and used as a vacuum reservoir. A two stage axial type compressor and ten Stokes vacuum pumps were also used during the depressurization. Opening a butterfly valve on the vacuum line, at the smaller chamber, was manually controlled so that the smaller chamber's depressurization rate matched the launch pressure profile...|$|R
40|$|A need {{exists for}} miniaturized, rugged, {{low-cost}} high-vacuum systems. Recent advances in sensor technology {{have led to}} the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other analytical instruments such as scanning electron microscopes. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was developed based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture molecular drag pump (MDP). The MDP is enabled by a miniature, very-high-speed (200, 000 rpm), rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. The key advantages of the pump are reduced cost and improved ruggedness compared to other mechanical hig-hvacuum pumps. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate rotor and stator blades for other pump designs. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor will likely not be necessary. Finally, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three over competing designs. The new pump forms the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications and on spacecraft and planetary landers. The MDP achieves high vacuum coupled to a ruggedized diaphragm <b>rough</b> <b>pump.</b> Instead of the relatively complicated rotor and stator blades used in turbomolecular pumps, the rotor in the MDP consists of a simple, smooth cylinder of aluminum. This will turn at approximately 200, 000 rpm inside an outer stator housing. The pump stator comprises a cylindrical aluminum housing with one or more specially designed grooves that serve as flow channels. To minimize the length of the pump, the gas is forced down the flow channels of the outer stator to the base of the pump. The gas is then turned and pulled toward the top through a second set of channels cut into an inner stator housing that surrounds the motor. The compressed gas then flows down channels in the motor housing to the exhaust port of the pump. The exhaust port of the pump is connected to a commercially available diaphragm or scroll pump...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive zinc, {sup 65 }Zn, was {{detected}} after a thermal vacuum process that extracted a desired product from articles {{out of a}} commercial light water reactor. While the facility is designed to handle radioactive materials, {{the location of the}} {sup 65 }Zn was in an area that is not designed for gamma emitting contaminants. A series of experiments were conducted to entrain the contaminant in an easily replaceable trap within the process piping. The experiments were conducted with increasing levels of complexity. Initially a simple apparatus was developed to determine the effect of substrate temperature on the vapor capture, this was followed by experiments to determine the effect of filter pore size on pumping and trapping, finally the interactive effects of both pore size and temperature were evaluated. The testing was conducted on a system that used a <b>roughing</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> using model and prototypic materials. It was determined that heating the substrate to nominally 200 °C resulted in effective trapping on the model as well as prototypic material...|$|R

Recent advances in sensor technology {{have led to the}} development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other miniature analytical instruments. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was created based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive- to-manufacture molecular drag pump (MDP). The MDP is enabled by the development of a miniature, veryhigh- speed, rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. Such a pump represents an order-of-magnitude reduction in mass, volume, and cost over current, commercially available, state-ofthe- art vacuum pumps. The vacuum system consists of the MDP coupled to a ruggedized <b>rough</b> <b>pump</b> (for terrestrial applications or for planets with substantial atmospheres). The rotor in the MDP consists of a simple smooth cylinder of aluminum spinning at approximately 200, 000 RPM inside an outer stator housing. The pump stator comprises a cylindrical aluminum housing with one or more specially designed grooves that serve as flow channels. To minimize the length of the pump, the gas is forced down the flow channels of the outer stator to the base of the pump. The gas is then turned and pulled toward the top through a second set of channels cut into an inner stator housing that surrounds the motor. The compressed gas then flows down channels in the motor housing to the exhaust port of the pump. The exhaust port of the pump is connected to a diaphragm or scroll pump. This pump delivers very high performance in a very small envelope. The design was simplified so that a smaller compression ratio, easier manufacturing process, and enhanced ruggedness can be achieved at the lowest possible cost. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate TMP (turbo molecular pump) rotor and stator blades. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor is greatly simplified. Finally, because of the simplified design, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three. In fact, there are only five parts, not counting the motor and off-the-shelf screws and O-rings. This reduces the amount of machining and also makes fit-up much simpler while allowing the maintenance of close tolerances...|$|R
