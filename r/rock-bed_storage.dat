40|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} solar thermal storage is for power generation or process heating. Low-temperature thermal storage in a packed rock bed {{is considered the}} best option for thermal storage for solar drying applications. In this chapter, mathematical formulations for conical have been developed. The model equations are solved numerically for charging/discharging cycles utilizing MATLAB. Results were compared with <b>rock-bed</b> <b>storage</b> with standard straight tank. From the simulated results, the temperature distribution {{was found to be}} more uniform in the truncated conical <b>rock-bed</b> <b>storage.</b> Also, the pressure drop {{over a long period of}} time in the conical thermal storage was as low as 25 Pa. Hence, the amount of power required from a centrifugal fan would be significantly lower. The flow of air inside the tank is simulated in SolidWorks software. From flow simulation, 3 D modelling of flow is obtained to capture the actual scenario inside the tank...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} {{analysis of the}} air flow through the <b>rock-bed</b> <b>storage.</b> Air was collected {{from the inside of}} the plastic tunnel and pressed to the segments of the storage with area was 18. 7 m 2 and volume was almost 13. 1 m 3. The research was carried out from March to October 2013. The cycle of the storage work (charging or discharg-ing) was controlled based on the algorithm, in which a controlling signal was based on the difference in the temperature between the average temperature of the bed and the temperature inside a tunnel. 318 measurement cycles were selected for a detailed analysis. In those cycles, based on the measured parameters of air pressed into and flowing out of the storage, the amount of the stored heat in the storage and the change in the concentration of steam included in air was determined. For the obtained results multiple regression equations, describing a unitary heat stream and mass exchanged during the air flow through the storage, were found. Moreover, the quantity relation...|$|E
40|$|In many mild climates, {{during most}} part of summer, night-time {{temperatures}} are {{much lower than}} comfort temperatures. That {{is the case of}} most parts of Italy, where monthly mean temperatures in July and August are lower than 28 Â°C. Nonetheless, daytime temperatures are higher, thus air-conditioning is widely used even in buildings with low inner gains, like dwellings. It is obvious that {{it would be possible to}} have free cooling by storing night-time "cold" in order to provide it during daytime. On the other hand, as dwellings are usually occupied during nights, indoor temperature cannot be lowered as much as possible, without limiting comfort. So, <b>rock-bed</b> heat <b>storage</b> will let time shifting of temperature peak. Yet, even though it is not brand new, no design procedure is readily available. Moreover, the heat storage is very bulky so its integration in the architecture is a barrier. <b>Rock-bed</b> heat <b>storage</b> is numerically simulated in order to figure out its actual behaviour and the relevance of geometrical parameters on its effectiveness. A Schumann two-phase model is used to simulate a free-cooling ventilation system with <b>rock-bed</b> heat <b>storage</b> for a new building, to be built in Pesaro, Italy. Results show that for time shifting of temperature peak, heat storage volume is relevant rather than its length. This makes it possible to realize low energy demand ventilation systems by reducing pressure drop through the heat storage. Besides, when optimizing system use, its length becomes relevant again...|$|R
40|$|The drying {{of fruit}} and {{vegetables}} is a subject of great importance. Dried fruit and vegetables have gained commercial importance, and their growth on a commercial scale has become an important sector of the agricultural industry. However, food drying {{is one of the}} most energy intensive processes of the major industrial process and accounts for up to 15 [*]% of all industrial energy usage. Due to increasingly high electricity prices and environmental concern, a dryer using traditional energy sources is not a feasible option anymore. Therefore, an alternative/renewable energy source is needed. In this regard, an integrated solar drying system that includes highly efficient double-pass counter flow v-groove solar collector, conical-shaped <b>rock-bed</b> thermal <b>storage,</b> auxiliary heater, the centrifugal fan and the drying chamber has been designed and constructed. Mathematical model for all the individual components as well as an integrated model combining all components of the drying system has been developed. Mathematical equations were solved using MATLAB program. This paper presents the analytical model and key finding of the simulation...|$|R
