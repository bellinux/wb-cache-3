40|$|AbstractWe review {{morphogenesis}} of the enteric {{nervous system}} from migratory neural crest cells, and defects {{of this process}} such as Hirschsprung disease, centering on cell motility and assembly, and cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules, along with cell proliferation and growth factors. We then review continuum and agent-based (cellular automata) models with rules of cell movement and logistical proliferation. Both movement and proliferation at the individual cell level are modeled with stochastic components from which stereotyped outcomes emerge at the population level. These models reproduced the wave-like colonization of the intestine by enteric neural crest cells, and several new properties emerged, such as colonization by frontal expansion, which were later confirmed biologically. These models predict a surprising level of clonal heterogeneity {{both in terms of}} number and distribution of daughter cells. Biologically, migrating cells form stable chains made up of unstable cells, but this is not seen in the initial model. We outline additional rules for cell differentiation into neurons, axon extension, cell-axon and cell–cell adhesions, chemotaxis and repulsion which can <b>reproduce</b> <b>chain</b> migration. After the migration stage, the cells re-arrange as a network of ganglia. Changes in cell adhesion molecules parallel this, and we describe additional rules based on Steinberg's Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, reflecting changing levels of adhesion in neural crest cells and neurons. This was able to reproduce enteric ganglionation in a model. Mouse mutants with disturbances of enteric nervous system morphogenesis are discussed, and these suggest future refinement of the models. The modeling suggests a relatively simple set of cell behavioral rules could account for complex patterns of morphogenesis. The model has allowed the proposal that Hirschsprung disease is mostly an enteric neural crest cell proliferation defect, not a defect of cell migration. In addition, the model suggests an explanations for zonal and skip segment variants of Hirschsprung disease, and also gives a novel stochastic explanation for the observed discordancy of Hirschsprung disease in identical twins...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThawing of {{permafrost}} in {{a warming}} climate {{is governed by}} a complex interplay of different processes of which only conductive heat transfer is {{taken into account in}} most model studies. However, observations in many permafrost landscapes demonstrate that lateral and vertical movement of water can have a pronounced influence on the thaw trajectories, creating distinct landforms, such as thermokarst ponds and lakes, even in areas where per-mafrost is otherwise thermally stable. Novel process param-eterizations are required to include such phenomena in future projections of permafrost thaw and subsequent climatic-triggered feedbacks. In this study, we present a new land-surface scheme designed for permafrost applications, Cryo-Grid 3, which constitutes a flexible platform to explore new parameterizations for a range of permafrost processes. We document the model physics and employed parameteriza-tions for the basis module CryoGrid 3, and compare model results with in situ observations of surface energy balance, surface temperatures, and ground thermal regime from the Samoylov permafrost observatory in NE Siberia. The comparison suggests that CryoGrid 3 can not only model the evolution of the ground thermal regime in the last decade, but also consistently <b>reproduce</b> the <b>chain</b> of energy transfer processes from the atmosphere to the ground. In addition, we demonstrate a simple 1 -D parameterization for thaw processes in permafrost areas rich in ground ice, which can phe-nomenologically reproduce both formation of thermokarst ponds and subsidence of the ground following thawing of ice-rich subsurface layers. Long-term simulation from 1901 to 2100 driven by reanalysis data and climate model output demonstrate that the hydrological regime can both accelerate and delay permafrost thawing. If meltwater from thawed ice-rich layers can drain, the ground subsides, as well as the formation of a talik, are delayed. If the meltwa-ter pools at the surface, a pond is formed that enhances heat transfer in the ground and leads to the formation of a talik.

In some cases, however, the oval is either so expanded or contracted that the latitudinal coverage of the AE magnetometer chain is not adequate. Then, a longitudinal chain in the key region would give more information of the real situation, but, of course, only during some limited UT-period. In order {{to find out the}} UT coverage of a single meridional chain, we have compared the global AL and AU indices with corresponding local indices determined using data from the meridional part of the EISCAT Magnetometer Cross during the years 1985 ? 1987. A statistical study shows that the local indices are close (within relative error of 0. 2) to the global AU and AL during periods 1500 ? 2000 UT (~ 1730 ? 2230 MLT) and 2130 ? 0130 UT (~ 0000 ? 0400 MLT), respectively. In the middle of these optimal MLT-sectors the EISCAT Cross sees more than 70 % of the cases when the global AE chain records activity.

40|$|Inflammatory and immune {{responses}} play {{a fundamental}} role in both health and disease, and leukocytes are important actors in these processes. Migration of the leukocytes to sites of injury or inflammation {{is a crucial}} component of innate and adaptive immunity. It is currently accepted that leukocyte extravasation is a multistep process. However, a later step in this cascade, namely the interaction of leukocytes with components of extracellular matrices (ECM), such as the vascular endothelial basement membrane (BM) and the interstitium ECM, is poorly understood. There is also limited information concerning the role of vascular BM proteins in hemostasis and/or thrombosis. In this thesis, the interaction of blood platelets, lymphocytes and monocytes with vascular BM components, particularly the endothelial laminin isoforms, has been studied. Laminins (Lms), major components of all BMs, are a family of heterotrimeric molecules, each composed of á-, â-, and ã-chains. To date, five á-, three â-, and three ã-chains have been identified that associate to form at least 15 Lm isoforms. Lms regulate various cellular functions, such as adhesion, motility, differentiation and proliferation through various integrin and nonintegrin receptors. Lm- 411 (á 4 â 1 ã 1, laminin- 8) and Lm- 511 (á 5 â 1 ã 1, laminin- 10) are major Lm isoforms of vascular endothelial BMs. These BM components may participate in leukocyte extravasation and, following vascular injury, contribute to hemostasis and/or thrombosis when exposed to circulating platelets. First, commercially available placenta laminin preparations, often used in functional studies, were characterized. These preparations differed from one another and consisted of highly fragmented proteins, a mixture of laminin isoforms, and/or contaminating fibronectin. They also exhibited major functional differences between batches. In a following study, megakaryocytic cells were found to synthesize and platelets to secrete heterotrimeric á 5 -Lms. Lm- 511 strongly promoted platelet adhesion, but not activation, via á 6 â 1 integrin. Thereafter, the pivotal role of á 5 -Lm(s), expressed by high endothelial venules, in promoting adhesion and migration of blood lymphocytes via á 6 â 1 integrin was demonstrated. Lm- 511 was also able to co-stimulate T cell proliferation, and stimulated blood lymphocytes secreted both á 4 - and á 5 -laminins. The lymph node cell number in Lmá 4 -deficient mice compared to wild type did not differ significantly. Finally, Lm- 411 and Lm- 511 were found to mediate adhesion and chemokine-induced migration of monocytes via áMâ 2 and áXâ 2 integrins.

The entire set of NMR spectra is simultaneously fitted with six distinct environments {{taking into account}} the effect of first and second neighbors on the position of the 77 Se resonance. The selenium chains are bound at each end to trivalent arsenic atoms, and the chain length distribution can be modeled with the Flory theory, which is well-known in polymer science and is used {{here for the first time}} to model the probability of finding each selenium environment in a selenide glass. No arsenic homopolar bond is detected in our experiments. ■ INTRODUCTION Chalcogenide glasses exhibit a wide range of physical properties such as infrared transparency, high refractive indices, and reversible amorphous-to-crystal transitions and can be easily shaped into optical devices. 1 − 6 Among them, the arsenic selenide glasses As x Se 1 −x are considered to be a promising family because glassy As 2 Se 3 is a good candidate for all-optical switching 7 or for use as a mid-infrared laser source; 8 in addition, arsenic selenide glasses can be used for optic fibers. 9 Recent studies also investigated the possibility of preparing these glasses using microwave heating. 10 Numerous attempts were made to draw a link between the changes in the physical properties of arsenic selenide and the evolution of its molecular structure as the arsenic content varies, both at room temperature 11, 12 and when the temperature is increased, 13 during aging of the glass, 14 or when irradiated with a laser. 15 To gain some insight into the arsenic selenide glass structures, recent studies relied on molecular dynamics 16 − 18 combined with anomalous X-ray scattering 19 or 77 Se solid-state NMR 20 − 23 to characterize the environments and connectivity of selenium and arsenic atoms. Many of these studies hint toward the existence of a small amount of As−As homopolar bond 12, 16 with tetravalent arsenic atoms linked to two arsenic and two selenium atoms. 19 Moreover, 77 Se NMR spectroscopy can quantify three distinct selenium environments (selenium atoms linked to two, one, or zero arsenic atoms) and shows that there is some disorder in the distribution of the lengths of the selenium chains that link arsenic atoms together, as opposed to what is inferred in the chain-crossing model (i. e., when the selenium chains are of similar lengths). 20, 23 Interestingly, it was suggested that the Flory model, 24 which describes the distribution of chain lengths in organic polymers, could be applied to inorganic polymers (mostly silicates) because the underlying chemical phenomena share striking similarities, especially for glasses with covalent bonds and no ionic species. 25 − 27 The Flory theory provides a very simple model for the probability, P(n), of finding a chain of length n, which is equal to np n− 1 (1 − p) 2, where p is the probability to form a linkage between two monomers and the average chain length is given by 1 + p/ 1 − p. Moreover, Flory distributions are characterized by a single parameter p and not two as is the case for Gaussian distributions (which may not correctly <b>reproduce</b> the <b>chain</b> length distributions for arsenic-rich glasses with short chain lengths) or three for skewed Gaussian distributions. Therefore, the Flory framework was applied here as a model for the distribution of chain lengths. 77 Se is a spin 1 / 2 nucleus with a 7. 63 % natural abundance, a gyromagnetic ratio equal to 19 % of γ(1 H), and a fairly large chemical shift range over 3000 ppm. 28, 29 However, as many diluted spin- 1 / 2, it usually features long longitudinal relaxation times around hundreds of seconds, which may affect the measured proportions of each selenium environment. 23 Usually, three selenium environments are distinguished depending upon the nature of the two atoms (arsenic or selenium) they are connected with. 20 However, as the 77 Se atoms are excessively sensitive to their environments, it is often observed that the chemical shifts of these broad lines vary with the composition of the sample, 20 precluding any simultaneous fitting of series of NMR spectra. Such an effect results from a dependence of th...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development and validation of a methodology for estimating the consequences of accidental dust explosions in complex geometries. The approach adopted entails the use of results from standardized tests in 20 -litre explosion vessels as input to the combustion model in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, and the subsequent validation of the model system by comparing with results from laboratory and large-scale experiments. The PhD project includes dedicated laboratory experiments designed to explore selected aspects of flame propagation in dust clouds, and to reveal {{similarities and differences between}} flame propagation in gaseous mixtures and mechanical suspensions of combustible powder in air. The research project represents a continuation of numerous efforts by various research groups, where the key underlying problem has been the scaling of results obtained in laboratory tests for predicting the consequences of dust explosion scenarios in industry. The traditional approach to the scaling problem entails the use of empirical correlations, typically represented as nomographs or formulas in relevant safety standards. It is generally accepted that empirical correlations may work reasonably well for simple geometries, such as isolated process vessels and silos. The need for more sophisticated methods arises for accident scenarios that involve complex geometrical boundary conditions, such as flame propagation in connected vessel systems and secondary dust explosions inside buildings. The European Commission (EC) supported the Dust Explosion Simulation Code (DESC) project under the Fifth Framework Programme. The goal was to develop and validate a CFD code for simulating industrial dust explosions in complex geometries. To this end, GexCon created the CFD code DESC (Dust Explosion Simulation Code) by modifying the existing CFD code FLACS (FLame ACceleration Simulator), originally developed for simulating gas explosions in congested offshore geometries. The specific contributions from the candidate with respect {{to the development of the}} CFD software is limited to the methodology for estimating combustion parameters for a given dust sample from experimental results, the validation of the resulting model system against experimental data, and general participation in the R&D team during the development process. The modelling of particle-laden flow and heterogeneous combustion in the CFD code DESC involves several simplifying assumptions. The flow model assumes thermal and kinetic equilibrium between the dispersed particles and the continuous phase, and the k-ε turbulence model in FLACS remains unchanged for multiphase flows. The empirical correlation for the turbulent burning velocity in dust clouds originates from experiments with premixed combustion in gaseous mixtures. The fraction of dust that takes part in the combustion reactions, as function of the nominal dust concentration, is estimated from the explosion pressures measured in a constant volume explosion vessel. The thermodynamic data available in FLACS limit the application area to materials containing the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. The simplifications limit the application area of DESC to certain classes of materials, and flame propagation in dust clouds with relatively high reactivity. DESC do not contain models for simulating phenomena such as agglomeration, gravitational settling, and selective separation of particles in flow through cyclones or along other curved paths. In spite of the simplicity of the model system, the results from the validation work show that the CFD code DESC can describe the course of dust explosions in relatively complex geometries with reasonable accuracy relative to the inherent spread in the experimental results. The results obtained for silo explosions reproduce trends observed for variation in vent area and ignition position from various experiments. Results obtained for flame propagation sustained by dust dispersion from a layer indicate that the empirical model for dust lifting in DESC is suitable for the purpose. Results obtained for dust explosions vented through ducts reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Simulations of dust explosions in a system of two vented vessels connected by a pipe with a 90 ° bend indicate that the DESC can <b>reproduce</b> relatively complex <b>chains</b> of events, including dust lifting from a layer. The results for the connected vessel system also demonstrate how sensitive the results can be with respect to modest changes in the initial and boundary conditions. Finally, simulations of explosion experiments in elongated vessels with repeated obstacles reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Although the results from the validation work indicate that CFD simulations can become a valuable tool for consequence modelling and design of industrial facilities, the modelling in DESC requires further improvements. An essential improvement entails fundamental changes to the numerical solver to reduce in the influence of the grid resolution on the results from the simulations. In the current versions of FLACS and DESC, simulation of explosion scenarios is subject to strict grid guidelines. The current versions of both codes use a structured Cartesian grid, with limited possibilities for local grid refinement. This poses a particular challenge for DESC, since the grid resolution required to resolve complex internal geometries on a structured Cartesian grid varies significantly from case to case. The long-term solution to these challenges will presumably entail the use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and this is outside the scope of the present work. The model system may also benefit from various other improvements, such as turbulent burning velocity correlations specifically developed for dust explosions, an explicit model for turbulent flame thickness, radiation models, local grid refinement in the region where ignition occurs, reduced dependence on empirical input to the model system, and in general more realistic modelling of particleladen flow and heterogeneous combustion. There is, however, a fine balance between the level of detailed information that must be specified in the model, and the applicability and user-friendliness of the model system. For most industrial applications of a CFD tool for dust explosions, there are significant inherent uncertainties associated with initial and boundary conditions. Dust explosion experiments in transparent balloons show that the initial phase of flame propagation in turbulent dust clouds can progress in a distributed manner, with very limited energy output. This observation may explain some of the challenges associated with the analysis of pressure-time histories from 20 -litre explosion vessels for dust explosions when using a weak ignition source. Experiments in a 3. 6 -m flame acceleration tube demonstrate the importance of explosion-generated turbulence for dust explosions, and illustrate the challenge associated with poor repeatability in dust explosion experiments. The results obtained for propane-air mixtures in the same apparatus indicate that FLACS under-predicts the rate of combustion for turbulent flame propagation in fuel-rich propane-air mixtures. The CFD code DESC represents a significant step forward for process safety related to dust explosions in the process industry. There is, however, significant room for further improvements to the model system, and dedicated experiments will play an important role for the future development of the code. Improved safety in the process industry requires reliable and well-documented consequence models, and future development of DESC should include an integrated framework for model validation, including verification and testing. </p...|$|R
