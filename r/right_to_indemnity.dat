50|$|Trust {{creditors}} (that is, {{persons who}} have become creditors of the trustee qua trustee) may be entitled to be subrogated to the trustee's lien. This is a particularly precarious 'right' of trust creditors: a trustee {{may not have a}} right of indemnity (for example, because the trustee has committed a breach of trust in incurring the liability to the creditor in question) or it may be limited (for example, where the trustee has committed an unrelated breach of trust and the clear accounts rule operates). In some jurisdictions it is possible for the trustee's <b>right</b> of <b>indemnity</b> <b>to</b> be excluded altogether. In these cases, subrogation may be rendered worthless or impossible.|$|R
40|$|The {{revocation}} of {{an agent}} frequently {{raises the question}} of the legal basis for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>indemnity</b> by agent so revoked. The existence of such a right as well as the determination of the amount of the indemnity depend {{on the nature of the}} relationship between the agent and his client. In the case of an independent agent, this relationship is of a special nature. His function differs from that of a servant and that of an independent trader, who are both currently called agents. The indépendant agent deals with third parties for a client, but does not himself supply the goods and services in which he trades. The indépendant agent, to whom is recognized the status of commercial intermediary, has a function which is characterized by his own obligational contents. He brings to the execution of his work the duties of a professional. He is subject to an obligation of diligence and, because of his professional status, incurs a certain liability towards the third party he deals with. The qualification of mandate, often given to his contract, cannot take into account the extensive obligations imposed on the agent, particularly the fact that he makes a profession of his agency and that he has a special interest in the success of the affair he négociâtes. The reference to rules of a civil nature in matters that relate to business creates some confusion. The nature of the relationship between the agent and his client is challenged by the notion of common interest which grants to the agent a right to keep up the contract and maintain goodwill. The proposition of the Civil Code Revision Office for the revision of the legal categories has the advantage of giving new definitions to contracts which are characterized by the autonomy of the obligee in the execution. In the case of the independent agent, it will favour a qualification more adequate of the relationship between him and his client. The revocation of the agent would then be treated like the revocation in other contracts in which work is done in the interest of the other party...|$|E
50|$|If {{the witness}} is warned under section 204 of the CPA, the {{privilege}} falls away: The witness is then given the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> earn an <b>indemnity</b> {{in exchange for}} taking away the privilege against self-incrimination. For example, if while housebreaking one sees a murder occurring, one may be indemnified against incriminating oneself in providing evidence of the murder. This {{is a question of}} State strategy: The murder is obviously the more serious offence. Once the procedure in section 204 has been correctly followed, the witness loses the privilege, but gains indemnity against any future prosecution on that charge. This can be controversial: Glenn Agliotti was famously called as a witness against Jackie Selebi in terms of section 204, and admitted to having paid a bribe. It could be argued that in such circumstances the bigger crook is allowed to get away with it.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} late reports of accidents at work in an agricultural environment and attempts {{to answer the question}} whether a delay in reporting such an agricultural accident has any influence on the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> claim single <b>indemnity</b> for an accident at work. The first part of the paper determines the conditions that must be satisfied in order for the accident to be considered as reported without delay. Further in the paper, legal consequences of a late report of an accident at work, and the possible limitation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> claim compensation are presented. Farmers are often late to notify the insurer about an accident, despite the requirement that such an agricultural accident at work should be reported not later that 6 months following its occurrence. However, there are no legal sanctions if this date is not met. Therefore in practice, a late report does not result in any direct legal consequences, and a late claim is rejected on grounds o f unnecessary delay only if late reporting has impaired the possibility of ascertaining the actual circumstances of the accident. As can be deduced from the statistics of reported agricultural accidents, the current regulations in Poland, although introduced to discipline potential claimants, seem unsatisfactory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract When a ship {{is fixed}} on a voyage charter or time charter, the {{charterer}} may use tonnage {{which has been}} chartered to him to transport goods owned by third-party cargo owners. This thesis will discuss this situation: the charterer entered into the contract of carriage of goods by sea with sender, {{but it is the}} ship-owner who actually performs the carriage of goods as actual carrier. If the cargo is damaged or lost, whether the ship-owner shall be liable to the third party? If it is the case, on what legal basis third-party cargo owners can claim against ship-owners? What is the nature of ship-owner s liability to the third party? How does such ship-owner s liability system apply to business practice? All these questions will be analyzed in this paper. Firstly, I will present the legal relationship between parties involved in the carriage where the charterer uses the chartered vessel to carry third party cargo owner goods. It is known that the ship-owner has no contractual obligations to cargo owners, as the ship-owner is not the contracting party to the head contract of carriage of goods by sea. However Section 286 of NMC imposes statutory liability on ship-owners and Section 285 and 287 of NMC cause ship-owner and charterer jointly and severally liable to third-party cargo claimants. Such mandatory liability system aims to strengthen the economic position of cargo interests, but ship-owners and charterers are still free to insert clauses to allocate risks between them as long as such the clauses do not derogate from mandatory provisions. This paper will discuss two common clauses regarding ship-owner s liability, that is, demise clause and incorporation clause. I will analyze whether these clauses are caught by obligatory provisions and if they are not, how those clauses apply in practical business. Finally I will discuss indemnification claims between ship-owner and charterer. When the ship-owner is found liable under a bill of lading, and if such claim under the charter party would have allowed him to avoid of at least limit liability, the ship-owner has <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> seek <b>indemnity</b> from charterer according to Section 338 of NMC. However Section 338 does not provide cargo claimants with an absolute <b>right</b> <b>to</b> redress and certain requirements must be satisfied, that is, the greater obligations assumed by the ship-owner must result from different terms contained in the bill of lading and there must be contractual basis for indemnity in the charter party. All these issues mentioned above will be discussed mainly under Norwegian maritime law, but some comparison will be made between Norwegian maritime law and Chinese maritime law. Besides that, I will also take relevant international conventions into consideration including the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules...|$|R
