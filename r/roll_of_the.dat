Eldred's merit badges were noted in the Honor <b>Roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> August 1912 edition of Boys' Life.|$|E

5|$|In July 1906, Ernest Thompson Seton sent Baden-Powell {{a copy of}} his 1902 book The Birchbark <b>Roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Woodcraft Indians. Seton, a British-born Canadian-American {{living in}} the United States, met Baden-Powell in October 1906, and they shared ideas about youth {{training}} programs. In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called Boy Patrols. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds (from boy's schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole, Parkstone, Hamworthy, Bournemouth, and Winton Boys' Brigade units) and held a week-long camp in August on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset, England. His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training, allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader.|$|E
