40|$|Abstract Background In Japan, as {{the number}} of elderly covered by the Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) system has increased, demand for {{long-term}} care services has increased substantially and consequently growing expenditures are threatening the sustainability of the system. Understanding the predictive factors associated with long-term care expenditures among the elderly would be useful in developing future strategies to ensure the sustainability of the system. We report a set of predictors of the highest long-term care expenditures in a cohort of elderly persons who received consecutive long-term care services during a year in a Japanese city. Methods Data were obtained from databases of the LTC insurer of City A in Japan. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the predictors of the highest long-term care expenditures. We used a simplified model that focused on the effects of disability status and type of services used, while controlling for several relevant factors. Goodness of fit, a multicollinearity test, and logistic regression diagnostics were carried out for the final model. Results The study cohort consisted of 862 current users of LTCI system in city A. After controlling for gender and income, age, increased utilization <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> decline in functional status, higher care needs level and institutional care were found {{to be associated with the}} highest LTCI expenditures. An increased utilization <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> (OR = 24. 2) was a strong main effect predictors of the high LTC expenditures. However, a significant interaction between institutional care and high care need level was found, providing evidence of the combined effect of the two covariates. Conclusions Beyond to confirm that disability status of elderly persons is the main factor driving the demand of LTC services and consequently the expenditures, we showed that changes in utilization <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> -a specific insurance factor- and the use of institutional care conditional on the high care level, were strongest predictors of the highest LTC expenditures. These findings could become crucial for tracking policies aimed at ensuring financial sustainability of LTCI from a public insurer perspective in Japan. </p...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{strategic}} risk {{has become}} an issue of paramount importance to corporations. One way to reduce such risk is through international operations. However, published research reports conflicting findings {{on the relationship between}} international operations and risk reduction. In addition, the literature leaves one avenue largely unexplored, namely, industry influence. Using a sample of 367 firms, this study tests for the relationship between internationalization and risk across global and multi-domestic industries. Study findings indicate a negative relationship between risk and internationalization, indicating that firms are benefited by reduced risk through internationalization. Additionally, regression models indicate the incremental <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> due to internationalization is greater in the case of global industries, compared to multi-domestic industries.

30|$|As in the Netherlands, a {{key reason}} for the rapid growth in the Swedish {{disability}} program over the 1970 s (see Table  1) was the relatively generous benefits that the system provided. That generosity was apparent both in the ease of entry onto {{the program and the}} replacement <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> The first level of protection for Swedish workers with health problems is a sickness benefit. In the 1970 s, sickness benefits replaced about 90 percent of expected earnings for individuals with “abnormal physical or mental conditions” that reduced their normal work capacity by at least 25 percent. Workers claiming sickness absence for more than eight days were required to get a certificate from a doctor. This was primarily facilitated by the individual’s doctor with no centralized screening or standards.|$|E

30|$|The second Coalition {{flagship}} {{change to}} the activation regime–Universal Credit (UC)–is even more radical in ambition. It aims to unify all means-tested benefits (with {{the exception of the}} Council Tax Benefit) into a single working-age benefit with a generous earnings disregard and a single withdrawal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> against work income. Support for childcare via the benefit system will be made available for parents regardless of the number of hours they work–under the old system, they had to work at least 16 hours per week to qualify for support. The aim of UC is to improve work incentives for most families compared with the current system. It is hoped that by getting more of such families into work that this will reduce poverty and cut back on public spending on welfare benefits. UC began to be implemented slowly in 2013 and it is planned to be fully operational by 2018.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{analytical}} model incorporating {{benefits of a}} stock, costs of adjusting the stock, and uncertainty in costs, we uncover several important principles governing the choice of pricebased policies (e. g., taxes) relative to quantity-based policies (e. g., tradable permits) for controlling stock externalities. Applied {{to the problem of}} greenhouse gases and climate change, we find that a price-based instrument generates several times the expected net benefits of a quantity instrument. As in Weitzman (1974), the relative slopes of the marginal benefits and costs of controlling the externality continue to be critical determinants of the efficiency of prices relative to quantities, with flatter marginal benefits and steeper marginal costs favoring prices. But some important adjustments for dynamic effects are necessary, including correlation of cost shocks across time, discounting, stock decay, and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> growth.

We assign lifetime wages randomly from the observed wage distribution in the formal labor market of Indonesia (taken from the Indonesian Labor Market Survey, Sakernas).

In past decades, institutional theorists have long argued that institutions are powerful forces that greatly influence organizational behaviors and outcomes (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983).

Nonetheless, significant uncertainties {{are associated with}} decision-making for this IT investment context, regarding future market conditions, technology standards, and consumer and merchant responses, especially their willingness to adopt. As a result, traditional capital budgeting approach and experienced intuition have not been effective. We develop a model to support a bank’s mobile payment systems adoption decision-making at the firm level when it faces endogenous technological risks and exogenous market conditions. This study applies theory and modeling from financial economics for decision-making under uncertainty to investments in m-payment systems technology. We assess the projected benefits and costs of investment as a continuous-time stochastic process to determine the optimal investment timing. We find that: (1) the value of waiting to adopt jumps when the related business environment experiences relevant shocks; (2) when the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> flows, the time horizon for decision-making and the time value of money change, the recommended investment timing and optimal investment will change too; and (3) when value jumps occur at different stages and in different directions, the optimal timing and maximal payoffs may exhibit unexpected changes. We illustrate how to use simulation-based financial option valuation approach to value the investment. We further discuss the application of our approach for systems that are subject to network effects, rational expectations and strategic interactions among different banks...|$|E

The main conclusions of the analysis are that: (a) the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is already overwhelmed by the volume of returning veterans and the seriousness of their health care needs, {{and it will not}} be able to provide a high quality of care in a timely fashion to the large wave of returning war veterans without greater funding and increased capacity in areas such as psychiatric care; (b) the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is in need of structural reforms in order to deal with the high volume of pending claims; the current claims process is unable to handle even the current volume and completely inadequate to cope with the high demand of returning war veterans; and (c) the budgetary costs of providing disability compensation benefits and medical care to the veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan over the course of their lives will be from $ 350 - $ 700 Billion, depending on the length of deployment of US soldiers, the speed with which they claim disability benefits and the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and health care inflation.

Such a plan {{is expected to}} pay more stable and predictable benefits over time than one based on the money purchase principle. The properties of the plan are investigated through simulation. Methods for distributing surpluses and eliminating deficiencies that involve adjusting the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> accrual (rather than varying the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> contribution) are discussed. The behavior of the plan under a scenario of persistently unfavorable investment experience is Simulated, and methods for satisfactorily dealing with such a scenario are considered. The plan actuary is expected {{to play an important}} role in maintaining an appropriate balance between solvency and stability...|$|R
40|$|Major {{changes were}} made to {{disability}} benefits in 1992. Disability Living Allowance (DLA) was introduced, making new lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> available to people with less severe care and mobility needs. Attendance Allowance (AA) remained for people who became disabled in later life, but substantial changes were being made to the claim process. This report presents the findings of research {{carried out by the}} Social Policy Research Unit at York University to evaluate the changes. The research asks whether the new lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> DLA are extending help to less severely disabled people, and evaluates the quality of service provided to people who claim the benefits, ask for a review of the claim, or appeal against the decision...|$|R
40|$|Administrative data on means-tested {{benefits}} {{have come to}} be widely used as proxy measures <b>of</b> local poverty <b>rates</b> in the UK. Two such uses are described: allocating funding to local government, and constructing neighbourhood deprivation indices. The paper argues that such uses risk errors of both measurement and interpretation. Income poverty is conventionally defined against percentages of national median income. The paper shows that out-of-work means-tested benefit claims are valid, but incomplete, proxies for income poverty so conceived. Further, there is considerable regional variation in the statistical relationship between <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> income poverty and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> claims. Benefits data should be used only with caution to describe spatial differences in poverty...|$|R
