50|$|A chirped {{mirror is}} made to <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> wider range of frequencies. This is done by {{creating}} layers with different depths. There may be 10 layers with a depth designed to <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> certain wavelength of light, another 10 layers with slightly greater depth to <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> slightly longer wavelength of light, and so on for {{the entire range of}} wavelengths of light the mirror is designed to reflect. The result is a mirror that can <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> whole range of light wavelengths rather than single narrow band of wavelengths.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|Coins of Ezana {{without any}} symbol at all {{have also been}} found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas. These may reflect a {{transition}} in the religion in Aksum when Frumentius was influencing Ezana's father and gathering Christians in the country, giving weight to the writings of Rufinus. The lack of symbol altogether may <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in religion of the Aksumite state.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji, {{who claimed}} to be of Spanish–Italian–Sicilian ancestry, {{composed}} various pieces that <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> enthusiasm for those cultures, such as Fantasia ispanica, Rosario d'arabeschi and Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach. These are works of a Mediterranean character and are inspired by Busoni's Elegy No. 2, All'Italia, and the Spanish music of Isaac Albéniz, Debussy, Enrique Granados and Liszt. They are considered among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works.|$|E

5|$|Yet both <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> inseparable {{integrity}} and regard for accuracy and truth, {{expressed in terms}} both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day.

5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> ideological point-of-view.|$|E
5|$|In two {{panels of}} the famous Bayeux tapestry, {{standards}} are shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror; {{as one of the}} combatants at the Battle of Hastings, Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman cavalry charge against an English shield-wall, a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson's brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in Anglo-Saxon England) or whether they <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army.|$|E

5|$|Around 1550 the {{mounting}} conflict {{seems to have}} reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader's marriage to a local woman. Historical texts tie the lineage of the family's leader, Zafikazimambobe, to Anteony noble Ramarohala, who had settled there at least three generations before. Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual, and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles. Rather, these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means, and also <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> awareness among the Antemoro {{of the importance of}} local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them. Upon rising to power, the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ombiasy (wise men) who practiced astrology and served as scribes; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed. These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct sombily (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom. They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island.|$|E
5|$|The first {{standard}} strips {{began to emerge}} in the 1870s, with many clubs opting for colours associated with the schools or other sporting organisations from which the clubs had emerged. Blackburn Rovers, for example, adopted shirts of a halved design based on those of the team for former pupils of Malvern College, one of the schools where the sport had developed. Their original colours of light blue and white were chosen to <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> association with Cambridge University, where a number of the club's founders had been educated. Colours and designs often changed dramatically between matches, with Bolton Wanderers turning out in both pink shirts and white shirts with red spots within the same year. Rather than the modern shorts, players wore long knickerbockers or full-length trousers, often with a belt or even braces. Lord Kinnaird, an early star of the game, was noted for always being resplendent in long white trousers. There were no numbers printed on shirts to identify individual players, and the programme for an 1875 match between Queen's Park and Wanderers in Glasgow identifies the players by the colours of their caps or stockings. The first shin pads were worn in 1874 by the Nottingham Forest player Sam Weller Widdowson, who cut down a pair of cricket pads and wore them outside his stockings. Initially the concept was ridiculed but it soon caught on with other players. By {{the turn of the century}} pads had become smaller and were being worn inside the stockings.|$|E
