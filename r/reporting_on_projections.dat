The model captures the effects of variations in surface solar radiation, using information over the period 1959 – 2002 available from observational records from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), as well as increases in greenhouse gases on surface temperature. The model performs well with respect to observational data, and is simple enough to admit a rigorous statistical analysis. This allows us to quantify the uncertainty associated with estimated parameter values using observational data only. Our method immediately leads to estimates with associated confidence intervals, which can be translated into confidence intervals for climate projections. In particular, we construct probabilistic climate projections using standard scenarios for carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions...|$|R

For the years 2001 – 2007 we {{estimate}} fertility rates, survival probabilities, internal migration probabilities and international migration flows for 16 {{ethnic groups and}} 355 UK areas. We make assumptions about future component rates, probabilities and flows and feed these into our projection model. This model is a cohort-component model specified for single years of age to 100 +. To handle this large state space, we employed a bi-regional model. We implement four projections: (1) a benchmark projection that uses the component inputs for 2001; (2) a trend projection where assumptions beyond 2007 are adjusted {{to those in the}} UK 2008 -based National Population Projections (NPP); (3) a projection that modifies the NPP assumptions and (4) a projection that uses a different emigration assumption. The projected UK population ranges between a low of 63 millions in 2051 under the first projection to a high of 79 million in the third projection. Under all projections ethnic composition continues to change: the White British, White Irish and Black Caribbean groups experience the slowest growth and lose population share; the Other White and Mixed groups to experience relative increases in share; South Asian groups grow strongly as do the Chinese and Other Ethnic groups. The ethnic minority share of the population increases from 13 % (2001) to 25 % in the trend projection but to only 20 % under our modified emigration projection.

40|$|We <b>report</b> <b>on</b> new <b>projection</b> engine {{which was}} {{developed}} in order to implement a distributed guideline-based decision support system (DSS) within the European project MobiGuide. In this model, small portions of the guideline knowledge are projected, i. e.

Furthermore, the projection engine generates guideline projections which are adapted to the patient’s previously defined preferences and, implicitly, to the patient’s current context, which is embodied in the projected knowledge. We evaluated this distributed guideline application model for two complex guidelines: one for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, and one for Atrial Fibrillation. We found that the initial specification of what we {{refer to as the}} customized guideline should be in the terms of the distributed DSS, i. e., include two levels: one for the central DSS, and one for the local DSS. In addition, we found significant differences between the customized, distributed versions of the two guidelines, indicating further research directions and possibly additional ways to analyze and characterize guidelines...|$|R

A high-resolution, pan-Baltic {{application of the}} Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE) model was used to make transient simulations {{of discharge}} to the Baltic Sea for a mini-ensemble of climate projections representing two high emissions scenarios. The biases in precipitation and temperature adherent to climate models were adjusted using a Distribution Based Scaling (DBS) approach. As well as the climate projection uncertainty, this study considers uncertainties in the bias-correction and hydrological modelling. While {{the results indicate that}} the cumulative discharge to the Baltic Sea for 2071 to 2100, as compared to 1971 to 2000, is likely to increase, the uncertainties quantified from the hydrological model and the bias-correction method show that even with a state-of-the-art methodology, the combined uncertainties from the climate model, bias-correction and impact model make it difficult to draw conclusions about the magnitude of change. It is therefore urged that as well as climate model and scenario uncertainty, the uncertainties in the bias-correction methodology and the impact model are also taken into account when conducting climate change impact studies...|$|R

This paper {{presents the results of}} the research. It <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> <b>projections</b> to 2026 of demand for social services for older people and associated expenditure in England. The approach taken by the Wanless Review team is described in detail in their report, Securing Good Care for Older People: Taking a long-term view (Wanless 2006) and can be characterised as ‘normative’; <b>projections</b> are based <b>on</b> various assumptions about how, {{in the view of the}} Wanless Review team, services should be allocated to achieve stated outcomes. This represents a departure from the ‘positive’ approach taken by the PSSRU long-term care team, where <b>projections</b> are based <b>on</b> analyses of how services are currently allocated. A separate version of the PSSRU long-term care finance model has been developed to produce the analysis commissioned by the Wanless Review team. The structure and basis of the Wanless Review version of the model, however, draws on existing work carried out by the PSSRU long-term care team and established links with the CARESIM model at the University of Essex. It should be emphasised that the estimates provided by this report are not forecasts about the future; they are <b>projections</b> <b>on</b> the basis of specific assumptions about future trends. This is of particular importance to the Wanless Review version of the model as it assumes a completely different pattern of services, based on explicitly stated outcomes that, in the view of the Wanless Review team, should be delivered by social services. We can never know with any degree of certainty how people will react to changes in a system, especially one as complex as social services; we can only extrapolate how they might behave according to past behaviour. The paper has five sections. A description of the models used to produce the projections in this report is given in section two. Section three discusses the main projections. Three different scenarios are presented that model the two possible future service models commended by the Wanless Review team and a further scenario reflecting existing patterns of care. In section four we explore the sensitivity of these projections to changes in key assumptions. Section five concludes the paper with a brief discussion. This paper is one of two major research papers commissioned by The Wanless Social Care Review to help in the estimate of future trends and costs.

40|$|Current {{understanding}} {{posits that}} the different senses interact on multiple stages of processing. We investigated this notion {{using a combination of}} high-resolution fMRI and electrophysiological recordings in non-human primates. In particular we study how acoustic stimulation affects neural responses in low-level (areas V 1 and V 2) and higher-tier visual areas (area TE). In primary visual cortex we find that the presentation of sounds reduces the fMRI-BOLD signal to values below pre-stimulus baseline, but enhances evoked response to visual stimuli above the level attained by pure visual stimulation. This finding is well consistent with previous results in humans, and suggests a modulatory and gain changing mechanism of acoustic stimuli on visual cortex. Noteworthy, the acoustic influence was stronger in peripheral visual representations, in good concordance with prior <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> anatomical <b>projections</b> from auditory areas to peripheral representations in occipital cortex. Similarly, we find that acoustic stimuli modulate neural responses in visual temporal association cortex (area TE). Recordings of neural activity in alert animals demonstrate a modulatory influence on neural responses, but only minimal responses to acoustic stimulation alone. Using computational tools to characterize this acoustic influence we find that the presence of sounds enhances the trial to trial reliability of neural responses and increases the ability to correctly decode which of a set of visual scenes was presented. This result hence suggests that sounds increase the encoded visual information...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for thermal {{characterization}} of heterogeneous materials has been proposed. As for homogeneous {{materials in the}} first part of the paper, the method is based on the use of Karhunen-Loève decomposition (KLD) techniques in association with infrared thermography experiments or any other experimental device providing dense data in the spatial coordinate. Orthogonal properties of KLD eigenfunctions and states are used for achieving simple estimates of thermal diffusivities. It has been proven that diffusivities can be estimated without explicit knowledge of variables and parameters related to heat exchanges at the interfaces (i. e. thermal conductivities, thermal contact resistances). Indeed, the diffusivities estimates only depend on some few KLD eigenelements. As a result, a significant amplification of the signal/noise ratios is reached. Moreover, it is shown that spatially uncorrelated noise has no effect on KLD eigenfunctions, the noise being entirely <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> states (time-dependent <b>projection</b> coefficients). This is particularly interesting because thermal diffusivities estimates involve spatial derivatives of the eigenfunctions. Consequently, the proposed method results in an attractive combination of parsimony and robustness to noise. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through some simulated experimental applications. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 85 - 89). According to the 2000 / 2001 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS), HIV/AIDS prevalence is 16 % and {{is expected}} to be higher in the next five years. The disease is quite pervasive across all sectors of economic activity, but the impact is especially acute on the Zambian health sector, which is faced with increasing demands on healthcare for not only HIV/AIDS but other diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, diarrhoea, to mention but a few. It is therefore essential that expenditure on HIV-related care among different health care systems be analysed so as to determine areas of relatively greater need. It is against this background that this study entitled, "An analysis of expenditure on HIVIAIDS patients in Zambia", was conducted. The main objective of the study is to analyse expenditure on HIV-related care and treatment among the different health care systems and geographical localities in Zambia. The study used utilisation data on total and HIV-related outpatient visits and inpatient days collected from the country's facility based database called the Health Management Information System (HMIS); and HIV-prevalence data compiled from the Central Statistics Office's <b>report</b> <b>on</b> Epidemiological <b>Projections.</b> Expenditure data <b>on</b> the other hand was compiled from the National Health Accounts (NHA) report for 1999 - 2002 and separate data on HIV/AIDS expenditure was collected from the District Health Boards reports for 2003. Utilisation and HIV-prevalence data were then combined with expenditure data to estimate the overall utilisation of services by HIV-positive patients and the annual expenditure required to meet the burden of HIV/AIDS. Both utilisation and expenditure statistics were analysed and compared according to different levels of healthcare and geographical localities. Data analysis was exploratory and descriptive...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{reliable}} thermal characterization of orthotropic, homogeneous materials is proposed. It {{is based on}} the use of Karhunen-Loève Decomposition (KLD) techniques in association with infrared thermography experiments or any other kind of experimental device providing dense data in the spatial coordinate. Main problem addressed in this paper is how to deal efficiently with large amount of rather noised experimental data. It is proven that orthogonal properties of KLD eigenfunctions and states allow achieving simple estimates of thermal diffusivities which depend only on the first and the second KLD eigenelements. This means that the 2 D KLD approximation of the temperature field provides information enough for estimation purposes. As a result, a significant amplification of the signal/noise ratios is reached. Moreover, we prove that spatially uncorrelated noise has no effect on KLD eigenfunctions, the noise being entirely <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> states (time-dependent <b>projection</b> coefficients). This is particularly interesting because thermal diffusivities estimation involves spatial derivatives of the eigenfunctions calculation. Consequently, the proposed method results in an attractive combination of parsimony and robustness to noise. Indeed, because it does not require analytical solutions of the associated heat conduction problem, the method could be extended to application involving heterogeneous materials. The second part of the paper deals with this extension. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
