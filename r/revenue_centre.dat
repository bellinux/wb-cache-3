50|$|A <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> has costs, however to {{the manager}} of a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> this is of little {{importance}} as revenue is his sole performance indicator. Not all costs are ignored in a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre.</b> For example, {{the manager of a}} <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> is responsible for the expenses of his department (such as maintenance costs). In a sales office (the most widespread example of a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre),</b> maintenance costs can be construed as rent, salaries, taxes and security. However, any costs related to product sale and manufacturing are not included in such expenses. A <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> becomes a profit centre if the latter is encompassed, thus making a profit centre a blend of both a cost and <b>revenue</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} in a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> is that costs are mostly ignored. If costs are not monitored by another division of the business, profits can be hindered. Furthermore, the manager of a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> does not have the insight required for marketing decisions, consequently responsibility for a marketing decision cannot be given to a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> manager. Setting prices on products or services is an example of <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> managers being unable to undertake marketing decisions.|$|E
5000|$|In business, a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> or revenue {{center is}} a {{division}} that gains revenue from product sales or service provided. [...] The manager in <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> is accountable for revenue only.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} some examples of <b>revenue</b> <b>centres.</b>|$|R
50|$|Technological advancements {{have been}} able to reduce {{expenses}} in <b>revenue</b> <b>centres</b> as well as bring non-traditional (online) <b>revenue</b> <b>centres</b> to non-retail companies that work in manufacturing or service industries. This can be done by setting up websites which offer products directly from the supplier. This reduces cost by shortening the distribution channel and cuts out wholesalers and retailers.|$|R
50|$|Businesses {{may decide}} to open <b>revenue</b> <b>centres</b> when {{entering}} new markets or industries. The initial cost of these centres is high and it is highly likely {{that a lot of}} time is required in order for those centres to become profitable and cover the start-up expenditures.|$|R
50|$|A <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> {{is one of}} {{the five}} {{divisions}} of a responsibility centre - Cost centre, <b>Revenue</b> <b>centre,</b> profit centre, contribution centre and investment centre. Cost centres, like revenue centres, only monitor costs, thereby making them a counterpart to the <b>revenue</b> <b>centre.</b> Revenue centres only measure the output (in fiscal standings) and are therefore marketing establishments which are exempt from profit generation and accountability thereof. In a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> performance is measured by comparing actual sales to projected ones (as well as number of sales or revenue per time scale). Quota and budget comparisons are also used as a performance indicator.|$|E
50|$|<b>Revenue</b> <b>centre</b> {{managers}} {{should not}} be allowed to make marketing decisions. For example, if a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> manager is allowed to set the revenue target, he will maximise revenue. This will cause the marginal revenue to become zero.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> {{the manager}} usually has control over issues {{regarding}} marketing and sales. This is delegated {{to him because}} both of the spheres require extensive knowledge that is explicit to the local market. However, the <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> manager will not be given control over decision on quantity or product mix. If the manager is given control over these decisions problems can arise (see below).|$|E
50|$|In large {{companies}} with multiple products <b>revenue</b> <b>centres</b> {{will be responsible}} for meeting revenue target for each product. The problem will arise if all revenues are added together into a total of all products. The revenue manager will then be able to make up any losses in revenue by taking the revenue from the ones that outperformed the targets to the ones that underperformed, thereby causing a loss in overall profits.|$|R

50|$|Pure revenue centres hardly exist. This {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that costs cannot be {{completely}} ignored. Usually (as stated above) <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> managers control expenses.|$|E
50|$|It {{is easy to}} {{calculate}} {{the performance of a}} <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> as revenue is the only variable being performed against. However, this means that performance evaluations are also limited to one variable which is usually not enough to see the performance of a business division.|$|E

40|$|An initial {{examination}} of the New Zealand domestic meat market showed that the bacon industry was {{most in need of}} help from the development of new products. Per capita consumption of bacon and ham, products which provided almost 70 % of the bacon industry's revenue, were shown to be declining. The aim of the project was to design new cured meat products which would replace bacon as the major <b>revenue</b> <b>centre</b> for the industry. A market survey and two consumer surveys were carried out in Palmerston North with the aim of determining the reasons for the apparent decline in bacon and ham consumption. The three surveys were extended to include beef, sheep meat and pork cuts as well as ham, bacon and smallgoods so that the most consumer-acceptable cuts could be identified. The market survey showed that the industry was in fact selling their bacon and ham through the most important retail outlets and while poor advertising and packaging might have been partly responsible for the decline in per capita consumption of bacon and ham, they {{did not appear to be}} the major cause. The first consumer survey was carried out to see whether any changes in socio-economic factors such as household size, gross income of the household head or age of the housewife were responsible for the decline in consumption of bacon and ham. Trends evidenced in the New Zealand society since 1966, rather than contributing to the apparent decline in consumption of these products, were in actual fact favouring the consumption of these two meats. The second consumer survey evaluated the attitudes of thirty Palmerston North housewives towards bacon and ham as well as a number of other meats. This survey identified the reasons for the apparent decline in consumption of bacon and ham. Bacon, in particular, was seen to have intermediate properties, intermediate between fresh meat and smallgoods. The data from this second survey was examined by way of Principal component factor analysis and the following variables were isolated as being common to all meats: preference, nutrition, flavour, prestige and length of cooking. An analysis of main meal and snack meats identified additional variables which were unique to each meat group and still other variables were isolated for individual meat cuts. Together, these were hypothesised to be the blueprints for the individual products which enabled consumers to identify each meat product from a whole host of other meat products. The consumer-acceptable meats were examined and the attributes responsible for the success of these products were identified and new cured products were designed, and these attributes were built into them...|$|E

50|$|Dunstall {{historically}} had a mainly charity based <b>revenue,</b> <b>centred</b> on the church: The common lands {{were controlled}} by church wardens in the 1860s who annually sold the grazing's produced and reinvested {{the money into}} various community projects, shown in 1907 where Dunstall's income was registered as charity based with allotments being granted to young apprentice's for £5-£10, and these became so popular that rent on these allotments steadily rose from £30 in 1907 to £45 by 1970 to over £350 in the 1990s.Historical records show that Dunstall was predominately an agricultural area with 32 males and 2 females being employed in agriculture, the largest amount of people employed in any occupation in 1881.The pie charts show the employment structures of {{both male and female}} residents in 1881. It is reported that out of the occupations that are known for women, the largest sector was in domestic service or office, reflecting the role and place for women at the time.In the 2001 census, Dunstall was reported to have 111 economically active residents with 75 of those people being employed in services and 39 being employed in manufacturing and extractive industries. This therefore shows that people are now employed in more service based industries rather than the primary sector, reflecting the development of the United Kingdom and the move away from primary industries.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{productivity}} {{development of}} Finnish health centres in 1988 - 95 by applying different specifications of Malmquist index. As input variables we use operating costs {{or the number}} of personnel by employee category, and as output variables different kinds of visits, bed days and discharges. Measuring input use by operating costs gives more positive estimates of productivity change than those obtained by measuring inputs by the number of personnel. This suggests that productivity growth can partly be explained by changes towards a more efficient input mix in health centres. The choice of the base year had only a small effect on productivity change estimates. The results show that the productivity decline of health centres which was quite substantial all through the 1970 s and 1980 s reversed to a rise from 1990 onwards. The turn in productivity development occurred {{at the same time as}} the state and municipalities experienced severe financial difficulties due to recession and falling tax <b>revenues.</b> Health <b>centres,</b> productivity, Malmquist index...|$|R

30|$|To meet {{workload}} demands, IPs can use Elasticity [16] {{to reconfigure}} resources in an autonomic manner. The {{limitation of this}} view is that it assumes the IP’s objective is to satisfy precisely all workload demands. While this may be true, it {{may not always be}} the case, as the IP has finite resources and may apply differentiation on requests. Additionally, the IP may decide it is more cost effective to pay a penalty for an SLA violation instead of scheduling the request. The current view on Elasticity abstracts several complex activities. We refine this view by separating the decision making process from how the cloud environment is reconfigured, by defining elasticity as the on demand ability, to scale vertically or horizontally segmented resources in discrete units. To achieve a specific business goal, IPs go through a decision making process that changes the infrastructure, a process we name Cloud Systems Adaptation. We define this as a change to provider <b>revenue,</b> data <b>centre</b> power consumption, capacity or end-user experience where decision making resulted in a reconfiguration of compute, network or storage resources. Reconfiguration is the process of increasing or reducing resource allocation to a workload, through elasticity.|$|R
