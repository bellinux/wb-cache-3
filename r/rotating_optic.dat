The apparatus was powered by a weight slowly descending from the lantern room, which drove a clockwork mechanism turning the table at a set rotation. It was lit using lamps powered by paraffin, which was stored in a copper tank with ornate brass fittings.|$|E

The light station is a three-story white building protected by a Faraday cage to defend from the lightning strikes; above the keeper's house stands the tower 24 m high, which was rebuilt in 1950s, bringing the focal height to 186 m making it the highest lighthouse in Italy. The lantern was supplied by various fuels, including acetylene up to 1880, and then by petroleum gas, until in 1961 the plant was electrified. The <b>rotating</b> <b>optic</b> which {{was built in}} Paris by Barbier, Benard, et Turenne in 1951, is equipped with a Fresnel lens, with four deflectors at 90° to each other with a focal distance of 375 millimetres.

It is operated by Marina Militare identified by the code number 1418 E.F.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the sense of orientation. Vestibular, podokinetic and visual systems can all contribute to our sense of orientation in space. However, each provides the brain with different qualitative information in different reference frames. The aim of this work was to determine how these different sensory systems are fused to create a coherent internal representation of self-motion relative to the external environment and how this is used to guide locomotion. Vestibular stimulation with galvanic currents (GVS), podokinetic stimulation on a rotating platform, visual stimulation in a rotating visual scene all can evoke signals of rotation about the subject&# 146;s vertical axis. Healthy adult subjects were presented with a rotating stimulus of one or more afferent channels and perceptual, postural or locomotor responses during and following stimulation were recorded. GVS allowed systematic study of vestibular signals in isolation. Chapter 2 demonstrated these signals are interpreted within the CNS as head acceleration and revealed the peripheral and central vestibular adaption processes. Chapter 3 investigated the podokinetic after-rotation trajectory following a range of conditioning parameters and developed a model of podokinetic adaption incorporating vestibular feedback. Chapter 4 measured blinded locomotor responses during GVS which showed evidence of a podokinetic adaptation which summated with the vestibular response. Chapter 5 showed that a rotating vestibular signal {{in the presence of a}} stationary visual signal is rapidly recalibrated to the visual signal. Blinded after-rotation in the direction of the prior vestibular conditioning stimulus suggests the signal also undergoes adaptation according to vestibular processes. <b>Rotating</b> <b>optic</b> flow in Chapter 6 evoked illusions of self-motion but the dominance of vision on the sense of orientation diminished as the speed of optic flow increased. After-rotation trajectories revealed that the perception of self-motion which can be influenced by optic flow or the belief framework is the reference to which currently active sensory channels are calibrated. Chapter 7 investigates the locomotor responses following multisensory stimulation in conflicting and corresponding directions and demonstrated interactive influences of multiple inputs on the perception of self-motion. A conceptual model which incorporates the recalibration, adaptation and reweighting processes uncovered in the experimental chapters is presented in Chapter 8...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical features of peripapillary microvasculature in myopic eyes and investigate {{the association between}} the superficial and deep peripapillary microvascular density and the myopic optic disc characteristics. This cross-sectional study included {{one hundred and fifty}} healthy myopic eyes with β-peripapillary atrophy (β-PPA). Ovality index, degree of optic disc rotation, and the area of β-PPA were measured. Superficial and deep peripapillary microvascular density was measured using optical coherence tomography angiography. Logistic regression analysis was performed to look for the factors associated with peripapillary microvascular reduction. The mean superficial peripapillary microvascular density was 62. 14 ± 5. 47 %; 33 (22. 0 %) participants were found to have decreased microvascular density. Increased axial length (p < 0. 001) and decreased average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (p = 0. 027) were associated with the superficial peripapillary microvascular reduction. The mean deep peripapillary microvascular density was 73. 76 ± 4. 02 %; 26 (17. 33 %) participants were found to have decreased microvascular density. Larger ovality index (p = 0. 028) and more inferiorly <b>rotated</b> <b>optic</b> disc (p = 0. 021) were associated with the deep peripapillary microvascular reduction.

40|$|BACKGROUND Disenclavation is {{a common}} {{complication}} of prepupillary iris-claw intraocular lenses (IOL). We present a new minimally invasive revision surgery technique for reenclavation of prepupillary iris-claw IOLs using standard 23 Gauge (G) vitrectomy instruments. HISTORY AND SIGNS Three cases of revision surgery by unilaterally dislocated prepupillary iris-claw IOLs are presented. THERAPY AND OUTCOME Two 20 G sideports 90 degrees apart were constructed. Healon 10 ® was injected to maintain the anterior chamber. A standard enclavation needle was introduced to <b>rotate</b> the <b>optic</b> into correct position and a 23 G endgrasping forceps was used to grasp and stabilize the IOL for enclavation. The reenclavation was successful in all three cases and the mean visual acuity improved from preoperatively 0. 1 (range counting fingers [CF] to 0. 25) to 0. 6 (range 0. 4 to 0. 8) with no significant induction of astigmatism.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} method {{has been developed}} to determine the velocity profiles across the boundary layer of rotary wings. The measurement, based on laser Doppler velocimetry, has been tested on a helicopter rotor blade in hover. The main components of the prototype are embedded in an untwisted blade. The beams converging at the measurement volume, which can be moved along perpendicular to the surface, and the signals backscattered by flow particles, are collected through <b>rotating</b> fiber <b>optic</b> cables to a transmitter insuring the connection with fixed components (laser source, photomultipliers, burst spectrum analyzer, computer, etc.). Measurements, performed in a frame linked to the rotating blade for one radial distance from the rotation axis and at a chord abscissa x/c = 0. 25, have involved the tangential velocity component (chordwise) and the crossflow component (spanwise). The boundary layer has been explored at different rotating speeds of the blade. The accuracy of velocity components measurements has been evaluated in the region {{very close to the}} wall and far from the wall. The velocity profiles obtained in different hovering test conditions have shown the efficiency of the present embedded laser Doppler velocimeter method, which can also be applied to rotors in forward flight, wind turbines, etc. Undoubtly, the new database obtained on the rotating boundary layer will constitute an essential support for the physical models and computational works.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how light force, {{irrespective of the}} polarization of the light, {{can be used to}} run a simple nanorotor. While the gradient force of a single beam optical trap is used to hold an asymmetric nanorod, we utilize the scattering force to generate a torque on the nanorod, making it <b>rotate</b> about the <b>optic</b> axis. The inherent textural irregularities or morphological asymmetries of the nanorods give rise to the torque under the radiation pressure. Even a small surface irregularity with non-zero chirality is sufficient to produce enough torque for moderate rotational speed. Different sized rotors can be used to set the speed of rotation over a wide range with fine tuning possible through the variation of the laser power. We present a simple dimensional analysis to qualitatively explain the observed trend of the rotational motion of the nanorods.

40|$|To {{obtain a}} model for {{potential}} plasticity in the visual system of the chick we <b>rotated</b> one <b>optic</b> vesicle in embryos. The functionality of axonal connections was tested after hatching by examination of pecking behaviour, reflexes and the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). The animal exhibited normal reflexes with both eyes, showing the functionality of the manipulated eye. The animal showed to a monocular optokinetic stimulus – a normal OKN – a direction asymmetry in response to different stimulus velocities – a dependence in response to stimulus velocity – an increase in gain with decreasing stimulation velocity. In pecking behaviour the animal optimised the pecking precision in the first 5 days by maturation of the target mechanism and by learning. Plasticity on molecular level was examined by showing the expression pattern of positional marker in the tectum opticum (TO) by complementary connecting proteins. The expression of ephrin A 2 /A 5 was quantified in normal animals an those {{with one or two}} excised eye vesicles.

40|$|Abstract- Gyroscopes are {{state of}} art device to measure angular {{rotation}} {{of a system}} about some specific axes with respect to inertial frame of reference. Earlier they were mostly used for navigation purposes, however, the application area of the gyroscopes have increased over the years. Now adays, automobile control system, human body motion monitoring system and amusement equipments tend to use a gyro sensor. Although traditional <b>rotating</b> wheel, fiber <b>optic</b> and ring laser gyroscopes have dominated the market, but they are too huge and expensive. Moreover, they {{do not meet the}} sensitivity requirement of modern industry making them inadequate for emerging applications. This led to the advent of vibratory structure which has got several advantages over conventional counterpart like low power requirements, short start up time and very low inherent noise. This paper proposes a Coriolis based Piezoelectric Vibrating Disc Gyroscope. The detailed working principle, construction as well as the physical structure of the proposed vibrating disc gyro has been discussed throughout the length of the paper. Validation of the developed gyroscope has been carried out by providing input rotation via a stepper motor assembly causing the transfer of energy from drive mode to the sense mode and this transfer of energy provides a measure of the applied rotation rate...|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma is {{a disease}} which affects the eye and causes blindness. It is an {{ophthalmologist}} disease characterized {{by an increase in}} Intraocular Pressure (IOP). The glaucoma usually affects the optic disc on the retina which increases the cup size. There are various parameters to identify and diagnose glaucoma. The clustering technique is introduced to detect the glaucoma from the optic disc and cup in the retinal fundus images. Fuzzy C Means (FCM) Clustering is used for clustering the data in which the data points are clustered with different membership degree. But it does not fully utilize the spatial information in the image. The Modified Spatial Fuzzy C-Means clustering with spatial rotation has been proposed to detect glaucoma in retinal fundus images. The first and foremost step is preprocessing operation, in which the optic cup and disk of the input image is being <b>rotated.</b> Initially the <b>optic</b> disk is <b>rotated</b> in some angle and the distance between the data points are measured and a cluster is formed based on the centroid. The centroid and data point along with the cluster can be identified in each step then the common set of points is clustered together. This process continues until no more centroid is found. The cluster with more data points that do not match with the original image is considered as the retinal image with glaucoma disease. In future, this algorithm can be extended to larger clinical databases in order to identify the glaucoma at the maximum level...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{physics in}} soft matter systems, {{physical}} properties of bio-inspired {{systems and the}} mechanical manipulations of nano-systems have been studied using optical tweezers to {{form the basis of}} this doctoral Thesis. The ﬁrst two chapters are on a general introduction about optical tweezers and detailed description of the setup used along with its calibrations. The next three chapters describe studies of statistical properties in soft matter systems, namely, out-of-equilibrium microrheology in a worm-like micellar system, irreversibility to reversibility crossover in the non-equilibrium trajectories of an optically trapped particle with the veriﬁcation of ﬂuctuation theorems even for non-ergodic descriptions of the system and high velocity Brownian vortexes at the liquid-air interface. The mechanical manipulation of the nano-systems, i. e. optically driven nano-rotors and the trapping, as well as transportation of palladium decorated single wall carbon nanotubes using optical tweezers have been discussed in the next two chapters. In the next chapter, the study of physical property of a bio-inspired system -the cell membrane deformability of human erythrocytes with increasing calcium ion concentration has been described. This Thesis is an endeavor to understand diﬀerent mesoscopic systems using optical trapping and manipulation. Chapter 1 gives an introduction on optical tweezers. The working principle of optical trapping and manipulation are discussed along with their applicability in diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics. Chapter 2 discusses the experimental setup in detail. The setup used for the experiments is a dual optical trap around an inverted microscope. The formation of the traps, the technique to steer the trapping beams and to place the traps at the desired positions in 3 D without aﬀecting the symmetry or stiﬀness are described. Instantaneous position tracking of the trapped particle is a very crucial part of optical trapping experiments. A tracking beam is used for this purpose and the trapped bead is imaged on a quadrant photo diode which provides the current signals that corresponds to the particle’s position in the focal plane. Then the calibration of the setup using various calibration methods are explained. Calibration of the setup includes the calibration of the position sensing devices, e. g. the quadrant photo diode and the CCD camera attached to the microscope, calibration of the electronic devices, e. g. the stage nano-positioner, nano-tilt mirror mount etc., and ﬁnally calibration of the trap stiﬀnesses (in both X and Y) at varying laser powers. Precautions taken during the experiments to minimize the artifacts are also mentioned. In Chapter 3, a nonlinear microrheology experiment to probe directional viscoelasticity of a sheared worm-like micellar system has been described. Many wormlike micellar systems exhibit appreciable shear thinning due to shear induced alignment. As the micelles get aligned, introducing directionality in the system, the viscoelastic properties no longer remain isotropic. An optical tweezers based technique enables us to probe the out-of-equilibrium rheological properties of CTAT (cetyltrimethylammonium tosylate, cationic surfactant) system simultaneously along two orthogonal directions -parallel to the applied shear, as well as perpendicular to it. A trapped bead is dragged through the medium (1 wt% CTAT) and the position ﬂuctuations of the bead, along the direction of motion (X) and perpendicular to it (Y), are recorded in both ‘drive on’ and ‘drive oﬀ’ states. While the displacement of the bead along X -in response to the active drag force -carry signature of conventional shear thinning, its spontaneous position ﬂuctuations along Y, following the ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem, provide the loss modulus (G∗∗ along Y) which manifests a dramatic orthogonal shear thickening, an eﬀect hitherto unobserved. Chapter 4 describes an irreversibility to reversibility crossover in the transient response of a particle in optical trap; and the veriﬁcation of the ﬂuctuation theorem for a non-ergodic description of this system. The transient position ﬂuctuations of a colloidal bead is studied as it approaches equilibrium after being released from varying heights (by using an additional very strong optical trap) in the potential energy landscape created by a weak optical trap. The time evolution of the system shows dramatic changes as the release point energy is decreased. Starting from a small-time-reversible to long-time-irreversible transition for a higher energy release, a time independent completely reversible state could be reached just by lowering the initial potential energy a bit. For an even lower energy release, the system shows an anomalous irreversibility. In this state, it progressively extracts useful work from the thermal ﬂuctuations and surprisingly goes to a higher energy phase point. Highlighting the competition between the micro-reversibility and the irreversible dissipative loss in determining the long-time system behavior, this study exhibits the prominent emergence of a completely reversible state even at long time, in between the two irreversible states of opposite kind. The Transient Fluctuation Theorem (TFT) and the Integrated Transient Fluctuation Theorem (ITFT) which are deﬁned to be valid only for ergodic systems, have been veriﬁed even for non-ergodic descriptions (separately for diﬀerent release points) of this system. Chapter 5 illustrates the study of high velocity Brownian vortex at the liquid-air interface. A general kind of Brownian vortexes are constituted by applying an external non-conservative force ﬁeld to a colloidal particle bound by a conservative optical trapping force at a liquid-air interface. As the liquid medium is translated at a constant velocity with the bead trapped at the interface, the drag force near the surface provide enough rotational component to bias the particle’s thermal ﬂuctuations in a circulatory motion. The frequency of that circular motion increases linearly with the stage velocity, while an increment in the trapping laser power shows the opposite eﬀect. The properties of these Brownian vortexes have been studied extensively to demonstrate how the thermal ﬂuctuations and the advection of the bead play their role in the vortex motions, with an inference that the angular velocity of the circulatory motions oﬀer a comparative measure of the interface ﬂuctuations. In Chapter 6 the optical manipulation of asymmetric nanorods that constitutes optically driven nanorotors are described. The light force, irrespective of its polarization, is used to run a simple nanorotor. While the gradient force of a single beam optical trap holds an asymmetric nanorod, the scattering force is utilized to generate a non-zero torque on the nanorod making it <b>rotate</b> about the <b>optic</b> axis. The inherent textural irregularities or morphological asymmetries of the nanorods give birth to chirality which is responsible for generation of the torque under the radiation pressure. A farther study on nanorotors that are more transparent to infra-red (trapping beam) conﬁrms that the scattering force is indeed the origin of the torque. A model is proposed to explain the rotational motion of the nanorods and estimate the speed of rotation. If the nanorods are not fairly transparent to the laser beam, even a small surface irregularity with non-zero chirality is suﬃcient to produce enough torque for moderate rotational speed. Diﬀerent sized rotors can be used to set the speed of rotation over a wide range, with ﬁne tuning possible through the variation of the laser power. Chapter 7 discuses optical trapping and transportation of palladium decorated single wall carbon nanotubes (Pd-SWNT). Individual carbon nanotubes being substantially smaller than the wavelength of light are not much responsive to optical manipulation. Decorating those single-walled carbon nanotubes with palladium particles changes that scenario dramatically, making the optical trapping and manipulation much easier. Palladium decorated nanotubes (Pd/SWNTs) have higher eﬀective dielectric constant and are trapped at much lower laser power level with greater ease. In addition to that, an asymmetric line trap makes it possible to transport the Pd decorated SWNTs to a desired distant location in the sample cell. In the asymmetric line trap the Pd/SWNTs are ﬁrst get attracted by the gradient force and then the scattering force push them away towards {{the other end of the}} line trap. In Chapter 8, how the rotational motion of crenated erythrocytes in an optical trap can be used to probe their membrane deformability is explained. When placed in a hypertonic buﬀer medium, discocytic human erythrocytes are subjected to crenation and take deformed shapes. The deformation of the cells brings in chirality and asymmetries in shape that make them rotate under the scattering force of a linearly polarized optical trap. A change in the deformability of the erythrocytes, due to any internal or environmental factor, is reﬂected in the rotational speed of the trapped crenated cells. Therefore the average rotational speed and the probability of rotation of the crenated erythrocytes in an optical trap can be considered as a direct signature of their membrane deformability. As an example, the relative increment in erythrocyte membrane rigidity with adsorption of Ca++ ions is examined quantitatively through this approach. The Thesis concludes with a summary of the main results and a brief discussion of the scope of future work in Chapter 9...|$|R
