5|$|The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has {{proposed}} to MDOT that I-475 should {{be connected to}} US23 {{in the southern part}} of Genesee County. The board approved a study to investigate the economic impact of such an extension. The study will also examine how such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a <b>rail</b> <b>terminal</b> being built at the former Buick City complex. Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but was indefinitely postponed in 2011.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} increased rail traffic, a new railroad terminal {{was constructed}} in 1875, {{but it was not}} large enough to consolidate all train service in one location. A replacement station, called Union Station, opened on September 1, 1894. Although Chicago had a greater volume of traffic at its own Union Station, more railroads met at St. Louis than any other city in the United States. Union Station's rail platform expanded in 1930 and operated as the passenger <b>rail</b> <b>terminal</b> for St. Louis into the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Continuing east, M-102 intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) {{south of}} the Southfield campus of Oakland Community College and the Northland Center Mall. As the highway {{approaches}} M-1 (Woodward Avenue), there are a pair of service drives that split from the main roadway in each direction to provide access through the interchange with M-1. The main lanes of M-102 pass under M-1 and its ramp connections before the service drives merge back in on the other side. This interchange is located adjacent to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, former site of the now-defunct Michigan State Fair, and Woodlawn Cemetery. East of the fairgrounds, the highway crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger traffic; the line is south of a <b>rail</b> <b>terminal</b> in Ferndale. Further east, M-102 meets I-75 before intersecting Dequindre Road. Dequindre is the boundary between Oakland and Macomb counties.|$|E

Sokolniki Park, in the 18th century {{the home of the}} tsar's falconers well outside Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban Savyolovsky <b>Rail</b> <b>Terminal</b> was built in 1902.

Electricity was in use on some branch lines of the NYNH for interurban streetcars via third rail or trolley wire. An accident in the Park Avenue Tunnel near Grand Central Station that killed 17 people on January 8, 1902 was blamed on smoke from steam locomotives; the resulting outcry led to a push for electric operation in Manhattan.|$|E
