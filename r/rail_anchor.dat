40|$|North American {{railroads and}} the United States Department of Transportation (US DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) require {{periodic}} inspection of railway infrastructure to ensure safe railway operation. The {{primary focus of}} this research is the inspection of North American Class I railroad mainline and sidings, as these generally experience the highest traffic densities. Tracks that are subjected to heavy-haul traffic necessitate frequent inspection and have more intensive maintenance requirements, leaving railroads with less time to accomplish these inspections. To improve the current (primarily manual) inspection process in an efficient and cost effective manner, machine vision technology can be developed and used as a robust alternative. The machine vision system consists of a video acquisition system for recording digital images, a mobile rail platform for allowing video capture in the field, and custom designed algorithms to identify defects and symptomatic conditions from these images. Results of previously developed inspection algorithms have shown good reliability in identifying cut spikes and <b>rail</b> <b>anchors</b> from field-acquired videos.

From these prioritized turnout components, those that are best suited for vision-based inspection are being further investigated.

40|$|The catastrophic {{derailment}} of a {{gantry crane}} is analysed in the paper. Under {{the action of}} a persistent and very strong wind, with gusts at about 110 km/h, the crane started moving and, after having travelled for about 60 m, derailed and collapsed. Fortunately, no injured operator resulted from the event. The crane was endowed with passive rail clamps, {{which had to be}} dimensioned with reference to a very strong, i. e. out-of-service, wind intensity, given in standards. The analysis of technical data of the crane and of the installed clamps brought to the conclusion that a trivial error was made in the determination of the out-of-service wind load, since no aerodynamic coefficient was taken into account in the evaluation of the wind thrust. Due to this, the clamps didn't respond to the current regulations and, actually, were not capable of keeping the crane standing for the strongest wind load, which may occur in the region of the plant installation. The analysis, based on crane geometry and wind recordings, shows that, actually, the clamps capacity was exceeded by the wind load at the moment of the accident. A plane analysis of the crane loading condition, based on a beam model, allowed to explain the way the crane collapsed, with the rotation about a vertical axis of one of the leg, and to estimate the loads exchanged between the crane bogies and the rail, that caused the rupture of several <b>rail</b> <b>anchoring</b> bolts.

40|$|Källsner and Girhammar have {{developed}} a new plastic design method for wood-frame shear walls at ultimate limit state. The method is capable of calculating the load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not necessarily anchored against uplift. In fully anchored shear walls, the leading stud needs to be anchored using some kind of hold-downs to resist uplift and the bottom rail needs to be fixed by anchor bolts to resist horizontal shear forces. In partially anchored shear walls, where hold-downs are not provided, the uplifting force is resisted by the sheathing-to-framing joints along the bottom rail. Hence, {{it is important that}} the bottom <b>rail</b> is <b>anchored</b> to the floor structure or foundation by anchor bolts and, therefore, able to transmit the forces to the structure below. Because of the eccentric load transfer, transverse bending is developed in the bottom rail and splitting of the bottom rail can occur. In order to use the plastic design method, a ductile behaviour of the sheathing-to-framing joints must be ensured. In this paper, results of tests on the splitting capacity of the bottom rail due to uplift in partially anchored shear walls are presented. Specimens with single-sided sheathing were tested, varying the size of washer, pith orientation of the bottom <b>rails</b> and <b>anchor</b> bolt position along the width of the bottom rail. The aim of the tests was to evaluate the influence of these parameters in order to avoid splitting failure of the bottom rail. Two types of brittle failure modes occurred during testing: (1) a crack opening from the bottom surface of the bottom rail and (2) a crack opening from the edge surface of the bottom rail along the line of sheathing-to-framing joints. These failure modes were mainly dependent on the washer size and the location of the anchor bolt. The results show that the distance between the edge of the washer and the loaded edge of the bottom rail has a decisive influence on the maximum load and the failure modes of the bottom rail.

The graphite mould is reusable many times, because the copper alloy is not as hot as the steel alloys used in rail welding. In signal bonding, the volume of molten copper is quite small, approximately [...] and the mould is lightly clamped {{to the side of}} the rail, also holding a signal wire in place. In rail welding, the weld charge can weigh up to 13 kg. The hardened sand mould is heavy and bulky, must be securely clamped in a very specific position and then subjected to intense heat for several minutes before firing the charge.When rail is welded into long strings, the longitudinal expansion and contraction of steel must be taken into account. British practice sometimes uses a sliding joint of some sort at the end of long runs of continuously welded rail, to allow some movement, although by using a heavy concrete sleeper and an extra amount of ballast at the sleeper ends, the track, which will be prestressed according to the ambient temperature at the time of its installation, will develop compressive stress in hot ambient temperature, or tensile stress in cold ambient temperature, its strong attachment to the heavy sleepers preventing buckling or other deformation. Current practice is to use welded rails throughout on high speed lines, and expansion joints are kept to a minimum, often only to protect junctions and crossings from excessive stress. American practice appears to be very similar, a straightforward physical restraint of the rail. The rail is prestressed, or considered [...] "stress neutral" [...] at some particular ambient temperature. This [...] "neutral" [...] temperature will vary according to local climate conditions, taking into account lowest winter and warmest summer temperatures.

This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not anchored against uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided by anchor bolts in the bottom rail and hold downs at the leading stud. Anchor bolts provide horizontal shear continuity between the bottom rail and the foundation. Hold downs are directly connecting the vertical leading stud to the foundation. Sometimes hold downs are not provided and only the bottom <b>rail</b> is <b>anchored</b> to the substrate. In this case the bottom row of nails transmits the vertical forces in the sheathing to the bottom rail (instead of the stud) where the anchor bolts will further transmit the forces into the foundation. In this report hold downs have been experimentally studied {{with respect to the}} strength and stiffness of the connection. Four different types of hold downs have been tested. The specimen was subjected to tension load applied to the stud. Four tests series are presented. Each series was divided into different sets according to the type of fastener used with the hold down device. The results show that the failure load is higher when hold downs with anchor bolts are used, up to ten times higher than the anchorage that uses only screws or nails. The failure mode vary with the type of hold down and the type of fasteners used. The tests showed three primary failure modes: failure of the stud when a bolt is used as the fastener between hold down device and stud, failure due to pull-out of the screws or nails from the rail and failure due to failure or pull-out of screws or nails from stud.

40|$|Källsner and Girhammar have {{developed}} plastic design methods for light-frame timber shear walls {{that can be}} used for determining the load-carrying capacity when the shear walls are partially anchored. For such walls, the leading stud is not fully anchored against uplift and tying down forces are developed in the sheathing-to-framing joints. Since the forces in the anchor bolts and the sheathing-to-framing joints do not act in the same vertical plane, the bottom rail will be subjected to cross-wise bending, leading to possible splitting along the bottom side of the rail. Another possible brittle failure mode is splitting along the edge of the bottom rail in line with the sheathing-to-framing fasteners. An experimental program has been conducted using different anchor bolt locations, washer sizes and pith orientations. A fracture mechanics approach for the two failure modes is used to evaluate the experimental results. The comparison shows a good agreement between the experimental and analytical results. The failure mode is largely dependent on the distance between the edge of the washer and the edge of the bottom rail. The size of the washer seems also to have some influence on the failure load. The fracture mechanics models seem to capture the essential behaviour of the splitting modes and to include the decisive parameters. These parameters can easily be adjusted to experimental results and be used in design equations for bottom <b>rails</b> in partially <b>anchored</b> shear walls.

If hold-downs are notprovided, the vertical uplifting forces are transferred to the substrate bythe fasteners of the sheathing-to-framing joints. Since the forces in theanchor bolts and the sheathing-to-framing joints do not act in the samevertical plane, the bottom rail will be subjected to bending in thecrosswise direction, and splitting of the bottom rail may occur. If thebottom rail splits {{the applicability of the}} plastic design method forpartially anchored shear walls is questionable. This doctoral thesisaddresses the problem of brittle failure of the bottom rail in partiallyanchored timber frame shear walls. The first part of the study comprised of two basic experimentalprograms, for single-sided and double-sided sheathed shear walls. Theaim was to evaluate the different failure modes and the correspondingsplitting capacity of the bottom rail. Two brittle failure modes wereobserved: (1) a crack opening from the bottom surface of the bottomrail; and (2) a crack opening from the side surface of the bottom railalong the line of the fasteners of the sheathing-to-framing joints. It wasfound that the distance between the washer edge and the loaded edgeof the bottom rail has a decisive influence on the type of failure modeand the maximum failure load of the bottom rail. Two theoretical models for the load-carrying capacity for each typeof failure mode based on a fracture mechanics approach are studied andvalidated. The two analytical closed-form solutions are in goodagreement with the test results. The fracture mechanics models seem tocapture the essential behaviour and to include the decisive parametersof the bottom rail. These parameters can easily be determined and thefracture mechanics models can be used in design equations for bottomrails in partially anchored shear walls. Also, an extended fracturemechanics model for the load-carrying capacity for each type of failuremode is presented and evaluated. The present study discusses the splitting behaviour of the bottom railand provides methods to determine the splitting capacity for two brittlefailure modes, splitting of the bottom surface (mode 1) and of the sidesurface of the rail (mode 2). By these means brittle failure of thebottom rail can be avoided and the full plastic load-carrying capacity ofthe sheathing-to-framing joints can be utilized.
