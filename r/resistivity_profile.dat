On the other hand, small dust particles stabilize MRI by capturing ionized gas particles needed for the coupling of the gas and magnetic fields. To provide an empirical basis for modeling the coevolution of dust and MRI, we perform three-dimensional, ohmic-resistive MHD simulations of a vertically stratified shearing box with an MRI-inactive "dead zone" of various sizes and with a net vertical magnetic flux of various strengths. We find that the vertical structure of turbulence is well characterized by the vertical magnetic flux and three critical heights derived from the linear analysis of MRI in a stratified disk. In particular, the turbulent structure depends on the <b>resistivity</b> <b>profile</b> only through the critical heights and is insensitive {{to the details of}} the <b>resistivity</b> <b>profile.</b> We discover scaling relations between the amplitudes of various turbulent quantities (velocity dispersion, density fluctuation, vertical diffusion coefficient, and outflow mass flux) and vertically integrated accretion stresses.

These empirical relations allow to predict the vertical turbulent structure of a protoplanetary disk for a given strength of the magnetic flux and a given <b>resistivity</b> <b>profile.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E
40|$|Failure {{of surface}} {{coatings}} on concrete slabs can occur {{if there is}} excess moisture in the slab. There {{is a need for}} reliable standard measurement procedures to determine whether a concrete slab is dry enough to have a surface coating applied. Accordingly the Building Research Association of New Zealand commissioned this project to develop a top-surface mounted resistive technique for measuring moisture profiles in concrete flooring slabs. Geophysical vertical electric sounding (VES) techniques have been adapted to determine <b>resistivity</b> <b>profiles</b> in concrete slabs through mathematical inversion of apparent resistivity readings made at the surface. Relative-humidity profiles may then be extracted when the relationship between relative-humidity and resistivity has been determined. The project has involved the development and testing of: •	'wet' electrodes (ie. wooden electrodes wetted with a conducting solution) which are able to reduce and stabilise the otherwise high, variable and non-reproducible electrode-concrete interface resistance, •	a VES instrument comprising an array of electrodes multiplexed to a computer controlled resistivity meter and operated through a graphical user interface and software able to 'invert' the apparent resistivity curves determined, •	embedded electrode systems for independent measurement of <b>resistivity</b> <b>profiles</b> for use in evaluating the VES instrument and technique and determining the relationship between relative humidity and resistivity. Resistivity ρ and relative-humidity ψ profiles have been measured using a range of concrete samples and the relationship between them, away from the dry surface region, {{has been found to be}} described by the equation ψ = -aln(ρ) + b where a and b are coefficients that are functions of depth and the age of the concrete. The ability of the VES instrument to determine <b>resistivity</b> <b>profiles</b> from non-reinforced slabs is demonstrated in this report. However reinforcing at shallow depths (30 mm below the surface) does not allow profile recovery and makes commercialisation of the instrument unlikely.

This paper presents a foundation relationship between P-wave / S-wave velocity and formation resistivity for improved fracture characterisation. Rock matrix and fluid volumetrics are combined with the basic correspondence between formation factor and porosities. Additional variables such as secondary porosity, tortuosity, cementation exponent, partitioning coefficient, crystallisation and mineralisation are also considered to account for variances between the fractured and conventional pore-matrix media. The seismic-resistivity relationship, being novel in fracture heterogeneity, is verified by data from a naturally fractured gas reservoir.

Analysis on zones of relatively lower correlation suggests that additional variables (lithology and temperature changes) need to be accounted for. <b>Resistivity</b> <b>profile</b> can be obtained at inter-well regions from electromagnetic surveys, thus, allows higher definition of the rock matrix/fracture system and pore/fracture fluids.
