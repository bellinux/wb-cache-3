40|$|Abstract 1 — The non-fragmentable {{nature of}} Ethernet data frames, {{as well as}} {{operation}} of the priority oriented packet schedulers in the Optical Network Units (ONUs) along with heavy network load conditions {{and the lack of}} detailed knowledge about the queues composition at the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) level, result in the creation of upstream channel slot remainders. Non-preemptive packet schedulers and multithreshold reporting processes defined vaguely by the IEEE 802. 3 – 2005 standard result in either increased packet delay or EPON system incompatibility, respectively, since threshold processing was never officially defined in the scope of the referred EPON standard. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, based on basic modifications of the standard and extended GATE MultiPoint Control Protocol (MPCP) Data Unit (DU) formats and meaning, allowing for the OLT packet scheduling agent to grant always exactly the <b>requested</b> <b>slot</b> size, thus preventing the creation of any upstream channel slot remainders. It is estimated that roughly 3 % of the upstream bandwidth can be salvaged when slot remainders are absent in the upstream channel transmission. I...|$|E
40|$|Airport {{coordination}} is key in airport scheduling {{activities at}} congested airports. In this strategic capacity management process {{the allocation of}} slots – precisely timed operation permits – is required for every take-off and every landing. At this scheduling stage excess demand may occur {{if the number of}} slot requests exceeds the number of available slots. Conflict resolution includes both rescheduling and rejecting slot requests. Consequently, airport access cannot be realized as planned by some airlines. This dissertation’s objective is the development of a standardized approach to evaluate the scheduling and slot allocation process. This evaluation is based on the feasibility for demanding airlines to access airport infrastructure as requested. Therefore the term “scheduled delay” – defined as difference between requested and allocated slot times – is introduced as performance indicator. Scheduled delays allow assessing airport coordination results quantitatively and transparently with regard to airport access and can account for an airport’s scheduling performance. Because this approach is unique in air transportation sciences until now, the possible usage of scheduled delays has been discussed accordingly. In Section 1 of this thesis the feasibility to access airport infrastructure due to slot allocation decisions is introduced as a relevant performance aspect in airport coordination. Airport access is required by airlines to offer transport services. Operational restrictions as well as passenger habits determine the required access times. Slots will not be allocated as requested, if conflict resolution due to excess demand requires rescheduling or rejection of some slots at least. This scheduling performance aspect impacts on both airline and passenger habits. Section 2 focuses on the airport coordination process itself. With airport coordination data being available for German coordinated airports (schedule periods Summer 2005 and Winter 2005 / 2006), a detailed process analysis is based on the developments at those airports. The results of this analysis allow abstracting the airport coordination process in Section 3. Slot demand (input parameter and system load), conflict resolution (service process) and allocated slots (output parameter and system throughput) are classified as relevant parameters and dependencies of airport coordination. Scheduled delay is defined as scheduling performance indicator. It measures the temporal deviation between <b>requested</b> <b>slot</b> time and allocated slot time as resulting from conflict resolution. A delay analysis shows significant differences at German coordinated airports with regard to scheduling performance. The empirical results confirm the assumption that when slot utilization (slot demand vs. slot capacity) increases, the average scheduled delays per allocated slot will rise. Since the available airport coordination data does not allow a precise and complete reproduction of this interdependency, a deterministic model approach is defined to predict scheduled delays depending on the level of slot utilization. The conflict resolution as focal part of the airport coordination is modeled. Section 4 finally discusses the possible implementation of scheduled delays in airport planning and management. Now a systematic airport performance measurement framework can be established including both airport scheduling and day-to-day operations. The performance indicator‘s contribution to addressing airport capacity and design issues is focal in its possible usage. An airport’s capability and sufficiency to cope with the given demand can be indicated reliably...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an operational simulation tool to evaluate different rail operational policies aimed at increasing service reliability in large-scale multi-carrier rail networks. Operational policies that improve shipment connection reliability at shunting yards, such as priority-based classification, train holding and train cancellation policies can be evaluated using the tool. To support operational decisions needed to implement priority-based classification, an optimization based framework is proposed. Operational policies to improve train schedule reliability, such as including slack time in timetables to handle minor delays, and rescheduling strategies to manage large delays {{can also be}} evaluated using the tool. For minor delays, an analytical method for deterministic analysis of propagation of delays in train traffic networks is proposed and demonstrated on the Washington DC Metrorail Network. Rescheduling strategies required to manage large delays in multi-carrier rail networks are also discussed herein. A dynamic <b>slot</b> <b>request</b> mechanism is proposed, wherein each carrier <b>requests</b> <b>slots</b> for N blocks ahead, to model rescheduling requests of multiple carriers competing for the slots.

40|$|Optimizing {{the sales}} of {{advertising}} slots sold by TV or internet companies amounts to collecting as much revenue as possible from a finite inventory under uncertain demand. This situation yields interesting operations research issues. We will present three optimization problems from this field, encountered in the TF 1 Group. For TV channels, the considered inventory is the schedule of commercials breaks in the programs of each week. The price (in € per second) for the airing of commercials during these slots is based on rating forecasts for each marketing target. A typical <b>request</b> for broadcasting <b>slots</b> consists of a budget, a time period, {{and a set of}} dispatching rules: preferred shows, approximate percentage of the budget during prime-time hours, etc. Manually selecting a set of available slots satisfying such a request is a long and difficult task. We will present a Mixed Integer Programming approach based on a goal programming model, producing near-optimal solutions in one minute for a scheduling period covering 1000 commercial breaks (see [1] for a study of the problem where the number of slots to be selected is fixed). The sale process is different for national general interest channels with large market shares. Higher airtime costs lead to <b>slot</b> by <b>slot</b> <b>requests.</b> That is to say that all companies present their lists of <b>requested</b> <b>slots</b> two months before broadcasting.

We explore, via an extensive simulation study, {{the performance of the}} protocol when integrating voice and data traffic over two wireless channels, one of medium capacity (referring mostly to outdoor microcellular environments) and one of high capacity (referring to an indoor microcellular environment).

We evaluate the voice packet dropping probability and access delay, as well as the data packet access and data message transmission delays for various voice and data load conditions.

40|$|The ATLAS {{workload}} {{management system}} is a pilot system based on a late binding philosophy that avoided {{for many years to}} pass fine grained job requirements to the batch system. In particular for memory most of the requirements were set to request 4 GB vmem as defined in the EGI portal VO card, i. e. 2 GB RAM + 2 GB swap.

40|$|The IEEE 802. 16 is {{a leading}} {{technology}} for Broadband Wireless Access (BWA), where a Base Station (BS) provides a set of Subscriber Stations (SSs) with first-mile network access. Each SS has multiple connections directed to the BS, which are assigned bandwidth on a demand basis. Specifically, the BS allocates part of the channel as <b>request</b> <b>slots,</b> which are accessed by best-effort connections in a random access manner to transmit bandwidth requests. Although bandwidth requests sent by different SSs may collide the standard does not specify an explicit acknowledgment mechanism. This, and the bandwidth being assigned by the BS to each SS as a whole, may lead to critical inconsistencies between {{the perception of the}} SSs’ requirements at the BS and the actual SSs’ requirements, which in turn may entail SS service disruption. While the standard suggests that an SS should regularly update the BS about the backlog of its connections, the algorithm to do so is left unspecified. In this paper we propose a simple, yet effective, mechanism to be employed by the SSs, called Bandwidth Request Reiteration (BR 2), which prevents deadlock from occurring. Using detailed packet-level simulation, we compare BR 2 to an alternative approach based on timeout, and show that BR 2 achieves better performance, in terms of the average transfer delay, while it does not incur a significant additional overhead, in terms of MAC signalin...|$|R

40|$|The scarcest {{resource}} {{for most of}} the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is energy and one of the major factors in energy consumption for WSNs is due to communication. Not only transmission but also reception is the source of energy consumption. The lore to decrease energy consumption is to turn off radio circuit when it is not needed. This is why TDMA has advantages over contention based methods. Time slot assignment algorithm {{is an essential part of}} TDMA based systems. Although centralized time slot assignment protocols are preferred in many WSNs, centralized approach is not scalable. In this paper, a new energy efficient and delay sensitive distributed time slot assignment algorithm (DTSM) is proposed for sensor networks under convergecast traffic pattern. DTSM which is developed as part of the military monitory (MILMON) system introduced in [27], aims to operate with low delay and low energy. Instead of collision based periods, it assigns slots by the help of tiny <b>request</b> <b>slots.</b> While traditional slot assignment algorithms do not allow assigning the same slot within two hop neighbors, because of the hidden node problem, DTSM can assign, if assignment is suitable for convergecast traffic. Simulation results have shown that delay and energy consumption performance of DTSM is superior to FPRP, DRAND, and TRAMA which are the most known distributed slot assignment protocols for WSNs or ad hoc networks. Although DTSM has somewhat long execution time, its scalability characteristic may provide application specific time durations...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} slot allocation mechanism, {{based on}} the International Air Transport Association (IATA) system and its complementary version of the European Union (EU) regulation, produces rather poor capacity allocation outcomes for congested EU airports since it fails to properly match <b>slots</b> <b>requested</b> with <b>slots</b> allocated to airlines. Inefficiencies during the initial allocation are mainly due to the problem complexity in conjunction to limited decision support available to slot coordinators. On the other hand, substantial inefficiencies give rise to severe slot misuse and unreasonably low utilisation of airport resources running already into scarcity. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an optimisation-based model implementing the existing EU/IATA rules, operational constraints, and coordination procedures with the ultimate objective to better accommodate airlines’ preferences at coordinated airports through the minimisation of the difference between the requested and the allocated slot times to airlines. The results of the model are assessed and compared vis-à-vis the allocation outcome produced according to current slot coordination practice in three regional Greek airports. The proposed model produces very promising results and demonstrates that there is large room for improvement of the efficiency of the current allocation outcome in a range between 14 % and 95 %. The discussion of the model results is complemented by a sensitivity analysis highlighting the importance of declared capacity and the magnitude of its influence on slot allocation efficiency...|$|R

Classical definition of course scheduling cannot fulfill {{the special needs of}} lecture scheduling in universities, therefore several additional rules have to be added to this problem. Lecture scheduling is computationally NP-hard problem, therefore a number of researches apply heuristic methods to do automation to this problem. This research applied Genetic Algorithm combined with Constraint Satisfaction Problem, with chromosomes generated by Genetic Algorithm processed by Constraint Satisfaction Problem. By using this combination, constraints in lecture scheduling that must be fulfilled can be guaranteed not violated. This will make heuristic process in Genetic Algorithm focused and make the entire process more efficient. The case study is the case in Informatics Department, Faculty of Information Technology, ITS. From the analysis of testing results, it is concluded that the system can handle specific <b>requested</b> time <b>slot</b> for a lecture, that the system can process all the offered lectures, and that the system can produce schedules without violating the given constraints. It is also seen that Genetic Algorithm in the system has done optimation in finding the minimum student waiting time between lectures...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} the present {{invention}} utilizes an interface unit and a controller located at a central cable station. The interface unit interfaces the controller with a cable connection, which connects the interface unit to a plurality of cable modems located at remote locations. The cable modems write transmission <b>requests</b> into <b>slots</b> that are defined by the controller as contention slots and that are communicated along a channel of the cable connection. The cable modems also write other data into slots that are defined by the controller as data slots and that are also communicated along the channel of the cable connection. The controller is configured to define certain ones of the slots communicated along the aforementioned channel as data slots and to allocate these data slots to particular ones of the cable modems in response to transmission requests received by the controller. The controller is preferably configured to define each slot not allocated to a particular cable modem as a contention slot. Furthermore, the controller is also configured to preselect certain ones of the data slots as contention slots such that preselected ones of the data slots are automatically defined as contention slots.
