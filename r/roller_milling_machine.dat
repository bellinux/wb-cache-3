As it nears the mill, the water runs into a raised wooden flume {{to be fed}} to the Fitz Waterwheel. The waterwheel is 20½ feet in diameter and 2 ft wide.

50|$|At Buxton {{the river}} Bure was quite large with a {{powerful}} flow and with the diversion of the course there was a fall of 6 to 7 feet providing this mill with considerable power. The breastshot water wheel, which was sixteen foot, was installed in a separate brick built building which was located behind the mill house. This water wheel {{was replaced by a}} turbine in 1902. There was also a second waterwheel which was overshot using water that formed part of the Aylsham Navigation and gained its head by the close by lock system.The 1902 turbine was small and revolved at a much faster pace which removed the need several of the gear wheels which on larger, slow moving water wheels waste considerable power out-put. In 1965 this turbine was still producing 25% of the mill's power requirements. It had undergone a minor overhaul in 1930 and a major overhaul in the 1960s that would have left it capable of running for the next 40 years. The mills power was used to drive two and sometimes three pairs of millstones, which were in regular use for grinding animal food stuffs.

Tribological loading is the main type of load that should be considered when investigating the design failure of <b>roller</b> <b>mills</b> or of the low quality of grinding products. In the current work a comprehensive analysis of the design of <b>roller</b> <b>mills</b> to withstand tribilogocal was undertaken. Three body abrasive loading (3 BA) was found to be the key element to be considered in designing the roller. High stress three-body abrasion experiments were conducted on polyester and epoxy polymers to measure the wear and frictional characteristics of the selected material, different loads, durations and sand grain sizes were tested. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy were used to categorize the damage on the worn surface of the materials and the causes of failure. The current results are compared with the performance of mild steel results based on the literature. The results revealed that polyester had relatively poor wear performance compared to epoxy and steel especially when large sand grains were used. The wear mechanisms on the polyester surface were macro-pitting, fracture, ploughing, and defragmentation; while, epoxy showed micro-pitting and defragmentation. Epoxy material performance indicates it has potential for replacing metal <b>rollers</b> in the <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there is an}} {{emerging}} trend of coarse grinding of cereals in production of poultry feed due to positive influence of coarse particles on poultry digestive system. Influence of grinding method (hammer <b>mill</b> vs. <b>roller</b> <b>mill)</b> and grinding intensity of corn (coarseness of grinding) on mill specific energy consumption and pellet quality was investigated. By decreasing grinding intensity of corn (coarser grinding), specific energy consumption of both hammer <b>mill</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> was significantly decreased (p < 0. 05). When comparing similar grinding intensities on hammer <b>mill</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> (similar geometric mean diameter or similar particle size distribution), specific energy consumption was higher for the hammer mill. Pellet quality decreased with coarser grinding on hammer mill but, however, this effect was not observed for the <b>roller</b> <b>mill.</b> Generally, pellet quality was better when <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> was used.

40|$|Due to {{the need}} for {{thermally}} resistant materials in microelectronic insulators, high-speed aircraft structures, and structural components of space vehicles require high temperature polymer composites. The general requirements for a high temperature composite consist of good retention of mechanical properties at high temperatures and in the environment to be encountered, long shelf life, an acceptable manufacturing process, and quality control procedures, along with inspectability and repairability. Polybenzoxazine, a new kind of thermoset resin, has been known for its unique characteristics as compared to conventional phenolics and epoxy resins, such as excellent mechanical properties, near zero volumetric shrinkage, low water absorption, excellent resistance to heat and chemicals, UV light and high glass transition temperature (Tg). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in different fields, and they hold the promise of delivering exceptional mechanical properties and multi-functional characteristics with unique physical, mechanical and transport properties, However, if these materials are to be utilized as effective reinforcements in polymer composites, proper dispersion and good interfacial bonding between the CNTs and the polymer matrix have to be guaranteed. The objective of this project is to combine two materials having good mechanical and thermal properties to arrive at a product with further improved mechanical, and thermo mechanical properties and dimensional stability. To achieve this goal CNT-Benzoxazine nanocomposites were made successfully without any solvent. By using triton functionalization of MWCNT and dispersion technique a three <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> <b>machine</b> (Calendaring) is used to promote CNT dispersion and interfacial adhesion with a new polymer matrix. The effects of CNT functionalization on the dispersion characteristics, mechanical and thermal properties of matrix nanocomposites containing different contents of CNTs are investigated. The mechanical and thermal properties of benzoxazine nanocomposites containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are studied. The influence of carbon nanotubes on benzoxazine nanocomposites brings significant improvements in terms of flexural modulus and strength. However, the increased modulus is at the expense of a reduction in impact fracture toughness. SEM observations are performed on the fracture surface to characterize the failure behavior. The thermo-mechanical properties are characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA). The results show that by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the catalytic effect of CNTs accelerates the curing process at low temperatures. Enthalpy decreases due to a reduction in the degree of cure and increase in viscosity of the nanocomposites. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) shows the storage modulus and glass transition temperature increase with increasing CNT content. The addition of CNTs has an ameliorating effect of lowering the coefficient of thermal expansion in both the regions below and above glass transition temperature. The char yield increases with increasing CNT content due to the physical barrier effect of CNTs. Carbon nanotubes impedes the propagation of decomposition reactions in the nanocomposites. These observations have a particular implication for using the benzoxazine nanocomposites requiring low shrinkage and accurate dimensional control. The mechanical and thermal properties of CNT-benzoxazine nanocomposites containing both treated and untreated CNTs are compared with those of typical epoxy nanocomposites containing similar CNTs. The effects of CNT addition to the polymers are discussed based on reinforcing mechanism and cure kinetics. The results confirm that samples with functionalized CNTs show much better dispersion in the matrix with associated improved mechanical and thermal properties than those without functionalization and epoxy nanocomposites. Rheological studies were also carried out to optimize suitable processing parameters for the potential manufacturing of CFRP composite prepregs based on benzoxazine nanocomposites containing CNTs...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study effects of grinding and pelleting on feed structure using either wheat or maize as a base ingredients.

In addition base ingredients were mixed with mineral and vitamin premix to make complete diets. Smaller particles improved pellet durability but replacement of ground ingredients with whole ingredinets increased hardness. Coarse structure of the diets reduced energy consumption when compared with fine structured diets.
