5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of <b>rape</b> <b>victims.</b> Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Veronica shows {{one of the}} <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> (Krista Kalmus) {{the photo}} of a suspect, but she doesn’t {{recognize}} him. In criminology class, Veronica does {{a case study of}} Weevil (Francis Capra), and the class enjoys it. After the study, Veronica tells Weevil that she’s dating Logan (Jason Dohring), and he reacts negatively. Veronica then walks into Mars Investigations and finds Cyrus O’Dell and his wife (Jaime Ray Newman) talking with Keith, while Veronica herself does some detective work. Keith informs Veronica that Dean O’Dell’s stepson is dying and that he wants Keith to find the boy’s biological father. At Mercer's (Ryan Devlin) party, two masked men enter and steal everyone’s valuables, including the necklace that Lilly gave Veronica. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is failing his mechanical engineering class, a subject in which he wanted to major. Meanwhile, Keith tracks down the husband, and Veronica accuses Weevil of robbing the party.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the {{fraternity}} boys, {{and one of them}} tells her information that leads to her suspecting a boy named Chip. Keith and Harmony flirt, and Harmony shows a good amount of true romantic interest in Keith. Logan’s family has been donating $10,000 a month to “Aaron’s Kids”, which Veronica learns is not actually a charity. Veronica talks to Chip, who says that he was with another girl, who admits it while saying that she’ll never say so openly. Veronica turns her suspicion on Dick. After doing more digging, Veronica says that the money is going to Logan’s illegitimate brother, Charlie Stone. Parker insults Veronica for supposedly working with the fraternity. Keith catches Harmony’s husband kissing another woman. After talking to one of the other <b>rape</b> <b>victims,</b> Veronica discusses Claire with a slightly offbeat clerk, who says that Claire went in with a guy. Logan meets Charlie (Matt Czuchry), and they connect over surfing. However, Veronica notices some inconsistencies at Charlie’s private school job.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} into <b>rape</b> <b>victim</b> blaming has often neglected to assess attitudes toward male victims. The {{present study was}} designed to redress this imbalance and specifically, investigate the role of homophobic attitudes in male <b>rape</b> <b>victim</b> perception. Men and women read a vignette describing an incident of rape and answered two questionnaires that assessed firstly, homophobic attitudes toward homosexual persons and secondly, their perception of the <b>rape</b> <b>victim.</b> Based on the literature, I formulated three hypotheses a) males will evaluate male victims more negatively than females b) males will exhibit higher levels of homophobia than females and c) high levels of homophobia will predict more negative victim perception, particularly for male participants. The data supported two of the three hypotheses. Firstly, men exhibited greater degrees of homophobia than women and secondly, men's homophobic attitudes were significantly correlated with negative male <b>rape</b> <b>victim</b> perception. The implications of these findings for the reporting of rape and post-rape adjustment of victims are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Rape by males against males {{has been}} heavily stigmatized. According to {{psychologist}} Dr. Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> reported {{a lack of}} services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped {{to deal with this}} type of crime.|$|E
25|$|Sociobiologists and {{evolutionary}} psychologists have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape {{may be a}} mating strategy in humans, {{as a way for}} males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations. Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> are women of childbearing age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that <b>rape</b> <b>victims</b> suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and women of childbearing age experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women. Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by natural selection.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{assertion}} that previous research may have inadvertently confounded two stereotypes, we considered the impact of benevolent sexism on <b>rape</b> <b>victim</b> blame {{in the context of}} independent manipulations of gender and the perceived genuineness (victim stereotypicality) of an acquaintance <b>rape</b> <b>victim.</b> We predicted that for blame, benevolent sexism may be independently positively associated with gender and victim counter-stereotypicality. Following pilot work, 120 Australian undergraduates read an acquaintance rape scenario. Results indicated that benevolent sexism was only positively associated with blame of the gender counter-stereotypical victim when that victim was also counter-stereotypical in terms of victim stereotypes. This result indicates a more moderate role than previously indicated for benevolent sexism in accounting for <b>rape</b> <b>victim</b> blame...|$|R
