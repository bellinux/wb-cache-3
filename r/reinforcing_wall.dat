The combination of Structural Health Monitoring data and data analysis tools could be a solution. In this study, laboratory data was captured for both a baseline bare-frame and a wooden wall reinforced steel structure. A MATLAB®-based computer program, the in-house SHE™ accomplishes an array of tasks, including signal processing and modal decomposition among others. A SAP 2000 ® model contextualized the experimental data by producing trend behaviors, such as mode order or common mode shapes. Both sequential and cumulative reinforcement detection was performed on the cases of a baseline configuration, a single <b>reinforcing</b> <b>wall</b> case, and a double <b>reinforcing</b> <b>wall</b> case. The coupled translational, twisting, and bending modes were employed by nine damage detection indices. Relative to all others, Flexibility Percentage Difference performed the best, indicating both damage severity and location.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{concept of}} placing high {{strength}} linear reinforcements in a soil backfill {{to produce a}} vertical retaining structure is a recent idea that has been applied with success {{at a number of}} locations. Rational procedures have been developed for the design of these structures when the reinforcements consist of long metal straps. In certain situations advantages in construction and economy could be gained by replacing the metal straps with a continuous high strength fabric as reinforcement. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the behavior of a number of fabric reinforced earth models and to determine if the design methods that have been applied to metal strap <b>reinforced</b> earth <b>walls</b> can be applied to fabric <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls.</b> The economic feasibility of fabric <b>reinforced</b> earth <b>walls</b> was also investigated. The results of the model tests indicated that the design of fabric <b>reinforced</b> earth <b>walls</b> using methods developed for metal strap <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls</b> produces conservative results. Further investigation is required to define the actual mechanism involved in fabric <b>reinforced</b> earth <b>walls.</b> The economic analysis indicated that fabric <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls</b> can be competitive with other types of retaining structures for low heights...|$|R
40|$|Accidents {{involving}} vehicles {{crashing into}} <b>reinforced</b> retaining <b>walls</b> are increasing {{because of the}} increased construction of <b>reinforced</b> retaining <b>walls</b> on roads.

40|$|Lightly <b>reinforced</b> {{concrete}} <b>walls</b> {{are commonly}} found in low-to-moderate seismic regions such as Australia. While many theoretical analyses on lateral load-displacement of structural walls have been proposed and widely used, not many {{have been developed for}} lightly <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>walls.</b> The lateral load-displacement behaviour and failure mechanism of lightly <b>reinforced</b> structural <b>walls</b> differ to those of heavily <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>walls,</b> particularly in terms of tension stiffening effects, possible failure mechanisms and drift capacities.

A parametric study was conducted to provide initial insight into the effect of four design parameters (aspect ratio, axial load ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio and longitudinal reinforcement ratio) on the ultimate displacement capacity of <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>walls.</b> Two analytical models were developed to predict the lateral load-displacement behaviour of lightly <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls</b> consisting of a detailed wall model and a simplified wall model that provides a quick and conservative estimate for initial design checking purposes using displacement-based principles.

This type of walls gained relevance in 1950 s– 1970 s constructions because of their good performances under seismic actions. Real earthquakes have, indeed, demonstrated that buildings constructed with large lightly <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls,</b> characterised by adequate area respect to the floor extension, could suffer lower damages in comparison with traditional RC framed buildings. Moreover, a widespread use of such a construction typology is outstanding thanks to the diffusion on the market of new types of integrated formworks, including insulating materials such as polystyrene, that are being used for casting concrete and are aimed to obtain a higher energetic efficiency and build structures made of continuous lightly <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls.</b> Nevertheless, {{there is a lack of}} both experimental information and specific design indications in technical codes on this type of construction. This paper firstly reviews the European code requirements for large lightly <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls.</b> Then, some experimental tests on RC walls in the existing literature are studied in detail also by means of a nonlinear Finite Element (FE) model. Finally, the performances of a whole RC building designed with both large lightly <b>reinforced</b> <b>walls</b> along the perimeter and internal frames have been also exploited by linear dynamic and static nonlinear analysis. The analysis are mainly aimed to highlight the influence of in-plane stiffness of the floor on the dynamic behaviour of the structure and to assess the contribution of both ductility and over-strength to the behaviour factor, i. e. to the seismic performance of such type of buildings, considering the lack of information in the technical literature about these features...|$|R

In the present paper, a pseudo-dynamic method, which considers the effect of phase difference in both the shear and primary waves travelling through the backfill due to seismic excitation, is considered to obtain the minimum length of the geosynthetic reinforcement to resist direct sliding and overturning failure of the <b>reinforced</b> soil <b>wall.</b> A two-part wedge mechanism is used for determining {{the external}} stability of the <b>reinforced</b> soil <b>wall</b> against direct sliding. <b>Reinforced</b> soil <b>walls</b> with cohesionless backfill soil are considered in the present analysis.

The effect of drilled-in reinforcement on the resistance of walls with low-strength mortar was found to be particularly dramatic, changing the response from that of penetration and disintegration of the masonry to ductile behaviour, with the integrity of the wall maintained and only minimal wall displacement.

A full scale high anchored <b>reinforced</b> earth <b>wall</b> was constructed and instrumented to capture the essential behavior of the wall. Two sections of the wall were monitored where at one of the sections polystyrene foam was inserted at the back face of the wall panel to allow for lateral deformation to take place which means that the facing was less flexible in the transverse direction. The lateral deformation, axial forces along the reinforcing bars and settlement were monitored and measured for both cases and the results were compared and discussed...|$|R
