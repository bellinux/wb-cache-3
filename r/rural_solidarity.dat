The government of Poland conceded to demands regarding police brutality but the agreement to legalize <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> was postponed, as well as further steps {{on the issue of}} political prisoners. The government acknowledged its mishandling of the Bydgoszcz events, and in return, Lech Wałęsa agreed to postpone the general strike.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Solidarity {{had been}} {{transforming}} itself from a trade union into a social movement or more specifically, a revolutionary movement. Over the 500 {{days following the}} Gdańsk Agreement, 9–10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations, such as the Independent Student Union (Niezależne Zrzeszenie Studentów, created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union (NSZZ Rolników Indywidualnych [...] "Solidarność" [...] or <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity,</b> created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union. It {{was the only time}} in recorded history that a quarter of a country's population (some 80% of the total Polish work force) had voluntarily joined a single organization. [...] "History has taught us that there is no bread without freedom," [...] the Solidarity program stated a year later. [...] "What we had in mind was not only bread, butter and sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the repair of the republic." [...] Tygodnik Solidarność, a Solidarity-published newspaper, was started in April 1981.|$|E
500|$|The {{activity}} of Solidarity, although concerned with trade union matters (such as replacing the nomenklatura-run system with worker self-management in enterprise-level decision making), was {{widely regarded as}} the first step towards dismantling the regime's dominance over social institutions, professional organizations and community associations. Because of conditions specific to state socialist society, Solidarity soon lost its labor focus and became a universalist movement that emphasized civic rights and open society. Removing the ruling formation or breaking the dependence on the Soviet Union was not on the agenda. Using strikes and other tactics, the union sought to block government policies. The aims of the original, so-called First Solidarity (1980–81), were to reform socialism, not to introduce industrial private ownership or promote capitalism in general. Solidarity was an egalitarian and collectivist movement. It did not postulate any re-privatization of state-owned or small rural property, as such concepts were beyond the axiological horizon of Polish society. Solidarity was socialist and social justice was its goal. The First Solidarity upheaval could be viewed also as working people revolting against the emerging capitalist features of the economic order that diminished their role in Gierek-led society, combined with the [...] "anti-politics" [...] approach (building civil society [...] "without reference to both state and market") embraced at that time by their allied intellectual leaders. People of decidedly anticommunist or anti-PZPR orientations constituted a relatively small minority within the First Solidarity organization, which accommodated one million communist party members among its ranks. Apart from workers, both individual farmers and students created their own independent organizations: <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> and Independent Students' Union. They were formally recognized by the authorities only after strike actions conducted by activists of both movements in January 1981.|$|E
50|$|Some {{projects}} {{the movement has}} undertaken include socialist work camps in the 1940s and 1950s in which students would work in unionizing factories {{during the summer and}} pool their resources in communal houses of prayer; summer solidarity projects between 2000 and 2002 exploring sustainable living in <b>rural</b> community; international <b>solidarity</b> exchanges with more militant SCMs in the Philippines and Nicaragua; and annual student educational trips they call pilgrimages.|$|R
50|$|Since {{there is}} no formal census data {{available}} about Afghanistan {{it is hard to}} accurately identify the number of villages. Previously, it was estimated that approximately 20000 rural settlements or villages existed, however this was markedly increased to 42000 villages. Since field coordinators have reported that several of the villages comprise less than the minimum of 25 families required to initiate a CDC, it is estimated by the MRRD that around 28500 NSP communities would be a reasonable equivalent to rural settlements estimate. This approximation thus average 1 NSP community = 1.474 rural settlements. However the current average used is 1 NSP community = 1.583 <b>rural</b> settlements.

40|$|The {{project has}} {{examined}} drug consumption {{as a political}} problem and its ideological undertones. It is shown how drugs and drug consumption often have been subordinate in problem descriptions that have fulfilled other political purposes. Worries about politically radical youth, foreign religions or incomprehensible music have been understood as a drug problem. In the Swedish parliament the drug problem has been {{described in terms of}} capitalist class oppression, Americanism or cultural superficiality. Modernity, urbanization and industrialization have also been criticized {{in the name of the}} drug problem. In the treatment centres and within the ruling bureaucracy it was also elucidated that the drug problem was an ideological problem. The effective treatment method has been elusive, but the effective method has also played second fiddle in the choice of treatment solutions. Other values have been awarded, such as <b>rural</b> romanticism, Swedishness, <b>solidarity</b> and diligence. Individualism, Americanism and profit making have also been opposed within the ideological treatment sector. At the end of the research period such assessments however became subordinate to an overarching ideological quest to make substance abuse treatment a market among others...|$|R
2500|$|While party–controlled courts {{took up the}} {{contentious}} issues of Solidarity's legal registration as a trade union (finalized by November 10), planning had already begun for the imposition of martial law. A parallel farmers' union was organized and strongly opposed by the regime, but <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> was finally registered on May 12, 1981. In the meantime, a rapid deterioration of {{the authority of the}} communist party, the disintegration of state power and an escalation of demands and threats by the various Solidarity–affiliated groups were occurring. According to Kuroń, a [...] "tremendous social democratization movement in all spheres" [...] was taking place and could not be contained. Wałęsa had meetings with Kania, which brought no resolution to the impasse. Following the Warsaw Pact summit in Moscow, the Soviet Union proceeded with a massive military build-up along Poland's border in December 1980, but during the summit, Kania forcefully argued with Leonid Brezhnev and other allied communists leaders against the feasibility of an external military intervention, and no action was taken. The United States, under presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, repeatedly warned the Soviets about the consequences of a direct intervention, while discouraging an open insurrection in Poland and signaling to the Polish opposition {{that there would be no}} rescue by the NATO forces.|$|E
50|$|Supported by Lech Wałęsa and {{the factory}} workers, the farmers {{organized}} on December 14, 1980, the founding congress of <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> in Warsaw. It {{was attended by}} 1000 delegates, who represented around 600 000 private farmers. Among their demands, there was a call for formal registration of their independent union. However, on December 30, 1980, the Supreme Court announced that its ruling on <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> had been postponed. As a result, tensions rose rise between the peasants and local governments across the country.|$|E
5000|$|However, <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> was not legalized until May 12, 1981, {{after another}} farmers strike, {{this time in}} Bydgoszcz, where it {{resulted}} in a major incident, which sparked off the 1981 warning strike in Poland. Its first leader became Jan Kulaj, and the union was banned on December 13, 1981 (see: Martial Law in Poland). Among those who supported restoration of the <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity,</b> was Pope John Paul II, who called for it during his 1987 visit to Poland, saying: [...] "A Pope cannot remain quiet about this {{even if he were}} not a Pole".|$|E
50|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> {{returned}} in 1989 (see: Polish Round Table Agreement), and has existed since then. Among its leaders, there are Gabriel Janowski, Artur Balazs, Roman Bartoszcze, and Roman Wierzbicki.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> (full name Independent Self-governing Trade Union of Individual Farmers [...] "Solidarity") is a {{trade union}} of Polish farmers, {{established}} in late 1980 {{as part of}} the growing Solidarity movement. Its legalization became possible on February 19, 1981, when officials of the government of the People's Republic of Poland signed the so-called Rzeszów - Ustrzyki Dolne Agreement with striking farmers. Previously, Communist government had refused farmers’ right to self-organize, which caused widespread strikes, with the biggest wave taking place in January 1981. The <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> was officially recognized on May 12, 1981, and, strongly backed by the Catholic Church of Poland, it claimed to represent at least half of Poland's 3.2 million smallholders.|$|E
50|$|On November 30, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Andrzej Kacala {{met with}} a group of 30 representatives of farmers' unions {{founding}} committees from the Warsaw, Lublin, Siedlce, Skierniewice, and Wałbrzych Voivodeships, {{as well as from the}} Września - Konin, Golub-Dobrzyń - Kujawy, and the Holy Cross Mountains regions. The representatives informally called themselves <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity.</b>|$|E
50|$|On September 24, 1980, {{representatives of}} Polish {{individual}} farmers submitted documents to the Warsaw Provincial Court for registration as <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity.</b> However, after one month, {{at the end}} of October, the court ruled that private farmers were self-employed and as such, were not entitled to organize their own labor union. The disappointed farmers turned to the Supreme Court.|$|E

50|$|The {{party was}} {{established}} in October 1991 by a merger of <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> and Polish People's Party-Solidarity, the latter a splinter group from the former. In the parliamentary elections later that year it received 5.5% of the vote, winning 28 seats in the Sejm and five in the Senate. It joined the coalition governments headed by Jan Olszewski and Hanna Suchocka, with party leader Gabriel Janowski serving as Minister of Agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1980, {{workers of}} the Vladimir Lenin Gdańsk Shipyard began a strike, which {{resulted}} in creation of Solidarity (see: History of Solidarity).

50|$|Bydgoszcz events (wypadki bydgoskie) {{refers to}} {{a turning point in}} the early history of the Solidarity movement. Following the {{registration}} of Solidarity by the authorities of Poland in 1980, the farmers were also pushing for creation of a separate trade union, independent from the official system of power. The NSZZ RI Solidarność (Independent Self-Governing Trade Union of Individual Farmers Solidarity, also called <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity)</b> was created, but not legalized by the authorities. Because of that on March 16, 1981 in Bydgoszcz a strike was proclaimed.|$|E
5000|$|... "Countrymindedness" [...] was {{a slogan}} that {{summed up the}} {{ideology}} of the Country Party from 1920 through the early 1970s. It was an ideology that was physiocratic, populist, and decentralist; it fostered <b>rural</b> <b>solidarity</b> and justified demands for government subsidies. [...] "Countrymindedness" [...] grew out of the failure of the country areas to participate in the rapid economic and population expansions that occurred after 1890. The growth of the ideology into urban areas came as most country people migrated to jobs in the cities. Its decline was due mainly to the reduction of real and psychological differences between country and city brought about by the postwar expansion of the Australian urban population and to the increased affluence and technological changes that accompanied it.|$|E
5000|$|Southeastern part of Poland was {{the area}} in which {{individual}} farmers were very numerous and where position of the Roman Catholic Church was the strongest. Therefore, in early 1981, main center of farmers’ protests was established in the city of Rzeszów, where the strike and the sit-in began on January 5, 1981 and where the center of the movement was established. As Time magazine reported on Monday, February 2, 1981, members of Solidarity and <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> occupied [...] "Headquarters of the old official trade union" [...] (in fact, it was The House of the Railroad Worker), where they placed a sign which said: [...] "SOLIDARITY IS MORE THAN JUST A NAME". The united front of both organizations demanded negotiations toward legitimizing the farmers' union.|$|E
50|$|On 7 July 1945, Rzeszów became {{capital of}} the newly created Rzeszów Voivodeship, which {{consisted}} of western counties of prewar Lwów Voivodeship, plus some eastern counties of prewar Kraków Voivodeship. This decision had {{a major impact on}} the city, as it quickly grew. New offices of the regional government were built, and in 1951, several neighboring villages were annexed by Rzeszów, and the area of the city grew to 39 km2. In 1971 and 1977, further villages were annexed. In early 1981, Rzeszów was a main center of peasant’s protests, who for fifty days occupied local offices, which resulted in signing of the Rzeszów - Ustrzyki Agreement, and creation of <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity.</b> On 1 January 1999, the city became the capital of Podkarpackie Voivodeship. Its population grew to 170,000, and area to 91,43 km2.Since January 1, 2017 years Rzeszów will be greater on the village Bzianka (Government Decision of July 2016.). The area of Rzeszów will increase to over 120 square kilometers and more than 188,000 inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|Henryk Górecki {{dedicated}} his Miserere to {{the city}} of Bydgoszcz. Bydgoszcz was the site of a confrontation between members of the opposition organizations Solidarity and <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> (which were made up of an estimated one-third of the Polish population) and the Polish militia. At around ten past seven on 19 March 1981, approximately two hundred militia, sent in to remove the organizations from a prolonged negotiation with the Provisional Council, violently assaulted the organizations’ members. In the confrontation, one was left with contusions to the skull and ribs, and suspected brain damage; two others were seriously injured, inflaming an already unhappy Polish populace. Nine months after the incident in Bydgoszcz, the opposition organizations was outlawed and General of the Army Wojciech Jaruzelski declared a state of martial law. During this period, no performance of the work was possible, and Górecki placed the completed work out of sight. He revised the work in 1987 before its premiere in Włocławek on September 10, 1987 at the 15th Bydgoszcz Music Festival. Włocławek had been the site of the 1984 assassination of the priest Jerzy Popiełuszko by state police and made a fitting scene for the performance of a work dedicated to those so violently oppressed by their government. Promotion of the premiere was prohibited by the authorities, but every seat ended up occupied.|$|E
50|$|On Monday, January 26, {{a one-hour}} warning strike {{took place in}} {{selected}} enterprises of Bielsko-Biala and the region (Skoczów, Zywiec, Kęty, Andrychów, Sucha Beskidzka). On the same day, the Interfactory Founding Committee {{changed its name to}} Interfactory Strike Committee (MKS), with 107 members of 54 enterprises of the province. The MKS had its main office at the club-room of Cotton Plant Bewelana in Bielsko-Biała, which had previously been the location of weekly meetings of regional Solidarity leaders. In that club-room, some 400 people stayed for ten days. The strike started on Tuesday, January 27, and most enterprises of the Voivodeship took part in it. In Bielsko-Biała itself, the only businesses that did not participate in it were hospitals, railroads, delivery services, and telecommunications companies. In the course of the time, additional enterprises joined the protest, and activists of <b>Rural</b> <b>Solidarity</b> brought food to the workers, who occupied their factories. Crews of striking enterprises were very determined, and what they needed most were news updates. Every few hours, several times a day, strike bulletins were copied and distributed to thousands of people. Negotiations at Bewelana were broadcast live to most local factories, due to the efforts of Solidarity telecommunications experts, who created a network, which connected all radio stations of the enterprises. Local government was helpless, and the Interfactory Strike Committee became the center of power in the region, with 200,000 people actively participating in the protest. Negotiations, which took place in early February, failed, and soon afterwards, Solidarity leaders Lech Wałęsa, Andrzej Gwiazda and Stanisław Wądołowski came to Bielsko-Biała, together with their advisers Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Bronisław Geremek. Wałęsa and his people at first opposed the strike, for two reasons. Firstly, Bielsko-Biała's Solidarity activists organized it without consultation the union’s national leadership body. Secondly, at that time national negotiations were taking place in Warsaw, and local protests did not help Solidarity. Therefore, Wałęsa came to Bielsko-Biała to end the strike, but after finding out about the situation in the region, and seeing the determination of the people, he changed his mind and supported the protest. Furthermore, he warned the government that a national strike would take place, if force was used against workers in Bielsko-Biała. As time went by, the situation became dramatic. All talks were broken, and people talked among themselves that the authorities were considering the use of force.|$|E

Such phenomenon of legal life of the Russian countryside as a lynch mob is studied in the article on the basis of a wide range of archival and ethnographic sources. The author analyzes the crimes for which the perpetrators are arbitrarily subjected to massacre in the village. The role of the peasant community in the punishment implementation of criminals was found out. The causes of the stability of this tradition in rural society were set. Lynching played an effective means of suppression of unlawful acts of the peasants.

40|$|It {{has become}} a well known fact that a {{sustainable}} development of humankind resides not only in preserving the environment but mainly in preserving solidarity between generations or within a generation. This sustainable development defined as a productive cooperation between generations implies a man nature relationship where the man {{is an element of}} nature not its master. The place where the interests of several generations come together as a hole is the countryside, for here the connection between nature, work and capital has a permanent and direct character. Therefore it is not by chance that man and land are primary components of a nation wealth. For the Romanian people eternity was born in the countryside, and the sacred aspects of life are better preserved here. In this context it is a priority to determine the real contribution that it has to Grass Domestic Product, the contribution it has to the preservation and augmentation of the national wealth, as basis for an increasing thrust capital. <b>Rural</b> <b>solidarity,</b> Thrust capital, Rural family, Social dialog, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of the world’s current economic models are destructive and unsustainable. Little {{progress has been made}} in recent years to change this, despite significant discussion surrounding the theme. In this context, the solidarity economy presents itself as an alternative that seeks environmental and economic sustainability, as well as social promotion. In Brazil, Solidarity Economy Rural Organizations (SEROs) began in the 1970 s. As with organizations from other sectors, they should be evaluated in relation to their ability to achieve social and solidarity objectives. Thus, this study aims to present a theoretical model of performance evaluation indicators for Solidarity Economy Rural Organizations in Southern Brazil based on the perceptions of the organizations’ decision makers. SERO representatives interviewed were asked to rank 36 criteria commonly used in performance evaluations, which were grouped into six dimensions: (1) legal documents and standards; (2) valuing of human work; (3) technology and economy; (4) acknowledgment of women; (5) preservation of and respect for nature; and (6) cooperation and solidarity. The results show that SERO representatives consider that performance evaluations should adhere to the Brazilian Declaration of Solidarity Economy Principles. Additionally, we identified a greater concern with criteria correlated to technical and legal aspects than criteria related to solidarity and humanitarianism. These results are relevant for the maintenance of <b>rural</b> <b>solidarity</b> economy organization as they provide a base for developing processes and tools to be used in SERO performance evaluations; such processes are necessary to maintain sustainable development in low-income economies, and to enable solidarity organizations to reach their objectives...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of recent social transformations in two Angolan cities – Luanda and Ondjiva – highlights the maintenance and strengthening of groups and social networks based on family ties {{on the one}} hand and, on the other, the construction of new solidarities and identities derived from a traditional framework and recreated in the urban context in recent decades. Family solidarity and reciprocity in the post-independence, post-war context in Luanda and Ondjiva are the basis of social strategies, and the new forms of urban extended family have supported individuals during rapid urban growth and socio-economic uncertainty in multiple ways: providing economic support, a main point for social reference and security, among other things. In Luanda this organisation has generated an atomised social structure, and in Ondjiva the urban social tissue that was completely erased during invasion and war relied for many years on <b>rural</b> <b>solidarity</b> ties. However, with the gradual yet massive migration towards the capital city, the return of displaced populations and the arrival of new migrants in Ondjiva, newer, broader and more complex forms of solidarity and social identity have emerged in recent years. The increasing complexity, along with the decrease in the capacity to sustain reciprocity and dependency networks, tends to lead to the formation of clearer social strata and the preponderance of new criteria. Both in Luanda and in Ondjiva, the urban reference – the integration, adoption and practice of an urban/modern lifestyle – together with the consolidation of a market economy and economic stratification, generates new social differentiation and tends to produce different layers within the urban population. In both urban centres, urban/cosmopolitan references tend to assume {{a central role in the}} formation of social differentiation, producing new forms of social identity and social status...|$|E
