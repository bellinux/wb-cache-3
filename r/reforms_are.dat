5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international <b>reforms,</b> <b>are</b> the two key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after}} the global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
5|$|Within his Remarks, Staszic did not {{portray the}} life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, {{one of the most}} {{prominent}} statesmen in Polish history); rather, he argued that <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before. Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes. He advocated the abolition of the serfdom and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights). He criticised the szlachta (Polish nobility) for inefficient governance, and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone. He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours. Although he preferred republicanism in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the most practical solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe. In Remarks he even supported the introduction of an absolute monarchy in Poland.|$|E

5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The <b>reform's</b> goal <b>was</b> to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|R
5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> neither popular nor productive.

5000|$|The Brezhnev era, {{which had}} begun with high growth, began to stagnate {{some time in}} the early-1970s. Kosygin's [...] "radical" [...] <b>reform</b> {{attempts}} <b>were</b> halted in 1971 and his second <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> more modest. The second <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> halted because of the 1973 oil crisis, when an international increase in oil price prompted economic growth based on selling oil. Another <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> implemented in 1979 but this, too, failed as by this time the Soviet economy had become [...] "addicted" [...] to high oil prices.|$|R

Local planners and economists in the 1980s still complained that they had too little power in the daily running of their local economies. Specialised literature proved that the reform's main goal had failed to meet the expected standards.|$|R

25|$|Nechtan's ecclesiastical <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> seen {{as having}} led to closer links between Pictland and Northumbria, with notable results in artistic forms. His {{expulsion}} of Ionan clerics, rather than being a submission to Rome and Northumbria, probably marks the coming of age of an independent Pictish church, which nonetheless remained close to Iona and to Ireland. In addition, it speaks to a very considerable degree of royal control over the church in Pictland, which {{appears to have been}} contentious in the ninth century.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{schooling}} in Guyana is tiered. There are senior secondary schools, {{which tend}} to be more academic in orientation, junior secondary schools, Community High Schools and Secondary Departments of Primary Schools.

5000|$|The Vilayets (...) of the Ottoman Empire {{were the}} first-order {{administrative}} division, or provinces, {{of the later}} empire, introduced with the promulgation of the Vilayet Law (Teşkil-i Vilayet Nizamnamesi) of 21 January 1867. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> part of the ongoing administrative <b>reforms</b> that <b>were</b> being enacted throughout the empire, and enshrined in the Imperial Edict of 1856. The <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> at first implemented experimentally in the Danube Vilayet, specially formed in 1864 and headed by the leading reformist Midhat Pasha.

25|$|During {{the years}} 2014—2017 there {{occurred}} no large-scale protest actions, but, in general, a scientific community has not supported the launched reforms. Sometimes these <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> interpreted as nothing else than a redistribution of real estate. In 2017, {{when the new}} presidium of the Academy was being elected, the candidates for presidency negatively estimated the intermediate results of the reforms. The elected RAS president Alexander Sergeev claimed a change of {{the legal status of}} the Russian Academy of Sciences as one of the urgent problems. Nevertheless, he is ready to establish working relationships with the state authorities at various levels, including the FASO.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that the <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> not totally without effect. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Justice, in 2008 there were more marriages and slightly fewer divorces in Morocco. Of the divorces granted, almost 30% were divorce by mutual consent – which did not exist before the 2004 reforms. Moreover, while over 14,000 divorce proceedings were initiated by men, over 26,000 were initiated by women in 2007; before the reforms, women did not have the right to initiate these proceedings. Finally, the number of women arranging their own marriages increased by over 14% between 2006 and 2007.|$|E
25|$|Organised retail {{will need}} workers. Walmart employs 1.4 {{million people in}} United States alone. With United States {{population}} of about 300 million, and India's population of about 1200 million, if Walmart-like retail companies were to expand in India {{as much as their}} presence in the United States, and the staffing level in Indian stores kept at the same level as in the United States stores, Walmart alone would employ 5.6 million Indian citizens. Walmart has a 6.5% market share of the total United States retail. Adjusted for this market share, the expected jobs in future Indian organised retail would total over 85 million. In addition, millions of additional jobs will be created during the building of and the maintenance of retail stores, roads, cold storage centers, software industry, electronic cash registers and other retail supporting organisations. Instead of job losses, retail <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> likely to be massive boost to Indian job availability.|$|E
50|$|The reforms {{resulted}} in significant {{restructuring of the}} administrative structure and the composition of its personnel.
