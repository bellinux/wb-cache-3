A subsidy however has the effect of shifting the domestic firm's best <b>response</b> <b>function</b> to the right. Because its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E

Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and IP3 through gap junctions and extracellular ATP signalling. Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release.|$|E
40|$|Estimation of <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> is an {{important}} task in dynamic medical imaging. This task arises for example in dynamic renal scintigraphy, where impulse <b>response</b> or retention <b>functions</b> are estimated, or in {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} where hemodynamic <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are required. These functions can not be observed directly and their estimation is complicated because the recorded images are subject to superposition of underlying signals. Therefore, the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are estimated via blind source separation and deconvolution. Performance of this algorithm heavily depends on the used models of the <b>response</b> <b>functions.</b> <b>Response</b> <b>functions</b> in real image sequences are rather complicated and finding a suitable parametric form is problematic. In this paper, we study estimation of the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> using non-parametric Bayesian priors. These priors were designed to favor desirable properties of the functions, such as sparsity or smoothness. These assumptions are used within hierarchical priors of the blind source separation and deconvolution algorithm. Comparison of the resulting algorithms with these priors is performed on synthetic dataset as well as on real datasets from dynamic renal scintigraphy. It is shown that flexible non-parametric priors improve estimation of <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> in both cases. MATLAB implementation of the resulting algorithms is freely available for download. Comment: 19 pages, Preprint submitted to Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|The kinetic Glauber-Ising spin {{chain is}} {{one of the very few}} exactly {{solvable}} models of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

[...] This filter is based on Zolotarev polynomials (which include the Chebyshev polynomials as a special case) discovered by Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. [...] The Zolotarev response has a stopband at low frequency, the cutoff of which can be controlled by the designer so it is not detrimental in a waveguide filter.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the non-uniqueness of the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> in thermodynamics. It deals with continuous {{bodies of the}} differential type. In effect, the authors take {{the point of view}} that two sets of <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> (for stress, heat ﬂux, energy, etc.) are equivalent provided they lead to the same balance equations and the same surface tractions and surface inﬂux of heat on the boundary of the body (in response to the same motions and temperature ﬁelds). Using the results of their previous papers, the authors study the non-uniqueness in the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> from this standpoint. The results typically say that the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are unique only to within certain expressions.

40|$|Recently, with an enlighting treatment, Baskaran and Grishchuk {{have shown}} the {{presence}} and importance of the so-called ``magnetic'' components of gravitational waves (GWs), which {{have to be taken}} into account in the context of the total <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> of interferometers for GWs propagating from arbitrary directions. In this paper the analysis of the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> for the magnetic components is generalized in its full frequency dependence, while in the work of Baskaran and Grishchuk the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> were computed only in the approximation of wavelength much larger than the linear dimensions of the interferometer. It is also shown that the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> to the magnetic components grow at high frequencies, differently from the values of the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> to the well known ordinary components that decrease at high frequencies. Thus the magnetic components could in principle become the dominant part of the signal at high frequencies. This is important for a potential detection of the signal at high frequencies and confirms that the magnetic contributions must be taken into account in the data analysis. More, the fact that the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> of the magnetic components grow at high frequencies shows that, in principle, the frequency-range of Earth-based interferometers could extend to frequencies over 10000 Hz.
