In {{the process of}} CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA (“spacers”) are {{acquired}} from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. It so far remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of “self ” is mediated by the RecBCD dsDNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that in E. coli, acquisition of new spacers depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of dsDNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, {{in combination with the}} higher number of forks on the foreign DNA. This model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers from both high copy plasmids and phages. CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive defense system in bacteria and archaea that provides acquired immunity against phages and plasmids 1 - 6.

Considerable evidence has demonstrated that exogenously administrated recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) provides neuroprotection in different paradigms of brain damage (Buemi et al. 2000; Erbayraktar et al. 2003; Sirén, Knerlich, et al. 2001).

For example, the canonical molecular signals used to initiate protein synthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes are mutually exclusive 1, 2. However, the core structures and conformational dynamics of ribosomes {{that are responsible}} for the steps of translation following initiation are ancient and conserved across the domains of life 3, 4. We asked whether an undiscovered RNA-based signal might be able to use these conserved features, bypassing mechanisms specific to each domain of life, and initiate protein synthesis in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Although structured internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNAs can manipulate ribosomes to initiate translation in eukaryotic cells, an analogous RNA structure-based mechanism has not been observed in bacteria.

However, this view fails to explain specificity since glypicans bind many extracellular ligands. Here we provide genetic evidence in Drosophila that Notum requires glypicans to suppress Wnt signalling, but does not cleave their glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. Structural analyses reveal glycosaminoglycan binding sites on Notum, which likely help Notum colocalise with Wnts. They also identify, at the active site of human and Drosophila Notum, a large hydrophobic pocket that accommodates palmitoleate.

40|$|Mechanisms {{governing}} a neuron’s regenerative ability {{are important}} but not well understood. We identified Rtca, RNA 3 ′-terminal phosphate cyclase, as an inhibitor for axon regeneration. Removal of dRtca cell-autonomously enhanced axon regrowth in the Drosophila central nervous system, whereas its overexpression reduced axon regeneration in the periphery. Rtca {{along with the}} RNA ligase Rtcb and its catalyst Archease operate in the RNA repair/splicing pathway important for stress induced mRNA splicing, including that of Xbp 1, a cellular stress sensor. dRtca and dArchease had opposing effects on Xbp 1 splicing, and deficiency of dArchease or Xbp 1 impeded axon regeneration in Drosophila. Moreover, overexpressing mammalian Rtca in cultured rodent neurons reduced axonal complexity in vitro, whereas reducing its function promoted retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after optic nerve crush in mice. Our study thus links axon regeneration to cellular stress and RNA metabolism, revealing new potential therapeutic targets for treating nervous system trauma. <b>Reprints</b> <b>and</b> <b>permissions</b> <b>information</b> is available at www. nature. com/reprints.

Which of these pathways applies is both organ and injury-specific 1 – 4. Current paradigms in the lung posit that epithelial repair {{can be attributed}} to cells expressing mature lineage markers 5 – 8. In contrast we here define the regenerative role of previously uncharacterized, rare lineage-negative epithelial stem/progenitor (LNEPs) cells present within normal distal lung. Quiescent LNEPs activate a ΔNp 63 /cytokeratin 5 (Krt 5 +) remodeling program after influenza or bleomycin injury. Activated cells proliferate and migrate widely to occupy heavily injured areas depleted of mature lineages, whereupon they differentiate toward mature epithelium. Lineage tracing revealed scant contribution of pre-existing mature epithelial cells in such repair, whereas orthotopic transplantation of LNEPs, isolated by a definitive surface profile identified through single cell sequencing, directly demonstrated the proliferative capacity and multipotency of this population.

Here we show how oxytocin enables pup retrieval behavior in female mice by enhancing auditory cortical pup call responses. Retrieval behavior required left but not right auditory cortex, was accelerated by oxytocin in left auditory cortex, and oxytocin receptors were preferentially expressed in left auditory cortex. Neural responses to pup calls were lateralized, with co-tuned and temporally-precise excitatory and inhibitory responses in left cortex of maternal but not pup-naive adults. Finally, pairing calls with oxytocin enhanced responses by balancing the magnitude and timing of inhibition with excitation. Our results describe fundamental synaptic mechanisms by which oxytocin increases the salience of acoustic social stimuli. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced plasticity provides a biological basis for lateralization of auditory cortical processing. The neuropeptide oxytocin controls social behaviors such as pair bond formation, mating, and parenting 1 – 14.

40|$|Identifying {{mechanisms}} of drug action remains a fundamental impediment {{to the development}} and effective use of chemotherapeutics. Here we describe an RNA interference (RNAi) –based strategy to characterize small-molecule function in mammalian cells. By examining the response of cells expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to a diverse selection of chemotherapeutics, we could generate a functional shRNA signature that was able to accurately group drugs into established biochemical modes of action. This, in turn, provided a diversely sampled reference set for high-resolution prediction of {{mechanisms of}} action for poorly characterized small molecules. We could further reduce the predictive shRNA target set to as few as eight genes and, by using a newly derived probability-based nearest-neighbors approach, could extend the predictive power of this shRNA set to characterize additional drug categories. Thus, a focused shRNA phenotypic signature can provide a highly sensitive and tractable approach for characterizing new anticancer drugs.

One of the best-studied lncRNAs is Xist, which is required for transcriptional silencing of one X-chromosome during development in female mammals 3, 4.

40|$|Recent studies {{into the}} global causes of severe {{diarrhea}} in young children have identified the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium as {{the second most important}} diarrheal pathogen after rotavirus 1 – 3. Diarrheal disease is estimated to be responsible for 10. 5 % of overall child mortality 4. Cryptosporidium is also an opportunistic pathogen in the context of HIV-AIDS and organ transplantation 5, 6. There is no vaccine and only a single approved drug that provides no benefit for those in gravest danger, malnourished children and immunocompromised patients 7, 8. Cryptosporidiosis drug and vaccine development is limited by the poor tractability of the parasite, which includes lack of continuous culture, facile animal models, and molecular genetic tools 3, 9. Here we describe an experimental framework to genetically modify this important human pathogen. We establish and optimize transfection of C. parvum sporozoites in tissue culture. To isolate stable transgenics we develop a mouse model that delivers sporozoites directly into the intestine, a Cryptosporidium CRISPR/Cas 9 system, and in vivo selection for aminoglycoside resistance. We derive reporter parasites suitable for in vitro and in vivo drug screening, and we evaluate the basis of drug susceptibility by gene knock out. We anticipate the ability to genetically engineer the parasite will be transformative for Cryptosporidium research. Genetic reporters will provide quantitative correlates for disease, cure and protection and the role of parasite genes in these processes is now open to rigorous investigation. <b>Reprints</b> <b>and</b> <b>permissions</b> <b>information</b> is available at www. nature. com/reprints...|$|E

The 13 -subunit, 800 -kDa eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF 3) organizes initiation factor and ribosome interactions required for productive translation 3. However, current understanding of eIF 3 function does not explain genetic evidence correlating eIF 3 deregulation with tissue-specific cancers and developmental defects 4. Here we report the genome-wide discovery of human transcripts that interact with eIF 3 using photo-activatable crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) 5. eIF 3 binds to a highly specific programme of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) involved in cell growth control processes, including cell cycling, differentiation, and apoptosis, via the mRNA 5 ′ untranslated region (5 ′ UTR). Surprisingly, functional analysis {{of the interaction between}} eIF 3 and two mRNAs encoding cell proliferation regulators, c-Jun and BTG 1, reveals that eIF 3 employs different modes of RNA stem loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression. Our findings illuminate a new role for eIF 3 in governing a specialized repertoire of gene expression and suggest that binding of eIF 3 to specific mRNAs could be targeted to control carcinogenesis. Extensive genetic evidence implicates eIF 3 in other functions in translation outside of its general role as a protein scaffold for formation of initiation complexes.

40|$|The present dogma {{of muscle}} {{contraction}} is founded principally on two tenets: (1) that contraction {{is the result}} of an interaction between actin, myosin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and (2) that contraction proceeds by a sliding mechanism which does not involve permanent change in the length or configuration of the component protein molecules. Actomyosin is an ATPase needing Mg++ ion as a co-factor but not Ca++ ion. The Ca++ concentration on the other hand plays a vital role in switching the muscle from a resting to an active state. I wish to acknowledge at the outset the debt we owe to Dr. H. E. Huxley for his unique {{role in the development of}} the structural ideas underlying this hypothesis.

40|$|Summary: This article reviews, {{particularly}} {{with reference to}} USA sources, the empowerment perspective, the strengths perspective, and the harm reduction approach {{as they relate to}} clinical application in serving those affected with alcohol or drug use disorders. Findings: Social work practitioners have long been educated in applying empowerment processes and the strengths perspective to better serve their clients. However, applying the harm reduction approach, particularly to the population of those with substance use disorders, has only recently been discussed in social work literature. Applications: The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide social work practitioners with relevant information pertinent to the empowerment perspective, the strengths perspective, and the harm reduction approach as they apply to helping those with substance use disorders. It also proposes various strategies involved in the assessment process, treatment planning, and treatment derived from practice experience that integrates these important social work approaches to possibly better assist this population.
