5000|$|The International Nonproprietary Name [...] "retigabine" [...] was {{initially}} published as being under consideration by WHO in 1996. This was later adopted as the <b>recommended</b> <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Name</b> (rINN) for the drug, and, in 2005 or 2006, the USAN Council—a program {{sponsored by the}} American Medical Association, the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, and the American Pharmacists Association that chooses nonproprietary names for drug sold in the United States—adopted the same name. In 2010, however, the USAN Council rescinded its previous decision and assigned [...] "ezogabine" [...] as the United States Adopted Name for the drug. The drug will thus be known as [...] "ezogabine" [...] in the United States and [...] "retigabine" [...] elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|WHO Drug Information {{provides}} an overview of topics relating to drug development and regulation that are of current relevance and importance, and includes the lists of proposed and <b>recommended</b> <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN). Its contents reflect, but do not present, WHO policies and activities and they embrace socioeconomic as well as technical matters. The objective is to bring issues that are of primary concern to drug regulators and pharmaceutical manufacturers to the attention of a wide audience of health professionals and policy-makers concerned with the rational use of drugs. In effect, the journal seeks to relate regulatory activity to therapeutic practice. It also aims to provide an open forum for debate. Invited contributions will portray a variety of viewpoints on matters of general policy with the aim of stimulating discussion not only in these columns but wherever relevant decisions on this subject have to be taken...|$|R
40|$|The World Health Organization is a {{specialized}} {{agency of the}} United Nations with primary responsibility for international health matters and public health. Through this organization, which was created in 1948, the health professions of some 165 countries exchange their knowledge and experience {{with the aim of}} making possible the attainment by all citizens of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. By means of direct technical cooperation with its Member States, and by stimulating such cooperation among them, W H O promotes the development of comprehensive healrh services, the revention and control of diseases, the improvement of environmental conditions, the deve~opment of health manpower, the coordination and development of biomedical and health services research, and the planning and implementation of health programmes. These broad fields of endeavour encompass a wide variety of activities, such as developing systems of rimary health care that reach the whole population of Member countries; promoting t i e health of mothers and children; combating malnutrition; controllhg malaria and other communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and leprosy; having achieved the eradication of smallpox, promoting mass immunization against a number of other preventable diseases; improving mental health; providing safe water supplies; and training health person-nel of all categories. Progress towards better health throughout the world also demands international cooperation in such matters as establishing international standards for biological substances, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals; formulating environmental health criteria; <b>recommending</b> <b>international</b> <b>nonproprietary</b> <b>names</b> for drugs; administering the International Health Regulations; revising the International Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death; and collecting and disseminating healrh statistical information.

40|$|Paracetamol (<b>recommended</b> <b>international</b> <b>nonproprietary</b> <b>name)</b> (acetaminophen) was {{synthesized}} in 1878 by Morse (Morse HN: 1878.) {{and first}} used clinically by von Mering in 1887. But it was quickly discarded {{in favour of}} phenacetin. “Rediscovered” in 1948, following the studies of Brodie and Axelrod (Brodie BB 1948.) and marketed in the 1950 s in the United States as an analgesic replacement for phenacetin, “condemned” for its nephrotoxicity. Unfounded concerns about paracetamol safety delayed its widespread acceptance until the 1970 s. From then on, paracetamol {{is one of the}} most popular and widely used drugs in the world for the treatment of pain and fever; probably the most commonly prescribed medicine in children. Paracetamol occupies a unique position among analgesic drugs, both for the type of pain relieved and for the side effects. So, for example, it is almost unanimously considered to be ineffective in inflammatory pain (unlike NSAIDs), as well as in intense pain or that arising from smooth muscle spasm in hollow viscera (unlike opiates); and it has no depressant effect on respiration (unlike opiates) and does not produce gastrointestinal damage or untoward cardiorenal effects (unlike NSAIDs). The peculiarity of effects and side effects of paracetamol should have suggested a peculiar mechanism of action for this drug. On the contrary, and curiously, surprising efforts have repeatedly been made in order to demonstrate that paracetamol shares the mechanism(s) of action of NSAIDs. Paracetamol would act as a pro-drug, the active metabolite (AM 404) being formed in the brain through the conjugation of the de-acetylated derivative of paracetamol (p-aminophenol) with arachidonic acid, by the action of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) ...|$|E
