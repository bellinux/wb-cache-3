50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> (Catocala nupta) is a moth of the Erebidae family.|$|R
60|$|The tree had fallen, {{though it}} was a windless night, and the lantern, stood upon the ground, had lit up the still green leaves and the dead beech leaves. It was a dry place. A toad was there. And the <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> had circled round the light and flashed and gone. The <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> had never come back, though Jacob had waited. It was after twelve when he crossed the lawn and saw his mother in the bright room, playing patience, sitting up.|$|R
5000|$|As the <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> moth takes off, {{the sudden}} flash of colour may confuse the attacker, {{and when it}} lands and {{immediately}} closes its wings it may seem to disappear as the colour is [...] "switched off". It is also thought that the symmetrical patterned orange sections on the rear wings form the illusion of another smaller creature (butterfly), so the attacker will go for the colourful [...] "small illusive" [...] rear safe region on {{the main body of}} this <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> moth species.|$|R
50|$|Catocala elocata, the French <b>red</b> <b>underwing,</b> is a moth of the Erebidae family. It {{is found}} in Central Europe, Southern Europe, North Africa, Anatolia, Uzbekistan, and Kazachstan.|$|R
50|$|The bald parrot is a medium-small, overall green parrot with a bald, brownish-orange head. As {{several other}} members of the genus Pyrilia, it has <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts that barely are visible when perched, but highly {{conspicuous}} in flight.|$|R
50|$|Issued on 22 October 1974 - out {{of print}} as of November 22, 1999.It came in an updated version in 1995 with {{additional}} security features.It features a self-portrait by Jens Juel and a <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> drawn by Ib Andersen.|$|R
5000|$|The English name {{derives from}} the bird's <b>red</b> <b>underwing.</b> It is not {{closely related to the}} red-winged blackbird, a North American species {{sometimes}} nicknamed [...] "redwing", which is an icterid, not a thrush. The binomial name {{derives from the}} Latin words turdus, [...] "thrush", and ile [...] "flank".|$|R
5|$|Some noctuid moths, such as {{the large}} <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> (Catocala nupta), are cryptic at rest, but display a flash of startlingly bright colours when disturbed. Others, such as many species of genus Speiredonia and Spirama, look {{threatening}} while at rest. Also saturniid moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia display snake heads, but not from the frontal position.|$|R
5|$|The most similar European thrush {{species is}} the redwing (T. iliacus), but that bird {{has a strong}} white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> in flight. The mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) is much larger and has white tail corners, and the Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis), {{although}} much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.|$|R
50|$|The blue-rumped parrot (Psittinus cyanurus) is {{a parrot}} {{found in the}} very {{southern}} tip of Myanmar, peninsular Thailand, Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra and nearby islands. It is a small parrot (18 cm) and is primarily green with bright <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts, a reddish shoulder patch, and yellowish margins on the wing coverts. It is sexually dimorphic. The female has a grey-brown head. The male has a black mantle, red upper mandible, and blue head and rump.|$|R
50|$|The pygmy lorikeet averages 13 cm {{in length}} (including tail) and 20 g in mass. It is the {{smallest}} of the lorikeets. The male has a dark purple rump and a streaked yellow breast, with red stripes under its wings. His tail is green tipped with yellow, and his eyes and beak are orange. The female lacks the <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> stripe of the male, and has a green (rather than purple) rump. Immature birds are similar to adults in appearance but lack yellow streaking on their breasts and have brown bills and eyes.|$|R
50|$|The rainbow lorikeet is a {{medium-sized}} parrot, with the length ranging from 25 to 30 cm, including the tail. The weight varies from 75 to(-) 157 g. The plumage of the nominate race, {{as with all}} subspecies, is very bright. The head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, {{and the rest of}} the upper parts (wings, back and tail) are deep green. The chest is red with blue-black barring. The belly is deep green, and the thighs and rump are yellow with deep green barring. In flight a yellow wing-bar contrasts clearly with the <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts.|$|R
40|$|In {{positive}} assortative mating, {{individuals of}} similar phenotype mate together {{more frequently than}} expected by chance. Assortative mating {{by a variety of}} qualities, including ornamentation, is well documented in birds. Studies of assortative mating by ornaments have focused on single, highly conspicuous ornaments, but many species of birds possess multiple ornaments in both sexes. We compared ornament expressions between mates of northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) to determine if assortative mating occurred by {{one or more of the}} four ornaments displayed by both sexes. All cardinals possess tall head crests and red-orange bills. In addition, males have black face masks and entirely red body plumage, whereas females have blackish face masks and <b>red</b> <b>underwing</b> coverts. We predicted that cardinals mate assortatively by plumage color because red plumage expression has been shown to indicate quality in both sexes. We found that cardinals mate assortatively by plumage and bill color, the two ornaments colored by carotenoid pigments, but not by mask expression or crest length. Whether this mating pattern arises by mutual mate choice or intrasexual selection is not known.

50|$|It is 20-24 cm {{long with}} a {{wingspan}} of 33-34.5 cm and a weight of 50-75 g. The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and with dark brown {{spots on the}} white underparts. The most striking identification features are the <b>red</b> flanks and <b>underwing,</b> and the creamy white stripe above the eye. Adults moult between June and September, which means that some start to replace their flight feathers while still feeding young.|$|R
50|$|The eclectus parrot {{is unusual}} in the parrot family for its marked visible light sexual {{dimorphism}} in the colours of the plumage. A stocky short-tailed parrot, it measures around 35 cm in length. The male is mostly bright green with a yellow-tinge on the head. It has blue primaries, and <b>red</b> flanks and <b>underwing</b> coverts. Its tail is edged with a narrow band of creamy yellow, and is dark grey edged with creamy yellow underneath, and the tail feathers are green centrally and more blue as they get towards the edges. The grand eclectus female is mostly bright red with a darker hue {{on the back and}} wings. The mantle and underwing coverts darken to a more purple in colour, and the wing is edged with a mauve-blue. The tail is edged with yellowish-orange above, and is more orange tipped with yellow underneath. The upper mandible of the adult male is orange at the base fading to a yellow towards the tip, and the lower mandible is black. The beak of the adult female is all black. Adults have yellow to orange irises and juveniles have dark brown to black irises. The upper mandible of both male and female juveniles are brown at the base fading to yellow towards the biting edges and the tip.|$|R
