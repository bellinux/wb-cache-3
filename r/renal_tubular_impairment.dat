In addition, we studied the sensitizing activity of cepharanthin, an MDR-overcoming agents, to vinblastine, adriamycin, epirubicin, cisplatin, mitomycin C and etoposide. Based on the results, we treated 6 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinomas (4 : bones, 2 : contralateral kidneys) by intraarterial injection of vinblastine and adriamycin (or epirubicin) in combination with cepharanthin.

40|$|Urinary beta 2 -glycoprotein- 1 was {{measured}} in 60 patients with conditions recognised as causing <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>impairment</b> and compared with established markers of early tubular malfunction. Increased beta 2 -glycoprotein- 1 excretion was found in 49 (82 %) of the subjects; raised excretion of alpha 1 -microglobulin, retinol-binding protein, and beta 2 -microglobulin was found in 46 (77 %), 45 (75 %), and 31 (52 %), respectively, and increased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in 32 of 54 of the subjects (59 %). The increase was particularly pronounced in those with proximal tubule malfunction, although considerable variation occurred. beta 2 -glycoprotein- 1 was shown to be stable in urine over the physiological pH range, and it is concluded that its measurement provides a means of detecting chronic malfunction of the renal tubules that is marginally more sensitive than assays of alpha 1 -microglobulin or retinol-binding protein, and more reliable than assays of beta 2 -microglobulin or N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hydronephrosis {{leads to}} {{deterioration}} of renal function. As urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (U-NAG) activity {{is considered a}} sensitive marker of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>impairment,</b> {{our aim was to}} measure U-NAG in children with hydronephrosis and to look for a relationship among selected clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 31 children (22 boys and 9 girls, mean age 2. 3 ± 2. 5 years) with hydronephrosis grade 1 - 4 that had U-NAG/creatinine ratio (U-NAG/Cr) measured. RESULTS: The U-NAG/Cr was significantly higher in patients with hydronephrosis compared to reference data (p = 0. 002). There was no difference in U-NAG/Cr between children with unilateral and bilateral hydronephrosis (p = 0. 51). There {{was no significant difference in}} U-NAG/Cr between children with grades 1 - 3 (pooled data) and grade 4, respectively (p = 0. 89). There was no correlation between U-NAG/Cr and the grade of hydronephrosis (r = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: U-NAG/Cr is increased in children with hydronephrosis grade 1 - 4, and there is no relationship with the grade of hydronephrosis. U-NAG is a useful marker of renal tubular dysfunction, however its relationship with the degree of kidney damage in patients with hydronephrosis should be considered as doubtful...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if the coadministration of methotrexate (MTX) and nonsteroidal antiinflanunatory drugs (NSAIDs) results in a clinically significant drug interaction. DATASOURCES: A case report of hematologic toxicity following the administration of MTX and flurbiprofen at our institution is presented. Six previously published case reports and five pharmacokinetic studies regarding MTX and NSAID interactions are available {{to assist in the}} evaluation of this potential interaction. DATASYNTHESIS:Cases of various clinical manifestations during concomitant MTX and NSAID administration, including acute renal failure and pancytopenia, have been reported. The exact mechanism of the interaction has not been fully elucidated. Suggested theories to explain the mechanism of MTX toxicity include reduction in MTX clearance secondary to renal capillary constriction induced by NSAIDs, displacement of MTX or its metabolite from plasma proteins, competition between MTX and NSAIDs for <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> excretion, or <b>impairment</b> of hepatic metabolism of MTX by NSAIDs. Studies comparing MTX pharmacokinetics with or without concurrent NSAID therapy have not shown statistical differences in the parameters evaluated. However, one study did demonstrate differences in the pharmacokinetics of 7 -hydroxy-methotrexate, the active metabolite of MTX, when MTX was administered with aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: Although a clinically significant interaction does not occur in all patients, numerous case reports are available that demonstrate possible problems following the coadministration of MTX and NSAIDs.

40|$|A 16 -year {{old girl}} {{presented}} with rapid onset of muscular weakness {{and a history}} of severe dysphagia, dysphonia and significant wasting. On examination, she was dystrophic (BMI 15. 7) and had signs of myopathy. Laboratory findings confirmed myopathy (CPK 106. 4 µkat/L (6384 IU/L), AST 2. 86 µkat/L (171. 6 IU/L), myoglobin 1582 µg/L). There was profound hypokalaemia (S-K 1. 8 mmol/L) suggesting hypokalaemic paralysis. Diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) was based on combination of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, severe hypokalaemia, high urinary pH and positive value of urinary anion gap. There was evidence of other signs of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>impairment</b> (urinary beta- 2 -microglobulin 213 mg/L, glomerulotubular proteinuria 1. 01 g/ 24 h). Autoimmune tests (rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, autoantibodies to Ro/SSA and La/SSB) together with symptoms of xerostomia with swallowing difficulties and atrophic glossitis suggested primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) as the underlying cause of dRTA. The renal biopsy confirmed chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis compatible with this diagnosis. Full recovery of muscle weakness and hypokalaemia and acidosis followed after potassium and alkali replacement therapy. Corticosteroids were administered with subsequent addition of cyclosporine A because of disease activity. In conclusion, primary SS is a rare diagnosis in childhood and adolescence and should be considered in patients presenting with hypokalaemic paralysis, as this might be due to dRTA, {{even in the absence of}} apparent sicca syndrome...|$|E

40|$|Previously we {{reported}} that the consecutive injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into LPS-sensitized mice for the generalized Shwartzman reaction (GSR) appeared to induce the injury of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells via apoptosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the mechanism of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell injury in GSR. The expression of Fas and Fas ligand was immunohistochemically detected on <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells from GSR-induced mice, although neither Fas nor Fas ligand was found in cells from untreated control mice or in cells from mice receiving a single injection of LPS. GSR-induced <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell injury was produced in neither Fas-negative MRL-lpr/lpr mice nor Fas ligand-negative MRL-gld/gld mice. The administration of anti-gamma interferon antibody together with a preparative injection of LPS prevented the expression of Fas and Fas ligand and the apoptosis of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. A provocative injection of tumor necrosis factor alpha into LPS-sensitized mice augmented Fas and Fas ligand expression and the apoptosis of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. The administration of tumor necrosis factor alpha to interleukin- 12 -sensitized mice resulted in Fas and Fas ligand expression and the apoptosis. Sensitization with interleukin- 12 together with anti-gamma interferon antibody did not cause the apoptosis of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells. It was suggested that the Fas/Fas ligand system probably plays a critical role in the development of <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell injury through apoptotic cell death...|$|R

40|$|The {{intracellular}} mechanisms underlying <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> {{epithelial cell}} proliferation and tubular repair following ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remain poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS 3), an unconventional receptor-independent regulator of heterotrimeric G-protein function, influences <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> regeneration following IRI. In rat kidneys exposed to IRI, {{there was a}} temporal induction in renal AGS 3 protein expression that peaked 72 h after reperfusion and corresponded to the repair and recovery phase following ischemic injury. Renal AGS 3 expression was localized predominantly to the recovering outer medullary proximal tubular cells and was highly coexpressed with Ki- 67, a marker of cell proliferation. Kidneys from mice deficient in the expression of AGS 3 exhibited impaired <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> recovery 7 d following IRI compared to wild-type AGS 3 -expressing mice. Mechanistically, genetic knockdown of endogenous AGS 3 mRNA and protein in <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cells reduced cell proliferation in vitro. Similar reductions in <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell proliferation were observed following incubation with gallein, a selective inhibitor of Gβγ subunit activity, and lentiviral overexpression of the carboxyl-terminus of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2 ct), a scavenger of Gβγ subunits. In summary, {{these data suggest that}} AGS 3 acts through a novel receptor-independent mechanism to facilitate <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> epithelial cell proliferation and <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> regeneration. —Regner, K.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 50 -year old male patient {{presenting}} with a combination of chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis related to a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorder. Laboratory studies revealed hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia with renal wastage and metabolic alkalosis, compatible with a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> transport disorder with similarities to Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome. Calcifications of the menisci and cartilage on X-rays of knee joints suggested chondrocalcinosis, which has been associated with Gitelman's syndrome. Radiologically suspected osteopenia was confirmed by a bone density scan that revealed osteoporosis of the vertebral column. An association of osteoporosis with hypercalciuria, which commonly occurs in Bartter's syndrome patients, has been reported. Upon treatment of the <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorder with spironolactone and a thiazide diuretic in combination with calcium and magnesium supplementation, the electrolyte abnormalities resolved and arthralgias disappeared. Our case demonstrates a <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> dysfunction with features of both Bartter's and Gitelman's syndrome along with concurrent chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis. Furthermore, the occurrence of osteoporosis in this relatively young patient, in the absence of other risk factors, demonstrates that <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorders should be suspected in presenile osteoporosis. Vice versa, since osteoporosis usually is asymptomatic before fracturing, patients with <b>renal</b> <b>tubular</b> disorders should be examined for osteoporosis...|$|R

Significant reduction in cytotoxicity after the addition of aggregated IgG suggested that the reaction was of the antibody-dependent cell-mediated type.
