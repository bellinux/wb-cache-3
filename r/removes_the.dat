5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> asthenospheric wedge.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} is then 'weeded' where the excess parts of <b>the</b> figures are <b>removed</b> from <b>the</b> release liner. It {{is possible to}} <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> positive parts, which would give a negative sticker, or <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> negative parts, giving a positive sticker. <b>Removing</b> <b>the</b> figure would be like <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> positive, giving a negative image of the figures.|$|R

5|$|During the trip, The Smoking Man tells Scully that he {{believes}} he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own life in his hands. Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment, where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else. The Smoking Man and Scully arrive {{at the home of}} Marjorie Butters (Louise Latham), a 118-year-old gardener who also has the chip implanted {{in the back of her}} neck. Meanwhile, Mulder visits Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to voice his concern, but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine. At a gas station, Scully <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> wire, places it in an envelope, and mails it to Mulder. However, a man following the two <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> letter from the mailbox.|$|E

5|$|In the Wii version, players {{control the}} game using the Wii Remote held sideways, {{and the game}} world is rotated by {{twisting}} the controller in various directions. The Nunchuk and Classic Controller are also compatible for alternate control schemes. This version also <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> restriction to only rotate in 90 degree intervals and offers three additional levels compared to the PC versions.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{aforementioned}} toxin-antitoxin systems, DarTG {{is a type}} II system where both the toxin and the antitoxin have enzymatic activity. The DarG antitoxin does not inhibit the DarT toxin, which modifies DNA by ADP-ribosylating specific sequence motifs, but instead <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> toxic modification caused by the toxin.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{redesigned}} MacBook {{line was}} launched on March 9, 2015. Available in silver, gold or space grey, it is thinner than the MacBook Air and <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> traditional MagSafe charging port (along {{with all other}} ports, except the headphone jack) {{in favor of the}} multi-purpose USB-C port. It also features a Retina display. On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option.|$|E
5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E

5|$|In this falling block puzzle game, the player's {{objective}} is to destroy the viruses populating the on-screen playing field by using colored capsules that are tossed into the field by Mario, who assumes {{the role of a}} doctor. The player manipulates each capsule as it falls, with the goal being to align similar colors which <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> viruses. The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each level.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E
5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "laparoscopic-assisted supracervical hysterectomy" [...] (LASH) {{was later}} {{developed}} to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> uterus without <b>removing</b> <b>the</b> cervix using a morcellator which cuts the uterus {{into small pieces}} that can be <b>removed</b> from <b>the</b> abdominal cavity via the laparoscopic ports.|$|R

The National Park Service attempted to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> paint with paint stripper, which failed. It then tried arsenic in 2005, which not only failed to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> paint but also left purple streaks on the granite. Art restorer Gordon Ponsford said he would use a laser to <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> paint. However, the laser did not <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> arsenic stain.|$|R

Lou leads a strike when wages are ordered to be cut by 10%, but the strikers return to work on the verge of starvation. Lou, who resists, is saved by Hal who assumes control, restores the wages and <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> previous manager.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|When {{they wake}} up in the hospital, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are told that Black has been sentenced to receive the Dementor's kiss, which <b>removes</b> <b>the</b> soul of the recipient. Dumbledore advises Hermione and Harry to use Hermione's time-turner, a device she has been using to double-up on classes; this permits them to go back in time and save Buckbeak, who carries Black away to safety.|$|E
