40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} Mexico as importer, manufacturer, producer and distributor centre of <b>reptile</b> <b>skins</b> from non-native and native species, {{through a combination of}} documentary research and survey methods. A number of key findings were derived from this study. Although Mexico has adopted the "System for the Conservation, Management and Sustainable Use of Wildlife" (SUMA), the country still relies on <b>reptile</b> <b>skins</b> from non-native species. In contrast, the smaller numbers of skins used from native species mainly derive from captive breeding schemes that although biologically sustainable, provide no incentive for habitat conservation. Sustainable use of <b>reptile</b> <b>skins</b> from native species could positively encourage conservation in Mexico. However, as a megadiverse country with potential to produce wildlife, Mexico will have to implement an appropriate regulatory framework to support local communities to promote the sustainable use of native species. ...|$|R

50|$|Even {{though this}} thick forest {{is hard to}} {{penetrate}} about 35% of the mangrove forests have {{been lost in the}} past two decades. These losses exceed those for tropical rain forests and coral reefs. Mangrove trees grow on a narrow strip between land and ocean in river systems, between the latitudes 25 degrees N and 30 degrees S, and the constant renewal of the trees relies on rivers bringing nutrients to the coast in regular seasonal patterns. The limited distribution of this ecosystem adds to the delicacy of it. Many global changes such as an increased rise in sea water is largely thought to be responsible for the destruction of these mangrove forests. A few other factors such as mariculture, agriculture, and urbanization have also contributed to the recent loss of mangrove habitats. Mangroves provide humans with shrimp, fish, honey, lumber, and <b>reptile</b> <b>skins.</b> Without this tropical habitat, many of these products would be reduced in our market.|$|R

40|$|As {{wildlife}} trafficking or {{the illegal}} wildlife trade {{has taken a}} more prominent place on the global agenda, discussions are taking place as to how wildlife trafficking happens. An increased understanding has revealed that corruption is a key facilitator of this profitable and pervasive global black market, but limited research has explored exactly what that corruption looks like and how corruption enables wildlife to be trafficked. Furthermore, research shows that Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia, are focal points for the supply and demand of certain species of wildlife. Through a literature-based investigation, this paper unpacks the role specific acts of corruption play in the trafficking of ivory, <b>reptile</b> <b>skins</b> and live <b>reptiles</b> from, through or to Asia. It is proposed that not only do individual corrupt acts enable wildlife trafficking to happen, but also that corrupted structures (the criminal justice system, and economic and political foundations) in some societies enable trafficking to happen and also increase the resilience of trafficking to reduction measures. In collating detailed data about the forms of corruption facilitating wildlife trafficking, the gaps in knowledge, and therefore the important areas for further research, become evident...|$|R

40|$|WC/Co {{cemented}} carbide {{is a composite}} material for highly demanding wear applications. The unique combination of hardness (from the WC-phase) and toughness (from the binder Co) gives a material especially suitable for rock drilling. This thesis, investigates the deterioration and wear of these {{cemented carbide}} buttons and the correlation to different rock types. To better {{understand the nature of}} the wear of the cemented carbide buttons, the counter surface â€“the rock- has also been studied. A range of important rock types has been investigated with respect to hardness distribution and scratch response in a micro scale and friction properties when slid against cemented carbides. The cemented carbide may deteriorate due to a number of mechanisms. The effect of fatigue in the structure was studied in TEM and particle erosion response was used to probe the corresponding mechanical degradation. Further, homing cross sectioning has been developed and used as a new technique to investigate the presence of weak zones in the surface layer of a drill button. It was found that rock penetration into this layer is a very common mechanism, with profound implications for the nature of the wear. High resolution scanning electron microscopy has been extensively used to map the deterioration and wear of numerous drill buttons, worn against different rock types in different kinds of drilling applications. Finally, the collected data on the surface damage, the <b>reptile</b> <b>skin</b> formation, the rock intrusion and the properties of the rock are assembled into a new view of the deterioration and wear of cemented carbide in rock drilling...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{perspective}} is to highlight the merit of the reptile integument as an experimental model. Reptiles represent the first amniotes. From stem reptiles, extant reptiles, birds and mammals have evolved. Mammal hairs and feathers evolved from Therapsid and Sauropsid reptiles, respectively. The early reptilian integument had {{to adapt to the}} challenges of terrestrial life, developing a multi-layered stratum corneum capable of barrier function and ultraviolet protection. For better mechanical protection, diverse reptilian scale types have evolved. The evolution of endothermy has driven the convergent evolution of hair and feather follicles: both form multiple localized growth units with stem cells and transient amplifying cells protected in the proximal follicle. This topological arrangement allows them to elongate, molt and regenerate without structural constraints. Another unique feature of <b>reptile</b> <b>skin</b> is the exquisite arrangement of scales and pigment patterns, making them testable models for mechanisms of pattern formation. Since they face the constant threat of damage on land, different strategies were developed to accommodate skin homeostasis and regeneration. Temporally, they can be under continuous renewal or sloughing cycles. Spatially, they can be diffuse or form discrete localized growth units (follicles). To understand how gene regulatory networks evolved to produce increasingly complex ectodermal organs, we have to study how prototypic scale-forming pathways in reptiles are modulated to produce appendage novelties. Despite {{the fact that there are}} numerous studies of reptile scales, molecular analyses have lagged behind. Here, we underscore how further development of this novel experimental model will be valuable in filling the gaps of our understanding of the Evo-Devo of amniote integuments...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} in summer 1999 {{of the first}} animal inclusions in amber, the Albian -Cenomanian deposits of the Charentes region (SW France) have yielded rich and diverse assemblages of continental organisms. Four major groups have been studied in detail: (1) plants, (2) arthropods in amber (3) microorganisms in amber, and (4) vertebrates. Main palaeobotanical discoveries come from two quarries in the localities of Archingeay-Les Nouillers, where exceptionally preserved leaf cuticles have been found, and Puy-Puy, at Tonnay-Charente, which is especially rich in angiosperm impressions (more than 20 species identified). Three Uppermost Albian and six Lowermost Cenomanian sites have produced large amounts of amber, from which numerous insects and other arthropods have been described, such as various primitive ants or the oldest mole cricket and mecysmaucheniid spider. In association to the arthropods, Charentes amber provides infrequent inclusions such as <b>reptile</b> <b>skin,</b> dinosaur feathers and mammal hairs, or marine plankton including diatoms, dinoflagellate cysts, foraminifers or larval echinoderm spines. Charentes amber is generally dark and opaque {{and the use of}} Synchrotron imaging allows 3 D reconstruction of arthropods that could not be observed by classic optical methods. Finally, most of the Cenomanian paralic deposits that contain plant fossils and amber have also yielded rich microassemblages of vertebrates, among which numerous fish and selacian teeth as well as remains of dinosaurs (carcharodontosaurids, troodontids, iguanodontids, [...] .), pterosaurs (ornitocheirids) and marsupial (?) mammals. The exceptional richness and diversity of these deposits allow for interpretation of the mid- Cretaceous terrestrial palaeoenvironment of Charentes as a coastal forest dominated by Araucariaceae and Cheirolepidiaceae, while angiosperms become more abundant toward the continent, in an insular context favourable to endemism and vertebrate dwarfism...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} market for luxury goods has almost doubled since 1990, with a worldwide increase of 10 % annually. This trade is fuelled {{by a great}} deal of legally and illegally exploited wildlife species, putting enormous pressure on many of them, with potentially irreversible consequences. The dramatic decline of sturgeon populations exploited for their caviar, is a good example: all 27 species are threatened and the most coveted {{are on the verge of}} extinction. We aim to identify the mechanism responsible for the continued overexploitation of sturgeon species, despite caviar&#x 27;s ever-increasing price and the imminent loss of these species. Here, we demonstrate consumer preference for rarity over intrinsic quality: customers tasting two caviar samples more often chose the one they thought was rare, although both were identical. In a game theory model, we demonstrate that the most rational behaviour is to rush to consume rare species, even though this precipitates their extinction. We conclude that the human predisposition to place exaggerated value on rarity probably drives the entire market for luxury goods from <b>reptile</b> <b>skins</b> to exotic woods. Our findings suggest that allowing low levels of legal trade will exacerbate the arbitrary value of rare species and thereby stimulate demand. Only a total ban on trade from the wild (with very strict controls) combined with strong support for farmed equivalents will protect rare species...|$|R

The numbers counted off the Fibonacci progression, the mathematical formula (named for the Italian monk and mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci who discovered it) for growth patterns {{found in many}} forms of life, including leaves, snail shells, pine cones and <b>reptile</b> <b>skins.</b> The pattern is identifiable as a sequence of numbers in which any given number {{is the sum of}} the two numbers that precede it: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc., ad infinitum. From 1969 Merz employed the Fibonacci sequence in performances and installations throughout his career to represent the universal principles of creation and growth: climbing up the Guggenheim Museum in New York (1971) or the spire of a Turin landmark (1984), or perched in neon on a stack of newspapers among the old masters of Naples' Capodimonte Gallery (1987). In 1972 he illustrated the Fibonacci progression with a series of photographs of a factory workers' lunchroom and a restaurant progressively crowded with diners. His 1973 show at the John Weber Gallery in New York expressed the Fibonacci in a series of low modular tables. In 1990 the sequence determined the form of a spiral assembled from sticks, iron and paper across 24 meters of a hall in Prato, near Florence. An installation of Fibonacci numbers by Merz is the landmark of the Centre for International Light Art in Unna, Germany.|$|R
