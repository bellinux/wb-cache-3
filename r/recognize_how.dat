5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
25|$|Counselors help {{individuals}} identifying {{behaviors and}} {{problems related to}} their addiction. It can be done on an individual basis, but it's more common to find it in a group setting and can include crisis counseling, weekly or daily counseling, and drop-in counseling supports. They are trained to develop recovery programs that help to reestablish healthy behaviors and provide coping strategies whenever a situation of risk happens. It's very common to see them work also with family members who {{are affected by the}} addictions of the individual, or in a community to prevent addiction and educate the public. Counselors should be able to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> addiction affects the whole person and those around him or her.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{activity}} {{along the}} North Coast of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska {{is characterized by}} transform movements of the Queen Charlotte Fault, a plate boundary where the Pacific Plate skids by the North American Plate. As the Pacific Plate moves northward to the Aleutian subduction zone, it generates rifting in the North American continent. Magma rises along cracks created by the rifting, and eventually erupts on the surface to form a volcano. This geological process has, over time, created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, {{which is the most}} volcanically active area in Canada. However, most of the volcanoes have not been directly dated or have not been dated in sufficient detail to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> active they are, making the prediction of volcanic events difficult and volcanic hazards uncertain.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{live action}} was a {{stepping}} stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make John Carter of Mars his next project. Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make {{the rest of the}} film look even more realistic. Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then {{would not have been able}} to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> serious their devolution was. Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because [...] "e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of." [...] The CEO says [...] "stay the course", which Stanton used because he thought it was funny. Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots.|$|E
2500|$|Toupées have a {{long and}} often humorous history in Western culture. [...] The toupée is a regular butt of jokes in many media, with a typical toupée joke {{focusing}} on the wearer's inability to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> ineffective the toupée is in concealing his baldness. [...] An early instance of [...] "toupée humor" [...] was an illustration by George Cruikshank in [...] "The Comic Almanack" [...] in 1837, in which he drew {{the effect of a}} strong wind, with a man's toupée whipped from his head.|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{viewers of}} films with aestheticized violence, such as John Woo's movies, {{she claims that}} [...] "One of the many pleasures" [...] from {{watching}} Woo's films, such as Hard Target is that it gets viewers to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> Woo plays with conventions [...] "from other Woo films" [...] and how it [...] "connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as [...] "Hard Target, True Romance and Tombstone are [...] with... signs" [...] and indicators, so that [...] "the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive" [...] of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt also {{recognised}} that, at his best, Scott conveyed his characters' {{traits and}} beliefs impartially, setting aside {{his own political}} bias. Having faithfully and disinterestedly described [...] "nature" [...] in all its detail was in itself a praiseworthy accomplishment. [...] "It is impossible", writes Hazlitt, [...] "to say how fine his writings in consequence are, unless we could describe how fine nature is." [...] Kinnaird also notes Hazlitt's psychologically acute observation of how Scott, in taking us back to our more primitive past, recognised [...] "the role of the repressed unconscious self in shaping modern literary imagination." [...] He sees Hazlitt, too, in The Spirit of the Age along with some other essays, as the first to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> Scott traced the action of historical forces through individual characters.|$|E
2500|$|Extraterritoriality. Robert Stack of the IRS {{said that}} {{extraterritoriality}} was incorrect (a myth): [...] "FATCA has received considerable international support because most foreign governments <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> effective FATCA, {{and in particular}} our intergovernmental approach, will be in detecting and combating tax evaders". [...] The legislation enables US authorities to impose regulatory costs, and potentially penalties, on FFIs who otherwise have few if any dealings with the US. [...] The U.S. has sought to ameliorate that criticism by offering reciprocity to potential countries who sign intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), {{but the idea of}} the US Government providing information on its citizens to foreign governments has also proved controversial. [...] The law's interference in the relationship between individual Americans or dual nationals and non-American banks led Georges Ugeux to term it [...] "bullying and selfish." [...] The Economist called FATCA's [...] "extraterritoriality stunning even by Washington's standards." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 6, 2012, Judge Barbara Jones {{ruled that}} based on {{rational}} basis review Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional and ordered the requested tax refund be paid to Windsor. The plaintiff commented, [...] "It's thrilling to have a court finally <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> unfair {{it is for the}} government to have treated us as though we were strangers." [...] Windsor's attorneys filed a petition of certiorari with the Supreme Court on July 16, asking for the case to be considered without waiting for the Second Circuit's review. On October 18, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling that Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional.

2500|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{this is a}} much-disputed area. Much {{has been}} made—particularly by Calvin Hoffman—of so-called [...] "parallelisms" [...] between the two authors. For example, when Marlowe's [...] "Jew of Malta", Barabas, sees Abigail on a balcony above him, he says But stay! What star shines yonder in the east? The lodestar of my life, if Abigail! Most people would immediately <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> similar this is to Romeo's famous But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! when she appears on the balcony above. There are many such examples, {{but the problem with}} using them as an argument is that it really is not possible to be sure whether they happened because they were by the same author, or because they were—whether consciously or unconsciously—simply copied by Shakespeare from Marlowe. It is worth noting, however, that Marlowe is the only contemporary dramatist from whom Shakespeare appears to 'copy' so much, and that the influence Marlowe had on Shakespeare is universally acknowledged.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when we fail to <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is surely}} {{something}} more than that," [...] said he; [...] "some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind back {{to some of those}} narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering public, you will <b>recognize</b> <b>how</b> often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal. Think of that little affair of the red-headed men. That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery. Or, again, there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert." ...|$|E

He that can discern the loveliness of things, we call him Poet! Painter, Man of Genius, gifted, lovable. These poor Sabeans did even what he does,--in their own fashion.

No one but a madman would shout instructions or warnings to a person performing a dangerous feat requiring coolness and presence of mind. Such, I take it, is the scheme, whatever it is, in which she is engaged; and as you are the only one who knows what that scheme is, I must, however reluctantly, abide by your decision.
