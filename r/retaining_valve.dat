40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} intraoperative hemodynamic parameters that predict early failure of infragenicular vein grafts with intraoperative completion duplex ultrasound scan. Methods: We reviewed the results of intraoperative duplex scans that were selectively performed after completion of 45 tibial/pedal vein bypass grafts at high risk for failure. Bypass was performed for rest pain (39 %) or tissue loss (61 %), and 60 % of the cases were disadvantaged because of compromised vein quality or poor arterial outflow. A 10 -MHz low-profile transducer was used to scan the entire graft at bypass completion. All grafts were determined to be technically adequate (absence of <b>retained</b> <b>valves,</b> arteriovenous fistulas, or localized velocity increases and the presence of bypass-dependent distal pulses). Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were also measured at each anastomosis, in the outflow artery and in the proximal and distal portions of each graft. Resistive indices (RI) were calculated at each measurement point (PSV-EDV/PSV). Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t test, χ 2 test, and multivariate analyses. Results: Twenty infragenicular vein bypass grafts (44 %) thrombosed within 12 months. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters were significantly different between grafts that remained patent or thrombosed. EDV was lower (5 ± 1 cm/s versus 13 ± 3 cm/s; P =. 02) and RI was higher (0. 90 versus 0. 81; P <. 01) in the proximal portions of grafts that thrombosed within 12 months. Distal EDV was also lower (6 ± 1 cm/s versus 15 ± 2 cm/s; P <. 01) and distal RI was higher (0. 89 versus 0. 78; P <. 01) in grafts that thrombosed. With multivariate analysis, only low distal EDV was predictive of early graft failure (P <. 05). Distal bypass EDV of less than 8 cm/s predicated early graft thrombosis with 76 % sensitivity and 75 % specificity (positive predictive value, 71 %; negative predictive value, 78 %). Absence of diastolic flow (EDV of 0 cm/s) predicted early graft failure with 100 % specificity and 100 % positive predictive value. Conclusion: In this initial experience, low EDV measured with intraoperative duplex scan was associated with early thrombosis of tibial level vein grafts. When such values are observed, measures should be taken to improve graft hemodynamic parameters. Prospective study of infragenicular vein bypass grafts may better define hemodynamic parameters predictive of early graft thrombosis. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 975 - 81. ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{juvenile}} sheep functional valve chronic implant calcification {{model was}} used to compare long-term calcification rates, functional performance, and durability for 3 types of right ventricular outflow tract implants: classically cryopreserved homografts and 2 decellularized pulmonary valved conduits. MethodsFifteen juvenile sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 3 study arms and underwent pulmonary valve replacement. The arms included the following: (1) cryopreserved ovine pulmonary valves; (2) cryopreserved, decellularized, saline (1 °C– 10 °C) –stored ovine pulmonary valves; and (3) cryopreserved, decellularized, glycerolized (− 80 °C) stored ovine pulmonary valves. Animal growth, serial echocardiographic results (with valve performance assessment), dimensions, and tissue-specific calcification measurements were compared with pre-explant angiographic analysis and right ventricular outflow tract pressure measurements, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, specimen radiographic analysis, gross explant pathology, and histopathology. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis were performed. ResultsAll but 2 study animals receiving implants thrived postoperatively, with similar growth rates, explant valve dimensions, ventricular functions, cardiac output, and indices during the study. As determined by means of echocardiographic analysis, 3 animals in arm 1 (and one in arm 2) had leaflet dysfunction. Valve regurgitation was recognized in 1 survivor each from both arms 1 and 2. Although 1 arm 1 animal died with calcified subacute bacterial endocarditis, and the other 4 had leaflet and conduit wall calcification by the time of death, no arm 2 or arm 3 animals demonstrated leaflet calcium, and no arm 3 and only 1 arm 2 animals had calcium in the conduit wall over the entire year, as determined with any measurement method. All cryopreserved conduit walls had calcium by 20 weeks, whereas only 1 of 10 decellularized conduits (arms 2 plus 3) had wall calcium. ConclusionCryopreserved–decellularized–glycerolized <b>valves</b> <b>retained</b> normal <b>valve</b> function, with absent leaflet and minimal wall calcifications 1 year postoperatively, as opposed to classically cryopreserved allografts.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} if intraoperative distal graft end-diastolic velocity (EDV) using completion duplex ultrasound (CDU) predicts patency of crural bypass {{in patients with}} critical limb ischemia (CLI). MethodsRecords of 116 non-consecutive patients who underwent crural revascularization with vein conduit and CDU between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed. Bypass grafts were performed for rest pain (34 %) or tissue loss (66 %), while 56 % of the reported cases were categorized as “disadvantaged” because of compromised vein quality or diseased arterial outflow. A 10 -MHz low-profile transducer was used to image the entire bypass at case completion. Technical adequacy of the grafts was verified by absence of <b>retained</b> <b>valves,</b> arteriovenous fistulas, or localized velocity increases and presence of bypass-dependent distal pulses. Modified Rutherford scores were calculated as surrogate markers of runoff resistance and compared to distal graft EDV. The primary study end point was graft patency during a 1 -year posttreatment period. Patency rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier life table methodology and compared using the log-rank test. Predictors of graft patency were determined by Cox proportional hazards. ResultsPrimary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency for all crural bypasses were 62 %, 66 %, and 70 % at 1 year, respectively. When stratified by tertiles of distal graft EDV (0 - 15 cm/s), 1 -year primary patency rates were 32 %, 64 %, and 84 % (P =. 001). Low (0 - < 5 cm/s) distal graft EDV (hazard ratio [HR], 3. 3 confidence interval [CI], 1. 74 - 6. 41; P <. 001), poor-quality conduit (HR, 2. 5; CI, 1. 19 - 5. 21; P =. 016), age < 70 (HR, 2. 08; CI, 1. 06 - 4. 00; P =. 031), and lack of statin use (HR, 2. 04; CI, 1. 04 - 4. 00; P =. 038) were independent predictors of graft failure. While the modified Rutherford score correlated with distal graft EDV (P =. 05), {{it was not an}} independent predictor of patency (P =. 58). Predictors of low EDV (< 5 cm/s) included single-vessel runoff (odds ratio [OR], 3. 33; CI, 1. 14 - 9. 71; P =. 027), poor conduit (OR, 2. 94; CI, 1. 16 - 7. 41; P = 0. 024), and diabetes (OR, 2. 86; CI, 1. 14 - 7. 21; P =. 025). ConclusionsDistal graft EDV predicts crural vein graft patency in patients with CLI. Grafts with EDV < 5 cm/s remain at high risk for early failure. The impacts on patency of statins, age, and poor-quality conduit are, again, confirmed. These results highlight the value of EDV using intraoperative CDU for anticipating and, possibly, improving results of open crural revascularization...|$|R

40|$|Intraoperative {{two-dimensional}} contrast echocardiography {{was performed}} on 29 patients undergoing open heart surgery to determine the presence of mitral regurgitation before and immediately after the operative procedure: 14 patients had predominant mitral stenosis, 9 had severe mitral regurgitation and 6 had no mitral valve disease (control subjects). Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed by applying a 5 MHz transducer directly on the heart during injection of saline solution through an apical ventricular sump or transseptal needle, generating contrast microbubbles, with imaging in two planes. Baseline studies were performed after thoracotomy and pericardiotomy before cardiopulmonary bypass, and a second study was done after the operative procedure, with the patient off cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamic stabilization before chest closure. No control subject had contrast evidence of mitral regurgitation before or after cardiopulmonary bypass. Two of three patients with mitral valvuloplasty and two of five with commissurotomy required a second operative procedure before chest closure because of persistent mitral regurgitation detected by intraoperative two-dimensional contrast echocardiography. Thirteen of the 15 patients with valve replacement had no mitral regurgitation after cardiopulmonary bypass. Intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiographic findings correlated with data from postoperative clinical examinations and two-dimensional echocardiography-Doppler studies. It is concluded that two-dimensional echocardiography with contrast is an important intraoperative tool for assessing the presence and relative severity of mitral regurgitation after mitral commissurotomy, valvuloplasty or valve replacement.

50|$|The {{complicated}} cylinder castings, {{which involved}} tortuous narrow steam passages to provide inside admission for the inside cylinders and outside admission for the outside cylinders, resulted in poor steam flow; this, together with leakages around the piston valves, {{led to a}} high coal consumption which became particularly apparent once the locomotives were being used on trains out of King's Cross. Nigel Gresley, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the LNER, decided to fit poppet valves, but instead of operating these by Lentz valve gear, {{as he had done}} with some of his other poppet valve fitments (such as Class B12), Gresley chose to use Caprotti valve gear. This was driven from the driving axle by a longitudinal shaft along the centre of the locomotive to a transverse shaft above the cylinders. No. 6168 Lord Stuart of Wortley was modified in September 1929, followed by no. 6166 in December. In December 1929, class B3 was subdivided into two parts, and the locomotives modified with Caprotti valve gear were given the classification B3/2, and the unmodified locomotives became B3/1. On test, they showed a 16% reduction in coal consumption, and as a result, a further two more were modified to B3/2 - no. 6167 in June 1938, and no. 6164 Earl Beatty in June 1939. These used steam to close the valves, instead of the springs fitted to nos. 6166/8.

40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate a newly developed biologic valved conduit fixed with genipin used to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract in a canine model. Methods: Fresh bovine jugular veins with a <b>retained</b> native <b>valve</b> procured from a slaughterhouse were used as raw materials to fabricate the valved conduits. A naturally occurring crosslinking agent, genipin, was used to fix the procured jugular veins. The glutaraldehyde-fixed counterpart was used as a control. A canine model was used in the study. Results: Echocardiography revealed that the motion of the valvular leaflets in both the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed conduits was satisfactory. The transvalvular pressure gradients of both studied groups were minimal. No endothelium-like cells were observed on the luminal surface of the conduit and the valvular leaflet for the glutaraldehyde-fixed group throughout the entire course of the study. In contrast, endothelium-like cells were observed on the entire surface of the genipin-fixed valved conduit retrieved at 6 months postoperatively in all the cases studied. There was no evidence of luminal fibrous peel in any the valved conduits studied. Degradation of valvular leaflet in one of the glutaraldehyde-fixed conduits was observed. In this particular case, thrombus formation was also observed {{on the surface of the}} valvular leaflet. On the other hand, no apparent degradation or thrombus formation was observed on the surfaces of the genipin-fixed valvular leaflet and conduit. A significantly more severe inflammatory reaction was observed for the glutaraldehyde-fixed conduit than for its genipin-fixed counterpart throughout the entire course of the study. The calcium contents of the samples before implantation and those retrieved at distinct implantation duration were minimal for both the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed tissues. Conclusion: Although further studies are necessary, the genipin-fixed valved conduit appears to have great potential in helping mitigate the complications observed in the commercially available conduits...|$|R

DotA-Allstars, LLC was eventually acquired by Blizzard to start development of Blizzard All-Stars. Blizzard took over the trademark challenge. The United States Patent & Trademark Office initially ruled in Valve's favor. By this point, Riot Games had hired Guinsoo to help develop their own MOBA, League of Legends. As with IceFrog, Feak transferred his rights to the Dota property to Riot, who in turn sold those to Blizzard. Blizzard {{filed a lawsuit against}} Valve to challenge Valve's ownership, pitting the rights assigned through IceFrog to Guinsoo at odds. The case Blizzard Entertainment v. Valve Corporation was settled out of court in May 2012; <b>Valve</b> <b>retained</b> the right to use Dota commercially, while Blizzard reserved the right for fans to use Dota non-commercially. Blizzard changed the names of its own projects to remove the Dota term, and renamed Blizzard All-Stars as Heroes of the Storm. Valve's Dota 2 was released in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|In {{accordance}} with its Acceptable Use Policy, <b>Valve</b> <b>retains</b> {{the right to}} block and unblock customers' access to their games and Steam services when Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC) software determines that the user is cheating in multiplayer games, selling accounts to others or trading games to exploit regional price differences. Blocking such users initially removed access {{to his or her}} other games, leading to some users with high-value accounts losing access because of minor infractions of the AUP. Valve later changed its policy to be similar to that of Electronic Arts' Origin platform, in which blocked users can still access their games but are heavily restricted, limited to playing in offline mode and unable to participate in Steam Community features. Customers also lose access to their games and Steam account if they refuse to accept changes to Steam's end user license agreements; this occurred in August 2012. In April 2015, Valve added Game Bans to its service, allowing developers to set bans on players for their games but enacted and enforced at the Steam level, allowing developers to police their own gaming communities in customizable manner.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the feasibility {{and the effectiveness}} of ileoileostomy in the region adjacent to the ileocecal <b>valve,</b> which can <b>retain</b> the ileocecal <b>valve</b> in infants. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 48 patients who underwent ileoileostomy in the region adjacent to the ileocecal valve (group 1) and 34 patients who underwent ileocecal resections and ileotransversanastomosis (group 2). Patients were monitored for the time to flatus, resumption of eating, length of hospital stay after surgery, serum total bile acid, vitamin B 12 and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The time to flatus, time until resumption of eating and post-operative length of hospital stay showed no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups. Serum total bile acid and vitamin B 12 were not significantly different between the two groups at post-operative day 1 and day 3, but were significantly decreased at 1 wk after operation in group 2. None of the patients died or suffered from stomal leak in these two groups. However, the incidence of diarrhea, intestinal infection, disturbance of acid-base balance and water-electrolytes in group 1 was lower than in group 2. CONCLUSION: Ileoileostomy in the region adjacent to the ileocecal valve is safe and results in fewer complications than ileotransversanastomosis in infants...|$|R
