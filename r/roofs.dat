5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green <b>roofs.</b> Green <b>roofs</b> are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living <b>roofs,</b> light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light <b>roofs,</b> and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of ash, whether it is wet or dry, the roof and building design and how much ash gets inside a building. The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%. Problems associated with ash loading are {{similar to that of}} snow; however, ash is more severe as 1) the load from ash is generally much greater, 2) ash does not melt and 3) ash can clog and damage gutters, especially after rain fall. Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction, including roof slope, construction materials, roof span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building. Generally flat <b>roofs</b> are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched <b>roofs.</b> <b>Roofs</b> made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed ash than <b>roofs</b> made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of <b>roofs</b> from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.|$|E

5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France.

Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep <b>roofs</b> which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical <b>roofs,</b> pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features.

5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung.

The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate <b>roofs</b> to Chamba, <b>roofs</b> were covered with planks, coated in clay.

40|$|<b>Roof</b> bolting is {{the most}} popular method for {{underground}} openings in the mining industry, especially in the bedded deposits such as coal. In fact, all U. S. underground coal mine entries are roof-bolted as required by law. However, <b>roof</b> falls still occur frequently in the <b>roof</b> bolted entries. The two possible reasons are: the lack of knowledge of and technology to detect the <b>roof</b> geological conditions in advance of mining, and lack of <b>roof</b> bolting design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> bolting systems. This research is to develop a method for predicting the <b>roof</b> geology and stability condition in real time during <b>roof</b> bolting operation. Based on this information, <b>roof</b> bolting design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> bolting systems will be developed for implementation in real time. For the prediction of <b>roof</b> geology and stability condition in real time, a micro processor was used and a program developed to monitor and record the drilling parameters of <b>roof</b> bolter. These parameters include feed pressure, feed flow (penetration rate), rotation pressure, rotation rate, vacuum pressure, oil temperature of hydraulic circuit, and signals for controlling machine. From the results of a series of laboratory and underground tests so far, feed pressure is found to be a good indicator for identifying the voids/fractures and estimating the <b>roof</b> rock strength. The method for determining quantitatively the location and the size of void/fracture and estimating the <b>roof</b> rock strength from the drilling parameters of <b>roof</b> bolter was developed. Also, a set of computational rules has been developed for in-mine <b>roof</b> using measured <b>roof</b> drilling parameters and implemented in MRGIS (Mine <b>Roof</b> Geology Information System), a software package developed to allow mine engineers {{to make use of the}} large amount of <b>roof</b> drilling parameters for predicting <b>roof</b> geology properties automatically. For the development of <b>roof</b> bolting criteria, finite element models were developed for tensioned and fully grouted bolting designs. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the mechanisms of modern <b>roof</b> bolting systems including both the tension and fully grouted bolts. Parameters to be studied are: bolt length, bolt spacing, bolt size/strength, grout annulus, in-situ stress condition, overburden depth, and <b>roof</b> geology (massive strata, fractured, and laminated or thinly-bedded). Based on the analysis of the mechanisms of both bolting systems and failure modes of the bolted strata, <b>roof</b> bolting design criteria and programs for modern <b>roof</b> bolting systems were developed. These criterion and/or programs were combined with the MRGIS for use in conjunction with <b>roof</b> bolt installation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: During an {{investigation}} on thin steel <b>roof</b> claddings under simulated cyclonic wind loading, {{it was found}} that trapezoidal <b>roof</b> claddings behaved quite differently to corrugated (arc and tangent type) <b>roof</b> claddings due to the presence of overload cycles. The overload cycles caused a reduction in fatigue life for corrugated <b>roofing</b> whereas the reverse occurred for trapezoidal <b>roofing.</b> This contrasting behaviour of the two crest-fixed <b>roof</b> claddings was investigated using small scale <b>roofing</b> models instead of the commonly used large scale two-span <b>roof</b> claddings. It was found that overload cycles formed a weaker locally dimpled mechanism around the fastener holes of corrugated <b>roofing</b> and thus accelerated the fatigue-caused pull-through failure. In contrast a stronger deformed shape was formed in trapezoidal <b>roofing</b> which delayed the pull-through failure. Both laboratory testing and finite element analysis of small scale models were used to study the contrasting behaviour of <b>roof</b> claddings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} non-stationary {{behavior}} of a <b>roof</b> drainage during experimental measurement in the climate simulator. Many buildings use a fully or partially flat <b>roof</b> where {{it is necessary to}} use the <b>roof</b> drainage. Thermal behavior of <b>roof</b> drainage is very important {{from the point of view}} of heat transfer and potential condensation. The placement of a <b>roof</b> drain slightly deteriorates thermal transmittance of the <b>roof.</b> This experiment evaluates <b>roof</b> drains in the specific climate simulator where thermal conditions were dynamically controlled in the specific temperature range. The measurement was performed for two types of <b>roof</b> drains. The first drainage is a simple single-shell and the second is double-shell drainage. The results show the effect on the thermal transmittance of the <b>roof</b> section and also the minimal effect of condensation on the non-insulation part of the drainage. Both <b>roof</b> drains showed minimal deterioration of thermal transmittance of the <b>roof</b> construction...|$|R
