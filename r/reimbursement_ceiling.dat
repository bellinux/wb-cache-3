40|$|In my dissertation, I aim to {{understand}} incentives in U. S. healthcare operations {{based on my}} collaboration with various health organizations. In my first essay, I investigate the underlying operational and economic drives be-hind physicians ’ test-ordering behavior in an outpatient setting, motivated by a collabo-rative study with University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Eye Center. I model the physician-patient interaction under the strategic queueing framework, and show that insurance coverage is a key driving force of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals that simply expanding cost-sharing does not constitute the solution: (i) While existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing that the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption toward different directions. (ii) Setting a low <b>reimbursement</b> <b>ceiling</b> alone cannot elimi-nate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even {{when there is no}} <b>reimbursement</b> <b>ceiling.</b> These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and so are ro...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{diagnostic}} tests {{have long been}} viewed as one major aspect of the inefficiency in the healthcare system and are often attributed to the fee-for-service payment model. In this study, we investigate the underlying operational and economic drives behind physicians ’ test-ordering behavior in an outpatient setting. We model and analyze the strategic interaction between a single physician {{and a group of}} patients with health insurance coverage. We then investigate the effect of different service settings. First, setting a low <b>reimbursement</b> <b>ceiling</b> alone cannot eliminate overtesting. Second, the joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting, which differs from popular beliefs about the effect of misdiagnosis concerns. Third, patient heterogeneity can further encourage physicians to overtest in order to cherry-pick patients. Fourth, we show that our main insights carry over when the physician can increase the service quality through reading and analyzing the results from {{diagnostic tests}}. Last, we consider asymmetric information in physician type and find that physicians ’ signaling efforts can lead to more salient overtesting behavior, especially when technology advancements flatten out differentiation among physicians.

40|$|Despite {{emerging}} {{evidence about}} the high incidence and severity of wheelchair-related injuries, regulations governing wheelchair safety are almost nonexistent in Canada. The authors believe that, to improve wheelchair safety, a concerted effort by government, manufacturers, purchasing groups, users and clinicians is needed. Health Canada's Health Protection Branch should treat wheelchairs as medical devices (as defined in the Food and Drugs Act 1985) and improve its injury-reporting network. Manufacturers should give a higher priority to safety in wheelchair design, improve their educational materials and formalize postmarketing surveillance. Purchasing groups should try {{to ensure that they}} do not stifle innovation in wheelchair design by setting unrealistic <b>reimbursement</b> <b>ceilings</b> and should use their market power more effectively. Users should obtain their wheelchairs in specialized settings, heed safety warnings and make more effective use of litigation when such action is warranted. Clinicians should ensure that patients are equipped with the most appropriate wheelchair for their needs, that they are given adequate training in safe wheelchair use and that they understand the dangers involved. Rapid changes in wheelchair technology and emerging {{evidence about the}} high incidence and severity of injuries related to wheelchair use suggest that such changes are needed in the wheelchair delivery system...|$|R
40|$|Reference pricing {{systems are}} <b>reimbursement</b> <b>ceilings</b> set by payers {{in an effort}} to {{constrain}} pharmaceutical expenditure for a private or public drug benefit. In recent years, many governments have adopted reference pricing either as a replacement or in addition to product specific price controls. Programme administrators should consider whether these policies are providing the intended benefits or whether there may be a more effective method. This article provides a review of reference pricing in Europe, North America and other countries. There are many similarities in the reference price policies but the markets to which they apply {{are more likely to be}} different. The European experience gives a `once-for-all' lowering effect on pharmaceutical expenditure, often at the expense of compromises on prescribing. In Germany and The Netherlands, reference pricing has been relatively ineffective in lowering expenditure which has led to a succession of other interventions to achieve expenditure control goals. The US also has reference pricing, but it occurs in a very competitive market which may be responsible (at least in part) for the relatively modest growth in expenditure compared with European countries. The review of countries with reference pricing policies suggests that such policies are less effective than competitive markets in moderating pharmaceutical expenditure. Nonetheless, governments continue to pursue reference pricing strategies. Reviews-on-treatment, Health-policy, Reimbursement, Health-economics, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the association between the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) policy design and its achievement of providing financial protection to rural residents. This study collected data on NCMS policy design and health care spending from 25 counties and rural households in their catchment areas. It shows that on average, NCMS has a growing but small effect on the reduction of catastrophic medical payment (CMP) incidence. If outpatient spending can be reimbursed from an NCMS pooled account, the incidence of CMP before a reimbursement and that after a reimbursement will be reduced. Higher nominal reimbursement rate for inpatient spending at provincial hospitals is correlated with higher incidence of CMP before a <b>reimbursement.</b> Higher <b>ceiling</b> for annual <b>reimbursement</b> from NCMS is associated with lower incidence of CMP after a reimbursement. Thus, NCMS policy design can be improved to strengthen its effects on the reduction of CMP incidence...|$|R
