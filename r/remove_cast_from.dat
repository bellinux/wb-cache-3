30|$|Color {{constancy}} is {{an important}} issue in the topic of color image enhancement. In the current design, the proposed method cannot handle color constancy problem and fails to produce color constant results for the images with color cast or color shift. However, this problem can be resolved by combining a color restoration algorithm, such as white-patch algorithm [26] or color correction algorithm [27], with the proposed method to <b>remove</b> color <b>cast</b> <b>from</b> the enhanced results. In this article, we do not cover the color restoration problem and only focus the topic on dynamic range compression with local contrast enhancement problem.|$|R
40|$|Shadow {{detection}} and removal has had {{great interest in}} computer vision especially in outdoor environments. It is an important task for visual tracking, object recognition, and many other important applications. One of the fundamental challenges for accurate tracking is achieving invariance to shadows. Two or more separate objects can appear to be connected through shadows. Many algorithms have been proposed in the literature that deal with shadows. However, the problem remains largely unsolved and needs further research effort. This paper proposes a method for <b>removing</b> <b>cast</b> shadows <b>from</b> vehicles in outdoor environments. The proposed method employs the estimated background model of the video sequence and applies a Gamma decoding followed by a thresholding operation. Experimental results show {{the success of the}} proposed method in detecting and removing shadows robustly and leads to considerable improvements in multiple object tracking...|$|R

25|$|The {{explanation}} originally {{put forward}} by Ludwig Borchardt, and later expanded upon by other early 20th-century Egyptologists including Junker and Reisner, was that the reserve head served as a ritualistic substitute for the real head of the deceased, in case it was damaged.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on a zinc coating produced {{on the surface of}} ductile iron grade EN-GJS- 500 - 7 to determine the eutectic grain effect. For this purpose, castings with a wall thickness of 5 to 30 mm were made and the resulting structure was examined. To obtain a homogeneous metal matrix, samples were subjected to a ferritising annealing treatment. To enlarge the reaction surface, the top layer was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>casting</b> by machining. Then hot dip galvanising treatment was performed at 450 °C to capture the kinetics of growth of the zinc coating (in the period from 60 to 600 seconds). Analysing the test results it was found that within the same time of hot dip galvanising, the differences in the resulting zinc coating thickness on samples taken from castings with different wall cross-sections were small but could, particularly for shorter times of treatment, reduce the continuity of the alloyed layer of the zinc coating...|$|R
50|$|A {{seasoned}} pan has a stick-resistant coating {{created by}} polymerized oils and fats. Seasoning {{is a process}} by which a layer of animal fat or vegetable oil is applied and cooked onto cast-iron or carbon steel cookware. New cookware should be vigorously washed in hot water with a strong detergent to <b>remove</b> any <b>casting</b> oils <b>from</b> the cookware's surface. A light coat of oil is applied and the cookware is placed upside down in an oven above a large pan (to drain for an hour), the pan can now be removed, then the oven set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) and baked for 30 minutes. Some cookware comes pre-seasoned from the factory. A proper cast iron seasoning protects the cookware from rusting, provides a non-stick surface for cooking, and prevents food from interacting with the iron of the pan. However, frequent use of acidic foods such as tomato sauce can remove the seasoning faster and the cookware {{will need to be}} re-seasoned frequently. This can be lessened if initial season is better at polymerizing than standard fats/oils. Enamel-coated cast-iron pans do not need seasoning, as the enamel coating prevents rust in most instances. It is recommended to maintain the seasoning frequently to keep the food from sticking to the iron.|$|R
50|$|The {{gravity process}} begins by {{preheating}} the mold to 150-200 °C (300-400 °F) {{to ease the}} flow and reduce thermal damage to the casting. The mold cavity is then coated with a refractory material or a mold wash, which prevents the <b>casting</b> <b>from</b> sticking to the mold and prolongs the mold life. Any sand or metal cores are then installed and the mold is clamped shut. Molten metal is then poured into the mold. Soon after solidification the mold is opened and the <b>casting</b> <b>removed</b> to reduce chances of hot tears. The process is then started all over again, but preheating is not required because the heat <b>from</b> the previous <b>casting</b> is adequate and the refractory coating should last several castings. Because this process is usually carried out on large production run work-pieces automated equipment is used to coat the mold, pour the metal, and <b>remove</b> the <b>casting.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Latex is a {{synthetic}} rubber {{often used in}} special effects. Foamed latex is sometimes considered the [...] "ultimate in prosthetic appliance." [...] It {{can be used in}} an inflatable bladder effect to make it seem like the actor’s skin is moving or rippling like Rick Baker’s werewolf change effect An American Werewolf in London. This is accomplished by covering an inflatable balloon of some type underneath a covering made of latex, urethane, or plastic molding. Latex {{can also be used to}} make scar effects or other more blatant mutilation. For example, with latex prosthetics, movie makers can make an actor appear to have more or less limbs than he should. They can also make the actor appear to be horribly wounded with flesh hanging and large gashes. To accomplish these tricks, the actor must first have a mold made of the part of him that will be replicated using latex. Take, as an example, one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. To make this actor seem to be rotting, they need to make a cast. The technicians prep the area of the body, say the face, to be cast. They must cover the hair and coat the eyebrows, eyelashes, and any other hair that can’t be covered with petroleum jelly. Then they must apply the alginate or other comparable substance, completely covering the molding area, keeping the mouth, nose, or both open for breathing. When that is finished, they layer the area with plaster bandages to create the cast. When all of it has dried and settled, they <b>remove</b> the <b>cast</b> <b>from</b> the actor and put it together again to create the mold. After this, they pour plaster of Paris into the mold to create a cast that is exactly like the actors face. <b>From</b> the <b>cast</b> they can get another mold which they then can use to sculpt any prosthetic attachments they need. This can include fake limbs, fake skin, or growths. It is important to use the a good adhesive to apply the prosthetic. In his book Vincent Kehoe recommends one that is [...] "easy to apply, sets rapidly, be dilutable for use, and be removable with a solvent that is not harmful to the skin.|$|R

A plastic cast was wrapped around the right limb from the forearm to the forepaw to keep wrist joint at 90 ° of flexion for 5 weeks. Heat hyperalgesia was tested using the plantar test at 6 h after <b>removing</b> <b>cast.</b> The rats were perfused transcardially with 4 % paraformaldehyde and DRGs were excised at 24 h after <b>removing</b> <b>cast.</b> For size distributions of the TRPV 1 -IR and NGF-IR neuronal profile, the DRG area measurements over 1000 DRG neurons per animal were measured in each side, on both the immobilized (ipsilateral) and contralateral sides. Ipsilateral withdrawal latency was significantly shorter than contralateral sides. Ipsilateral percentage of immunoreactive neurons in the total DRG neurons was significantly higher than contralateral sides in TRPV 1 -IR and NGF-IR. Long-term casting induced heat hyperalgesia, and up-regulation and phenotypic change of TRPV 1 -IR and NGF-IR in DRGs on the immobilized side.
