5000|$|In Soviet {{ideology}} {{there exists}} {{the concept of}} Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism (UBN) (Український буржуазний націоналізм, (УБН)). This nationalism was presented {{as a form of}} an anti-socialist and counterrevolutionary, [...] "bourgeois" [...] movement. All counter-revolutionary activities were persecuted by the Article 58 of the 1922 Russian Criminal Code. The definition of Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism was well put in the foreword of a Soviet book from the 1950s [...] "Under foreign flags" [...] by Volodymyr Byelyayev. The book claimed that Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism was invented by the [...] "archenemy" [...] of the Ukrainian people, the historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, whom the author claimed to have been a German spy. Hrushevsky enjoyed great political and public popularity and respect, so the Soviet government resorted to negative public relations against him. These accusations were recently reiterated by the doctor of historical sciences Vitaliy Sarbei who was published by the <b>Russian</b> <b>information</b> <b>agency</b> [...] "Rosbalt" [...] (February 2011). The book [...] "Under foreign flags" [...] gives the following definition of Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism: Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism is the ideology and politics of the Ukrainian bourgeoisie. Exploiting society, the social base of Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism was a stratum made up of all urban and rural bourgeoisie starting from the big capitalists, owners of big industrial enterprise, and finishing with numerous layers of the bourgeois class under capitalism, kurkul. The economical base for the growth of Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism in the epoch of imperialism is the same as for that of any nationality, that is, the increase of imperialist competition for sales markets and raw materials.|$|E
40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{integration}} activity of industrial {{structures in the}} regions of Russia. The monitoring of the current legal system of the Russian Federation {{carried out in the}} area of statistics and compiling statistical databases on mergers and acquisitions showed the absence of formal executive authority dealing with the compiling collections of information on the integration activity at the regional level. In this connection, the data of <b>Russian</b> <b>information</b> and analytical <b>agencies</b> made the <b>information</b> research base. As research tools we used methods of analysis of structural changes, methods of analysis of economic differentiation and concentration, methods of non-parametric statistics. The article shows the close relationship between social and economic development of the subjects of Russia and integrated business structures functioning on its territory. An investigation of the integration activity structure and dynamics in the subjects of the Russian Federation based on statistical data revealed the increasing heterogeneity of the integration activity of business structures in the regions of Russia. The research results are of practical importance, since they can be used to improve existing federal programs aimed at evening-out disproportions in the social and economic development of Russian regions...|$|R
