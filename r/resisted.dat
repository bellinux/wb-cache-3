40|$|Many {{problems}} {{exist in}} current photoresist designs that will limit {{their ability to}} obtain the performance required for future generations of integrated circuit devices. In order to overcome these challenges, novel <b>resist</b> designs are required, along with advancement in the fundamental understanding {{of the source of}} these problems. A mesoscale kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of <b>resists</b> was developed to probe the effects of changes in <b>resist</b> formulation and processing. A detailed SEM simulator was developed in order to better understand the effect of metrology on the characterization of the final <b>resist</b> relief image. Several important structure-property relations were developed for the prediction of glass transition temperature in molecular <b>resists</b> and the prediction of the solubility of molecular <b>resists</b> in developer. Five new families of molecular <b>resists</b> were developed that provide solutions to some of the limitations in current <b>resist</b> designs. Single component molecular <b>resists</b> have all of the functional groups required to act as a chemically amplified <b>resist</b> contained in a single molecule. This eliminates inhomogeneities in the <b>resist</b> and provides improved line edge roughness. Non-chemically amplified molecular <b>resists</b> were developed that have very good sensitivity due to the unique dissolution properties of molecular <b>resists.</b> Negative tone molecular <b>resists</b> were developed that have an excellent combination of resolution, sensitivity, and line edge roughness with better resolution than has been previously seen in negative tone <b>resists.</b> Control methods were also developed to improve the resolution of these types of negative tone <b>resists</b> even further.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{electron}} penetration through a <b>resist</b> {{is essentially a}} stochastic process; there is a finite probability that <b>resist</b> exposure by released electrons can occur quite far {{from the point of}} photon absorption.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Patterning {{of metal}} oxides {{typically}} involves a multi step process, involving depositing a <b>resist,</b> patterning that <b>resist</b> with {{some form of}} lithography, etching the oxide through the <b>resist,</b> and finally removing. This process can be simplified if the <b>resist</b> is removed and replaced with a metal oxide that can be directly patterned. Solution deposition of metal oxides allows the possibility of depositing materials that are responsive to traditional lithographic patterning methods. A directly patterned <b>resist</b> can be integrated into devices with less difficulty. It is also possible, with a directly patterned metal oxide, to consider this material also as a <b>resist</b> for the patterning of another material. This metal oxide can then be considered an inorganic <b>resist.</b> Inorganic <b>resists</b> have proven to offer a higher resolution and etch resistance than a comparable polymer <b>resist.</b> The work presented here represents efforts to develop directly patterned metal oxides that exhibits these desired <b>resist</b> properties, but which also competes with polymer <b>resist</b> in terms of sensitivity, the one area inorganic <b>resists</b> have always performed unsuitably. An inorganic <b>resist</b> has been developed that exhibits excellent performance in these important metrics, {{as well as others}} which are required of state-of-the-art <b>resists.</b> This inorganic <b>resist</b> has shown sensitivity to a variety of modern exposure sources.
