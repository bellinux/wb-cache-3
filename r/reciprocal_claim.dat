40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this article {{consists}} in relations between arbitration agreement and set-offs. Due to the controversies surrounding both institutions, the issue in question raises many doubts which are of theoretical and practical importance. The article adopts position that set-offs must be perceived both as the off-court vehicle for mutual settlement of reciprocal claims and liabilities governed mainly by the substantive civil law and a defense in the judicial proceedings before state courts subject to the law on the civil procedure. Therefore the analysis of interconnections between set-offs and arbitration agreement involves the insight {{from the perspective of}} this two – highly distinctive {{but at the same time}} closely intertwined - branches of law. The article focuses on the legal consequences of entering a valid arbitration agreement and the party’s capacity to settle one’s debt unrelated to this arbitration agreement by setting it off against its <b>reciprocal</b> <b>claim</b> covered by the arbitration agreement. The author performs a critical analysis of the current state of law including the examination of the jurisprudence stances in this regard developed by some scholars and judicial decisions of the Polish Supreme Court concerning relevant legal matters. The author proposes his final conclusions regarding the issue in question, based on theoretical assumptions adopted, explained and justified in this article. Finally, the article touches upon the possibility and purposefulness of adopting alternative regulations on the issue at hand...|$|E

60|$|I am {{constantly}} {{of opinion}} that your States, in three orders, on the footing {{on which they}} stood in 1614, were capable of being brought into a proper and harmonious combination with royal authority. This constitution by Estates was the natural and only just representation of France. It {{grew out of the}} habitual conditions, relations, and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>claims</b> of men. It grew out of the circumstances of the country, and out of the state of property. The wretched scheme of your present masters is not to fit the Constitution to the people, but wholly to destroy conditions, to dissolve relations, to change the state of the nation, and to subvert property, in order to fit their country to their theory of a Constitution.|$|R

We separate the capacity for retaliation into two channels: (i) the capacity for foreign government retaliation under the dispute settlement procedures of the GATT/WTO system, and (ii) the capacity for foreign industry retaliation through <b>reciprocal</b> <b>claims</b> of dumping and the foreign pursuit of AD duties in countries with AD regimes. Using a nested logit framework and analyzing U. S. AD cases between 1980 and 1998, we find significant empirical evidence consistent with the theory that U. S. industry {{is influenced by the}} threat of reciprocal foreign ADDs in its decision of which foreign countries to name in the initial AD petition, and that the U. S. AD authority's antidumping decisions are influenced by the threat of foreign retaliation under the GATT/WTO dispute settlement mechanism. ...|$|R
50|$|If two persons owe {{each other}} money or similar and {{replaceable}} goods, {{it is possible}} for them to offset/to balance their mutual outstanding debts with each other under condition of maturity and solvency of both debts. The counterparty must be notified about the offsetting. When making an offset of a claim no time limits or conditions may be imposed, except for the condition that the offsetting shall be taken into account only in case the claim is brought to court. The two <b>reciprocal</b> <b>claims</b> shall be considered as extinct to the amount of the lower one as of the day on which the offsetting could have been made. The offsetting is also possible after prescription of one of the claims, if it would have been admissible before the expiry of the limitation period. If the debtor agreed to an assignment of the debt, he may not offset his obligation with the assigned one regarding his old creditor. Claims that are not subject to forcible execution and claims ensuing from wilful wrongful acts and claims for taxes cannot be set-off without the creditor's consent.|$|R

Its continuous worldwide accessibility urges discussion of a number of questions regarding tort jurisdiction. These are the starting points for some critical remarks regarding states' <b>reciprocal</b> <b>claims</b> to cross-border activities {{and the way in which}} they deal with the interests of the involved parties. For tort jurisdiction, the paper proposes and applies criteria for the assessment of the place where the harmful event has occurred or may occur (art. 5, subsection 3 Regulation 44 / 2001), as explained by the European Court of Justice of the European Union. Special attention is hereby given to some particularities that characterize Internet torts. On the one hand it concerns the alleged global assignment of jurisdiction that art. 5, subsection 3 may lead to and on the other hand the scope of the assigned jurisdiction in the court of the place where the damage occurs. The European approach is confronted with the principles of personal jurisdiction that are embedded in long arm statutes and the Due Process Clause, as applied in some leading American cases regarding Internet jurisdiction. It leads to suggestions regarding the development of a marginal test for the reasonableness of the jurisdiction art. 5, subsection 3 could lead to in a particular case, as well from the point of view of the weight of the connecting factor as to the scope of the jurisdiction that is based upon it...|$|R

40|$|The Triple Helix {{model is}} a {{prescriptive}} model of innovation that takes a sociological perspective {{to explain how the}} reciprocal relations between university-industry-government contribute to the creation and capitalization of knowledge. The model emphasizes the role of the university as promoters of socioeconomic development especially in those regions with low technology dynamics. The conceptual framework developed by Gunasekara which combines the triple helix model and the engaged university theory, is applied to perform a comparative analysis of the current role of two Mexican universities –one private the other public- in terms of their contribution to regional development. Results shows despite the efforts of both universities to establish links with the public and private sectors, they only play a developmental role. Important changes in technology, research and innovation policies are required to support the establishment of the multiple <b>reciprocal</b> relations <b>claimed</b> by the Triple Helix model. Regional universities need to do more than promote entrepreneurship, create incubators and support joint research projects with local enterprises to play the generative role universities have under the triple helix model...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{improvement}} (QI) {{has become}} a cornerstone in contemporary healthcare organizations {{with the aim of}} enabling management that facilitates efficiency and effectiveness, while providing a consistent correlation between health spending and indicators of access to and quality of care. However, despite years of reform which have attempted to change healthcare professionals’ practice, traditional professional modes of working remain relatively stable and entrenched. Previous research has highlighted the fact that healthcare professionals’ active involvement in quality improvement work (QIW) is often lacking. Such a lack is often explained by professionals’ scepticism towards management, managers, and organizationally related improvement initiatives. Yet, {{there is a shortage of}} studies which focus on analysis at the level of the actor when studying healthcare professionals’ involvement in QIW. This dissertation presents a qualitative case study of the QIW undertaken by a multi-professional diabetes care team. It enables a description and analysis of healthcare professionals’ involvement in QIW at the actor level of analysis. A theoretical framework, consisting of the combination of institutional logics and institutional work, is applied in order to focus on varied and complementary aspects of institutional dynamics while simultaneously emphasizing the embeddedness of actors’ actions and interactions. The study shows that healthcare professionals’ identification with and adherence to the professional logic in general impairs their involvement in QIW. Adherence entails perceiving professional judgments and discretion as legitimate in guiding practice and work. However, the study emphasizes that adherence to the professional logic varies amongst professionals representing different professions. This means that healthcare professionals’ acceptance of the bureaucratic control of work as legitimate differs - enabling diverse approaches and practices in QIW. Furthermore, the study illustrates that the physicians’ relative dominance hinders the utilization of multiple perspectives in the multi-professional team. This finding elucidates how dominance and hierarchization of logics enable healthcare professionals’ practice to remain relatively stable, despite managerial attempts to change and alter it. Finally, the study delineates the interactions needed in order to bridge institutional logics at the actor level of analysis. Such interactions are characterized by <b>reciprocal</b> acts of <b>claiming</b> and granting influence that constitute creative/disruptive institutional work, enabling actors to find new approaches to each other and further facilitate healthcare professionals’ involvement in QIW...|$|R
40|$| The non-statutory {{associative}} {{legal person}} at common law is not, in my opinion, contractually founded. but {{is based on}} internal corporate law. This legal phenomenon has to be distinguished from the association with~ out legal personality (which is contractually founded). Features of the associative legal person are the following: By virtue of the internal corporate law <b>reciprocal</b> <b>claims</b> are established between members and the legal person {{as a result of}} which performances can be demanded between the members and the legal person respectively; The associative legal person is the owner of a separate associative estate that is engaged and administered by the organs. By virtue of their claims against the legal person the members have the capacity to control and to have a say in the management of the estate; The associative legal person is capable of a separate volition and it therefore has the capacity to act, to appear in court in its own name and to be accountable for its actions; In my opinion the associative legal person can lay claim to personality rights as a persona. and demand satisfaction in some cases of prejudice to those rights; The associative legal person as an entity can not only be held liable for lawful acts of the organs, but also for the unlawful acts of the organs, in cases where the legal person directed its volition to effect a certain unlawful action, or acted with unacceptable negligence. As it is possible for the legal person to form its own volition, it can also disclose a guilty inclination. It is furthermore possible for the legal person to be held liable by means of vicarious liability. am. of the opinion that the underlying principles of the legal person at common law present the most suitable basis on which the legal position of cooperative institutions in private law, like churches, political parties. charitable institutions, unions and social associations of the corporative type can be constructed. In doing this the internal legal relations among the members and external legal actions towards outsiders is accounted for in the most satisfactory manner. The legal position of churches is quite distinctive. but in essence it still complies with the requirements for the acquisition of legal personality at common law. In my opinion churches should for this reason be acknowledged as legal persons at common law. The legal position of associations without legal personality (clubs) should be distinguished from the position of legal persons at common law. Associations without legal personality, like the English clubs. are contractually founded; their members are co-owners of the separate club estate and no distinct entity (perosona) is formed. Although the prerequisites for acknowledging legal personality at common law have, in my opinion. been defined satisfactorily in the South African case law, it is not always easy to determine whether these prerequisites are present, {{especially in the case of}} informal associations. In order to achieve certainty about the law, I would like to propose that a simple system of registration be introduced for associations and foundations. Those associations and foundations that would like to confirm their legal personality to the outside world, can do so by means of registration. This ought to remove the uncertainties of outsiders (and sometimes members themselves) as to the question whether an informal social association or club is a legal person at common law, and if it is, who the authorized organs are. Such a system of registration, that would naturally have to be instituted by statute, should comprise the following: Legal personality is still conferred according to the requirements laid down by common law; An association that complies with the requirements of common law, is indeed a legal person before registration, but members and administrators can be held responsible personally for actions taken by the organs on behalf of the legal person; Registration serves the purpose of proclaiming the legal personality to the outside world and of indemnifying members and administrators from being held responsible personally for actions taken by the organs. This will make it possible to distinguish the following co-operative institutions: Registered associative legal persons, the members and administrators of which cannot be held responsible personally for actions taken by the organs; Unregistered associative legal persons, the members and administrators of which can be held responsible personally for actions taken by the organs; Clubs or societies that do not qualify for legal personality, because of their contractual nature. Most of the local churches, and without doubt the local Reformed churches, comply with the requirements for legal personality at common law. Because of the adoption and application by the South African courts of the English concept of a church, a conflicting situation has arisen by which local Churches, although they have indeed been defined as common law legal persons at times are considered by the courts to be based on contractual legal relations. No common law authority exists for this point of view, because legal persons are not contractually based according to Roman-Dutch law, and the English unincorporated associations that are indeed contractually based, are not acknowledged as legal persons in English law. To establish the legal position of churches on a purely common law base. one should, in my opinion, characterize the local churches as common law legal persons (based on internal corporate law). Such a point of view would also be in accordance with the fundamental views of Reformed theologians about local churches. As a result of the Reformed dogmatics the connection between local Reformed churches cannot be Seen as a base for an institutionalized body or legal person, but rather as an experience of the unity existing between local churches (with the same articles of faith and church government) because of the fact that all Christians are members of the universal church (the body of Christ). This means that the Reformed Church in South Africa (as a group of churches) is not a legal person and therefore it cannot own land or participate as an entity in the processes of law in any way. It is therefore suggested that the Administrative Bureau of the Reformed Church(es) and the governing body of the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Church(es) act as common law legal persons to perform all the combined legal actions of the individual local churches. The result is that the national synod or religious denomination (kerkverband) itself need not be vested with legal personality. The national synod is a temporary, more comprehensive (meerdere) meeting of the local Reformed churches that is dissolved at the end of each session. Through the meeting of local churches in the national synod and other comprehensive meetings. the religious denomination as such is visibly experienced. In such a way the Reformed concept of church is taken into account. without losing sight of the necessity that local Reformed churches sometimes have to enter into combined legal actions.
