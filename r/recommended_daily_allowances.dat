50|$|School lunches {{must meet}} the {{applicable}} recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which state that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories should come from fat, {{and no more than}} 10 percent from saturated fat. School lunches must also provide one-third of the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> <b>allowances</b> of calories, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and calcium. However, decisions about what specific foods to serve and how to prepare them are made by local school officials. The 2007 School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study III, based on research by the USDA during the 2004-05 school year, found that students in more than 90 percent of schools surveyed had the opportunity to select lunches that met dietary standards for fat and saturated fat.|$|E
50|$|The {{assessment}} of vitamin B6 status is essential, as the clinical {{signs and symptoms}} in less severe cases are not specific. The three biochemical tests most widely used are the activation coefficient for the erythrocyte enzyme aspartate aminotransferase, plasma PLP concentrations, and the urinary excretion of vitamin B6 degradation products, specifically urinary PA. Of these, plasma PLP {{is probably the best}} single measure, because it reflects tissue stores. Plasma PLP less than 10 nmol/l is indicative of vitamin B6 deficiency. A PLP concentration greater than 20 nmol/l has been chosen as a level of adequacy for establishing Estimated Average Requirements and <b>Recommended</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Allowances</b> in the USA. Urinary PA is also an indicator of vitamin B6 deficiency; levels of less than 3.0 mmol/day is suggestive of vitamin B6 deficiency.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with changes}} in food, {{starting}} early in the 20th century, governments have issued nutrition guidelines, leading to the food pyramid (introduced in Sweden in 1974).

In total, 14 elements were analyzed, 13 (Ca, K, Mg, Na, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Co, Cd, and Pb) by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, and P by UV-Vis spectrometry, after mineralization of samples. It was found that K was the most abundant macroelement in the analyzed samples, whereas among microelements, the highest concentration was found for Mn.
