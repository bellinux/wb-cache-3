5|$|Jackson {{signed with}} the Cincinnati Reds on April 8, 1995. Again he {{struggled}} with injury, and {{was placed on the}} disabled list once for tendinitis in his right shoulder and once for a strained <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> muscle. In his only year with the club, Jackson posted a team-best 2.39 ERA, while recording 41 strikeouts over 40 games. Jackson and the Reds made the playoffs, winning the National League Divisional Series but losing the National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves in four games. Jackson was granted free agency on November 3, 1995.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the race, Coulthard was leasing the Learjet of friend David Murray when the {{aeroplane}} developed engine trouble en route to Côte d'Azur International Airport in Nice, and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at Lyon-Satolas Airport, France. Coulthard, his then-girlfriend the American model Heidi Wichlinski and personal trainer/bodyguard Andy Matthews survived; Murray's personal pilot David Saunders and co-pilot Dan Worley died. Coulthard suffered from bruises to his right <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> and severe grazed elbows in the crash. FIA Formula One Safety and Medical Delegate Sid Watkins declared that Coulthard was passed fit to compete in the race.|$|E
5|$|Larry Purvis (Leland Orser) {{is a test}} subject who is kidnapped as an {{incubator}} for the facehuggers. After he is impregnated and rescued, Call {{offers to}} bring him along so he can be frozen and the Alien embryo surgically extracted later. On the Betty, the survivors are ambushed and held at gunpoint by Dr. Wren when Purvis goes into convulsions. He staggers over to Wren, who shoots him. Purvis stays on his feet and overpowers Wren, pulling the scientist's head to his chest. The Alien erupts through Purvis' <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> and Wren's head, killing them both.|$|E

2500|$|The {{advanced}} cynodonts {{have very}} mammal-like <b>rib</b> <b>cages,</b> with greatly reduced lumbar ribs. This {{suggests that these}} animals had more developed diaphragms, were capable of strenuous activity for fairly long periods and therefore had high metabolic rates. On the other hand, these mammal-like <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> may have evolved to increase agility. However, the movement of even advanced therapsids was [...] "like a wheelbarrow", with the hindlimbs providing all the thrust while the forelimbs only steered the animal, in other words advanced therapsids were not as agile as either modern mammals or the early dinosaurs. So {{the idea that the}} main function of these mammal-like <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> was to increase agility is doubtful.|$|R
5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the <b>rib</b> <b>cage.</b> The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, {{the right side of the}} skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the right side of the skull is very different from that of the left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mason Wren (J. E. Freeman) {{is one of}} five {{scientists}} {{employed by}} the USM to clone the Alien Queen. After the Queen is extracted from Ripley, Wren conducts social experiments on Number 8 (whom he considers a predator). He discovers Call infiltrating Number 8's cell, and orders the mercenaries rounded up for execution. They overpower the infantry and take Wren hostage, forcing him to lead them to the Betty. During an Alien attack, Wren shoots Call and escapes from his captors. He confronts the crew of the Betty aboard the ship as Larry Purvis' Alien begins to emerge from his chest. Wren shoots Purvis, who overpowers him and pulls Wren's head to Purvis' chest. The chestburster erupts through Purvis' <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> and Wren's skull, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz came off the disabled list. Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz got hurt again. On June 13, {{he picked up his}} first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained <b>rib</b> <b>cage,</b> but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, a tagged Cuvier's {{beaked whale}} dove to 2,992 m, {{which is the}} deepest {{recorded}} dive by any mammal. The whales' <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> can fold down so as to reduce air pockets and decrease buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|The {{skeleton}} {{provides the}} framework which supports {{the body and}} maintains its shape. The pelvis, associated ligaments and muscles provide a floor for the pelvic structures. Without the <b>rib</b> <b>cages,</b> costal cartilages, and intercostal muscles, the lungs would collapse.|$|R
5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the <b>rib</b> <b>cage.</b> In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E
5|$|He {{managed to}} regain a {{starting}} {{spot on the}} Bears' roster, after Barry Minter, the team's veteran middle linebacker, was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury. Urlacher excelled at the middle linebacker position, and recorded 46 tackles, six sacks, and one interception in his next five starts. Not even a <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> injury hindered his performance during this period, as Urlacher {{went on to win}} the league's Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October. He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks, both of which surpassed the franchise's previous rookie records. Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5–11 record, Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season. Many news organizations, such as the Associated Press and The Sporting News named him as the 2000 Defensive Rookie of the Year. Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the 2001 Pro Bowl as an alternate middle linebacker. Urlacher's successful rookie campaign served as the foundation for his professional career and reputation.|$|E
5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the <b>rib</b> <b>cage.</b> However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, archaeologists {{uncovered}} 43 {{human and}} 76 llama skeletons {{in the village}} of Huanchaco. The human skeletons were from {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 15, all of whom had deep slashes across the sternum and broken <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> indicating that their hearts may have been removed. The burial is dated at 1200-1400 A.D.|$|R
5000|$|It's {{when the}} zone of {{apposition}} ( [...] {{the portion of the}} diaphragm in contact with the parietal pleura during expiration in the base of the pleural cavity') is reduced by the flattening of the diaphragm during inspiration and the pressure in the last intercostal spaces changes from intra-abdominal to intra-thoracic pressure. This partially contributes to the expansion of the <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> during ventilation.|$|R
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E
5|$|The trachea and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front and sides of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the <b>rib</b> <b>cage,</b> the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have <b>rib</b> <b>cages,</b> they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|R
5000|$|In Scandinavian folklore, sleep {{paralysis}} {{is caused}} by a mare, a supernatural creature related to incubi and succubi. The mare is a damned woman, who is cursed and her body is carried mysteriously during sleep and without her noticing. In this state, she visits villagers to sit on their <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> while they are asleep, causing them to experience nightmares. The Swedish film Marianne examines the folklore surrounding sleep paralysis.|$|R
5000|$|In Asian {{countries}} it {{is possible}} to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either [...] "chicken frames" [...] or [...] "chicken carcasses" [...] and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.|$|R
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Spinosaurus was {{primarily}} a terrestrial predator or a piscivore, as indicated by its elongated jaws, conical teeth and raised nostrils. The hypothesis of spinosaurs as specialized fish eaters has been suggested before by A. J. Charig and A. C. Milner for Baryonyx. They base this on the anatomical similarity with crocodilians {{and the presence of}} digestive acid-etched fish scales in the <b>rib</b> <b>cage</b> of the type specimen. Large fish are known from the faunas containing other spinosaurids, including the Mawsonia, in the mid-Cretaceous of northern Africa and Brazil. Direct evidence for spinosaur diet comes from related European and South American taxa. Baryonyx was found with fish scales and bones from juvenile Iguanodon in its stomach, while a tooth embedded in a South American pterosaur bone suggests that spinosaurs occasionally preyed on pterosaurs, but Spinosaurus was likely to have been a generalized and opportunistic predator, possibly a Cretaceous equivalent of large grizzly bears, being biased toward fishing, though it undoubtedly scavenged and took many kinds of small or medium-sized prey. A study by Cuff and Rayfield (2013) concluded that bio-mechanical data suggests that Spinosaurus was not an obligate piscivore and that its diet was more closely associated with each individual's size. The characteristic rostral morphology of Spinosaurus allowed its jaws to resist bending in the vertical direction, however its jaws were poorly adapted with respect to resisting lateral bending.|$|E

5000|$|There {{was some}} debate {{as to how}} the deaths occurred. Some reports {{suggested}} they were caused by people falling off a staircase as they tried to escape the tunnel. However, autopsies showed that all of the fatalities were due to crushed <b>rib</b> <b>cages.</b> A 2012 scientific analysis of the causes of the disaster dismissed the earlier descriptions of the incident as stampede or crowd panic, and instead found evidence for a phenomenon called [...] "crowd turbulence".|$|R

5000|$|They {{were more}} derived than Andesauridae but more basal than lithostrotians (such as Antarctosaurus and Saltasaurus). Lognkosaurians can be {{distinguished}} from other titanosaurs by the wide and unusually thick cervical rib loops on their neck vertebrae, their extremely robust neck neural spines, the relatively narrow neural canal, and their huge vaulted neural arches. They also had very wide dorsal vertebrae with wing-like side processes, and extremely wide <b>rib</b> <b>cages.</b> Their dorsal side processes are also fairly in-line {{with the level of}} the neural canal, instead of being attached further up the neural arch as in lithostrotians.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in Mortal Kombat Trilogy and the Super NES and Genesis {{versions}} of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, this finisher allowed players {{to perform a}} combo which would cause the opponent to explode. Brutalities were not very popular, as they were extremely difficult to accomplish, requiring the player to memorize and perform a special 11-hit combo. Many felt the pay-off was lacking with the only result being a fiery explosion where the victim disappears and an unrealistic amount of bone and flesh (including several <b>rib</b> <b>cages</b> and skulls) are sent flying and covering most of the screen (in some versions, the bone and flesh flies completely offscreen).|$|R
