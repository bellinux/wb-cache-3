5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} is an {{excellent}} polar protic solvent, as noted above. It is frequently used as a solvent for <b>recrystallization</b> to purify organic compounds. Acetic acid {{is used as a}} solvent in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} yttrium (0.1 to 0.2%) {{have been used}} to reduce the grain sizes of chromium, molybdenum, titanium, and zirconium. Yttrium is used to {{increase}} the strength of aluminium and magnesium alloys. The addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves workability, adds resistance to high-temperature <b>recrystallization,</b> and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature oxidation (see graphite nodule discussion below).|$|E
5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy <b>recrystallization</b> of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by <b>recrystallization.</b> These do not have a third layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a three layers since the external layer can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, <b>recrystallization,</b> and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium was {{separated}} from zirconium through repeated <b>recrystallization</b> of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer {{were the first to}} prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|In {{material}} sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic {{systems have}} been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity; <b>recrystallization</b> is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard <b>recrystallization</b> and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms {{a number of}} organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance spark plugs, crucibles for <b>recrystallization</b> of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes {{for the production of}} chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.|$|E
5|$|Small-molecule and {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{differ in}} the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and <b>recrystallization.</b> By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out so as to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger RNA molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been unfolded; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves <b>recrystallization</b> during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{following}} forging processes can be performed at various temperatures; however, they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the <b>recrystallization</b> temperature. If the temperature is above the material's <b>recrystallization</b> temperature it is deemed hot forging; if the temperature is below the material's <b>recrystallization</b> temperature but above 30% of the <b>recrystallization</b> temperature (on an absolute scale) it is deemed warm forging; if below 30% of the <b>recrystallization</b> temperature (usually room temperature) then it is deemed cold forging. The main advantage of hot forging {{is that it can}} be done more quickly and precisely, and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the <b>recrystallization</b> process. Cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece.|$|E
25|$|Where r (0) is {{the initial}} size, n {{the order of}} <b>recrystallization,</b> t a time {{constant}} for <b>recrystallization</b> {{that depends on the}} rate R (in units of size/ time).|$|E
25|$|Zone {{distillation}} is a distillation analog of zone <b>recrystallization.</b> Impurity {{distribution in}} the condensate is described by known equations of zone <b>recrystallization</b> with various numbers of iteration of process – with replacement distribution efficient k of crystallization on separation factor α of distillation.|$|E
25|$|To make {{ice cream}} smooth, <b>recrystallization</b> must occur {{as slowly as}} possible, because small {{crystals}} create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} borax (known by {{the trade}} name Rasorite–46 in the United States {{and many other}} countries) is refined by a process of <b>recrystallization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is conducted in THF. Workup sometimes washing with hydrochloric acid to convert hydrolysis derivatives to the dichloride. <b>Recrystallization</b> from toluene forms acicular crystals.|$|E
25|$|The cryptocrystalline {{nature of}} chert, {{combined}} with its above average ability to resist weathering, <b>recrystallization</b> and metamorphism {{has made it}} an ideal rock for preservation of early life forms.|$|E
25|$|This {{process of}} the tool {{traversing}} along the weld line in a plasticised tubular shaft of metal results in severe solid state deformation involving dynamic <b>recrystallization</b> of the base material.|$|E
25|$|Crude NBS gives better yield in the Wohl-Ziegler reaction. In other cases, impure NBS (slightly yellow in color) {{may give}} {{unreliable}} results. It can be purified by <b>recrystallization</b> from 90–95°C water (10g of NBS for 100mL of water).|$|E
25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of organic}} compounds nearly always increases with temperature. The technique of <b>recrystallization,</b> used for purification of solids, {{depends on a}} solute's different solubilities in hot and cold solvent. A few exceptions exist, such as certain cyclodextrins.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{sedimentary}} structures {{have been reported}} from the Bass Formation. They include ripple marks; mudcracked surfaces; cone-in-cone structures; interformational breccias/conglomerates; both normal and reversed small-scale, graded bedding; and local channel fills. The dolomite and limestone within the Bass formation {{have been affected by}} post-depositional alteration including: dolomitization, <b>recrystallization,</b> stylolitization, and silicification.|$|E
25|$|The Rothemund {{synthesis}} is a condensation and oxidation {{starting with}} pyrrole and an aldehyde. In solution-phase synthesis, acidic conditions are essential; formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid are typical reaction solvents, or p-toluenesulfonic acid or various Lewis acids {{can be used}} with a non-acidic solvent. A large amount of side-product is formed and is removed, usually by <b>recrystallization</b> or chromatography.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{samples of}} zinc {{chloride}} typically contain water and products from hydrolysis as impurities. Such samples may be purified by <b>recrystallization</b> from hot dioxane. Anhydrous samples can be purified by sublimation {{in a stream}} of hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating the sublimate to 400°C in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Finally, the simplest method relies on treating the zinc chloride with thionyl chloride., ZnCl2, CdCl2, ThCl4, CrCl3, FeCl3, CoCl2, and NiCl2 from the corresponding hydrates.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation is the {{formation}} of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by <b>recrystallization</b> from microcrystalline salts.|$|E
25|$|Most of the region's {{crystalline}} rock bodies of Late Archean age {{are part of}} the greenstone-granite terrane of northern Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and {{the western part of the}} Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Lithologies of the rocks are usually gneissose and migmatitic. Repeated metamorphism and deformation caused extensive <b>recrystallization,</b> intense foliation, shear zones and folding. There are east-northeast- to east-trending faults in the gneissic rocks south of the Great Lakes tectonic zone in Minnesota, south of the Midcontinent Rift System in Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{borohydride}} is an odorless {{white to}} gray-white microcrystalline powder which often forms lumps. It can be purified by <b>recrystallization</b> from warm (50°C) diglyme. Sodium borohydride is soluble in protic solvents {{such as water}} and lower alcohols; it will also react with these solvents to produce H2; however, these reactions are fairly slow. Complete decomposition in excess methanol can take nearly 90min at 20°C. It will decompose in neutral or acidic aqueous solutions but is stable at pH 14. These conditions can be exploited to allow sodium borohydride to react in a homogeneous manner, with reduced lifespan being traded against increased reactivity.|$|E
25|$|Peridotites {{can take}} on a massive form or may be in layers. Layered peridotites may form the base layers of gabbroic complexes. Even though some layered peridotites appear to have no {{associated}} gabbro, they probably once were part of such a complex. Three main textures are found in peridotites: the first are well formed crystals of olivine surrounded by other minerals. These olivine crystals probably settled out of the magma first. Another texture is equal sized crystals with straight grain boundaries intersecting at 120°. This may result when slow cooling allowed <b>recrystallization</b> to minimize surface energy. A third texture has long crystals with ragged curvilinear boundaries, a result of internal deformation.|$|E
25|$|Following the Bridgman anvil, {{the diamond}} anvil cell {{became the most}} {{versatile}} pressure generating device that has a single characteristic that sets it apart from the other pressure devices. This provided the early high pressure pioneers with the capability to directly observe the properties of a material while under pressure. With just {{the use of an}} optical microscope, phase boundaries, color changes and <b>recrystallization</b> could be seen immediately, while x-ray diffraction or spectroscopy required time to expose and develop photographic film. The potential for the diamond anvil cell was realized by Alvin Van Valkenburg while he was preparing a sample for IR spectroscopy and was checking the alignment of the diamond faces.|$|E
25|$|Freeze {{distillation}} is {{an analogous}} method of purification using freezing instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a <b>recrystallization</b> where {{the product is}} the mother liquor, and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process {{is used in the}} production of ice beer and ice wine to increase ethanol and sugar content, respectively. It is also used to produce applejack. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. However, reducing methanol with the absorption of 4A molecular sieve is a practical method for production. Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps 3,000 {{million years}} ago in Precambrian time, sand, limey ooze, silt and clay were {{deposited}} in a marine trough (accurate dating is not possible, due to subsequent partial <b>recrystallization</b> of the resulting rock). Interbeded between these layers were volcanic deposits, probably from an island arc. These sediments were later lithified into sandstones, limestones, and various shales. These rocks were 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16km) below the surface when orogenies (mountain-building episodes) around 2,800 to 2,700 {{million years ago}} intensely folded and metamorphosed them, creating alternating light and dark banded gneiss and schist. Today these rocks dominate the Teton Range with good examples easily viewable in Death Canyon and other canyons in the Teton Range. The green to black serpentine created was used by Native Americans to make bowls.|$|E
25|$|Some {{crystals}} {{have formed}} by magmatic and metamorphic processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline rock. The {{vast majority of}} igneous rocks are formed from molten magma {{and the degree of}} crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as granite, which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of lava were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or glassy matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as marbles, mica-schists and quartzites, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like limestone, shale and sandstone and have never been in a molten condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of metamorphism have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing <b>recrystallization</b> in the solid state.|$|E
25|$|Naphthalene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), indane (0.2%), indene (<nbsp&2%), and methylnaphthalene (<nbsp&2%). Petroleum-derived naphthalene is usually purer than that derived from coal tar. Where required, crude naphthalene can be further purified by <b>recrystallization</b> from any {{of a variety of}} solvents, resulting in 99% naphthalene by weight, referred to as 80nbsp&°C (melting point). Approximately 1.3M tons are produced annually.|$|E
25|$|Potassium–argon dating, {{abbreviated}} K–Ar dating, is a radiometric dating {{method used}} in geochronology and archaeology. It {{is based on}} measurement of {{the product of the}} radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar). Potassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay minerals, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product 40Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies (recrystallizes). The amount of Argon sublimation that occurs {{is a function of the}} purity of the sample, the composition of the mother material, and a number of other factors. These factors introduce error limits on the upper and lower bounds of dating, so that final determination of age is reliant on the environmental factors during formation, melting, and exposure to decreased pressure and/or open-air. Time since <b>recrystallization</b> is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of 40Ar accumulated to the amount of 40K remaining. The long half-life of 40K allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in 2004 that excess racemic D,L-asparagine (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during <b>recrystallization,</b> induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser), valine (Val), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp). The enantiomeric excess {ee=100x(L-D)/(L+D)} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly {{with that of the}} inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 D,L-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess D,L-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized. It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in L- or D-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee {{was reported}} to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.|$|E
25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and <b>recrystallization</b> processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E
500|$|Another {{way to make}} caesium {{fluoride}} is {{to react}} caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) with hydrofluoric acid. The resulting salt can then be purified by <b>recrystallization.</b> The reaction is shown below: ...|$|E
