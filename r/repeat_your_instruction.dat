60|$|SECOND WATCH: I don't want <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> in the {{discharge}} of my duty.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall be}} most happy to receive <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> {{on the subject}} in this letter.|$|R
60|$|Gom. You may spare <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> if you please, father; she has {{no farther}} need of them.|$|R
60|$|SOAMES [taking up his pen] You wont take my advice. I didnt {{expect you}} would. Well, I await <b>your</b> <b>instructions.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'Who's the {{imbecile}} meddler {{who sent}} you blundering here? Didn't you understand <b>your</b> <b>instructions?</b> Don't you know anything? It's incredible. Here--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Signore!' {{interposed}} Cavalletto, also addressing Arthur: 'for to commence, hear me! I received <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> to find him, Rigaud; is it not?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Dear Sir, I {{thank you}} for <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> as to the Silver Pictures, about which, when at home, I will make some experiments...|$|R
6000|$|... "Against the evidence?" [...] {{asked his}} {{superior}} in quiet surprise. [...] "You of course remember <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> {{and know what}} your duty is." ...|$|R
5000|$|THE COURT: [...] "I'm sorry. <b>Your</b> <b>instructions</b> from me, the Judge are that, if {{she appears}} with a lawyer, her lawyer {{will deal with}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very sorry}} {{if there has}} been any mistake. I tried to obey <b>your</b> <b>instructions.</b> You wanted two hundred El Dorados, did you not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You seem," [...] she said, [...] "to have rather {{exceeded}} <b>your</b> <b>instructions.</b> I {{simply wanted}} to know whether the man was in Paris or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{fixed her}} a longer time. [...] "Are <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> from Mrs. Newsome that you shall, {{even at the}} worst, {{absolutely}} and irretrievably break with me?" ...|$|R
60|$|GIUSEPPE. He {{has had a}} good dinner, {{according}} to <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> excellency, and is now doing me the honor to gamble with me to pass the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "No one. I {{keep them}} {{locked up in}} a cabinet. I only make memorandums of <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> which I give to my clerks, but never your letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} {{directions}} to receive these gentlemen, {{and expect to}} have them at my quarters this evening, awaiting <b>your</b> <b>instructions.</b> U.S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General, Commanding Armies United States." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{accordance}} with <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> we beg {{to inform you}} that we personally served the respondent and co-respondent in this suit to-day, at Richmond, and Robin Hill, respectively.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{more you}} might have said, Mr. Allen," [...] I remarked presently; [...] "you have a cause for keeping me under <b>your</b> <b>instruction,</b> and that is behind all." ...|$|R
60|$|REVEREND AND DEAR FATHER--When I last had {{the honor}} of seeing you, I {{received}} <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> to report, by letter, the result of my conversations on religion with Mr. Romayne.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will bear}} <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> in mind, father, and indeed they accord {{with what you}} before said to me, and which I {{determined}} to make a guide to my conduct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{do not you}} be {{too proud}} {{of the effect of}} <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> Claude,' said Jane, 'for when honest Phyl came into the garden, she did not know farthings from fractions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir,--Agreeably to <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> I {{went to the}} prisoners, [...] Behar and Jewar Ali Kh√¢n, {{accompanied}} by Hoolas Roy, who read the [...] papers respecting the balance now due, &c., &c.|$|R
5000|$|Say again repeat; Please <b>repeat</b> <b>your</b> last message (<b>Repeat</b> is {{only used}} in Australian/Canadian/UK/US {{military}} radio terminology to request additional artillery fire) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You remember," [...] resumed {{the little}} man, [...] "that the first {{consequence}} of our following <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> was a discovery (which we immediately communicated to you) {{that she was}} secretly learning to write?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The heavier luggage, {{labelled}} for the hold, sir," [...] the {{man told}} him, [...] "is down-stairs, and will go direct to the steamer to-morrow morning. That was according to <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> I believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{whole thing}} is {{thoroughly}} irregular," [...] said Morris. [...] "It is not the custom of the trade to settle {{at this time of}} the year. What are <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> if I refuse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{propose a}} very simple method of {{arranging}} them. You are a man of honor, and more conversant with business than I. Give me <b>your</b> <b>instructions.</b> My lawyer shall have them within half an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said the}} east Whitefish, {{and he sent}} the truck to the west fork. It's a point where one might go wrong, and he'll claim that he {{misunderstood}} you and you didn't make <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> clear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] {{said the}} editor resignedly. [...] "Of course I can deliver <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> to the foreman. And now--let me see--I suppose {{you wish to}} {{intimate}} in a personal notice to your husband that you've returned." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY MOGTON [To JANET.] I {{will get}} {{you to come to}} the station with me. I can give you <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> in the cab. [She kisses ANNYS.] You have been called to a great work. Be worthy of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then you}} will be able to <b>repeat</b> <b>your</b> remarks to me IN THE STREET," [...] {{continued}} the Colonel, bowing, as he persisted in following his visitor to the door.|$|R
6000|$|That evening Mr. Slippen's boy {{presented}} himself at Captain Hampton's lodgings with a note. It contained only the words 'Dear sir,--Our man uses the [...] "White Horse," [...] Frogmore Street, Islington. I await <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> before moving {{further in the}} matter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eh? You trust her, Bran?' said Raphael, in an undertone. 'I {{must really}} emancipate myself from <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> if you require a similar {{simplicity}} in me. Stay! there wanders a mule without a rider; we {{may as well}} press into the service.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{and your}} friend have {{certainly}} put your heads together to good purpose," [...] the old lawyer said, [...] "and I {{do not see}} any better plan than you suggest. You had better have Bassett down here, and give him <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{expression}} {{is a legal}} one, sir, signifying the resolve not to proceed with a matter. In other words, eager though I am to carry out <b>your</b> <b>instructions,</b> sir, as a general rule, on this occasion I must respectfully decline to co-operate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We prefer," [...] {{said the}} German coldly, [...] "that you should remain here. One of our number will carry out <b>your</b> <b>instructions</b> minutely. If the {{operations}} are complicated, {{he will return}} to you with a report and you can instruct him further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend's {{sister was}} well {{grounded}} in the re familiari" [...] answered her husband; [...] "and doubtless she hath imparted somewhat of her skill to this damsel. Besides, the child is of tender years, and will profit much by <b>your</b> <b>instruction</b> and mine." ...|$|R
