5|$|Against Oueddei stood freshly arrived French forces. Already in 1977, after Oueddei first offensives, Malloum {{had asked}} for a French {{military}} return in Chad, but President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was at first reluctant to commit himself before the 1978 legislative elections; also, France was afraid of damaging its profitable commercial and diplomatic relations with Libya. However, the rapid deterioration {{of the situation in}} Chad <b>resolved</b> <b>the</b> President on 20 February 1978 to start Opération Tacaud, which by April brought 2,500 troops to Chad to secure the capital from the rebels.|$|E

This was due to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling that Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Following the delay, the Space Head Module {{was removed}} from the rocket, and {{returned}} to its integration building on 22 February. Whilst it was in the integration building, daily inspections were made to ensure that the spacecraft was still functioning normally. Once the fuel issue had been <b>resolved,</b> <b>the</b> launch was rescheduled for 8 April, and launch operations resumed. On 1 April, the Space Head Module was returned to the silo, and reinstalled atop the Dnepr. Following integrated tests, the practice countdown was successfully conducted on 6 April.|$|E

5|$|In August 2003, the BBC had <b>resolved</b> <b>the</b> issues {{regarding}} production rights that had surfaced {{as a result}} of the jointly produced Universal Studios–BBC–Fox 1996 Doctor Who film, leading the Controller of BBC One Lorraine Heggessey and Controller of Drama Commissioning Jane Tranter to approach Gardner and Davies to create a revival of the series to air in a primetime slot on Saturday nights, as part of the BBC's plan to devolve production to its regional bases. By mid-September, they accepted the deal to produce the series alongside Casanova.|$|E

5|$|Senator Roberts {{proposed}} legislation {{at the start}} of session regarding the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which <b>resolved</b> <b>the</b> same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|Several Congressmen, {{including}} Hamilton, Robert Morris and Gouverneur Morris, {{attempted to}} use this Newburgh conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government.

The light-horsemen had taken the {{surrender}} of a large Turkish force, part of the Turkish Fourth Army, then had to defend them from the Arab tribesmen.

The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing.

5|$|The {{authors of}} the 2015 study which <b>resolved</b> <b>the</b> phylogenetic {{placement}} of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that the echo parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable ecological replacement for the Réunion parakeet and Newton's parakeet, due to their close evolutionary relationship. The echo parakeet was itself close to extinction in the 1980s, numbering only twenty individuals, but has since recovered, so introducing it to the nearby islands could also help secure the survival of this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of the Amylostereaceae {{is not completely}} <b>resolved.</b> <b>The</b> next closest relatives might be – depending on the research – either Echinodontium tinctorium and most other species of the genus Echinodontium, or Artomyces pyxidatus.

Only the classification to the Russulales is regarded as correct. Some authors have suggested that Amylostereum should {{be placed in the}} family Echinodontiaceae.|$|E
5|$|The mutiny refocused {{attention}} on the long term tension {{over the use of}} Indochinese soldiers, and on the ways in which it could be <b>resolved.</b> <b>The</b> tension could {{be traced back to the}} creation of French Indochina. Cochinchina, the European term for southern Vietnam, had been colonised in 1867 and the remaining parts of Vietnam, Tonkin and Annam, the northern and central regions were conquered in 1883. Nominally, only Cochinchina was a colony, while Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia and Laos were protectorates which together comprised French Indochina. The problem centred around the French reliance on native soldiers to maintain colonial control. This need was problematic because Indo-Chinese soldiers were both enforcers of colonial order and colonial subjects. This created constant French concerns about their loyalty. Despite several attempts to deal with the issue, the basic tension between the need for and suspicion of native troops could never be entirely <b>resolved.</b> <b>The</b> need for forces to pacify the countryside was too pressing to do without them. As a result, the tension resurfaced at regular intervals, either due to proposals to improve the position of Indochinese soldiers in the army, or after a mutiny had raised question marks about the loyalty of the soldiers.|$|E
