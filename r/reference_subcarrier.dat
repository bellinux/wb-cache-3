50|$|In color {{television}} {{systems such as}} PAL and NTSC, this period also includes the colorburst signal. In the SECAM system it contains the <b>reference</b> <b>subcarrier</b> for each consecutive color difference signal in order to set the zero-color reference.|$|E
50|$|A gated and {{filtered}} signal {{derived from the}} color subcarrier, called the burst or colorburst, {{is added to the}} horizontal blanking interval of each line, excluding the vertical sync interval, as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the chrominance signals. The burst signal is inverted in phase (180Â° out of phase) from the <b>reference</b> <b>subcarrier.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{degradation of the}} European Space Agency (ESA) Deep Space Telecommand receiving subsystem due {{to the presence of}} cross-modulation and ranging interference for simultaneous ranging and command operations on the Earth-to-space link is investigated. The most important result is that under imperfect carrier <b>reference</b> the command <b>subcarrier</b> and the ranging tone frequencies can be selected to suppress the cross-modulation interference and interference from the ranging channel for the specified command bit rate and ranging code component. Recommendations as to use of specific command subcarrier frequency, command bit rate, and ranging tone frequency are made for consideration in future standards systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{tracking}} loops presented herein {{exploit the}} coherency {{of the observed}} data sidebands at the carrier frequency for improvements in phase-coherent tracking, telemetry, and command system performance. The loop is motivated by one aspect of generalized harmonic analysis, viz., the so-called cross spectrum. The basic idea of the loop centers around using the power in the composite received signal (sidebands including cross-modulation components) to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the carrier tracking loop, thereby reducing the noisy reference loss and ultimately the <b>subcarrier</b> <b>reference</b> jitter, the symbol sync jitter, and the error probability of the data detector. The modulation from the extracted sidebands is removed {{in such a way}} that the coherence power in the data sidebands can be used for tracking at the carrier frequency...|$|R
