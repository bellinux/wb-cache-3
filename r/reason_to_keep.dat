5|$|Howard Browne {{took over}} as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in 1950. Browne {{preferred}} fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines for a while. He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and the quality declined. At the end of 1950, Ziff-Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result {{to have been a}} definite improvement in quality. Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest-sized magazine, Fantastic, in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well. The move from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the early 1950s, and with Fantastics success there was little <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Fantastic Adventures going. It was merged with Fantastic; the last issue was dated March 1953, and the MayJune issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the following issue.|$|E

50|$|Several {{cognitive}} {{accounts of}} the endowment effect {{suggest that it is}} induced by the way endowment status changes the search for, attention to, recollection of, and weighting of information regarding the transaction. Frames evoked by acquisition of a good (e.g., buying, choosing it rather than another good) may increase the cognitive accessibility of information favoring the decision <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> one's money and not acquire the good. By contrast, frames evoked by disposition of the good (e.g., selling) may increase the cognitive accessibility of information favoring the decision <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the good rather than trade or dispose of it for money (for a review, see Morewedge & Giblin, 2015). For example, Johnson and colleagues (2007) found that prospective mug buyers tended <b>to</b> recall <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their money before recalling <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> buy the mug, whereas sellers tended <b>to</b> recall <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their mug before <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> sell it for money.|$|R

25|$|Egyptian Islamic jurist and {{religious}} scholar Muhammad Abduh, {{regarded as one}} of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism or sometimes called Neo-Mu’tazilism, broke the rigidity of the Muslim ritual, dogma, and family ties. Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics, they needed to use <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with changing times. He said that in Islam man was not created to be led by a bridle, man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher’s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. He was against polygamy and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar’s monopoly on exegesis and abolish racial discrimination {{and religious}} compulsion.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} were {{produced}} by Rainmaker Digital Effects. Gero wrote the scene involving the minute long sequence where the Horizon weapon fires from the Apollo to the Asuran homeworld. He {{made contact with}} Mark Savela {{to see if it}} could be done; Savela was up to the challenge. The sequence was costly, since the visual effects team had to make a 3D world that would last a minute long to ensure that the sequence followed Gero's script. The sequences where Atlantis takes off {{from the bottom of the}} ocean were stock footage from [...] "Rising", with the shield and beam added on. Another <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the scenes was because the writers liked the scene to be reused.

Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, because you can experiment too much.

The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me." [...] Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club wrote in her review for the 10th season [...] "At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season." [...] Many sources, including Rachel Simon of Bustle and Nicole Pomarico of Wetpaint, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an Emmy nomination.|$|E

500|$|In 2014 the University of Virginia {{fraternity}} and sorority system {{became the}} focus of significant national scrutiny due to the publication of an article in the December 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine, entitled [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] and authored by Sabrina Erdely. The article alleged that in September 2012, a group of male fraternity members at the university had attacked and raped a female student as part of an initiation rite at a party at the university's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. The article further asserted that the university's sexual assault policies were severely lacking and that the university administration did not handle sexual assault cases appropriately. The article attracted significant media attention and made national headlines, leading to the suspension of the university's Greek system and further investigation into the article's claims; these investigations quickly revealed numerous inconsistencies and raised serious questions about the article's veracity. On January 12, 2015, Charlottesville Police Department officials told the University that [...] "their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi...so there's no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them suspended".
