5000|$|In 1930, the <b>Rotolactor</b> {{was invented}} by Walker Gordon Farms in Plainsboro. The <b>Rotolactor</b> was the first rotary milking parlor and a popular tourist attraction. It {{remained}} in use into the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Jeffers {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the <b>Rotolactor</b> in 1913 as a cost-cutting and labor-saving method for milking a large number of cows. Development of the project was put on hold during World War I. In 1928, the Walker-Gordon Laboratories dairy was purchased by the Borden Company, and <b>Rotolactor</b> development resumed in earnest. Borden provided $200,000 in 1929 for building the <b>Rotolactor</b> at the Walker-Gordon Laboratories dairy farm.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rotolactor</b> and the Walker-Gordon farm in Plainsboro {{became popular}} tourist attractions, {{showcasing}} the unusual and modernistic {{features of the}} dairy. The farm building in Plainsboro containing the <b>Rotolactor</b> had an observation room to accommodate visitors, including large groups of school children.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{operator}} {{prepared the}} udder for milking. Then the teat-cups of the automatic milking machine {{were attached to}} the cow's udder. The cow was then milked for the twelve {{and a half minutes}} during the <b>Rotolactor's</b> one-time complete rotation. The teat-cups would then be detached {{at the end of the}} twelve and a half minute rotation. [...] The cow would then step off the platform and return to the barn to her stall.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Rotolactor</b> was {{the first}} {{invention}} for milking {{a large number of}} cows using a rotating platform. It was invented by Henry W. Jeffers. The <b>Rotolactor</b> was initially installed in a [...] "lactorium," [...] a building specifically designed for milking cows, in Plainsboro, New Jersey. The rotating mechanical milking machine was first used by the Walker-Gordon Laboratories dairy and was put into operation on November 13, 1930.|$|E
50|$|Menangle {{has several}} heritage-listed buildings. These include Camden Park House, The Menangle Store, the <b>Rotolactor,</b> Gilbulla, The Pines, Menangle railway station, and the Menangle Railway Viaduct.|$|E
50|$|The August 1931 {{issue of}} the American Journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health {{described}} the <b>Rotolactor</b> as an advance in cleanliness and hygiene for milk production.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first line}} of the Abstract of the 1930 Cow Milking Apparatus (<b>Rotolactor)</b> patent starts: [...] "The object of this {{invention}} is to provide an apparatus whereby an indefinitely large number of cows may be milked successively and largely automatically..." ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Rotolactor</b> is {{the first}} {{invention}} for milking {{a large number of}} cows successively and largely automatically, using a rotating platform. It was developed by the Borden Company in 1930, and is known today in the dairy industry as the [...] "rotary milking parlor".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Rotolactor</b> (roto + lactor ium) {{was a large}} {{rotating}} [...] "merry-go-round" [...] style {{platform for}} holding 50 cows. The machine brought the cows into position for milking with automatic milking machines. The rotating platform machine was sixty feet in diameter and made one complete revolution about every twelve and a half minutes, which was {{the time required to}} prepare and milk each cow.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in {{his senior}} year at Cornell in 1898, Jeffers worked for the Walker-Gordon Dairy Farm, {{eventually}} becoming president in 1918. At Walker-Gordon, based in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey, Jeffers invented a number of technological innovations streamlining dairy production, including the Jeffers bacteriology counter, the Jeffers feed calculator, and the <b>Rotolactor</b> (a rotary milking parlor, a sort of [...] "carousel" [...] for cows, invented in 1930).|$|E
50|$|Continuing {{outward from}} the Theme Center, one saw the Food Zone. Among the many unique {{exhibits}} was the Borden's exhibit, that featured 150 pedigreed cows (including the original Elsie) on a <b>Rotolactor</b> that allowed bathing them, drying them, and milking them in a highly mechanized way. While no such complete system ever became common in milk production, many of its features would come into everyday use in today's rotary milking parlors.|$|E
50|$|The milk {{was drawn}} by a vacuum to sealed glass {{containers}} above the cow's head. It was then transported in pipes to weighing and recording apparatuses. Then it was piped to another {{room where the}} milk was cooled and bottled. This was faster and more efficient than the methods previously used. Human hands never touched the milk, and the milk never {{came into contact with}} air, which was important to prevent premature spoiling. The <b>Rotolactor</b> could milk the Walker-Gordon dairy's 1,680 cows three times daily. This produced 26,000 quarts of milk.|$|E
