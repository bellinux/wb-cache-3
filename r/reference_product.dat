5000|$|The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has {{recognized}} this fact, which {{has resulted in}} the establishment of the term [...] "biosimilar" [...] in recognition that, whilst biosimilar products are similar to the original product, they are not exactly the same.Every biological displays a certain degree of variability.

50|$|Generally, once a drug is {{released}} in the market by FDA, {{it has to be}} re-evaluated for its safety and efficacy once every six months for the first and second years. Afterward, re-evaluations are conducted yearly, and the result of the assessment should be reported to authorities such as FDA. Biosimilars are required to undergo pharmacovigilance (PVG) regulations as its <b>reference</b> <b>product.</b> Thus biosimilars approved by EMEA (European Medicines Agency) are required to submit a risk management plan (RMP) along with the marketing application and have to provide regular safety update reports after the product is in the market. The RMP includes the safety profile of the drug and proposes the prospective pharmacovigilance studies.|$|E
50|$|Both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) have drafted {{reference}} {{papers and}} guidance’s {{for the industry}} for several types of NBCDs, e.g. for iron nanoparticles products. Also regulatory science initiatives have addressed lacking investigations. For the comparability exercise the question stays to evaluate the totality of evidence for enough similarity of such test drugs with the <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> to conclude {{of the extent of}} comparability and its impact on use. Currently, the FDA follows a case-by-case approach for the evaluation of NBCD follow-on products, which is iterative, adaptive and flexible but also more general. The EMA on the other hand is supporting a class-related approach including non-clinical testing. A harmonized approach is, however, still missing.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, GPhA began {{promoting}} {{the potential benefits}} of developing a market for biosimilar versions of biologic therapies and provided answers to questions that the FDA posed in a September 2004 workshop on the scientific challenges of creating biosimilars.

Congress created an approval pathway for biosimilars (including interchangeables that are substitutable with their <b>reference</b> <b>product)</b> with passage of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by President Obama on March 23, 2010.

50|$|After the expiry of {{the patent}} of {{approved}} recombinant drugs (e.g., insulin, human growth hormone, interferons, erythropoietin, monoclonal antibodies and more) any other biotech company can develop and market these biologics (thus called biosimilars).Every biological (or biopharmaceutical products) displays {{a certain degree}} of variability, even between different batches of the same product, which is due to the inherent variability of the biological expression system and the manufacturing process. Any kind of <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> has undergone numerous changes in its manufacturing processes, and such changes in the manufacturing process (ranging from a change in the supplier of cell culture media to new purification methods or new manufacturing sites) was substantiated with appropriate data and was approved by the EMA. In contrast, it is mandatory for biosimilars to take a both non-clinical and clinical test that the most sensitive clinical models are asked to show to enable detection of differences between the two products in terms of human pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.|$|E

Pharma Nord actively supports scientific research into {{the health benefits of}} coenzyme Q10, primarily in relation to cardiology. Q-Symbio, a large multinational study investigating coenzyme Q10's potential as an adjuvant for treating chronic heart failure was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, HEART FAILURE. The Q-Symbio study randomised 420 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV) to CoQ10 (ubiquinone) or placebo and followed each patient for a period of two years. In the group that received three 100 mg capsules of coenzyme Q10 daily there were 43% fewer heart-related deaths compared with the placebo group. Also, there was a significant reduction in the need for hospitalization among patients in the Q10 group. The product used in the Q-Symbio study was Pharma Nord's 100 mg Q10 in soft-gel capsules (Myoqinon). The preparation is based on ubiquinone, the form of CoQ10 that has been used in scientific research for over 50 years. Unlike ubiquinol (the reduced form of CoQ10), ubiquinone is supported by a vast number of published studies and is therefore considered the best documented source of CoQ10.|$|E
50|$|The {{environmental}} behaviour of flame retardants {{has been studied}} since the 1990s. Mainly brominated flame retardants were found in many environmental compartments and organisms including humans, and some individual substances {{were found to have}} toxic properties. Therefore, alternatives have been demanded by authorities, NGOs and equipment manufacturers. The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated flame retardants. In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> containing halogen free versus brominated flame retardants. About a dozen halogen free flame retardants were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings. A large group of the studied flame retardants were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), Aluminium diethyl phosphinate (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), zinc stannate (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS). Overall, they were found to have a much lower tendency to bioaccumulate in fatty tissue than the studied brominated flame retardants.|$|E
