The node <b>receiving</b> <b>this</b> message will mark its region status as region 1 and {{will go to}} sleep state.

All the other nodes <b>receiving</b> <b>this</b> message will mark their location status as region 2 and will go into the sleep state. Similarly rest of the nodes mark their region status as region 3 by receiving message TP 3.|$|R
5|$|Actual {{schools were}} rare in Plymouth colony. The first true school was not founded until 40 {{years after the}} {{foundation}} of the colony. The General Court first authorized colony-wide funding for formal public schooling in 1673, but only the town of Plymouth made use of these funds at that time. By 1683, though, five additional towns had <b>received</b> <b>this</b> funding.|$|E

He left General Carl Gustaf Rehnskiöld with 10,000 men at Poznań to guard against the main Saxon army under Schulenburg which threatened to enter Poland. On September 15, Peter I seized the town of Mitau in Courland. However, the allied successes were limited as the coronation of Leszczyński as Stanisław I of Poland was completed on October 4.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is <b>received.</b> <b>This</b> is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is <b>received.</b> <b>This</b> measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E
5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey <b>received</b> <b>this</b> treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{international}}-class chess at the strong London 1932 tournament, which World Champion Alexander Alekhine won. Milner-Barry's best results in international competition were achieved in three straight {{years at the}} Margate tournaments from 1937–39, and at Hastings 1938. In all four events he finished just above the middle against strong fields, with performance ratings (as calculated by Chessmetrics) between 2538 and 2565. This places him at a solid International Master standard, although he never <b>received</b> <b>this</b> title. He reached as high as No. 65 in the world between June and August 1941, according to Chessmetrics, which ranks historical chess performances retrospectively, using modern algorithms.|$|E

He also married Taka, the daughter of the shogun's personal retainer Iwajiro Mihashi. In order that his headmastery of the Jikishinkage ryu would not interfere with his duties to the shogun, his student Matsuoka Katsunosuke was temporarily placed in charge of the school.|$|E
5|$|Mexican {{artists have}} <b>received</b> <b>this</b> award {{more than any}} other nationality, though it has also been {{presented}} to artists originating from Colombia, the United States, and Venezuela.

They also located the tomb of Ramesses the Great, but it was badly looted. It was here that Champollion first received news of Young's campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to discredit Champollion's decipherments.
