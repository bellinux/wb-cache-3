5|$|Pronouns {{are subject}} to a {{complicated}} system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and <b>referent</b> (see Social registers below).

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their <b>referent,</b> either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

25|$|Personal pronouns in ASL are indexic. That is, {{they point}} to their <b>referent,</b> or to a locus {{representing}} their <b>referent.</b> When the <b>referent</b> is physically present, pronouns involve simply pointing at the <b>referent,</b> with different handshapes for different pronominal uses: A 'G' handshape is a personal pronoun, an extended 'B' handshape with an outward palm orientation is a possessive pronoun, and an extended-thumb 'A' handshape is a reflexive pronoun; these may be combined with numeral signs to sign 'you two', 'us three', 'all of them', etc.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>referent</b> is not {{physically}} present, the speaker identifies the <b>referent</b> and then {{points to a}} location (the locus) in the sign space near their body.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with strategies of participant marking in narrative texts in Dena’ina Athabascan, a language spoken in south-central Alaska. Dena’ina is a highly head-marking, polysynthetic language, and all <b>referents</b> (subjects, direct objects and postpositional objects) are encoded by pronominal affixes to the verb stem, as opposed to free pronouns or noun phrases. After a short introduction into the grammar of the language (chapter 1), the pronominal inventory as well as basic pronominal functions are explored (chapter 2). It is then shown {{that there is a}} significant asymmetry between the pronominal marking of first and second person <b>referents</b> (so called discourse <b>referents)</b> and of third person <b>referents.</b> These differences are: Discourse <b>referents</b> are always overtly encoded by a prefix, while third person <b>referents</b> can be encoded by null-marking; also, first and second person are marked in a different position within the verb word than third person prefixes. First and second person prefixes display case-marking, third person prefixes do not. An interesting semantic difference between prefixes encoding discourse <b>referents</b> on th...|$|R
40|$|There is {{disagreement}} within both linguistics and psycholinguistics {{concerning the}} use of unaccented third person pronouns to refer to implicit <b>referents.</b> Some researchers (e. g. Erk & Gundel, 1987) {{argue that it is}} impossible or highly marked, while others (e. g. Yule, 1982) maintain that it is not only acceptable but commonly used in normal discourse. However, both sides in the debate may be correct: While peripheral implicit <b>referents</b> (which evoke the means or the instrument by which a given state of affairs is established) are not easily referred to using pronouns, central or nuclear implicit <b>referents</b> are. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments, involving different languages (English and French). The results of both experiments show that pronominal reference to implicit <b>referents</b> caused slower reading times compared to explicit <b>referents</b> for peripheral <b>referents</b> only. We discuss these results with respect to Gundel, Hedberg and Zacharskis (1993, 2000) Givenness Hierarchy...|$|R

25|$|A related finding {{regarding}} statistical cues to phonological acquisition is {{a phenomenon}} known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to {{the same category as}} the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a <b>referent</b> phoneme. If the <b>referent</b> phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the <b>referent</b> phoneme if that <b>referent</b> phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.|$|E

40|$|Possible {{connections}} between {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) and exposure to vibrating handheld tools, repetitive wrist movements, and heavy manual work were examined in a case-referent study. The cases were 38 men operated on for CTS between 1974 and 1980. For each case, two <b>referents</b> were drawn from among other surgical cases (hospital <b>referents)</b> and two further <b>referents</b> from the population register and telephone directory, respectively (population <b>referents).</b> Thirty four of 38 cases (89 %) and 143 of 152 <b>referents</b> (94 %) were interviewed by telephone. An increased prevalence of obesity, rheumatoid disease, diabetes, or thyroid disease was observed among the cases but most did not suffer from any of these disorders. CTS was significantly correlated with exposure to vibration from handheld tools and to repetitive wrist movements but showed a weaker correlation with work producing a heavy load on the wrist. A cause-effect relation between CTS and exposures to handheld vibrating tools and to work causing repetitive movements of the wrist seems probable. Some differences between hospital and population <b>referents</b> indicate that a case-referent study of this type could be biased by inappropriate selection of <b>referents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} whether speaking mode {{influences the}} way German speakers mark the information status of discourse <b>referents</b> in nuclear position. In Study 1, speakers produced narrations spontaneously {{on the basis}} of picture stories in which the information status of <b>referents</b> (new, accessible and given) was systematically varied. In Study 2, speakers saw the same pictures, but this time accompanied by text to be read out. Clear differences were found depending on speaking mode: In spontaneous speech, speakers always accented new <b>referents.</b> They did not use different pitch accent types to differentiate between new and accessible <b>referents,</b> nor did they always deaccent given <b>referents.</b> In addition, speakers often made use of low pitch accents in combination with high boundary tones to indicate continuity. In contrast to this, read speech was characterized by low boundary tones, consistent deaccentuation of given <b>referents</b> and the use of H+L* and H+!H* accents, for both new and accessible <b>referents.</b> The results are discussed in terms of the function of intonational features in communication. It is argued that reading intonation is not comparable to intonation in spontaneous speech, and that this has important consequences also for our choice of methodology in child language acquisition researc...|$|R

40|$|As <b>referents</b> {{are more}} {{accessible}} in discourse, {{they can be}} referred to with more attenuated expressions, such as pronouns.

The results of a story completion experiment show that visually salient <b>referents</b> induce more attenuated expressions, but only when they are linguistically non-salient. Linguistically salient <b>referents</b> receive more reduced references when they are visually non-salient. We argue that visual saliency affects accessibility when the impact of linguistic factors is moderated.
