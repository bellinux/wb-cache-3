Any tension was soon defused by the Georgia defense, which forced threeincompletions and a sack. Glennon's attempt at a Hail Mary pass fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31–24.|$|E

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> spirals, kneaded and <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E
5|$|The Glamorgan sausage is a Welsh {{vegetarian}} sausage. It {{contains no}} meat or skin, instead {{it is made}} with cheese, generally Caerphilly, but sometimes cheddar, along with leek or spring onion. This mixture is then coated in breadcrumbs and <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> a sausage shape before cooking. Glamorgan sausages date back to at least the early 19th century, {{at which point the}} sausages would have contained pork fat.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen shows {{considerable}} variability {{among members}} of the order. It consists of eleven segments in primitive groups and ten segments in more derived groups, the tenth and eleventh segments having fused. The last two or three segments are adapted for reproduction. Each segment is made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite, connected by an elastic membrane. In some females, the sclerites are <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> a flexible, telescopic ovipositor.|$|E

5|$|After Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return, Tennessee's offense {{started from}} its 31-yard line. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech was {{followed}} by a five-yard first-down run by Hardesty. Tennessee attempted to move its offense quickly in order to maximize the chances of closing Virginia Tech's lead by scoring fast. Crompton completed an 18-yard pass, advancing the Volunteers into Tech territory, but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five-yard false start penalty, forcing the Volunteers to punt. The kick <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain a first down, however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying to run out the clock. Tennessee failed to gain a first down, and the resulting punt <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> the end zone for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E

5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback, and Indiana's offense started work at its 10-yard line after a Hoosier penalty. On the first play of Indiana's drive, Dittoe was sacked and fumbled the ball, which <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> the arms of a Virginia Tech defender. The Hokie offense quickly {{returned}} to the field and Tech's Tommy Edwards scored on the first play after being set up at the Indiana five-yard line after the turnover. The extra point gave Tech a 4213 lead with 9:21 remaining.|$|E
5|$|The egg is {{generally}} oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In {{the case of}} solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from {{a hole in the}} ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.|$|E
5|$|With a liver-and-white or {{black-and-white}} coat, the Norfolk Spaniel {{was described}} as being a large cocker spaniel. The Spaniel Club set out a breed standard for Norfolk Spaniels, but specimens of the breed varied greatly across England. Members of the breed were difficult to train, but formed a strong attachment with their owners and were useful for hunting both on land and in water. The breed ceased to exist after 1903, when it was <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> the new English Springer Spaniel breed created by The Kennel Club to contain all spaniels of this type.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ball}} <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> {{the end zone}} for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have}} a chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's post-touchown kickoff, NC State {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the game at its 24-yard line after a short kick return. The NC State's second drive of the game was more successful than its first, but as before, the Wolfpack offense {{ground to a halt}} before penetrating too deeply into Tech territory, and State was forced to punt the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokie offense began work at its eight-yard line but went three and out and prepared to punt the ball back to NC State. Tech punter Tony Romero, kicking from the Tech goal line, had his kick blocked by State defender Derrick Taylor. The ball <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> the Virginia Tech end zone and was recovered by an NC State's Brian Bulluck for a touchdown. The play and extra point tied the game at 77.|$|E
5|$|However, {{these results}} {{also noted that}} the system might be able to work against longer-ranged missiles. Although these {{traveled}} at very high speeds, their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler, and the longer flight times provided more time to prepare. Both projects were allowed to continue as research efforts, and were transferred to the US Air Force when that force separated from the Army in 1947. The Air Force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled Thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their GAPA surface-to-air missile (SAM) efforts. The next year Wizard's funding was also <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> GAPA to develop a new long-range SAM design, which would emerge a decade later as the CIM-10 Bomarc. ABM research at the Air Force practically, although not officially, ended.|$|E
