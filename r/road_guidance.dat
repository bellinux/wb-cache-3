40|$|One of {{the basic}} driver tasks is to follow the road. In daytime driving, when the {{visibility}} of the road in clear weather is unobstructed, this is normally not a problem. However, when driving at night on dark roads with low beams, it is often quite difficult to see the direction the road is taking. Indeed, drivers state that poor <b>road</b> <b>guidance</b> is their main problem in night driving. To overcome this problem, roads are fitted with retroreflective pavement markings, which are visible in night driving. This {{study was conducted to}} review the role, effects, and functioning of lane marking in night driving. The report consists of five sections.

We propose a model of steering that explicitly embodies this idea, using both a “near point ” to maintain a central lane position and a “far point” to account for the upcoming roadway. Unlike control models that integrate near and far information to compute curvature or more complex features, our model relies solely on one perceptually-plausible feature of the near and far points, namely the visual direction to each point. The resulting parsimonious model can be run in simulation within a realistic highway environment to facilitate direct comparison between model and human behavior. Using such simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed two-point model is able to account for four interesting aspects of steering behavior: curve negotiation with occluded visual regions, corrective steering after a lateral drift, lane changing, and individual differences.

Indeed, the first users who seem strategically vital by the sponsor of the first system are not necessarily the same as those targeted by the sponsors of the second technology.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of navigation {{system is to}} provide route search and <b>road</b> <b>guidance</b> for safe driving for drivers.

In order to maintain the safe driving, rather than searching the shortest path, a navigation system, in which the danger areas and/or the dangerous time zones have been considered, is required. Therefore, in this paper we propose a strategy of searching a navigation path to avoid danger areas for safe driving by using the A * algorithm. In the strategy, when evaluating the path-specific fitness of the navigation nodes, different heuristic weights were assigned to different types of risk areas. In particular, we considered three kinds of danger areas, such as accident-prone sections where accidents occur frequently, school zones, and intersection regions, as well as the time slots when the probability of danger is high.

40|$|The vehicle tracking, {{navigation}} and <b>road</b> <b>guidance</b> applications {{are becoming more}} popular but the presently available digital maps are not suitable for many such applications. Among the drawbacks are the insufficient accuracy of road geometry and the delayed time in loading the unwanted data.

A simplified map building process to construct customized high-precision digital maps from floating car data obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers is presented in this paper. The data collected from the GPS receiver fixed in a moving car are used to construct the customized digital road maps. The approach consists of six successive steps: Collecting floating car data (FCD) for desired road segments in a log file; refining the log file; constructing the road segments using the data present in refined log file; merging the segments which has negligible slope; refining the road intersections; and labeling the points of interest.

Due to the relatively small number of motorcycle crashes, the criteria are different from the normal general blackspot program. According to the brief, since the program commenced in 2003, approximately 170 projects have been completed, divided into three main components: 1. blackspot projects, focussing on individual locations with adverse motorcycle crash histories, e. g. individual curves or intersections; 2. blacklength projects, also based on adverse motorcycle crash histories, which extend beyond a single location but are of limited extent; 3. long route projects, which are pro-active projects intended to improve the consistency of <b>road</b> conditions, <b>guidance</b> and delineation along routes carrying large numbers of motorcycles.

A literature review of current knowledge concerning age, visual performance, and accident involvement was carried out. This was followed by an analysis of the present vehicle lighting problems.

However, the urban environment presents great challenges for GNSS positioning since number of obstacles result in signal attenuations and blockages, which can cause large errors. Yet, for new GNSS land applications, knowing the certainty of one's localization is of great importance if we want to rely on it for toll, insurance or for railway signaling. The concept of GNSS integrity, which is defined as a measure of trust to be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by the total system, can help to meet this requirement. Although GNSS integrity has been firstly developed and formalized in the aviation field, the algorithms developed for the aerospace domain cannot be introduced directly to the GNSS land applications. This is because a high data redundancy exists in the aviation domain and a basic hypothesis that only one failure occurs at a time is made for aviation schemes, which are not the case for the urban users. It is a great challenge to extend the integrity monitoring algorithms to GNSS urban applications. This paper will highlight the need for new integrity monitoring systems and will illustrate the behaviour of existing solutions based on real data. In this paper, we will in particular compare and evaluate the performances of several Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) integrity monitoring algorithms as well as different weighting models...|$|E
40|$|When drivers do {{not have}} {{complete}} information on road travel time and thus choose their routes in a stochastic manner or based on their previous experience, separate implementations of either route guidance or road pricing cannot drive a stochastic network flow pattern towards a system optimum in a Wardropian sense. It is thus of interest to consider a combined route guidance and road pricing system. A <b>road</b> <b>guidance</b> system could reduce drivers' uncertainty of travel time through provision of traffic information. A driver who {{is equipped with a}} guidance system could be assumed to receive complete information, and hence be able to find the minimum travel time routes in a user-optimal manner, while marginal-cost road pricing could drive a user-optimal flow pattern toward a system optimum. Therefore, a joint implementation of route guidance and road pricing in a network with recurrent congestion could drive a stochastic network flow pattern towards a system optimum, and thus achieve a higher reduction in system travel time. In this paper the interaction between route guidance and road pricing is modeled and the potential benefit of their joint implementation is evaluated based on a mixed equilibrium traffic assignment model. The private and system benefits under marginal-cost pricing and varied levels of market penetration of the information systems are investigated with a small and a large example. It is concluded that the two technologies complement each other and that their joint implementation can reduce travel time more efficiently in a network with recurrent congestion...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, an {{investigation}} on lane and vehicle tracking {{on a highway}} is carried out. The highway is chosen as the test ground due to the one-way flow of traffic, relative straightness {{of the road and}} consists of mostly automobiles. This study describes the development of a mid-line generation technique on the <b>road</b> as <b>guidance</b> for drivers to stay in the centre of the road lane they are currently driving on. The technique detects and tracks road lane in a video sequence and draws a virtual mid-line on the screen to guide the driver to stay centred within the lane. As a safety measure, the system will notify the driver with a warning signal if the vehicle zigzags across the lane. If the driver crosses onto another lane, the system will automatically update the new detection on left and right boundaries of the new lane and calculate the mid-line. Furthermore, the system will classify the vehicle into their proper group in order to estimate the distance between the target vehicle and the preceding vehicle. The system works thoroughly when the edges of the preceding vehicle are detected. The detected edges will create a bounding box. The box will be recognised by the back-propagation artificial neural network to classify it into heavy or light vehicle group. Based {{on the size of the}} bounding box, the system will then estimate the distance within the target vehicle and the preceding vehicle. To that effect, the objective of this study is to develop a low cost competitive safety system on the road.
