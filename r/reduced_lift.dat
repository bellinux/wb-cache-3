25|$|A {{rear spoiler}} usually comes {{standard}} in most sports vehicles and resembles {{the shape of}} a raised wing {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The main purpose of a rear spoiler in a vehicle's design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A rear spoiler design that stands off the rear deck lid will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the coefficient of drag. Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> are not required.|$|E

50|$|In aeronautics, a spoiler (sometimes {{called a}} lift spoiler or lift dumper) is a device {{intended}} to intentionally <b>reduce</b> the <b>lift</b> component of an airfoil {{in a controlled}} way. Most often, spoilers are plates on the top surface of a wing that can be extended upward into the airflow to spoil it. By so doing, the spoiler creates a controlled stall over {{the portion of the}} wing behind it, greatly <b>reducing</b> the <b>lift</b> of that wing section. Spoilers differ from airbrakes in that airbrakes are designed to increase drag without affecting <b>lift,</b> while spoilers <b>reduce</b> <b>lift</b> as well as increasing drag.|$|R

2500|$|... 1. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} an increase in vertical descent speed that resulted from changes in lifting gas volume during the extended stay at maximum altitude and subsequent descent into warmer atmospheric medium which further <b>reduced</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Through 2016, the Navy {{will look}} to {{incorporate}} other important service-life enhancements: Engine upgrades (ETF-40B configuration) that will provide additional power and lift particular in hot (43 °C, 110 °F, and higher) environments, reduced fuel consumption, reduced maintenance needs, and <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> footprint; Replacement of the buoyancy box to solve corrosion problems, incorporate hull improvements, and [...] "reset" [...] the fatigue-limit [...] "clock"; Incorporation of a new (deep) skirt that will reduce drag, increase performance envelope over water and land, and reduce maintenance requirements.|$|E
50|$|In the past, coal gas, {{a mixture}} of hydrogen, carbon {{monoxide}} and other gases, was also used in balloons. It was widely available and cheap; the down side was a higher density (<b>reducing</b> <b>lift)</b> and the high toxicity of the carbon monoxide.|$|R
50|$|The Ridge Rocket chair {{has a small}} lodge at its base, and {{the base}} of the Bullet chair is very near the main village. The new 6-seater lift (the Snow Ghost Express) was built for the 2006-2007 season {{parallel}} to Ridge Rocket Express to <b>reduce</b> <b>lift</b> lines.|$|R
50|$|Spoilers {{fall into}} two categories: those that are {{deployed}} at controlled angles during flight to increase descent rate or control roll, {{and those that are}} fully deployed immediately on landing to greatly <b>reduce</b> <b>lift</b> ("lift dumpers") and increase drag. In modern fly-by-wire aircraft, the same set of control surfaces serve both functions.|$|R
50|$|Internal blown flaps {{were used}} on some carrier and {{land-based}} fast jets in the 1960s, including the Lockheed F-104, Blackburn Buccaneer and certain {{versions of the}} Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21. They generally fell from favour because they imposed a significant maintenance overhead in keeping the ductwork clean and various valve systems working properly, along with the disadvantage that an engine failure <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> in precisely the situation where it is most desired. The concept reappeared {{in the form of}} upper and lower blowing in several transport aircraft, both turboprop and turbofan.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} are 92 ft below {{street level}} and are 250 ft long; {{shorter than the}} GNP&BR's standard length of 350 ft.

50|$|Research {{indicated}} that the aircraft had only managed to maintain level flight at first due to its high air speed (280 knots). The damage to the right wing, resulting in <b>reduced</b> <b>lift,</b> had made {{it much more difficult}} to keep it level. At 280 kn, there was nevertheless sufficient lift on the right wing to keep the aircraft aloft. Once it had to reduce speed for landing, however, it was doomed; there was too little lift on the right wing to enable stable flight, and the aircraft banked sharply to the right without any chance of recovery.|$|E
5000|$|For a space elevator, {{the cost}} varies {{according}} to the design. Bradley C. Edwards received funding from NIAC from 2001 to 2003 to write a paper, describing a space elevator design. In it he stated that: [...] "The first space elevator would <b>reduce</b> <b>lift</b> costs immediately to $100 per pound" [...] ($220/kg).|$|R
2500|$|Aeros has {{developed}} a technology to avoid the need for ballast, which they call [...] "control of static heaviness (COSH)". The main gas bag is inflated with helium to create lift for takeoff, then on landing some of the gas is re-compressed into a storage tank to partially deflate the gas bag and <b>reduce</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ammonia is {{sometimes}} used to fill weather balloons. Due to its high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia {{could potentially be}} refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to <b>reduce</b> <b>lift</b> and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add <b>lift</b> and <b>reduce</b> ballast). Ammonia gas is relatively heavy, poisonous, and an irritant.|$|R
50|$|An {{unwanted}} {{side effect}} of aileron operation is adverse yaw—a yawing moment {{in the opposite direction}} to the roll. Using the ailerons to roll an aircraft to the right produces a yawing motion to the left. As the aircraft rolls, adverse yaw is caused partly by the change in drag between the left and right wing. The rising wing generates increased lift, which causes increased induced drag. The descending wing generates <b>reduced</b> <b>lift,</b> which causes reduced induced drag. Profile drag caused by the deflected ailerons may add further to the difference, along with changes in the lift vectors as one rotates back while the other rotates forward.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the week}} of 15-22 April, no fewer than five 58th wing B-29s crashed near Karachi, all from {{overheated}} engines. The cause was traced {{to the design of}} the engine cowl flaps which controlled air flow over the cylinders. There were also problems with exhaust valves and valve guides on the engine. The B-29 was an advanced aeronautical design which had not been fully tested before being deployed overseas. The Wright 3350 tended to overheat partially due to reduced airflow over the rear cylinders due to restricted space caused by the cowl flap design. Additional complications leading to overheating were caused by operations in the tropical heat of India and by flying with maximum loads. The lower air pressures produced by the high ambient heat <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> and engine performance. The result was engine fires and crashes on take off.|$|E
50|$|In flight, {{droplets}} of supercooled water often exist in stratiform and cumulus clouds. They form into ice {{when they are}} struck by the wings of passing airplanes and abruptly crystallize. This disrupts airflow over the wing, <b>reducing</b> <b>lift,</b> so aircraft {{that are expected to}} fly in such conditions are equipped with a de-icing system.|$|R

50|$|During {{its service}} life, the H-5/HO3S-1 {{was used for}} utility, rescue, and mercy {{missions}} throughout the world, including flights during Operation Highjump in the Antarctic. While the extra power of the H-5 made it significantly more useful than its R-4 and R-6 cousins, the H-5/HO3S-1 suffered, like most early small tandem-seat single-rotor machines, from center of gravity problems. As a matter of routine, the helicopter was equipped with two iron-bar weights - each in a canvas case - one of 25 lb & one of 50 lb. Flying with no passengers, both weights were placed forward alongside the pilot. With three passengers, both weights were normally placed in the baggage compartment. However, in conditions of high ambient temperatures, which <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> due to the lowered air density, all weights were jettisoned. If the weights could not be recovered later, pilots on future missions were forced to utilize rocks or other improvised weights next to the pilot after offloading three passengers, or else travel at a very slow 25 kn.|$|E
5000|$|... 2006 saw the {{introduction}} of a completely new model, known as FZ1 in USA. In Europe and other markets, it was known as FZ1-S Fazer alongside a similar naked (without-fairing) version which was known as FZ1-N. The main changes included a new chassis, suspension, body work and a completely new engine, never seen before in the big Fazer. Cast aluminum die-cast diamond-shaped frame with the engine as stressed member replaced the older tubular steel frame along with a control-filled die-cast swingarm. This brought the bike up to date with modern rivals. The new model has a 150 bhp - 998 cc DOHC 20-valve engine from the 2004-2006 R1 tuned for better midrange torque, set in an all-new compact diamond-shaped aluminium frame. Most of this engine is identical to the sister YZF-R1's. The primary internal changes are a 40 percent heavier crankshaft and revised balance shaft. [...] New camshafts with <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> and duration aim to boost performance at lower revs, and the gearbox's top two ratios are higher to give a more relaxed feel at cruising speeds. Modifications are as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|The British epitomized this shift. Their {{standard}} early war fighters mounted eight [...]303 in calibre machine guns, but by mid-war {{they often}} featured {{a combination of}} machine guns and 20 mm cannons, and late in the war often only cannons. The Americans, in contrast, had problems producing a native cannon design, so instead placed multiple [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) heavy machine guns on their fighters. Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and air-to-surface ordnance such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings, and pressed into close air support roles as fighter-bombers. Although they carried less ordnance than light and medium bombers, and generally had a shorter range, they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability {{made it easier for}} them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles. Moreover, if they encountered enemy fighters, their ordnance (which <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> and increased drag and therefore decreased performance) could be jettisoned and they could engage the enemy fighters, which eliminated the need for the fighter escorts that bombers required. Heavily armed and sturdily constructed fighters such as Germany's Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Britain's Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest, and America's P-40, Corsair, P-47 and P-38 all excelled as fighter-bombers, and since the Second World War ground attack has been an important secondary capability of many fighters.|$|E
5000|$|Spoilerons. An {{upper surface}} spoiler that also acts to <b>reduce</b> <b>lift</b> (equivalent to {{deflecting}} an aileron upwards), so causing the aircraft to {{bank in the}} direction of the turn—the angle of roll causes the wing lift to act {{in the direction of}} turn, reducing the amount of drag required to turn the aircraft's longitudinal axis.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{airships}} {{often make}} use of aerodynamic lift by using their elevators to set a nose-up attitude so that {{the main body of}} the airship provides some lift as it flies along; however, this is typically done to counteract minor out-of-trim conditions, and it is as likely that the nose may need to be pointed down to <b>reduce</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{hydrodynamic}} discrete sources is applied for two-dimensional modeling of stepped planing surfaces. The water surface deformations, wetted hull lengths, and pressure distribution are calculated at given hull attitude and Froude number. Pressurized air cavities that improve hydrodynamic performance {{can also be}} modeled with the current method. Presented results include validation examples, parametric calculations of a single-step hull, effect of trim tabs, and performance of an infinite series of periodic stepped surfaces. It is shown that transverse steps can lead to higher lift-drag ratio, although at <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> capability, in comparison with a stepless hull. Performance of a multi-step configuration is sensitive to the wave pattern between hulls, which depends on Froude number and relative hull spacing...|$|E
40|$|To {{maintain}} {{the quality of}} the feathers, birds regularly undergo moult. It is widely accepted that moult affects flight performance, but the specific aerodynamic consequences have received relatively little attention. Here we measured the components of aerodynamic drag from the wake behind a gliding jackdaw (Corvus monedula) at different stages of its natural wing moult. We found that span efficiency was <b>reduced</b> (<b>lift</b> induced drag increased) and the wing profile drag coefficient was increased. Both effects best correlated with the corresponding reduction in spanwise camber. The negative effects are partially mitigated by adjustments of wing posture to minimize gaps in the wing, and by weight loss to reduce wing loading. By studying the aerodynamic consequences of moult, we can refine our understanding of the emergence of various moulting strategies found among birds...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} studies at NAL and elsewhere {{have revealed that}} {{the performance of a}} combat aircraft can be improved by the addition of strakes to wing moderated aspect ratio. At high angles of attack, the swept, sharp leading edge strake, produces a spiral at the leading adge and an attached floe behind it. This type of spirally rolled up paper cone vertox induces a wider low pressure region, resulting in increased lift and <b>reduced</b> <b>lift</b> dependent drag. The important strake plane form parameters are strake area ratio, leading adge sweep etc. The approximate estimation of lift for the strake wing agree reasonably well with the experimental data when the vortex noise in the calculation, Strakes have been used on the aerodynamics and northrop aerocrafts and claimed that they have derived considerable performance gains due to the strakes...|$|E
