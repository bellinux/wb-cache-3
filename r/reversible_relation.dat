40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} rather {{striking}} {{manner in which}} at key moments {{in the history of}} philosophy, in the discipline’s attempts at self-definition, the genre or literary form of poetry plays a key role. Philosophy, at these moments, has been defined, inter alia, as the enemy of poetry, the guiding light for the philosopher who can only try and inevitably fail to emulate its brilliance, or as the anomalous guest at the philosophical table with whom the host discipline has relations which result in either generative or degenerative effects. Insofar as it lays claim to or liaises with philosophy – as we have come to know it today – poetry has thus played a part in the self-definition of genre theory. The aim of this chapter is to capture a very specific set of transfers, transpositions, metonymies and other modes of <b>reversible</b> <b>relations</b> of substitution and surrogacy between philosophy and poetry, and along the way between genre-theory-as-philosophy and poetry...|$|R
40|$|I {{provide an}} {{alternative}} {{way of seeing}} quantum computation. First, I describe an idealized classical problem solving machine that, thanks to a many body interaction, reversibly and nondeterministically produces {{the solution of the}} problem under the simultaneous influence of all the problem constraints. This requires a perfectly accurate, rigid, and <b>reversible</b> <b>relation</b> between the coordinates of the machine parts - the machine can be considered the many body generalization of another perfect machine, the bounching ball model of reversible computation. The mathematical description of the machine, as it is, is applicable to quantum problem solving, an extension of the quantum algorithms that comprises the physical representation of the problem-solution interdependence. The perfect relation between the coordinates of the machine parts is transferred to the populations of the reduced density operators of the parts of the computer register. The solution of the problem is reversibly and nondeterministically produced under the simultaneous influence of the state before measurement and the quantum principle. At the light of the present notion of simultaneous computation, the quantum speed up turns out to be "precognition" of the solution, namely the reduction of the initial ignorance of the solution due to backdating, to before running the algorithm, a time-symmetric part of the state vector reduction on the solution; as such, it is bounded by state vector reduction through an entropic inequality.

40|$|The City of Rakvere/Estonia has {{organized}} an open international architectural {{competition for the}} design of Arvo Part's Hall by reconstruction of Rakvere's St Paul's church (nowadays sport venue) and planning the surrounding area called Vabaduse Square (Freedom Square). Our team participated with a project with the entry name CHOICE. We focused on making a new urban identity for Vabaduse Square, which should, at the same time, emphasize the main qualities of the site, of the town, in the existing circumstances. We proposed a continuous space for music and cultural events, variable, fluctuating, to give a chance to everybody to make its CHOICE in a large scale of convenient occasions (for an event or another, at a chosen time, regardless the number of participants) in both urban and architectural approaches. We conceived the extension of St. Paul’s Church to assure a total flexibility for the desired activities and open possibilities for the improvised ones. The entire building {{can be used as a}} whole, or can be divided in independent parts, each one with different time schedules, different entrances, and different users. We have chosen an austere expression for the inside and outside appearance of the building, in agreement with the austere Lutheran image of the church.

40|$|From the {{introduction}} to the book: Presenting a series of musical case studies. [Robert] Sholl focusses on three aspects of masochistic interaction in musical listening: first, the oscillation of reversibility of role play; second, the dissolution of narrative into fantasy; and third, the desire for but absence of fulfilment and synthesis. Throughout his case studies, Sholl explores how listening is inscribed at the limits of identification, ecstasy. and the phantasmic, respectively. Its liminal position is closely associated with a logic of embodiment as it take place "right at" the body as the site of masochism's endless (and painful) delays and deferrals. The first part of Sholl's triptych reinterprets Adorno's critique of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring as a reading of spectators' <b>reversible</b> <b>relation</b> to the girl who is chosen to dance her sacrificial dance. In order to understand a listener's relation to the girl, Sholl argues, it is first of all necessary to acknowledge the opacity of her body. While the work appears to invite an identification with power, it is in fact a masochistic reversal that dominates the scene. Embodying the Law of the Father, the girl's (ultimately silent, dead) body deflects and reverses the aural gaze to confront the listener and to occasion a diagnostic auscultation at the borders of life and death. The second part of Sholl's essay turns towards Saint Francis's ecstasy in Olivier Messiaen's opera St François d’Assise, Dissecting the opera's representation of Francis's spiritual development, Sholl argues that musical silences and dissonances in the work resist the phantasmic bridging of the gap between the human and divine that is suggested by the narrative. They create apertures for the listener to experience the self as contingent and to become aware of a certain "neutralisation of religion" in the opera. Listening to St François appears as a confrontation with the absence of death of God - a movement that began with the crucifixion and that, according to Sholl, is answered by Mosche Feldenkrais's concept of maturation. Finally Sholl completes his triptych by examining Cathy Berberian's visceral rendering of Luciano Berio's 1960 s work Visages, again bringing the body in full focus as a site of liminal aurally. Placing the work in a postwar musical historiography informed by attempts at aural control over the listener, the vocal performance by Berberian is read {{as an example of how}} masochistic reversibility may ultimately, and surprisingly, provide a point of listening on the aural, granular self-relation to the other. Berberian, Sholl argues, supremely in control as she is over the phantasmic dimension of listening, opens her body so as to allow the listener to "hear her hearing herself from within. " Such reconnecting by reversing power and rationality returns listening to a more mature, embodied, bur also aporetic spontaneity reminiscent of Adorno's vision of an "informal" music to come...|$|E
40|$|The {{conflicting}} arguments {{given in}} the discussion forum of Metamaterials 2011 on the possible forms of macroscopic Maxwell equations are lead to a convergence by noting the relationship among the employed material variables for each scheme. The three schemes by Chipouline et al. using (A) standard P and M (Casimir form), (B) generalized electric polarization P_LL (Landau-Lifshitz form), (C) generalized magnetic polarization M_A (Anapole form) are compared with (D) the present author's scheme using standard current density J.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of phenotypic plasticity indicates <b>reversible</b> <b>relations</b> of different cancer cell phenotypes, which extends the cellular hierarchy {{proposed by the}} classical cancer stem cell (CSC) theory. Since it is still question able if the phenotypic plasticity is a crucial improvement to the hierarchical model or just a minor extension to it, it is worthwhile to explore the dynamic behavior characterizing the reversible phenotypic plasticity. In this study we compare the hierarchical model and the reversible model in predicting the cell-state dynamics observed in biological experiments. Our {{results show that the}} hierarchical model shows significant disadvantages over the reversible model in describing both long-term stability (phenotypic equilibrium) and short-term transient dynamics (overshoot) of cancer cells. In a very specific case in which the total growth of population due to each cell type is identical, the hierarchical model predicts neither phenotypic equilibrium nor overshoot, whereas thereversible model succeeds in predicting both of them. Even though the performance of the hierarchical model can be improved by relaxing the specific assumption, its prediction to the phenotypic equilibrium strongly depends on a precondition that may be unrealistic in biological experiments, and it also fails to capture the overshoot of CSCs. By comparison, it is more likely for the reversible model to correctly describe the stability of the phenotypic mixture and various types of overshoot behavior. Comment: 24 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

We isolate a class of binary structures such that a structure from the class is reversible iff the sequence of cardinalities of its connectivity components is reversible. In particular, we characterize <b>reversible</b> equivalence <b>relations,</b> <b>reversible</b> posets which are disjoint unions of cardinals ≤ω, and some similar structures. In addition, we show that a poset with linearly ordered connectivity components is reversible, if the corresponding sequence of cardinalities is reversible and, using this fact, detect a wide class of examples of reversible posets and topological spaces.

40|$|In Contact Mechanics and Tribology, {{adhesion}} is {{the conservative}} <b>reversible</b> normal <b>relation</b> (contiguity) and attractive interaction (tension) at {{the interface between}} two materials in contact. ”Deadhesion ” or rather decohesion, {{is the loss of}} adhesion. In Fracture Mechanics and Rheology, debonding is usually interpreted as a crack propagating along the material pair interface at the microscale and as damage at the macroscale. This study is motivated by the fibre-matrix debonding which occurs in glass fibre reinforced epoxy matrix composites and decreases their strength. In this note, we focus our attention on the identification of the adhesive properties between glass and epoxy. The basic adhesive property, entering a normal adhesion-decohesion law relating the normal tensile stress pn to the normal gap gn at an interface, is the surface energy of adhesion (per unit area) ω (of Dupré). It represents the local work dissipated during the decohesion process (i. e. at the particle pair or con-tinuum elementary area microscale). In several contact mechanics models of adhesion-decohesion, the surface energy ω is equal to the product of two other basic adhesive properties, namely the adhesion peak stress pin and the decohesion rupture gap γn, or rather a fraction of it (e. g. one half) ...|$|R

This mainstream myth {{expressed in terms}} of capitalism and sexism boasted of out-doing the Western and Chinese colonizers in the capitalist game. Since the return to Chinese sovereignty, repeated financial crises, intensified neoliberalization of governance and the resulting increased monopolization of wealth and power, mainstream Hong Kong cultural myths and values have been shaken to the core. Political and socio-economic reforms also repeatedly failed in the hands of Hong Kong’s default operational logic, and structural injustices remain unresolved. Popular Hong Kong films released in 2010 seem to converge in collective soul searching through shifts in the representations of mainstream masculinity and local identity politics. The gender and cultural sensitivity of the generation coming of age in this millennium are represented as different. Cocky boastfulness gives way to the recognition of internal inadequacies and injustices and the respect for hard-earned wisdom and mastery. This is also reflected in the overturning of film genres representative of the heyday of Hong Kong. "Once a Gangster" is an anti-gangster gangster film. "La Comédie Humaine" is an anti-heoric killer film. "Gallants" is a tribute to unsung kungfu masters past their prime and "Break Up Club" is about {{a very different kind of}} mainstream boyfriend.

40|$|Analyses of {{cyclic loading}} {{of a plane}} strain mode I crack under {{small-scale}} yielding are carried out using discrete dislocation dynamics. The formulation {{is the same as}} used to analyze crack growth under monotonic loading conditions, differing only in the remote stress intensity factor being a cyclic function of time. The dislocations are all of edge character and are modeled as line singularities in an elastic solid. The lattice resistance to dislocation motion, dislocation nucleation, dislocation interaction with obstacles and dislocation annihilation are incorporated into the formulation through a set of constitutive rules. Either <b>reversible</b> or irreversible <b>relations</b> are specified between the opening traction and the displacement jump across a cohesive surface ahead of the initial crack tip in order to simulate cyclic loading as could occur in a vacuum or in an oxidizing environment, respectively. In accord with experimental data we find that the fatigue threshold ΔKth is weakly dependent on the load ratio R when the reversible cohesive surface is employed. This intrinsic dependence of the threshold on R is an outcome of source limited plasticity at low R values and plastic shakedown at higher R values. On the other hand, ΔKth is seen to decrease approximately linearly with increasing R followed by a plateau when the irreversible cohesive law is used. Our simulations show that in this case the fatigue threshold is dominated by crack closure at low values of R. Calculations illustrating the effects of obstacle density, tensile overloads and slip geometry on cyclic crack growth behavior are also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{stiffness}} {{at small}} strains of compacted cemented-mixed well-graded gravelly soil was studied previously by other researchers [1]. In this present study, {{the effect of}} global unloading/reloading history on the Eeq values of the same material was studied. The small strain stiffness of geomaterial is usually evaluated by either dynamic tests (i. e., resonant column tests and wave propagation tests) or static tests (i. e., monotonic or cyclic loading tests measuring stresses and strains) or both. In the present study, by {{taking into account the}} fact that the specimen of compacted well-graded gravelly soil are not sufficiently homogeneous so that the wave velocity be representative of average small strain stiffness of a given specimen, the static tests were employed. To this end, a single or multiple unload/reload cycle(s) with a single amplitude axial strain of an order of 0. 001 % is (are) usually applied at different isotropic stress states or anisotropic stress states during otherwise monotonic loading, ML, of triaxial compression (TC) test, for example. The elastic young’s modulus, Ee, is ideally defined as the slope of a fully <b>reversible</b> cyclic stress-strain <b>relation.</b> However, it is actually not the case due to viscous property and non-linear inviscid stress – strain relation. For this reason, when a small unload/reload cycle is applied during otherwise ML, the overall stress-strain relation is shifted toward larger strains due to the viscous behaviour of the test material. The peak-to-peak secant modulus from a unload/reload cycle is defined as the equivalent Young’s modulus, Eeq, as shown in Figure 1. However, this value may be somehow different from the truly elastic modulus for the reason described above. Abbas Taher...|$|R
40|$|The Vaseline-gap {{technique}} {{was used to}} record asymmetric charge movement in small segments of muscle fibres from the white sternomastoid or the soleus muscle of the rabbit. At 22 degrees C, non-linear ionic currents (Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca 2 +) were virtually eliminated for potential steps to 0 mV or below by specific blocking agents or ion substitution. A Boltzmann fit of charge movement (Q) vs. potential (V) produced the mean values Qmax = 15. 2 nC/microF, V = - 26. 8 mV and k = 15. 3 mV for twenty-three sternomastoid fibres, and 4. 8 nC/microF, - 32 mV and 13. 7 mV for seven soleus fibres. Qmax for the sternomastoid fibres {{was similar to that}} for other fast-twitch fibres when normalized by surface area rather than capacitance. Using a 55 ms step, the mean threshold potential (Vth) for contraction in twenty-eight fibres was - 25. 9 (+/- 2. 9) mV (+/- S. E. of mean), and the mean amount of charge moved (qth) at the threshold potential was 8. 5 (+/- 0. 4) nC/microF. In some contracting fibres, a component of charge movement was observed which was analogous to q gamma in amphibian muscle in its time course and potential dependence. Addition of 80 mM-sucrose to the external solution increased the speed of both the asymmetric charge movement and the charging of the linear capacitance of each fibre. The effect was <b>reversible.</b> A clear <b>relation</b> between the time course of these two parameters was established, and this strongly indicated {{that the majority of the}} asymmetric charge was located in the transverse tubular system or beyond. Moreover, it was shown that at 22 degrees C nearly all asymmetric charge moved in less than 0. 5 ms after depolarization of the T-system. Sucrose in the external solution affected the Q vs. V relation, steepening the curve and shifting it to more negative potentials, as well as slightly increasing Qmax. The actions of sucrose strongly suggest that it effectively dilates and/or shortens the transverse tubular system, probably by osmotic effects...|$|R
40|$|The book {{covers the}} flux pinning {{mechanisms}} and properties and the electromagnetic phenomena {{caused by the}} flux pinning common for metallic, high-Tc and MgB 2 superconductors. The condensation energy interaction known for normal precipitates or grain boundaries and the kinetic energy interaction proposed for artificial Nb pins in Nb-Ti, etc., are introduced for the pinning mechanism. Summation theories to derive the critical current density are discussed in detail. Irreversible magnetization and AC loss caused by the flux pinning are also discussed. The loss originally stems from the ohmic dissipation of normal electrons in the normal core driven by the electric field induced by the flux motion. The readers will learn why the resultant loss is of hysteresis type in spite of such mechanism. The influence of the flux pinning on the vortex phase diagram in high Tc superconductors is discussed, and the dependencies of the irreversibility field are also described on other quantities such as anisotropy of superconductor, specimen size and electric field strength. Recent developments of critical current properties in various high-Tc superconductors and MgB 2 are introduced. Other topics are: singularity {{in the case of}} transport current in a parallel magnetic field such as deviation from the Josephson <b>relation,</b> <b>reversible</b> flux motion inside pinning potentials which causes deviation from the critical state model prediction, the concept of the minimization of energy dissipation in the flux pinning phenomena which gives the basis for the critical state model, etc. Significant reduction in the AC loss in AC wires with very fine filaments originates from the reversible flux motion which is dominant in the two-dimensional pinning. The concept of minimum energy dissipation explains also the behavior of flux bundle size which determines the irreversibility line under the flux creep. The new edition has been thoroughly updated, with new sections on the progress in enhancing the critical current density in high temperature superconductors by introduction of artificial pinning centers, the effect of packing density on the critical current density and irreversibility field in MgB 2 and derivation of the force-balance equation from the minimization of the free energy including the pinning energy...|$|R
