5|$|As {{it became}} clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, {{although}} violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued {{off the coast of}} Brazil for many years and the Imbituba land station processed <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{southern}} <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> are seen with rolls of fats behind blowholes that northern species often lack, {{and these are}} regarded {{as a sign of}} better health condition due to sufficient nutrition supply, and could have contributed in vast differences in recovery status between <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in southern and northern hemisphere, other than direct impacts by mankind.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy {{right whale}} shares several {{characteristics}} with the <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> although having dorsal fins separates them from <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> {{and they have a}} very distinctive jaw configuration. Pygmy right whales' heads are no more than one-fourth the size of their bodies, whereas the right whales' heads are about one-third the size of their bodies.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Rosenbaum et al. disagreed, {{based on}} data from their genetic study of DNA samples from each of the whale populations. Genetic {{evidence}} now clearly demonstrates that the northern and southern populations of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> have not interbred for between 3 million and 12 million years, confirming the southern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> as a distinct species. The northern Pacific and Atlantic populations are also distinct, with the North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> being more closely related to the southern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> than to the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> Genetic differences between E. japonica (north pacific) and E. australis (south pacific) are much smaller than other baleen whales represent among different ocean basins.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii) is a {{small and}} slender species of mammal found in cool waters of the Southern Hemisphere. The dolphin {{is one of two}} species of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> dolphin; Lissodelphis, the other, the northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> dolphin, is found in deep oceans of the Northern Hemisphere.|$|R
50|$|Cosmopolitan {{species may}} be found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. However, {{northern}} and southern populations become genetically separated over time. In some species, this separation leads eventually to a divergence of the species, such as produced the southern <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> and North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> Migratory species' reproductive sites often lie in the tropics and their feeding grounds in polar regions.|$|R
5|$|A large {{population}} spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> as the <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (<b>right</b> <b>whales)</b> and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis).|$|E

50|$|III. Mealy-mouthed {{porpoise}} (Lissodelphis peronii, {{the southern}} <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> dolphin).

5|$|Unlike other whales (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} the males. Sexual {{dimorphism}} is usually reversed, with the males being larger, but the females of all baleen whales are usually five percent larger than males. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed through whale song, notably in humpback whales where the males of the species sing elaborate songs. Male <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> have bigger callosities than female <b>right</b> <b>whales.</b> The males are generally more scarred than females which {{is thought to be}} because of aggression during mating season.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> with catches of up to 39,000 <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are the <b>right</b> <b>whales.</b> These {{animals have}} very large heads, {{which can make}} {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E

5|$|Freshwater {{fish species}} in Massachusetts include bass, carp, catfish, and trout, while {{saltwater}} {{species such as}} Atlantic cod, haddock, and American lobster populate offshore waters. Other marine species include Harbor seals, the endangered North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> as well as humpback whales, fin whales, minke whales, and Atlantic white-sided dolphins.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray whale}} {{has been placed}} {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and the rorquals. The gray whale is the only benthic feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|Vocalizations made by <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> are not {{elaborate}} {{compared to those}} made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may {{be a form of}} communication between whales within the same group. Northern <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts {{to reduce the number of}} ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.|$|E
40|$|The North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (Eubalaena glacialis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critically}} endangered whales in the world. A favorite target of whalers as early as 1000 years ago, it was considered the “right” whale to hunt because it was large, slow moving and would often float after being killed. The whale was hunted for its baleen and the oil extracted from its blubber. Pre-whaling abundance estimates are unknown but after prolonged whaling the species may have numbered as few as 85 individuals by the 19 th century. Despite international protection from whaling since 1935 the <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> has failed to recover, presently numbering fewer than 400 individuals. Surveys and assessments in the latter half of the 20 th century demonstrated that the <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was not extinct, prompting protection in the United States and endangered status in Canada. Further studies showed that anthropogenic causes of mortality mainly from fishery entanglements and vessel collisions were inhibiting its recovery. In the U. S. the <b>Right</b> <b>Whale</b> Recovery Plan and the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan as well as ship strike reduction measures were implemented and continue to be modified. In Canada, the <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> received added protections through designation of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> conservation areas’, “Areas to be Avoided” and Bay of Fundy Traffic Separation Schemes. Recently the <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in Canada and a recovery strategy is under development...|$|R

5|$|The {{cladogram}} is a {{tool for}} visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa; the point where each node branches is analogous to an evolutionary branching – the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to {{the relationships between the}} three <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and the bowhead whale.|$|E
5|$|The right whales' two known predators are {{humans and}} orcas. When danger lurks, {{a group of}} <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which {{sometimes}} proves to be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, {{the sheer size of}} this animal is its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. <b>Right</b> <b>whales</b> ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> than to the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (<b>right</b> <b>whales),</b> Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (<b>right</b> <b>whales),</b> Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Basque {{people were}} the first to hunt <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> commercially, {{beginning}} as early as the 11th century in the Bay of Biscay. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the animal was also used for food. Basque whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last Basque voyages were made before the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. Basque shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Right</b> <b>whale</b> {{dolphins}} are cetaceans {{belonging to}} the genus Lissodelphis. It contains the northern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis) and the southern <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii). These cetaceans are predominantly black, white beneath, {{and one of the}} few without a dorsal fin or ridge. They are smaller members of the delphinid family, oceanic dolphins, and very slender. Despite scientists being long acquainted with the species (the Northern species was identified by Peale in 1848 and the Southern by La Cépède in 1804), little is known about them in terms of life history and behaviour.|$|R
60|$|Ere this, {{you must}} have plainly seen {{the truth of what}} I started with-- that the Sperm <b>Whale</b> and the <b>Right</b> <b>Whale</b> have almost entirely {{different}} heads. To sum up, then: in the <b>Right</b> <b>Whale's</b> there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the <b>Right</b> <b>Whale</b> has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.|$|R
