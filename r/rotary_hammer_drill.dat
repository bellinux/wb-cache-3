50|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> (also {{known as}} a rotary hammer, roto hammer drill or masonry drill) {{combines}} a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate rotation mechanism, and is used for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete. Generally, standard chucks and drills are inadequate and chucks such as SDS and carbide drills that {{have been designed to}} withstand the percussive forces are used. Some styles of this tool are intended for masonry drilling only and the hammer action cannot be disengaged. Other styles allow the drill to be used without the hammer action for normal drilling, or hammering to be used without rotation for chiselling. In 1813 Richard Trevithick designed a steam-driven rotary drill, also the first drill to be powered by steam.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the cam-type hammer drill, a rotary/pneumatic hammer drill accelerates only the bit. This is accomplished through a piston design, rather than a spinning cam. Rotary hammers have much less vibration and penetrate most building materials. They {{can also be used}} as [...] "drill only" [...] or as [...] "hammer only" [...] which extends their usefulness for tasks such as chipping brick or concrete. Hole drilling progress is greatly superior to cam-type hammer drills, and these drills are generally used for holes of 19 mm (3/4 inch) or greater in size. A typical application for a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>drill</b> is boring large holes for lag bolts in foundations, or installing large lead anchors in concrete for handrails or benches.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of drillhole ER- 12 - 1 {{was to determine}} the hydrogeology of paleozoic carbonate rocks and of the Eleana Formation, a regional aquitard, in an area potentially downgradient from underground nuclear testing conducted in nearby Rainier Mesa. This objective was addressed through the drilling of well ER- 12 - 1 at N 886, 640. 26 E 640, 538. 85 Nevada Central Coordinates. Drilling of the 1094 m (3588 ft) well began on July 19, 1991 and was completed on October 17, 1991. Drilling problems included hole deviation and hole instability that prevented the timely completion of this borehole. Drilling methods used include rotary tri-cone and <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>drilling</b> with conventional and reverse circulation using air/water, air/foam (Davis mix), and bentonite mud. Geologic cuttings and geophysical logs were obtained from the well. The rocks penetrated by the ER- 12 - 1 drillhole are a complex assemblage of Silurian, Devonian, and Mississippian sedimentary rocks that are bounded by numerous faults that show substantial stratigraphic offset. The final 7. 3 m (24 ft) of this hole penetrated an unusual intrusive rock of Cretaceous age. The geology of this borehole was substantially different from that expected, with the Tongue Wash Fault encountered at a much shallower depth, paleozoic rocks shuffled out of stratigraphic sequence, and the presence of an altered biotite-rich microporphyritic igneous rock {{at the bottom of the}} borehole. Conodont CAI analyses and rock pyrolysis analyses indicate that the carbonate rocks in ER- 12 - 1, as well as the intervening sheets of Eleana siltstone, have been thermally overprinted following movement on the faults that separate them. The probable source of heat for this thermal disturbance is the microporphyritic intrusion encountered at the bottom of the hole, and its age establishes that the major fault activity must have occurred prior to 102. 3 + 0. 5 Ma (middle Cretaceous) ...|$|R
40|$|The Piezoelectric <b>Rotary</b> <b>Hammer</b> <b>Drill</b> is {{designed}} to core through rock {{using a combination of}} rotation and high frequency hammering powered by a single piezoelectric actuator.

Through an iterative design process using models in ANSYS Finite Element software and a Mason's Equivalent Circuit model in MATLAB, a horn design was chosen for fabrication based on the predicted horn tip motion, electromechanical coupling, and neutral plane location. The design was then machined and a test bed assembled.

An Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) has been in development at JPL's Nondestructive Evaluation and Advanced Actuators (NDEAA) lab as an adaptable tool for many of these applications. The USDC uses a novel drive mechanism to transform the high frequency ultrasonic or sonic vibrations of the tip of a horn into a lower frequency sonic hammering of a drill bit through an intermediate free-flying mass. The USDC device idea has been implemented at various scales from handheld drills to large diameter coring devices. A series of computer programs that model the function and performance of the USDC device were developed and were later integrated into an automated modeling package.

40|$|Drill & Blast is a {{commonly}} used excavation method {{for the construction}} of underground openings (e. g. tunnels, caverns) in hardrock conditions worldwide. Wear of the employed tools may take place during dif-ferent steps of the working cycle, affecting a wide range of machinery and materials. Although excavators, dump trucks or conveyor belts are also permanently exposed to the excavated rock mass and therefore un-dergoing geologically influenced wear, the wear of the rock cutting tools (i. e. drilling bits, excavator chisels, picks) is the most expensive wear phenomenon. Drilling equipment and bit tool wear Common blasthole diameters range from 38 to 48 mm and are typically drilled by use of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> percussive <b>drilling</b> <b>hammers</b> (impact power of about 15 to 20 kW).

2500|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} <b>hammer</b> <b>drill,</b> which <b>hammers</b> the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust.
