5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a <b>restrike.</b> However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E
5|$|Section 201 amended {{legislation}} {{regarding the}} San Francisco Assay Office to allow coins to be minted there (as they previously were {{when it was}} the San Francisco Mint) {{until such time as}} the secretary certified that the mints of the United States were able to strike sufficient coins {{to meet the needs of}} the nation. It also repealed a provision of law not allowing gold or silver to be refined at the San Francisco facility. Section 202 increased the amount appropriated to expand Mint facilities (including the construction of the new Philadelphia Mint) from $30 million to $45 million. Section 9 of the Gold Standard Act of 1900 had required the Treasury Secretary to melt silver coins that were worn or no longer current, and <b>restrike</b> them into new ones; this was repealed by section 203 and the secretary was given authority to withdraw and melt all worn or uncurrent coins without needing to reuse the metal in coinage.|$|E

5|$|Following an {{increase}} in coin collecting among {{the public in the}} mid-nineteenth century, there arose considerable demand for older American coins. Mint Director James Ross Snowden began selling <b>restrikes</b> of Gobrecht dollars and trading them for rare medals (especially those depicting or relating to former President George Washington), which were then added to the Mint's coin collection, then known as a coin cabinet. The money generated from selling the <b>restrikes</b> went toward purchasing new items for the coin cabinet. The <b>restrikes</b> created under Snowden's tenure were likely struck in 1859 and 1860, but the practice was largely halted after the eruption of a public scandal; other Mint employees were creating and selling <b>restrikes</b> of early American coins for their own profit. All Gobrecht dollar <b>restrikes,</b> when tilted on their axis, depict the reverse eagle flying level, rather than upward as it is depicted on the coins struck during the official production run. It is unknown precisely why the orientation of the eagle was altered, though it is believed by many numismatists that Snowden did this intentionally to make <b>restrikes</b> distinguishable from originals. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggests that Snowden simply used the alignment because that was the same used on the Flying Eagle cent, which began production in 1856. Mint Engraver James B. Longacre, its designer, had borrowed Gobrecht and Peale's eagle reverse for the one-cent coin's obverse.|$|R

In 1924, the Christie family sold the island along with the mail contract and the MV Lerina to Martin Coles Harman, who proclaimed himself a king. Harman issued two coins of Half Puffin and One Puffin denominations in 1929, nominally equivalent to the British halfpenny and penny, resulting in his prosecution under the United Kingdom's Coinage Act of 1870. The House of Lords found him guilty in 1931, and he was fined £5 with fifteen guineas (£5 + £15.75) expenses. The coins were withdrawn and became collectors' items.

Electronic starters are not subject to wear and do not need replacing periodically, although they may fail like any other electronic circuit.

2500|$|This {{dramatic}} increase in prices has also led to unscrupulous sellers attempting to pass off prints from the Bohn Edition as originals, {{and it can be}} difficult for those unfamiliar with these practices {{to tell the difference between}} a <b>restrike</b> (commonly called [...] "a Bohn") and an original. The key indicators of a print coming from the Bohn Edition are (i) the presence of a number in the top, right-hand corner of the print (the number is most commonly in the image itself, but may be outside in the margin); (ii) the fact that the Bohn edition was issued without colouring; and (iii) the fact that the strikes for the main published volumes of the Bohn Edition were printed on both sides of the paper (the Bohn Edition of the so-called [...] "Suppressed Plates" [...] was, like the originals, printed on one side of the paper only). However, the fact that a print is single-sided does not mean that it is not a Bohn restrike: there are in existence many Bohns (for example, Light expelling Darkness) that bear a number, but which are printed on one side of the paper only. These single-sided numbered strikes are almost always printed on much higher quality paper than was used for the bound volumes, and the quality of the printing is usually much superior too, with more care having been taken to ensure a crisp impression. These impressions are believed to have been struck by Henry Bohn with a view to colouring them, and then selling them as high-quality single prints, in much the same way as the prints published in Gillray's lifetime. There are many example of such single-sided restrikes, both coloured and uncoloured. Since prices for Bohns are usually between one-tenth and one-twentieth of those for originals, unscrupulous sellers will go to great lengths to disguise the fact that a print is a Bohn. Some common methods include: (i) tortuously worded descriptions, which attempt to avoid disclosure of the fact the print is a <b>restrike</b> (although some sellers will just plain lie); (ii) if the number is outside the image, trimming the print to the very edges of the image; (iii) if the number is inside the image, carefully abrading the surface to obliterate the number; (iv) cutting strips of the image to remove the number; (v) laying the print to paper or framing it such that it is difficult to determine whether there is printing on the reverse; and (vi) adding colour.|$|E
2500|$|The President of the United States, {{authorized}} by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pleasure in presenting the Air Force Cross to Robinson Risner, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force, for extraordinary heroism {{in connection with}} military operations against an opposing armed force on 3 and 4 April 1965. On these dates Colonel Risner led two successive operations against vitally important and heavily defended targets. Performing {{in the role of}} air coordinator, Colonel Risner arrived over the target area before the main strike force, evaluated the effectiveness of each strike, redirected subsequent strikes, and provided flak suppression against defenses that would hinder delivery aircraft in the performance of their mission. On the initial attack, while exposing himself to heavy ground fire, with complete disregard for his personal safety, Colonel Risner's aircraft sustained a direct hit in the left forward bomb-bay area, filling the cockpit with smoke and fumes. He flew his badly damaged aircraft over heavily fortified hostile territory before successfully landing at a friendly airfield. On 4 April, he again led an attacking force of fighter aircraft on a <b>restrike</b> against the same target. Colonel Risner initiated the attack, directing his aircraft into the target in the face of heavy automatic ground fire. His aerial skill and heroic actions set an example for the others to follow. In the course of the operation, Colonel Risner's unit encountered the first MIG force committed in aerial combat against the U.S. Forces in Southeast Asia. However, he refused to be diverted from his primary mission of completing the destruction of the assigned targets. Colonel Risner's actions not only deprived the communist force of its vital supply route and much needed equipment but further served to emphasize the high degree of U.S. determination in Southeast Asia. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship and aggressiveness, Colonel Risner reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.|$|E

50|$|In 1688, Castaing {{proposed}} {{a method of}} reshaping and <b>restriking</b> existing coins, both {{as a response to}} counterfeiting and to help the Louis XIV raise money to support the Nine Years' War. The French government approved Castaing's method, because it was considerably less costly than the alternative method of melting the coins before <b>restriking</b> them. A Paris tinsmith, Martin Masselin, was chosen to undertake the job of annealing, blanching, and edge-marking the recoined pieces; he was paid fourteen deniers for each coin, with an additional 17 deniers for each restruck within {{the first three months of}} his contract. In 17 months of his contract, a deficit of 150,000 livres was discovered at the Paris Mint, and Masselin was charged with stealing the pieces. He and his clerks in Paris and at the provincial mints were dismissed, and in 1691, Castaing was given general management of all twenty-six French mints and the task of <b>restriking</b> the old coinage. Castaing was paid eight deniers for each coin restruck, and when the King ordered a second reformation of the currency in 1693, Castaing's wage was reduced to three deniers per coin.|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{starting}} auxiliary electrode {{were used for}} the investigation that the hot cathode type fluorescent discharge lamps were started on the low voltage. The ring type electrode or the strip type electrode, as the starting electrode, was positioned near the 20 W fluorescent lamp wall, and the starting characteristics of the discharge lamp were measured for the source frequency region between commercial frequencies and 500 Hz. For commercial frequencies and 500 Hz, the relation between the main <b>restriking</b> voltage and the ring location and also the preheating current of electrodes were obtaind. Using the strip electrode, the relation between the main <b>restriking</b> voltage and the frequency and also the preheating current of electrodes were obtained. When the ring electrode location was on the discharge lamp center and on its both end, the starting voltage was the minimum value and the maximum value respectively, that is it showed V-curve. Using the ring electrode, the minimum <b>restriking</b> voltage dropped to about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and about 90 % (215 V) at 500 Hz as compared with the normal type-Using the strip electrode, the minimum <b>restriking</b> voltage dropped to less than about 30 % (100 V) at commercial frequencies and less than 50 % (120 V) at high frequencies as compared with the normal type. Generaly, the starting voltage decreases as the preheating current increases, but the degree of preheating current region between 300 mA and 350 mA is neccesary to accelerate the starting. It is thought that the effect of the starting auxiliary electrodes resultes essentially in shortening of the electrode gap. When the reflector was earthed, the starting characteristics were not affected by the earthing effect for the strip electrode, but those were made random by the earthing effect for the ring electrode. Thus, it is concluded that as the strip type and the ring type electrode can be dropped the <b>restriking</b> voltage of the long type discharge lamps, using those are succesful in case of the low voltage starting in frequency region between commercial frequencies and high frequencies...|$|R
