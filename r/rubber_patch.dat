5000|$|After the Remsen stakes, Luro gave Northern Dancer {{some time}} off to heal and had a {{vulcanized}} <b>rubber</b> <b>patch</b> applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January. His first race at three was in a six-furlong prep under a new jockey, Bobby Ussery, who was instructed {{to take it easy}} and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell {{to the back of the}} pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses and get bumped again, eventually finishing third. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider. [...] "I believe in being very patient with my horses," [...] said Luro. [...] "I don't want punishment—under no circumstances." ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{and robust}} 2 D phased array {{technique}} with multiple distributed actuators is experimentally studied for damage detection {{in a thin}} isotropic panel. This array technique is combined with guided Lamb wave (GLW) interrogation. A 2 D phased array technique using a single actuator, located {{near the center of}} the array, is unable to detect a linear crack whose orientation is normal to the wavefront of the GLW excited from the actuator. To overcome this limitation, the array is coupled with multiple actuators positioned at four different locations on a test panel, while the array is mounted at the center of the panel. A piezoceramic-based 2 D spiral phased array is used as a sensor array. The associated array signal processing is used to produce array responses and detect two types of damages, such as a <b>rubber</b> <b>patch</b> and linear crack. An innovative GLW propagation and reflection analysis method is implemented to evaluate the damage locations within the panel geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the spiral array damage detection technique, using multiple distributed actuators, can provide more robust damage detection scheme, in thin isotropic panels, than the array tech-nique with a single actuator collocated at the center of the array...|$|E

They allow on demand measurements, quick results (no {{need to send}} anything to the laboratory), without any blood loss (no blood sample). Electronic tattoos or biostamps are currently under development. They are <b>rubber</b> <b>patches</b> that have a layer of flexible silicon wires (Fig.  5). The idea {{is to create an}} electronic device that is thinner than a sheet of paper, as flexible as a Band-Aid, and that can stick to the skin [43]. Beside their ability to record and transmit vital signs, these sensors have the potential to measure electrolytes and lactates in skin fluids [44]. If reliable, they may bring further opportunities such as remote metabolic monitoring in patients with chronic disease.|$|R

5000|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II put {{the economy of}} British Guiana {{into a state of}} decline, due to a decrease in trading activities, which initially led to a rise in unemployment. The war also resulted in a shortage of imported goods from Britain and North America, since many merchant ships were now being utilised for military transport. The effects of the shortage of imported goods were felt throughout the country. For example, there were no new bicycle tires or inner tubes, so owners of bicycles had to improvise by using discarded pieces of <b>rubber</b> to <b>patch</b> holes in existing tires. There was also a severe scarcity of flour and petrol for vehicles, and kerosene for domestic use was rationed. The government controlled the prices of goods, especially food items, and provided subsidies for necessary imports. However, the people quickly readjusted to the situation and there was no serious lack of food since Guianese farmers produced large quantities of food crops, including rice, cassava, plantains, sweet potatoes and eddoes, as well as vegetables.|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of a {{military}} airfield on a base in Seoul, South Korea, its runway was paved with good quality concrete materials that has lasted around 30 – 40  years. Engineers predict (Yang et al. 2014) that a half of all the airport runaways in South Korea will undergo surface reconstruction within 5 – 10  years. A few air bases have already been under reconstruction, and the RCAs produced on-site on air bases have been used only for the sub-base materials, regardless of the potentially good RCA quality that the air bases can produce. It is noticeable that the RCA recycled on the air base normally contains fewer impurities than other structures and at most contains some asphalt and <b>rubber</b> from the <b>patching</b> and joint sealing areas.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increased}} use of condoms, contact dermatitis to rubber is being seen more often. To develop a rubber condom suitable for use by rubber sensitive people, a "hypoallergenic" condom, which is washed in ammonia to reduce the residues of rubber accelerators, has been manufactured. Fifty patients allergic to various <b>rubber</b> accelerators were <b>patch</b> tested with an ordinary condom and the new washed condom. Fifty patients undergoing routine patch test investigation who were not allergic to rubber were also tested as controls. Twenty two of the rubber sensitive patients had a positive reaction to the new rubber condom compared with four of the control patients. Washing rubber condoms in ammonia does not appear to reduce the residues of rubber accelerators sufficiently for their use by rubber sensitive people. A non-allergenic condom is required...|$|R
40|$|We study rubber {{friction}} for {{tire tread}} compounds on asphalt road surfaces. The road surface topographies are measured using a stylus instrument and atomic force microscopy, {{and the surface}} roughness power spectra are calculated. The rubber viscoelastic modulus mastercurves are obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis measurements and the large-strain effective modulus is obtained from strain sweep data. The rubber friction is measured at different temperatures and sliding velocities, and is compared to the calculated data obtained using the Persson contact mechanics theory. We conclude {{that in addition to}} the viscoelastic deformations of the rubber surface by the road asperities, there is an important contribution to the rubber friction from shear processes in the area of contact. The analysis shows that the latter contribution may arise from <b>rubber</b> molecules (or <b>patches</b> of <b>rubber)</b> undergoing bonding-stretching-debonding cycles as discussed in a classic paper by Schallamach...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTropomyosin (Tm) is a two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil protein, {{and when}} {{associated}} with troponin, it {{is responsible for}} the actin filament-based regulation of muscle contraction in vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscles. It is widely believed that Tm adopts a flexible rod-like structure in which the flexibility must {{play a crucial role in}} its functions. To obtain more information about the flexibility of Tm, we solved and compared two crystal structures of the identical C-terminal segments, spanning ∼ 40 % of the entire length. We also compared these structures with our previously reported crystal structure of an almost identical Tm segment in a distinct crystal form. The parameters specifying the local coiled-coil geometry, such as the separation between two helices and the local helical pitch, undulate along the length of Tm in the same way as among the three crystal structures, indicating that these parameters are defined by the amino acid sequence. In the region of increased separation, around Glu- 218 and Gln- 263, the hydrophobic core is disrupted by three holes. Moreover, for the first time to our knowledge, for Tm, water molecules have been identified in these holes. In some structures, the B-factors are higher around the holes than in the rest of the molecule. The Tm coiled-coil must be destabilized and therefore may be flexible, not only in the alanine clusters but also in the regions of the broken core. A closer look at the local staggering between the two chains and the local bending revealed that the strain accumulates at the alanine cluster and may be relaxed in the broken core region. Moreover, the strain is distributed over a long range, even when a deformation like bending may occur at a limited number of spots. Thus, Tm should not be regarded as a train of short rigid rods connected by flexible linkers, but rather as a seamless <b>rubber</b> rod <b>patched</b> with relatively more flexible regions...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT Patch test is {{the gold}} {{standard}} for detection of causative allergens in allergic contact dermatitis. Though chronic urticaria is a multifactorial condition, a sizeable number of such patients are thought to be due to various contact allergens. Hence, a hospital based prospective study of patch test positivity to various allergens was conducted in patients suffering from chronic urticaria. AIMS To evaluate the pattern of allergen positivity in chronic urticaria patients by patch test using Indian Standard Series. SETTINGS & DESIGN Prospective investigational study was conducted at Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy department of a tertiary care hospital attached to a postgraduate training institute in Telangana state of India. METHODS & MATERIAL Thirty chronic urticaria patients, above 18 years of age were evaluated with patch test of Indian standard series. Two of these patients had prior history of contact sensitivity to <b>rubber</b> and paraphenylenediamine. <b>Patch</b> test was done by application of allergens of Indian standard series over upper back. Patch test site was examined after 48 hours and after 72 hours. Patch test was considered positive if erythema, erythematous papules or vesicles were found at the site of application of corresponding allergen. RESULTS Patch test was positive in 4 out of 30 patients of chronic urticaria, fragrance, black rubber mix, paraphenylenediamine and parthenium being the allergens in 1 patient each. Patients with positive patch test to black rubber mix and paraphenylenediamine had prior history of contact allergy. CONCLUSION Patch test is a simple, noninvasive, inexpensive and useful diagnostic test in a difficult to evaluate condition of chronic urticaria, irrespective of feasibility of avoidance of potential allergens...|$|R
40|$|I {{studied the}} ecology of the {{sawtooth}} grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), and used O. surinamensis in conjunction with a computer simulation to understand the regulation of small populations. Many populations of organisms deplete their food resource and inevitably encounter negative population feedbacks. Eight short-term experiments differentiated the effects of food deterioration and crowding of stages on dispersal, mortality and reproduction. Metapopulations were created by connecting vials with <b>rubber</b> tubes. The <b>patches</b> of each metapopulation were arranged in rings and food was replenished at two-week intervals. The population dynamical effects of subdivision, degradation and overall system size were manipulated in five experiments. Time-series of stage-specific abundances were compared in repeated measures ANOVA. An individual-based simulation was used to explore mechanisms of population dynamics through parameter calibration and model fitting. The experiments quantified rates of birth and death in response to both the amount of food and area. Mixed stage populations of O. surinamensis respond to food deterioration by increasing in immature mortality, sharply reducing oviposition, and increasing adult dispersal. Fragmentation experiments defined the relationship between habitat size and amount of food on population dynamics. For beetle abundance in my experiments, changing the habitat size had twice the effect of changes in the amount of food. Abundance responded more rapidly to changes in habitat area than to changes in amount of food. The results of the experiments were used to calibrate and test models that forecast population abundance. I selected from among candidate models based on minimum mean square error. The selected model indicates that periodic replenishment of food causes flushes of reproduction followed by food depletion, cannibalism and inhibited oviposition. I employed the experimental model system to test metapopulation theory, and I developed the simulation to show the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of O. surinamensis populations. ...|$|R
