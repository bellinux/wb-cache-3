The male Indian <b>red</b> <b>admiral</b> encircles the female while the female goes around to lay eggs on leaves that are suitable. The male {{butterflies}} are territorial and they choose the places best suitable for mating. After selecting they fly around the place keeping a watch on {{the movements of the}} female. The males are generally aggressive and often seen fighting with other males. They show acrobatic techniques to attract the female’s attention.|$|E
25|$|Under Transit Holdings ownership, bus {{operation}} in Portsmouth was completely remodelled. The <b>Red</b> <b>Admiral</b> name was revived as a trading name for services running to areas {{outside the city}} boundary, while Blue Admiral was introduced for routes entirely within the city. The entire fleet was replaced with minibuses, initially Ford Transits and later Iveco Daily vehicles for Blue Admiral and Mercedes-Benz 811D vehicles for <b>Red</b> <b>Admiral</b> services. Service frequencies rose to retain capacity, and Transit Holdings claimed that ridership had risen dramatically. However, some groups criticised the use of minibuses as having poor accessibility and giving uncomfortable ride quality.|$|E
25|$|In June 1988, Portsmouth City Transport was privatised. It {{was sold}} to a joint venture {{consisting}} of its employees and Southampton Citybus. The company was rebranded as Portsmouth Citybus and <b>Red</b> <b>Admiral</b> became {{a subsidiary of the}} company, operating largely with minibuses. While the main operation continued to use a variant of the red and ivory livery introduced in 1986, <b>Red</b> <b>Admiral</b> vehicles were painted into a red and black colour scheme. However, Citybus still faced strong competition from Southdown and People's Provincial, two former NBC subsidiaries which were now independent, and its finances were never entirely secure during its year of operation in this form.|$|E

Butterfly watchers can see monarchs, sulphur butterflies, and <b>red</b> <b>admirals</b> that stop here to drink nectar from wildflowers before continuing their southward migration.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>red</b> <b>admirals</b> occur most {{frequently}} during summer. They over-winter as adults, so {{can be seen}} on warm winter days. They are long lived, surviving up to six months in the summer, and perhaps nine months for those which overwinter. The adults feed on nectar from various plant species (native and introduced) and occasionally on seepage of sap. They are strong fliers, but their short flights when feeding and ovipositing are very erratic. Flights over water or mountain ranges are straight and fast, characteristic of a migrating butterfly, but no migration within New Zealand has been reported.|$|R
25|$|Prior to bus {{deregulation}} and the privatisation of National Bus Company in 1986, the Gosport & Fareham Omnibus Company was {{merged with}} {{the western part of}} Hants & Dorset in April 1983 to form the Provincial Bus Company which was sold to its employees in 1987 and renamed People's Provincial which then expanded into Portsmouth in the early 1990s. Southdown was sold to its management at privatisation. The municipal operation was sold to a consortium consisting of its employees and Southampton Citybus in 1988, and was rebranded as Portsmouth Citybus. In 1989 both Southdown and Portsmouth Citybus were sold to the Stagecoach Group, but the group was forced to divest most of the Portsmouth services and they were sold to Transit Holdings in 1991. The expanding FirstGroup acquired People's Provincial in 1995 and the Transit Holdings operation, by now trading as <b>Red</b> <b>Admiral</b> and Blue Admiral in 1996. The group's later acquisition of Southampton Citybus and Southern National saw the companies combined to form First Hampshire & Dorset, which provides the majority of services in the city today. Stagecoach in the South Downs, the name under which Southdown now trades, operates longer-distance services.|$|E
500|$|The archipelago's {{isolation}} {{has resulted}} in a lack of biodiversity. The most successful colonists with nearly two hundred species are the flies followed by beetles with approximately 140 species. There are no bees on the islands so the flies are probably important pollinators of plants. One beetle, the rare and endangered weevil, Ceutorhynchus insularis, [...] is known from only Dùn and the Westmann Islands, an archipelago off the south-west coast of Iceland. Less than one hundred species of butterfly and moth occur, compared to 367 recorded on the Western Isles. <b>Red</b> <b>admiral</b> (Vanessa atalanta) and painted lady (Vanessa cardui) are two of only seven species of butterflies, both well known and common migrants. Common summer moths are the antler (Cerapteryx graminis), dark arches (Apamea monoglypha) and the migrant silver Y (Autographa gamma). One unusual moth recorded is the least carpet (Idaea rusticata), an occasional migrant, and in the UK, usually recorded in the south-east of England. On 4 September 2014 a rare vagrant oleander hawk-moth (Daphnis nerii) was recorded. Oleander is not found in the UK every year, and the larva have never been recorded in the Britain.|$|E
500|$|Birch Moss Covert {{is a small}} {{woodland}} containing birch, alder and willow trees, as well {{as various}} species of flora and fauna. The small mammal population includes the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), which attract both kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Foxes, stoats, weasels, and badgers, are often seen. The area is part of Shell's estate, covering about [...] of land managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The trust also manages a small nature reserve located within Manchester United's training ground. This provides a habitat {{for a number of}} species including the <b>red</b> <b>admiral</b> butterfly (Vanessa atalanta), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), and grey partridge (Perdix perdix). Carrington Moss is home to the only recorded pairs of breeding grey partridge in Trafford. Six pairs of Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) were recorded in 2003. The reduction in the population of these and similar birds is attributed to modern farming methods, the loss of broad hedgerows, and the lack of winter stubble. Action for Nature in Trafford has therefore included the site in its Biodiversity Action Plan. The group intends to develop Carrington Moss as a home for other species, such as reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus). Stigmella continuella (a species of moth occurring in southern and north-west England) has been observed in the area.|$|E

60|$|It came to {{pass that}} during the service the sun began to shine very brightly after several days of cloud and misty windy wet weather, and that {{brilliance}} and the warmth in it served to bring a butterfly out of hiding; then another; then a third; <b>red</b> <b>admirals</b> all; and they were seen through all the prayers, and psalms, and hymns, and lessons, and the sermon preached by the white-haired Rector, fluttering against the translucent glass, wanting {{to be out in}} that splendour and renew their life after so long a period of suspension. But the glass was between them and their world of blue heavens and woods and meadow flowers; then I thought that after the service I would make an attempt to get them out; but soon reflected that to release them it would be necessary to capture them first, and that that could not be done without a ladder and butterfly net. Among the women (ladies) on either side of and before me there were no fewer than five wearing aigrettes of egret and bird-of-paradise plumes in their hats or bonnets, and these five all remained to take part in that ceremony of eating bread and drinking wine in remembrance of an event supposed to be of importance to their souls, here and hereafter. It saddened me to leave my poor <b>red</b> <b>admirals</b> in their prison, beating their red wings against the coloured glass--to leave them too in such company, where the aigrette wearers were worshipping a little god of their own little imaginations, who did not create and does not regard the swallow and dove and white egret and bird-of-paradise, and who was therefore not my god and whose will as they understood it was nothing to me.|$|R

The kingfisher was asleep on his watching-branch, and the blackbirds scarcely took the trouble to dive into the next bush.

60|$|A {{hundred other}} cases might be quoted {{in which the}} female is either more obscurely {{coloured}} than the male, or gains protection by imitating some inedible species; and any one who has watched these female insects flying slowly along {{in search of the}} plants on which to deposit their eggs, will understand how important it must be to them not {{to attract the attention of}} insect-eating birds by too conspicuous colours. The number of birds which capture insects on the wing is much greater in tropical regions than in Europe; and this is perhaps the reason why many of our showy species are alike, or almost alike, in both sexes, while they are protectively coloured on the under side which is exposed to view when they are at rest. Such are our peacock, tortoise-shell, and <b>red</b> <b>admiral</b> butterflies; while in the tropics we more commonly find that the females are less conspicuous on the upper surface even when protectively coloured beneath.|$|E

5000|$|The 2009 Star Trek film {{features}} uniforms {{reminiscent of}} the original television series but with some cosmetic changes. The badge (already the logo of the full Starfleet instead of specific to the Enterprise) is now a pin rather than sewn on, and is also silver instead of gold. The tops are now in two layers: a wide-collared colored over-shirt (gold, blue, or red {{just as in the}} original series) with a quilted pattern and a colored hem-line from the neck to the armpit, and a black undershirt, visually imitating the black collar of the original TOS design. The over-shirt has the division delta badge shape printed onto the fabric providing a textured appearance. As in the original series, female officers wear skirts, some with short sleeves (seen on Lt. Uhura), others with long sleeves (as seen on some of the background extras). In an unexplained change from previous series, many female crew members wear nail polish (Uhura wears black polish, while many extras wear red). Also, a number of females onboard can be seen wearing the long sleeve top and pants uniform similar to those worn in [...] "The Cage". Unlike other Trek, this uniform is worn only aboard starships - other personnel wear black one-piece uniforms of a much more [...] "military" [...] appearance.
