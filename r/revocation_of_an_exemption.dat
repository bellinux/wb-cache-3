50|$|The {{provision}} {{allowing for}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> naturalisation as <b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> residence abroad has been criticised as creating {{two classes of}} Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad. The provision for the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minor's naturalisation following the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation has been criticised as unfair to the child.|$|R

50|$|Violations of USDA Organic {{regulations}} carry fines up to $11,000 per violation, and {{can also}} lead to suspension or <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> farm or business’s organic certificate.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} prohibition to leave {{may take the}} form <b>of</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previously issued passport. For example, the United States of America may revoke passports at will.|$|R
50|$|<b>Revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> offer must be {{received}} and understood by the offeree before it comes into effect. An acceptance by the offeree before they receive notice <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> will be considered valid.|$|R
25|$|The {{main reasons}} for <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patent in {{opposition}} are <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> inventive step (43%), <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> novelty (22%) and an extension beyond {{the content of the}} application as filed (11%).|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> notice <b>of</b> the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{certificate}} <b>of</b> naturalisation must {{be published}} in Iris Oifigiúil (the official gazette of the Republic) and in the period from January 2002 to April 2005 no such notices were published.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, the {{complete}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> will automatically revives {{the next most}} recent will, while others hold that revocation leaves the testator with no will so that their heirs will instead inherit by intestate succession.|$|R
50|$|United States v. Rehlander was a 2011 case {{heard in}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. It struck down a Maine law {{providing}} that temporary commitment triggered automatic <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patient's firearms license.|$|R
50|$|Where, {{however, the}} will has been revoked by destruction, it cannot be revived. The <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> will which itself revoked an earlier will {{does not have}} the effect of {{reviving}} the earlier will; to achieve that end, re-execution is necessary.|$|R
40|$|It {{has always}} been a {{critical}} issue to find efficient methods for fast <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> user's identity in identity (ID) -based cryptosystems. Unfortunately, none of the previous ID-based cryptography can find a practical way. Libert et al. and Baek et al. respectively propose an ID-based mediated encryption scheme based on the practical ID-based encryption scheme from bilinear pairing due to Boneh and Franklin. Both schemes provide an efficient method for immediate <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> user's identity. However, no ID-based mediated signature scheme from bilinear pairing has been found so far. The essential reason {{is that most of the}} previous ID-based signatures from bilinear pairing are no ``good'' enough to generate their mediated versions. In this paper, we first presents an ID-based signature scheme from bilinear pairing. It is secure against existential forgery under adaptively chosen message and ID attack in the random oracle model. Furthermore, it has the good property of addition, thus can be used to construct an efficient ID-based mediated signature scheme. Combining this scheme with one of the above two mediated encryption schemes yields a complete solution to the fast <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> user's identity in ID-based cryptosystems from bilinear pairing...|$|R
50|$|In {{the canon}} {{law of the}} Catholic Church, obrogation is the {{enacting}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contrary law that is <b>a</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previous law. It {{may also be the}} partial cancellation or amendment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> newer one.|$|R

50|$|Stephens' {{political}} career was dogged by accusations of association with organized crime, {{which led to}} the only major political defeat in his career: the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state-issued casino license for Rosemont. In 1983, Stephens was indicted, in separate prosecutions, for tax fraud and bribery, but was acquitted on both charges.|$|R
25|$|As {{confirmed}} in Haig v. Agee, the administration may deny or revoke passports for foreign policy or national security reasons at any time, {{as well as}} for other reasons as prescribed by regulations. <b>A</b> notable example <b>of</b> enforcement of this was the 1948 denial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passport to U.S. Representative Leo Isacson, who sought to go to Paris to attend a conference as an observer for the American Council for a Democratic Greece, a Communist front organization, because of the group's role in opposing the Greek government in the Greek Civil War. Denial or <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passport does not prevent the use of outstanding valid passports. The physical <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passport is often difficult, and an apparently valid passport can be used for travel until officially taken by an arresting officer or by a court.|$|R
50|$|The {{destruction}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> copy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> will {{does not}} normally constitute an effective revocation, but the destruction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> duplicate original revokes both {{it and the}} other duplicate original (filed usually with a third party). The partial <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> will by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deletion or alteration is regulated by the Wills Act.|$|R
40|$|Efficient <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> {{public key}} {{certificates}} {{has always been}} a critical issue in public key infrastuctures (PKIs). In 2001, Boneh et al. introduced a method for obtaining instantaneous <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> user's public key privileges ([4]) in RSA-type cryptosystems. Their idea was to give an online security mediator (SEM) <b>a</b> piece <b>of</b> each user's private key exponent while users have the second piece of their respective decryption/signature exponent. In such a setting...|$|R
50|$|The {{ex officio}} review will proceed in four {{different}} assumptions. First, the existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> act or regulation {{that can be}} considered null and void by law; Then, the review <b>of</b> <b>an</b> annulable declarative act of rights; Also the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> act <b>of</b> taxation; And finally the correction of material and arithmetical errors.|$|R
25|$|Most jurisdictions require {{self-assessment}} {{of the tax}} {{and require}} payers of some types of income to withhold tax from those payments. Advance payments of tax by taxpayers may be required. Taxpayers not timely paying tax owed are generally subject to significant penalties, which may include jail for individuals or <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entity's legal existence.|$|R
50|$|Habitual {{offender}} laws {{may provide}} for mandatory sentencing - {{in which a}} minimum sentence must be imposed, or may allow judicial discretion in allowing the court to determine a proper sentence. One example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> habitual offender statute is a provision requiring the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> driver's license for a person convicted multiple times of driving under the influence.|$|R
50|$|<b>Revocation</b> <b>of</b> self-signed {{certificates}} {{differs from}} CA signed certificates. The self-signed certificate cannot (by nature) be revoked by <b>a</b> CA. <b>Revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> self-signed certificate {{is accomplished by}} removing it from the whitelist of trusted certificates (essentially the same as revoking trust in a CA). Failure to revoke a self-signed certificate may allow an attacker who has already gained access to monitor and inject data into a connection to spoof an identity if a private key has been compromised.|$|R
50|$|Etsi de statu was a papal bull {{issued by}} Pope Boniface VIII in July 1297. The bull was {{essentially}} <b>a</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bull issued the previous year, Clericis laicos. Whereas Clericis laicos had prohibited the taxation of clerical property by lay authorities without the explicit {{consent of the}} papacy, Etsi de statu allowed it in cases of emergency.|$|R
50|$|Legal {{consequences}} of hit-and-run may include the suspension or cancellation of one's driver's license; lifetime <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> driver's license {{is possible in}} certain jurisdictions. It is frequently considered a criminal offense which can be punished by fines and imprisonment. Insurance companies often raise the insurance costs or even void the policies of drivers involved in this offense.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, the key {{characteristic}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infraction is {{that the}} punishment seldom includes any amount <b>of</b> incarceration in <b>a</b> prison or jail or any other loss of civil rightstypically the only punishment is a fine, although sometimes other regulatory actions are possible (e.g. <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> license or permit) or an order to remedy or mitigate the situation.|$|R
40|$|The {{dismissal}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{probationary teacher}} or the suspension or <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> teacher’s certificate holds serious con-sequences.
