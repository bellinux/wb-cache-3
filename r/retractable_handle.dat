50|$|The diskos is {{a weapon}} {{featuring}} a razor-sharp spinning disk on a <b>retractable</b> <b>handle.</b> When activated the disk glows and shoots out sparks. This invention {{may have been}} inspired by a hand-held children's toy that shoots sparks when a button is pressed to start a small spinning disk. It is also indicated that the diskos develops a special affinity for its owner during training and should not be handled by anyone else. Each diskos is powered from an initial charge taken from the Earth Current. When its owner dies, the Diskos and its charge are returned to the Earth Current.|$|E
5000|$|Toru's {{younger sister}} {{and a fellow}} Saboteur. She is tall with black hair styled in a ponytail and dark eyes, but in the anime, she has green hair and blue eyes. Although she calls Toru her brother, she is {{unrelated}} to him by blood but they are originally from the same area., [...] Akari does not {{hide the fact that}} she is in love with Toru and is jealous of any other girl who gets close to him. She also uses the Iron-Blood Transformation, however her markings do not crisscross like Toru's and are much thinner. Her weapon is a large war hammer with a <b>retractable</b> <b>handle</b> and a spike on one side of the head.|$|E
50|$|On May 22, 2002, a crane lifted Blaine onto a 100 ft {{high and}} 22 in wide pillar in Bryant Park, New York City. He was not {{harnessed}} to the pillar, {{although there were}} two <b>retractable</b> <b>handles</b> {{on either side of}} him to grasp in the event of harsh weather. He remained on the pillar for 35 hours. He ended the feat by jumping down onto a landing platform made out of a 12 ft high pile of cardboard boxes and suffered a mild concussion.|$|R
50|$|Other {{available}} features {{may include}} the following: hinged or lift-off lid, two removable end caps, pre-cut foam, custom factory-cut foam, or do-it-yourself foam, rackmount rails for installation of 19-inch rackmount equipment, shock mounts for an internal rackmount frame, <b>Retractable</b> <b>handles</b> which are protected in some regard during shipping, airtight seal when the lid is closed and latched down, atmospheric pressure equalization valve , nitrogen filler valve, humidity indicators, wheels or casters, wheels and an extensible handle {{similar to a}} pull-around suitcase, legs to allow the removed lid {{to be used as}} a desk, and environmental controls: air conditioners, heaters or fans.|$|R
5000|$|The FAST (Farfisa All Silicon Transistor) Series models had a metal cabinet {{covered with}} a {{washable}} skin plate and plastic edges, chrome folding legs, <b>retractable</b> carrying <b>handles,</b> and a removable music rack. This model of Farfisa was used by Philip Glass on some of his early recordings. This series had the combo organs (FAST 2,3,4,5,Console), and the Professional (Original, Duo, and Pianos) ...|$|R
50|$|The system's {{keyboard}} has a {{mouse port}} built into either side. The {{front of the}} computer has a headphone jack, volume control, joystick, keyboard and mouse ports. The top has a <b>retractable</b> carrying <b>handle</b> only on non-Compact models, a reset button, and a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) button. The rear {{has a variety of}} ports, including stereoscopic output for 3D goggles, FDD and HDD expansion ports, and I/O board expansion slots.|$|R
5000|$|Very large cabinets, such as 8x10" [...] cabinets, {{may have}} both wheels {{and a long}} [...] "towel bar"-style handle to {{facilitate}} moving the equipment. Some 8x10" [...] cabinets have handles {{on the top and}} bottom to facilitate two-person carrying of the cab. Some combo amplifiers have wheels and a <b>retractable</b> carry <b>handle,</b> to enable bassists to walk while pulling their bass amp; this can enable bassists to walk onstage with their bass and amp or walk to a venue with their gear.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{transverse}} engine and gearbox in a mid-mounted, rear-wheel drive configuration, the X1/9 was {{noted for its}} balanced <b>handling,</b> <b>retractable</b> headlights, lightweight-removable hardtop, front and rear-storage compartments [...] - [...] and for being designed from its conception to meet the late 1960s U.S. safety regulations.|$|R
50|$|The X68000 {{features}} two soft-eject 5.25 in floppy drives, {{or in some}} of {{the compact}} models, two 3.5 in floppy drives, and a very distinct case design of two connected towers, divided by a <b>retractable</b> carrying <b>handle.</b> This system {{was also one of the}} first to feature a software-controlled power switch; pressing the switch would signal the system's software to save and shutdown, similar to the ATX design of modern PCs. The screen would fade to black and sound would fade to silence before the system turned off.|$|R
40|$|In many species, social {{interactions}} {{play a key}} role in deciding resource allocation. Aggression is one mech-anism by which crayfish become dominant, which, in turn, enables them to acquire higher-quality resources. In crayfish, hierarchies and dominance structures are formed by dyadic interactions. In natural habitats, crayfish have agonistic interactions that often take place with other crayfish in the vicinity. There is a possibility for observers to gain information about potential future opponents. We were interested in examining the impact of observing agonistic interactions on the social behaviour of a bystander crayfish. Bystanders were visually exposed to one of four treatments followed by an agonistic interaction with a na€ıve individual. Treatments consisted of: (1) two size-matched crayfish fighting (fight treatment); (2) two size-matched crayfish not fighting (visual control); (3) an empty fight arena with a retractable wall (motion control); or (4) an empty tank with no <b>retractable</b> wall (<b>handling</b> control). The second inter-action, where the bystander crayfish was fought against a na€ıve size-matched individual, or tester crayfish, was analysed by a person, blind to treatment, for initiation, winnereloser and temporal dynamics of escalation. Our results indicate that bystander crayfish exposed to the fight treatment lost significantly more often to tester crayfish than bystander crayfish subjected to control treatments. In addition, there were changes in the fight dynamics for the bystander crayfish. These results show that observations of interactions by a third crayfish have implications for hierarchies and social behaviour in natural settings...|$|R
