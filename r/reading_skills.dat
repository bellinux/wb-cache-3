5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and <b>reading</b> <b>skills.</b> Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedIt is {{possible}} that reading experience mediates the relationship between <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> and cortical thickness. Print exposure, a measure of reading experience, accounts for variability in <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> independently of phonological awareness and decoding skill (e. g. Stanovich & Cunningham, 1992). Several studies have found altered cortical structure in dyslexic readers throughout the posterior section of the reading network. Given the documented relationship between exposure to print and reading sub-skills, including phonological and orthographic processing, {{it is surprising that}} the relationship between exposure to print and cortical structure or function has not been explored. This study investigated the associations between cortical thickness in the left hemisphere <b>reading</b> network, <b>reading</b> <b>skill,</b> and print exposure in a sample of adult readers of varying <b>reading</b> <b>skill.</b> The pattern of correlations indicate that individuals with more print exposure, and who are of higher <b>reading</b> <b>skill,</b> had thicker cortices within the lefthemisphere reading network...|$|R

On the topic of the Internet's effect on <b>reading</b> <b>skills,</b> Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

The sample comprised 32 grade 7 students from Group 2 of Thakhonyangpittayakhom School, Kantarawichai District, Mahasarakham Province, in the 2 nd semester of the academic year 2015, obtained through cluster sampling, using the class as the sampling unit. The instruments were of 4 types: learning organization plans with the quality in the high level; 6 drills of analytical reading; a 4 -choice learning achievement test of analytical reading containing 30 questions, and a subjective test containing 3 questions, having the discrimination from 0. 25 to 0. 83 and the total reliability of 0. 84; an evaluation form for analytical <b>reading</b> <b>skill,</b> and a 5 -level satisfaction rating scale questionnaire containing 15 questions which had been examined by experts. The statistics employed in data analysis were percentage, the mean, standard deviation, and t-test (dependent samples) for hypothesis testing. The results revealed that the grade 7 students whose analytical <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> on Soonthornphu’s literary works using drills with STAD cooperative learning process was developed had their analytical <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> in the good level; the drills of analytical <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> had the efficiency of 85. 21 / 83. 80 which could meet the 80 / 80 criterion; the effectiveness index was 0. 7277 That means the students had their analytical <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> 0. 7277 or 72. 77 percent higher; and the grade 7 students were satisfied with the development of analytical <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> on Soonthornphu’s literary works using drills with STAD cooperative learning process in the highest level, with the mean of 4. 29. The learning organization on analytical reading for grade 7 students using drills with the content from Soonthornphu’s literary works, together with STAD cooperative learning process had good efficiency and effectiveness, suitable for being used further in Analytical reading at developing students’ creative <b>reading</b> <b>skill...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} used {{cross-cultural}} comparisons {{to demonstrate the}} effect of background knowledge on reading comprehension. The present study used a similar approach to study the relations between background knowledge, <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> and level of use of reading comprehension strategies. Eighty-eight sixth-grade participants in elementary school were equally divided according to <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> (skilled and less skilled) and country (Bahamas or Canada). Subjects thought aloud while reading culturally familiar and unfamiliar informative texts. Protocols were scored according {{to the level of}} strategic action exhibited and according to the condition triggering the action. The results, while confirming the role of knowledge in the construction of meaning, indicated significant country differences in subjects 2 ̆ 7 use of knowledge and in correlations of strategy level with other measures. Results from the Canadian sample confirmed other North American findings: level of strategy use was positively correlated with both <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> and with comprehension of familiar and unfamiliar texts. However, the Bahamian skilled and less skilled students demonstrated consistently higher levels of strategy and knowledge use on both familiar and unfamiliar stories than did the Canadian students. Furthermore, in the Bahamian sample, level of strategy use was not correlated with <b>reading</b> <b>skill</b> or comprehension. These results raise questions about the generality of relationship between reading strategies and comprehension.
