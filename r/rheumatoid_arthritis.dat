5|$|A phase II {{trial with}} another dissociated {{glucocorticoid}} fosdagrocorat (PF-04171327) (a phosphate ester prodrug of dagrocorat (PF-00251802)) for <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> {{was started in}} 2011 by Pfizer.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used as}} an {{anti-inflammatory}} {{agent for}} both acute and long-term inflammation, {{as well as for}} treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|Targeted {{monoclonal}} antibody therapy is employed to treat {{diseases such as}} <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Needles made of yttrium-90, {{which can}} cut more {{precisely}} than scalpels, {{have been used}} to sever pain-transmitting nerves in the spinal cord, and yttrium-90 is also used to carry out radionuclide synovectomy in the treatment of inflamed joints, especially knees, in sufferers of conditions such as <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In vivo {{studies in}} {{mice and rats}} showed that a topically {{administered}} SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of oedema, both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to prednisolone. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> asthma and colitis. In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid in cancer pathologies is currently lacking.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> in {{his left}} knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making {{a career out of}} football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play {{part-time}} for Hereford United, including in the first team when they were in the fourth, and later in the third, division of the English Football League. He was earning up to £33 a week. But in 1973, at the age of 21, the pain in his joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|In September 1936, Bill's brother, the Catholic priest Reverend Denny, and his sister, Mary Catherine Denny, were {{involved}} in a vehicle accident in which Mary received fatal injuries. Reverend Denny suffered from an illness that resulted from the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941. Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, A Digger at Home and Abroad, which was published in 1941. He continued to practice law until his death, despite difficulties associated with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b> He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he returned from his office in Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a state funeral, and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} is {{more common}} in people with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> than in the general population. However, whether vitamin D deficiency is a cause or a consequence of the disease remains unclear. One meta-analysis found that vitamin D levels are low in people with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> and that vitamin D status correlates inversely with prevalence of <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is associated with susceptibility to <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both {{minocycline}} and doxycycline {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects. Minocycline {{as well as}} doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b> However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline {{for the treatment of}} <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> does not include minocycline.|$|E
25|$|Other: Other {{tools to}} monitor {{remission}} in <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> are: ACR-EULAR Provisional Definition of Remission of <b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Some scores {{do not require}} input from a healthcare professional and allow self-monitoring by the person, like HAQ-DI.|$|E

25|$|It {{is a large}} molecule, with a {{molecular}} weight of 150 kDa., that binds to TNFα and decreases its role in disorders involving excess inflammation in humans and other animals, including autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> and, potentially, {{in a variety of}} other disorders mediated by excess TNFα.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{exercise}} is recommended as both safe and useful to maintain muscles strength and overall physical function. It is uncertain if specific dietary measures have an effect. Physical activity is beneficial {{for persons with}} <b>Rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> complaining of fatigue.

25|$|More than 75% {{of women}} with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis</b> have {{symptoms}} improve during pregnancy but might have symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and leflunomide are teratogenic (harmful to foetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended {{women of childbearing age}} should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and to discontinue its use if pregnancy is planned. Low dose of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are considered safe in pregnant persons with <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Total hip {{replacement}} is {{most commonly used}} to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> avascular necrosis, traumatic arthritis, protrusio acetabuli, certain hip fractures, benign and malignant bone tumors, arthritis associated with Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis.</b> The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have failed.|$|E
25|$|Vegetarian diets {{have been}} used as a {{treatment}} for <b>rheumatoid</b> <b>arthritis,</b> but the evidence is inconclusive whether this is effective.|$|E
