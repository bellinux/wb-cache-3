25|$|As {{mentioned}} before SSRIs are rather promiscuous {{in that they}} also bind to the homologous NET and DAT, although with much lower affinity than to their principal target SERT. The selectivity of SSRIs for SERT is <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> where {{only one or two}} different functional group substituents are sufficient to convert an SSRI into a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with higher affinity to NE. SSRI antidepressants all have the same mechanism of action and are at least 10-fold more selective for 5-HT re-uptake inhibition than for NE re-uptake inhibition. However, despite the sharing of the same mechanism of action, SSRIs differ in their potency and selectivity in inhibiting 5-HT re-uptake and many of them have important effects on other transporters and receptors. SSRIs are structurally diverse with clear variations in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, which leads to differences among them in their half-lifes, clinical activity, adverse effects and drug interactions, which explains the differences in their efficacy and tolerability among patients. However, all SSRIs are clinically equal {{when it comes to their}} efficacy over time.|$|E

He praised the film's cinematography and art direction, though concluded the film [...] "undercuts the figure who most represented the creative individual. Somewhere in this meandering film {{there is a}} fascinating story about a fascinating person that deserves to be told in more coherent and cogent terms." ...|$|E
500|$|Assigned {{to direct}} the film, Kusama said, [...] "I think {{also a lot of}} horror is about femaleness – whether it's Carrie or Rosemary's Baby." [...] She said she feels [...] "like there's a lot of fear of the female or kind of celebration of it in some weird way and {{something}} about this movie managed to take the fear and the sense that it's the female that ultimately survives and sort of marry that in a <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> way".|$|E

The speculation noted the way the old man is killed in the short, {{and the fact that he}} is carrying Ben & Jerry's ice cream. In response to this, Leitch [...] "coyly" [...] said, [...] "That's a <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> question", and adding, [...] "I think that people should continue to theorize who that old man was." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} the Britpop {{movement}} was in decline, and the band had failed to meet expectations with their third album. After {{the conclusion of the}} Be Here Now Tour in early 1998, amidst much media criticism the group kept a low profile. Later in the year, Oasis released a compilation album of fourteen B-sides, entitled The Masterplan. [...] "The <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> stuff from around that period is the B-sides. There's a lot more inspired music on the B-sides than there is on Be Here Now itself, I think", related Noel in an interview in 2008.|$|E

According to Witwer, Starkiller's characteristics and personality depended on who he was talking to and what circumstances he is in. Witwer called him [...] "a <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> guy, speaking of layered characters". Although acting as a villain in the beginning of the , Blackman has commented how Starkiller is [...] "really just this damaged kid." ...|$|E

When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he {{considered}} it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and [...] Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, [...] "We've seen it all. It's not <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> to audiences anymore. The interesting things are the ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning." ...|$|E

Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. Even when we write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away stuff that I really love to get it down to time. [...] It will be just <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> content-wise for us [...]" ...|$|E

It {{profiles}} Sigurður and his quest to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling the story of the American and Icelandic donors and examining the quasi-taboo nature of the museum's collection. Bekhor says: [...] "I wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending on how you react to it really says a lot about what your relationship is with that element of the human anatomy. It's a <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> phenomenon and we're really curious to see how audiences respond."

Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars and Sara Bareilles have also influenced Lorde vocally. Lorde also stated that she {{was inspired by the}} initially hidden identities of Burial and The Weeknd, explaining, [...] "I feel like mystery is more interesting". She names her mother, a poet, as the main influence for her songwriting. In addition, Lorde names several authors including Raymond Carver, Wells Tower, Tobias Wolff, Claire Vaye Watkins, Sylvia Plath, Walt Whitman and T. S.

The previous summer, when asked about her role in season 3, Carpenter responded {{that she would be}} performing [...] "a little more of the same, with a really, <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> twist.

500|$|The {{book was}} {{selected}} as [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] in the Sunday Age. Publishers Weeklys review of the book was critical of its [...] "adulatory" [...] tone, but called it a [...] "necessity for fans", due {{the inclusion of the}} discography. A review of the book for The Boston Globe commented [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured ... religion and spirituality." [...] The Palm Beach Post noted that the biography provides [...] "insights and updates as well as a solid background on Morrison's early life". The Sunday Times wrote that [...] "the <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> story here is told by the photographs". The Irish Times was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of the included photographs.|$|E

[...] In September, The September Issue, a documentary film by The War Room producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was ultimately {{found not guilty}} and was released, Lister stated {{in an interview with}} E4: [...] "I think this is a great storyline, I've really enjoyed doing it. When Zoe's obviously released, it's like a whole new scenario for her because there are people who haven't really trusted her or believed in her. People that have really let her down, and plus the fact she hasn't got over Sarah [...] being killed yet either. She hasn't had the chance to deal with that, so that's <b>really</b> <b>interesting,</b> and she still wants Lydia to go down!" [...] The character of Zoe then set out to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. She befriended her, and even seduced her in order to gain a confession.

500|$|Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic noted, [...] "'Concentrate and Ask Again'" [...] {{did little}} to drive the {{overriding}} story forward, but it did a brilliant job of making me question everything." [...] Nonetheless, she commented that it [...] "... was nowhere near as intense as 'Reciprocity'." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler did not think there was anything [...] "particularly remarkable about the core elements of this story – it's the same old formula that both Fringe and The X-Files used frequently – but the episode has a generous helping of little revealing character elements sprinkled throughout." [...] Isler praised the final ten minutes for [...] "provid some <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> action" [...] with Olivia's ending of the case, and the revelation of Simon's note in conjunction with Sam's knowledge of the First People. He ultimately graded the episode 7.5/10.|$|E

50|$|At {{the touch}} of the shutter, the camera takes a {{high-resolution}} still, plus a one-second movie vignette. Upon playback, this creates a motion series in slow motion, accompanied by music.

Once uploaded to a computer, the video plays at normal speed and without the sound produced on the camera. The images and the video are saved as different files, but can be combined.|$|R
500|$|In a 2008 interview, Downey {{stated that}} {{his time in}} prison changed his {{political}} point of view somewhat, saying, [...] "I have a <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> political point of view, and it's not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since." [...] However, {{when asked about the}} quote in a 2015 interview to promote Avengers: Age of Ultron, he denied that his previous statement reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part, and stated, [...] "I wouldn't say that I'm a Republican or a liberal or a Democrat." ...|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{enthusiasm for}} the Soviet Union dated to the early 1920s when he had hailed Lenin as [...] "the one <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> statesman in Europe". Having turned down several chances to visit, in 1931 he joined a party led by Nancy Astor. The {{carefully}} managed trip culminated in a lengthy meeting with Stalin, whom Shaw later described as [...] "a Georgian gentleman" [...] with no malice in him. At a dinner given in his honour, Shaw told the gathering: [...] "I have seen all the 'terrors' and I was terribly pleased by them". In March 1933 Shaw was a co-signatory to a letter in The Manchester Guardian protesting at the continuing misrepresentation of Soviet achievements: [...] "No lie is too fantastic, no slander is too stale... for employment by the more reckless elements of the British press." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} <b>really</b> <b>interesting</b> to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is a}} sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E
