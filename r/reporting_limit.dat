Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of oddities. Gurlitt failed to say that, despite the address in Salzburg listed in his Austrian passport, his main residence was in Munich. Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed and had no obvious source of income. He was not registered with the —a requirement under German law—or with the tax authorities or social services. He had never married, had no pension and no health insurance.

The administration of these substances is forbidden “in competition” only and if the case of administration by oral, intravenous, intramuscular or rectal routes. To discriminate between systemic and permitted administration routes, a reporting threshold has been set by the WADA at 30 ng/mL for the urinary concentrations of parent compounds or theirs metabolites. Unfortunately, as already reported by different research groups, this strategy is not always valid. An example is represented by budesonide, whose intake is revealed by the presence in urine of its main phase I metabolite, 16 α-hydroxy-prednisolone. Here we have evaluated the excretion profile of budesonide and of its main metabolites after oral and inhaled administration at different therapeutic doses and formulations, with the aim to select the best criteria to discriminate between the abuse and the permitted use of budesonide. Our data show that (1) the urinary level of 16 α-hydroxy-prednisolone is higher than the <b>reporting</b> <b>limit</b> also after inhalation; (2) the concentration of the parent compound and of the hydroxylated metabolites exceed the <b>reporting</b> <b>limit</b> only after systemic administration.
