50|$|Today, the <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> is {{not used}} as {{extensively}} as the sluice, but still is an effective method of recovering gold in areas where {{there is not enough}} available water to operate a sluice effectively. Like a sluice box, the <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> has riffles and a carpet in it to trap the gold. It was designed to be used in areas with less water than a sluice box. The mineral processing involves pouring water out of a small cup and then rocking the small sluice box like a cradle, thus the name <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> or cradle.|$|E

5000|$|The 1984 Disc Glide as it {{was known}} was a very rare {{motorcycle}} it had the first offering of the [...] "Chrome Package" [...] meaning it came with chrome <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes,</b> nose cone, and primary cover. It was called the FXRSDG.|$|R
50|$|Rocker covers are covers {{that are}} bolted on over rocker arms in an {{internal}} combustion engine. They are called valve covers in the United States, Canada, and {{in situations where}} Rocker Arms are not present, such as some Overhead Cam, and most Dual Overhead Cam engines. and <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{the heads}} and {{cylinders}} of the Evolution engine {{are made from}} aluminum to reduce weight compared to a cast iron design. Air cooling efficiency is improved as aluminum is a superior thermal conductor to cast iron. The blocky <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes</b> (thus becoming nicknamed [...] "block head" [...] which never caught on), aluminum heads and cylinders (also referred to as [...] "jugs") are {{the only part of}} the Evolution engine that can be said to be essential; the Big Twin and Sportster incarnations of the Evolution are significantly different.|$|R

50|$|A <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> (also {{known as}} a cradle) is a gold mining {{implement}} for separating alluvial placer gold from sand and gravel which was used in placer mining in the 19th century. It consists of a high-sided box, which is open on one end and on top, and was placed on rockers.|$|E
50|$|Also {{called a}} cradle, it uses riffles {{located in a}} high-walled box to trap gold {{in a similar manner}} to the sluice box. A <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> uses less water than a sluice box and is well suited for areas where water is limited. A rocking motion {{provides}} the water movement needed for the gravity separation of gold in placer material.|$|E
5000|$|All of the D.III series were {{generally}} {{very similar to}} other models, {{with the exception of}} the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIaü. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then. The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the rocker arms that operated the valves. Early models had square <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes</b> positioned directly over the cylinders with the rocker arms exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] rocker arm design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the tubular camshaft housing, and the now easily-sealable cylindrical rocker arm shafts protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed rocker arms with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes,</b> <b>rocker</b> arms and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] cam drive system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical [...] "slotless" [...] valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rocker</b> <b>boxes</b> must be {{manipulated}} carefully, to prevent losing the gold. Although big, {{and difficult to}} move, the rocker can pick up twice {{the amount of the}} gravel, and therefore more gold in one day than an ordinary gold mining pan. The rocker, like the pan, is used extensively in small-scale placer work, in sampling, and for washing sluice concentrates and material cleaned by hand from bedrock in other placer operations. One to three cubic yards, bank measure, can be dug and washed in a rocker per man-shift, depending upon the distance the gravel or water has to be carried, the character of the gravel, {{and the size of the}} rocker.|$|R
5000|$|The knucklehead is a retronym used by enthusiasts {{to refer}} to a Harley-Davidson {{motorcycle}} engine, so named because of the distinct shape of the <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes.</b> The engine is a two-cylinder, 45 degree, pushrod actuated overhead valve V-twin engine with two valves per cylinder. It was the third basic type of V-Twin engine used by Harley-Davidson, replacing the Flathead-engined VL model in 1936 as HD's top-of-the-line model. The engine was manufactured until 1947 and was replaced by the Panhead engine in 1948. The Knucklehead-engined models were originally referred to as [...] "OHVs" [...] by enthusiasts of the time and in Harley's official literature; the nickname arose from the California chopper culture of the late 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> (or [...] "cradle") {{is capable}} of greater volume than a gold pan, and it is more {{portable}} and requires less infrastructure than a sluice box, being fed not by a sluice but by hand. The box sits on rockers, which when rocked separates out the gold, and the practice {{was referred to as}} [...] "rocking the golden baby".|$|E
50|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of placer mining are from ancient Rome, where gold and {{other precious metals}} were extracted from streams and mountainsides using sluices and panning.However, the productivity rate is comparatively smaller compared to other methods such as the <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> or large extractors, such as those used at the Super Pit Gold Mine, in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, {{which has led to}} panning being largely replaced in the commercial market.|$|E
50|$|Many designs have {{increased}} portability by shrinking the altazimuth (<b>rocker</b> <b>box)</b> mount {{down to a}} small rotating platform. The altitude trunnion style bearing in these designs becomes a large radius roughly {{equal to or greater}} than the radius of the objective mirror, attached to or integrated into the tube assembly which lowers the overall profile of the mount. The advantage of this is that it reduces the total telescope weight, and the telescope's balance becomes less sensitive to changes in the weight loading of telescope tube from the use of heavier eyepieces or the addition of cameras etc.|$|E
50|$|Launched in 1957 the Model Twenty One was {{the first}} of the Triumph unit {{construction}} twin cylinder motorcycles from the Meriden factory. With a capacity of 349 cc, the engine was a classic Edward Turner design with a 360 degree crankshaft, twin gear driven camshafts and twin plunger oil pump. The cylinder block was cast iron with an alloy head and separate <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes.</b> The engine was dry sump lubrication and there was a single Amal Monobloc carburettor. Drive was by a conventional four speed gearbox, with a right foot gear lever. There are two explanations for the ''''Twenty One'''' name spelt out in full on the side panels. The first explanation is that it celebrates the twenty-first anniversary of Triumph Engineering Co Ltd. The second explanation is that the important US export market rated motorcycle engine displacement in cubic inches and 21 cubic inches equates to 350 cc.|$|R
500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used <b>rockers,</b> <b>boxes</b> that moved {{back and forth like a}} cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|R
50|$|These {{conditions}} {{indicate that}} the nose contour must meet the local radial air flow and have a sufficient radius of curvature to allow the flow to follow the shape smoothly and efficiently until it is flowing parallel to the main air stream; and {{the shape of the}} inside of the cowling or of anything located inside the nose of the cowling is unimportant, for the velocity is low in thisregion. The shape of the inside of the nose being unimportant; the only necessary dimensions for the nose section design are for the outside contour. Well-designed nose sections must therefore have a change in angular direction of approximately 90°. Thecurvature is determined by the length in which this angular change takes place and is governed by the distance between the engine <b>rocker</b> <b>boxes</b> and the trailing edge of the propeller. The two designs given in figure 2 are the best contours for their particular dimensions and cover the normal variation of length as encountered in practice. Either design may be used with almost identical results at speeds below 350 miles per hour. Above that speed, nose 1 is recommended, as the maximum local velocity produced by this cowling is less than that for nose 2 and, if the local velocities exceed the velocity of sound, the drag of the cowling will be multiplied many times.|$|R
50|$|All methods {{required}} {{water and}} because of that they could only be used during the summer. Panning for gold was the simplest method of recovering gold, but mostly used for prospecting since it was slow. A faster way was by a <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> or by sluicing. Dirt was filled into the box or sluice together with water and rocking movements or gravity would make the gold particle go to the bottom whereas sand and fine gold particles would flow off with the water. Further purification of the gold could be done with mercury that would amalgamate with gold only and leave fine sand particles out. A magnet could be used to separate fine magnetic sand from gold dust.|$|E
5000|$|The noisy {{two-cylinder}} 600 cc [...] {{engine was}} {{located at the}} back where it drove the rear wheels, initially via a [...] "crash" [...] gearbox. Later versions gained a four-speed all-synchromesh gearbox. Contemporaries were impressed by the brevity of the maintenance schedule, with the engine, gear box and final drive operating as a single chamber and all lubricated by means of oil, added through a filler in the <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> cover. There were just two grease nipples requiring attention, positioned on the steering kingpins. The engine was also commended in contemporary reports for its fuel economy and longevity. Although noisy, the engine offered impressive flexibility, recalling NSU's strengths as a motorcycle manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|Meticulous in {{both his}} dress and {{motorcycle}} preparation, the tough but light Lacey was the ideal racer, weighing in at only 8.5 stone. Winning his coveted Brooklands Gold Star (awarded for a rider's first 100 mph and over lap {{in a given}} class) in 1927 on his 498cc Grindlay Peerless, he hit the headlines again in 1928 by becoming the first rider to cover over 100 miles in a single hour, riding a 500 on British soil, again at Brooklands. The personnally modified 498cc Grindlay Peerless (Lacey fashioned his own pushrods, their tubes, cams, rocker gear and <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> castings and utilised an experimental Brampton front-fork which utilised progressive friction dampening [...] ) covered 103.9 miles in the hour for a Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) world record.|$|E
5000|$|Power: The {{engine is}} a {{controlled}} 5.0L V8 (R302ci for the Ford Falcon and 304ci for the Holden Commodore). Most {{parts of the}} engine are controlled and unlike the Australian Touring Cars (Supercars Championship) which uses fuel injection, the series uses a controlled carburettor. The other control parts for the engine are manifolds, exhausts, cam-shafts, <b>rockers,</b> air-filter/cold air <b>box</b> and ignition. The engines are rev-limited to 6400rpm. Top speed is 240 km/h.|$|R
25|$|A rush {{typically}} {{begins with}} the discovery of placer gold made by an individual. At first the gold may be washed from the sand and gravel by individual miners with little training, using a gold pan or similar simple instrument. Once {{it is clear that the}} volume of gold-bearing sediment is larger than a few cubic metres, the placer miners will build <b>rockers</b> or sluice <b>boxes,</b> with which a small group can wash gold from the sediment many times faster than using gold pans. Winning the gold in this manner requires almost no capital investment, only a simple pan or equipment that may be built on the spot, and only simple organisation. The low investment, the high value per unit weight of gold, and the ability of gold dust and gold nuggets to serve as a medium of exchange, allow placer gold rushes to occur even in remote locations.|$|R
50|$|The first Dominator, the Model 7, had a 497 cc {{parallel}} twin engine with iron cylinders and cylinder {{head and a}} Lucas K2F magneto. The crankshaft was of 360-degree layout with two main bearings. A single camshaft {{at the front of}} the engine was driven by gears and chain. The <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> was integral with the head, so there were fewer gasket faces to leak and less valve noise. The engine was a long stroke design with 66.0 x 72.6 mm bore and stroke and mild tuning, resulting in more torque low down. For the first few years a plunger frame was used, but in 1953 the Model 7 was upgraded with a single downtube swinging arm frame, 19-inch front wheel and 'pear shaped' silencers, still known as a Model 7.The Model 7 continued in production through to 1955 and was often used with a sidecar, which could not be fitted to the later Featherbed frame Dominators.|$|E
5000|$|Another distinctive, {{although}} less revolutionary, {{feature of}} the engine was {{the location of the}} tubes carrying the valve pushrods. Rather than being cast inside the cylinder head, thus requiring more cores and complexity, they were outside the main casting of the head. The top and bottom faces of the head were extended to form a flange on the camshaft side of the engine and individual steel tubes were placed through the flanges to enclose each pushrod (a similar system was used for the Volkswagen Beetle engine, albeit with longer tubes {{the entire length of the}} cylinder). These tubes were expanded at top and bottom to seal them and thus became a permanent part of the cylinder head. The separate tubes were reliable, less expensive to manufacture than casting them into the head, and gave that side of the engine its distinctive [...] "hollow" [...] appearance with the <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> appearing to be supported by columns.|$|E
5000|$|BSA, {{then the}} largest UK {{motorcycle}} manufacturer, was falling {{behind in the}} parallel-twin race. Although BSA had a parallel-twin, the BSA A7, they needed to develop the bike to remain competitive. In May 1948, the factory enticed Hopwood after only a year at Norton, and he was commissioned to create a competitive BSA parallel-twin. Launched in October 1949, Hopwood's A10 Golden Flash drew heavily from the A7 design by Page and Bert Perkins.The A10 was increased to , with a revised alloy <b>rocker</b> <b>box</b> and cast-iron cylinder head, plus an integral manifold for the single Amal carburettor. A semi-unit gearbox meant the primary chain was adjustable via a slipper tensioner within the primary chain case. The frame was available in rear rigid format, but the more common option was plunger suspension, adopted for the export market. The A10 featured a hinged rear mudguard to ease rear wheel removal. The A10 was so closely based on the A7 that it used many of its well-proven components, and this large carry-over of parts from the A7 promised greater reliability, with minimal risk of new technical problems.|$|E
