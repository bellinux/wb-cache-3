40|$|A {{promising}} application <b>for</b> biomass is <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> synthesis, such as methanol or {{dimethyl ether}} (DME). Previous studies have studied syngas production from biomass-derived char, oil and gas. This study intends {{to explore the}} technology of syngas production from direct biomass gasification, which may be more economically viable. The ratio of H- 2 /CO {{is an important factor}} that affects the performance of this process. In this study, the characteristics of biomass gasification gas, such as H- 2 /CO and tar yield, as well as its potential <b>for</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> synthesis is explored. A fluidized bed gasifier and a downstream fixed bed are employed as the reactors. Two kinds of catalysts: dolomite and nickel based catalyst are applied, and they are used in the fluidized bed and fixed bed, respectively. The gasifying agent used is an air-steam mixture. The main variables studied are temperature and weight hourly space velocity in the fixed bed reactor. Over the ranges of operating conditions examined, the maximum H- 2 content reaches 52. 47 vol%, while the ratio of H- 2 /CO varies between 1. 87 and 4. 45. The results indicate that an appropriate temperature (750 degrees C for the current study) and more catalyst are favorable for getting a higher H- 2 /CO ratio. Using a simple first order kinetic model for the overall tar removal reaction, the apparent activation energies and pre-exponential factors are obtained for nickel based catalysts. The results indicate that biomass gasification gas has great potential <b>for</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> synthesis after further processing.

40|$|The {{performance}} and emissions from a rich-lean combustor fired on simulated coal gas fuels were investigated using a 12. 7 -cm diameter axially-staged burner originally designed for operation with high heating value <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels.</b> A simple, tubular fuel injector was substituted <b>for</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> nozzle; no other combustor modifications were made. Four test fuels were studied including three chemically bound nitrogen-free gas mixtures with higher heating values of 88, 227, and 308 kj/mol (103, 258 and 349 Btu/scf), and a 227 kj/mol (258 Btu/scf) heating value doped with ammonia {{to produce a}} fuel nitrogen content of 0. 5 % (wt). Stable, ultra-low nitrogen oxide, smoke-free combustion was attained for the nitrogen-free fuels. Results with the doped fuel indicated that less than 5 % conversion of NH 3 to nitrogen oxide levels below Environmental Protection Agency limits could be achieved. In some instances, excessive CO levels were encountered.

The common hydrogenation catalysts are not very effective for the hydro-genization of these compounds, and new innovation for catalysts is required. The desulfurization of fuel oil obtained from oil shale is also becoming important and has different technological needs than other fuels.
