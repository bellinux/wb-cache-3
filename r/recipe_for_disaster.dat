John Pike, space policy director for the Federation of American Scientists, commented that [...] "the Kraft report is a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>disaster.</b> They are basically saying dismantle the safety and quality assurance mechanisms set in place after the Challenger accident." [...] NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel also took issue with the report, saying in May 1995 that [...] "the assumption that the Space Shuttle systems are now 'mature' smacks of a complacency which may lead to serious mishaps." [...] Nonetheless, NASA accepted the recommendations of the report, and in November 1995, responsibility for shuttle operations was turned over to the United Space Alliance.|$|E
2500|$|The series did {{not start}} well for the Rangers in western New York. [...] Despite playing a {{scoreless}} first period, the key development in the first twenty minutes was a knee injury suffered by Ranger defenseman Michal Rozsival. [...] Rozsival would see the ice for two shifts {{in the second period}} but could not stay in the game. [...] As a result, the Rangers were forced to play the remainder of the game with five defensemen, a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>disaster</b> against a team as talented offensively as the Sabres. [...] Indeed, the result was a disaster for New York, as the Sabres struck for three goals in four minutes, two coming from the aforementioned Vanek, and Buffalo led 3–0 after two. [...] The Rangers finally beat Ryan Miller halfway through the third period to cut the deficit to 3–1, thanks to a Marcel Hossa tally, but it would not be enough. [...] Three minutes later Jason Pominville was awarded a goal on the first of several controversial video reviews in the series; the controversy in this case coming from the appearance that Pominville had punched the puck into the net. Brendan Shanahan scored a power play goal late for the Rangers to make it 4–2, but Drew Stafford hit the empty net to seal a 5–2 Sabre victory in Game 1.|$|E

50|$|After {{having grown}} by over 50% from 1990 to 1998, Argentina's GDP {{declined}} by 3% in 1999 {{and the country}} entered what became a three-year-long recession. President Fernando de la Rúa was elected in 1999 on a reform platform that nevertheless sought to maintain the peso's parity with the dollar. He inherited a country with high unemployment (15%), lingering recession, and continued high levels of borrowing. In 1999, economic stability became economic stagnation (even deflation at times), and the economic measures taken did nothing to avert it. The government continued its predecessor's economic policies. Devaluing the peso by abandoning the exchange peg was considered political suicide and a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> economic <b>disaster.</b> By {{the end of the}} century, complementary currencies had emerged.|$|R

If a new approach is not embraced, we are likely seeing the end of the European Monetary Union (EMU) as it currently stands. The consequences of a breakup would ripple throughout the EMU as well as the shaky US financial system, and could ultimately trigger the next global financial crisis. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1991 the Argentine Government {{embarked}} on an ambitious exchange rate based stabi-lization (ERBS) program aimed at removing the enticement of using money creation to finance the pervasive fiscal imbalances that have been {{a feature of the}} Argentine economic landscape. Despite the strait-jacket of this program and the early successes achieved, within a decade of its implementation the program collapsed and resulted in the largest debt default in history. This paper analyzes the circumstances leading up to the failure of Argentina’s experiment with this currency board arrangement and the ensuing cur-rency crisis of 2002. In doing so, the paper places this particular episode of exchange rate crisis into the broader context of the three generations of currency crisis models under consideration in the literature. It will be argued that the mixture of unsustainable debt dynamics, an overvalued real exchange rate coupled with labor market rigidities, and the moral hazard presented by the large IMF-supported financial rescue packages provided a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> economic <b>disaster.</b> Moreover, this debacle provides overwhelming evidence that fiscal profligacy is inconsistent with the maintenance of any fixed exchange rate regime...|$|R

40|$|For {{several years}} now many {{observers}} of the economic landscape have stressed that the U. S. is running the risk of deflation. They point to both the Great Depression and to the more recent experience of Japan as evidence that deflation is a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> economic <b>disaster.</b> Deflation {{has been the subject}} of speeches by officials of the Federal Reserve, by Wall Street economists, and numerous policymakers. The FOMC has continued to feed these fears with references in their most recent press release to “unwelcome fall in inflation ” or “inflation becoming undesirably low. ” In the press and elsewhere deflation is often preceding by words like “destabilizing, ” or “debilitating. ” Despite the repeated use of such words, neither economic theory nor the historical record provide much support for the fear expressed by the media or public officials. Deflation, of course, is characterized by a general decline in the level of prices. Not just a decline in a few prices, but in a broad index of prices. Chart 1 below indicates that the U.

40|$|Understanding what {{version of}} your code is {{executing}} in production {{can be the}} difference between a solved bug and an embarrassing admission of ignorance. Too many times developers are caught up defending code that isn’t properly migrated out to Production or a customer’s machine.

5000|$|During the 2011 Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac, {{the high}} {{performance}} monohull sportsyacht Kiwi 35 WingNuts turtled in an extreme storm, killing {{the captain and}} one crew member.

[...] The waves were not all that unusual, although the wind was. The boat may have buried one of its hiking wings into a wave, causing it to 'trip,' and had the other lifted by the wind. [...] It is rare but not unheard of for keelboats to turtle and remain upside down, particularly if it has not lost its keel.
