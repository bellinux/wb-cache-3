5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|Some jurisdictions {{limit the}} sale of lithium batteries, which are the most <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> source of lithium for {{ordinary}} consumers. Lithium {{can be used to}} reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Technetium-99 (99Tc) {{is a major}} {{product of}} the fission of {{uranium-235}} (235U), making it {{the most common and}} most <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> isotope of technetium. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×108disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62GBq/g).|$|E

5|$|The iron {{compounds}} {{produced on}} the largest scale in industry are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl3). The former {{is one of}} the most <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.|$|E
5|$|The study {{undertaken}} by the Space Technology Laboratory suggested {{the use of a}} Thor-Hydra booster, however the more capable and more <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> Atlas-Agena B booster was selected instead. In phase two they switched {{to the use of the}} Atlas-Centaur booster, instead of an Atlas-Agena B booster.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, {{there were no}} federal laws {{specifically}} addressing the production, distribution or possession of child pornography, and it was <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> to those who sought it. While most was imported from European countries where it was legally produced in large quantities {{there was also a}} domestic industry.|$|E
40|$|Inconspicuous {{consumption}} – where brand {{signals are}} not <b>readily</b> apparent, <b>available</b> or visible to most consumers – {{is on the}} rise, even in Asia, which has typically favored conspicuous brand signaling.

5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|Details of the Implacable-class ships' radar suite are not <b>readily</b> <b>available.</b> They were {{fitted with}} the Type 277 surface-search/height-finding radar {{on top of}} the bridge and a Type 293 target {{indicator}} radar on the foremast. , one of the Illustrious-class ships upon which Indefatigables design was based, also carried Type 279 and Type 281B early-warning radars. Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire-control directors.|$|E
5|$|Glittery {{bands of}} mica {{decorated}} some balls {{while others were}} silk screened with seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes, sleigh rides, carolers, and poinsettias. Some balls featured silvery indents on their surfaces that reflected the surrounding light. In the early 1950s, clear glass balls appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were inexpensive, mass-produced, and <b>readily</b> <b>available.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{information}} about the types and distances of stars became more <b>readily</b> <b>available.</b> The spectra of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C. Pickering at Harvard College Observatory developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard Classification Scheme, published in the Harvard Annals in 1901.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s, Buford's economy was {{centered}} on both its location as a railway stop and its leather industry, until demand for leather declined and other transportation options became more <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> {{over the course}} of the 1900s, and these industries were no longer a viable part of Buford's economy by the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} venography {{employs the}} same principles, but uses MRI as a scanning modality. MRI {{has the advantage}} of being better at detecting damage to the brain itself {{as a result of the}} increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> in many hospitals and the interpretation may be difficult.|$|E
50|$|Though dating {{before the}} island's waggonways, iron ore was mined {{on the island}} and shipped to Falkirk in the early 19th century. Like coal, this petered out as better ore became much more <b>readily</b> and cheaply <b>available</b> elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Probabilistic graphs, such as Bayesian belief networks, {{are useful}} tools for {{coherent}} representation of uncertain knowledge. They {{are based on}} the sound foundations of probability theory and they <b>readily</b> combine <b>available</b> frequency data with expert assessments.

5|$|Once {{computational}} {{power was}} <b>readily</b> <b>available,</b> it became possible to easily design filters to minimise any arbitrary parameter, for example time delay or tolerance to component variation. The {{difficulties of the}} image method were firmly put in the past, and even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could be isolated and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{beryllium}} metal did {{not become}} <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> until 1957, {{even though it had}} been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified magnesium. The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} the barn was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel held together with iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} more <b>readily</b> <b>available</b> alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor. An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained from the outside of {{the west side of the}} barn.|$|E
50|$|Emerald swifts are {{frequently}} {{found in the}} exotic pet trade. Their striking coloration and ease of care make them popular captives.
