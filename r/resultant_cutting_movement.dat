The proposed technique was developed for an end milling operation. The surface area of the workpiece was divided into a number of segments, and the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> force at each discrete segment was determined using One Path Analysis software. The calculated <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> force was applied to the feed rate scheduling. Experimental results clearly showed that the implementation of feed rate scheduling reduces machining time considerably and that as the number of segments increases, the effectiveness of the feed rate scheduling increases.

40|$|AbstractAn {{enhanced}} Force model based Feedrate Scheduling (FFS) {{technique for}} rough cutting of parts with complex free form surfaces in 5 -axis machining is presented. In order {{to estimate the}} cutting forces in complex 5 -axis machining an enhanced solid modeler kernel based model is developed to find the complicated engagement between cutter and workpiece for each cutter location. In this paper, cutter-workpiece engagement model is presented using the commercial Parasolid solid modeler kernel, and then cutting forces are estimated based on the developed model. In this approach, the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> forces are kept constant on a user defined threshold. The feedrate will be adjusted to keep the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> forces constant all along the tool path. Therefore, it is shown that this approach allows decreasing the cycling time drastically. The scheduled feedrate in each cutter location is carried out in NC blocks using an off-line postprocessor {{that can be used}} in commercial CAM software. Eventually, the proposed FFS technique is experimentally tested on rough machining of an impeller with free form surfaces and force validations are presented in this article...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A custom moulded ankle {{orthosis}} with hinged joints potentially {{offers a}} better {{control over the}} subtalar joint and the ankle joint during lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements,</b> due to total contact design and increase in material strength. OBJECTIVES: To test the above hypothesis by comparing it to three other available orthoses. STUDY DESIGN: Repeated measures. METHODS: Eight subjects {{with a history of}} ankle sprains (Grade 2), and 11 subjects without such history performed lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> in four test conditions: 1) non-orthotic, 2) custom-moulded ankle orthosis with hinges, 3) Sport-Stirrup, and 4) elastic ankle sleeve with plastic support. A VICON motion analysis system was used to study the motions at the ankle and subtalar joints. RESULTS: The custom-moulded ankle orthosis significantly lowered the inversion angle at initial contact (p = 0. 006) and the peak inversion angle (p = 0. 000) during lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> in comparison to non-orthotic condition, while the other two orthoses did not. The three orthoses did not affect the plantarflexion motions, which had been suggested by previous studies to be important in shock wave attenuation. CONCLUSIONS: The custom-moulded ankle orthosis with hinges could better control inversion and thus expected to better prevent ankle sprain in lateral <b>cutting</b> <b>movements.</b> CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Custom-moulded ankle orthoses are not commonly used in preventing ankle sprains.

40|$|AbstractCutting {{movements}} in football (soccer) induce high loads on the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} in the knee. The injury risk {{is affected by the}} shoe-surface interaction. For the evaluation of different influencing factors of this interaction the TrakTester, a custom-made device, was used. To obtain significant results from testing ACL loading a realistic plantar pressure distribution in the shoe is required. Using the TrakTester several <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> were carried out using two different foot models with the resultant plantar pressure analysed with three different systems: The original foot model with Parotec insoles (24 integrated sensors; Paromed GmbH, Markt Neubeuern, Germany), the modified version of this foot model with Pedar-X insoles (99 sensors; novel GmbH, Munich, Germany) and the inflexible model was surveyed with the OpenGo science system (13 sensors, Moticon, Munich, Germany). For the inflexible model distinct angles between the lower leg and the surface were adjusted and the obtained plantar pressure distributions were analyzed. As the first version showed high pressures in the arch region, it was modified to reduce the load in this area. A second inflexible model induced the pressure in the heel and forefoot region. For various angles similar plantar pressure distributions were obtained. Highest pressures were applied on the medial side of the heel and forefoot with minor load in the arch region. This corresponds to literature data investigating <b>cutting</b> <b>movements</b> with subjects. Tests with the inflexible foot model achieved similar and realistic patterns of the plantar pressure distribution for different angles. This is an important precondition to obtain reproducible data for ACL loading during <b>cutting</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} predict cutting force and motion of the rotating insert in cutting processes with self-propelled rotary tools (SPRT). Metal cutting utilizing rotary tools is effective to suppress tool wear and thus it {{is considered to be}} suitable to attain high performance machining of difficult-to-cut materials. It is well known that a circular insert attached to a rotational axis is self-propelled due to inclined chip flow on rake face plane by setting certain oblique angle. A resultant insert rotation speed can be easily predicted considering a frictionless rotary axis. However, friction at the rotary axis of SPRTs may not be negligible in practice especially when slide bearings are employed. In order to investigate the influence of the friction at the rotation axis on the rotary cutting process, a new cutting model is proposed. As the friction at the rotation axis causes a decrease in a speed of round insert rotation, an equivalent oblique cutting process is taken into account in the proposed model utilizing conventional theoretical model. In the equivalent process, the tangential component of the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> force corresponds to the friction force at the rotary axis. The friction force is determined by cutting force component normal to force-bearing mechanism and the bearing's friction coefficient. Considering the equilibrium condition in cutting and friction forces, the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> force and the insert rotation speed are iteratively computed in the proposed model. Edge force model is also associated with the oblique cutting model, which is not negligible especially in machining difficult-to-cut materials. The developed model is extended to simulate milling processes with SPRTs. The proposed model is experimentally verified, and influence of the bearing friction of SPRT on the process is clarified...|$|R
