40|$|Many {{biological}} attachment {{devices of}} insects, spiders and geckoes consist of arrays of hairs (setae), which are terminated by contact elements of different shapes. However, {{the most frequently}} observed shape is a thin plate-like spatula. In spite of a rather wide range of sizes and thicknesses, most spatulae of different animals are not uniform but possess a gradient in thickness. The thickness of spatulae in the longitudinal section becomes gradually thinner close to the tip. This geometrical effect is numerically explained in the present paper, by using a numerical approach for modeling the van der Waals-like adhesion and friction between the contact element and the substrate. The approach suggests that the observed tapering in the thickness is useful for improving <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>peeling.</b> Similarly, the existing complementary tapering in the spatula width increases {{the strength of the}} detachment process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{we examine}} the effect of collagenase, elastase and {{glutaraldehyde}} treatments on the response of porcine aorta to controlled peel testing. Specifically, the effects on the tissue׳s resistance to dissection, as quantified by critical energy release rate, are investigated. We further explore the utility of these treatments in creating model tissues whose properties emulate those of certain diseased tissues. Such model tissues would find application in, for example, development and physical testing of new endovascular devices. Controlled peel testing of fresh and treated aortic specimens was performed with a tensile testing apparatus. The resulting reaction force profiles and critical energy release rates were compared across sample classes. It was found that collagenase digestion significantly decreases <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>peeling,</b> elastase digestion has almost no effect, and glutaraldehyde significantly increases resistance. The implications of these findings for understanding mechanisms of disease-associated biomechanical changes, and for the creation of model tissues that emulate these changes are explored...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} surface properties of porous inorganic materials is presented. The method is particularly tailored to cement-based materials {{in order to}} obtain properties suitable for mechanical applications such as dies manufacturing, where hardness, abrasion resistance and low friction are requested. The coating system is based upon using two coatings of different characteristics. The underlying base coating layer is infiltrated in air on three different formulations of hardened cement composite. Two different bi-component resins, one relatively soft and the other relatively hard, were tested as underlying surface coating. The outer surface coating, based upon a bicomponent resin characterized by high hardness, is added after hardening and curing of the first layer. Both coatings were chemically hardened and then cured with EB, UV curing is also suitable for the outer surface coating. An experimental campaign was carried out in order to evaluate the influence of radiation processing as curing treatment with reference to particular investigated materials. Hardness and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>peeling</b> of coating systems have been measured and are presented. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Organic coatings will partially meet the required specifications but have the inherent disadvantage of combustibility. Alkali-silicate binders, used in some industrial coatings and adhesives, show evidence of forming a fireproof paint, but the problem of high surface-tension, a characteristic of alkali silicates, has not been resolved. The solution: Use of a suitable non-ionic wetting agent combined with a paint incorporating alkali silicate as the binder...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} adhesion between polymer films on Si substrates is described involving mechanical interlocking. Isotropic {{reactive ion etching}} (RIE) is applied to form pits in the Si substrate which fill upon application of a polymer via spinning. After curing, interpenetrating polymer lobes form a robust bond with the Si substrate. Adhesion improvements over films on smooth substrates are demonstrated qualitatively through prolonged immersion in heated 40 % potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, and quantitatively through peel tests. Strips of SU- 8 on smooth substrates separate completely within minutes of immersion in KOH, whereas mechanically interlocked strips remain attached throughout. Tests reveal significant improvements <b>to</b> <b>peel</b> <b>resistance</b> for strips with interpenetrating lobes, due {{to a combination of}} crack deflection and physical restraint at the bond interface. Surprisingly, lobes with a vertical profile offer better <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> strip <b>peeling</b> compared with lobes having significant overhang. Stress concentrations at sharp bends in the latter raise local stresses to levels promoting failure in SU- 8, limiting the nominal load-carrying capacity of the interpenetrating interface. For maximum peel resistance, the lobe profile needs to be optimized such that maximum pull-out stresses are close to the failure stress of SU- 8. 1...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the geological properties (lithology, petrography, geochemistry) and industrial usibility of the Upper Cretaceous volcanics, seperated on the area, among Kozlu-Krd. Ereğli and Ormanlı, westside of Zonguldak. Volcanics, described as andesite, basaltic andesite and trachy-andesite by petrographically and geochemically, have subduction zone calk-alkaline character. Firstly, in laboratuary studies the aggregate tests (grading, specific gravity, water absorption, organic impurity, flakiness index, Los Angeles test for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> wear, <b>peeling</b> test, freezing resistance and UCS were realized on the 5 selected fresh patterns, match with the standarts (TS, ASTM, AASHO). Secondly, concrete tests (grading of the concrete aggregates, concrete preperation, slump test, specific density of concrete and UCS of the concrete) were made on the concrete patterns with volcanic aggregate additive. Statistical relationships were determined between values of the agreggate and concrete tests results. Both petrographical, chemical, physical and mechanical tests values of the agreggates and concretes are also match with the standarts, given above. As a conclusion, realized that volcanic aggregates for superstructure materials and C 25 / 30 concrete which made with volcanic aggregate (by using the specimen of N- 4 aggregate) for rainforcement buildings, bridges, foundation walls can be used...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{transparent}} {{films that}} have excellent photoelectric properties, mechanical and thermal stability, and antibacterial properties, are highly desirable for applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Multifunctional transparent conductive films (TCFs) with long silver nanowires (AgNWs, average length = 80 mu m and average diameter = 88 nm) /transparent polyimide (PI) structures which were fabricated {{by using a}} facile, scalable, environmentally-friendly, and full-solution process, can satisfy all the requirements above. The AgNW/ PI composite films show excellent opto-electrical properties (e. g., 7. 5 ohm sq(- 1), at 81. 1 % transmittance) and mechanical flexibility across a wide temperature range, from room temperature to 300 degrees C. The AgNW networks were embedded into the transparent PI film surface, which could decrease the surface roughness (R-rms < 2. 0 nm), and enhance the composite films' <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>peeling,</b> fracture, and oxidation, which expands the range of TCF applications considerably. Additionally, in exploring promising applications, {{the function of the}} transparent heater and the antibacterial properties of the composite films were also studied. These characteristics make the composite films excellent candidates for substrates for flexible and wearable electronic devices...|$|E
