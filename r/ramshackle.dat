However, she refused to allow religious pluralism and advocated for the state church and contemporary adversary travelers criticized her regime as bigoted and superstitious.|$|E
5|$|After a {{break in}} Cape Town, Coghlan and his wife left Kimberley for Bulawayo on 30 July 1900. There, they found the {{conditions}} to be very basic and the buildings, <b>ramshackle.</b> Nevertheless, the settlers enjoyed outdoor pursuits, dances and musical and theatrical performances. Coghlan and his wife lodged at the Grand Hotel. In 1901, not long after they arrived, the Coghlans' first child was born, but the baby lived only three days. A second child, a girl named Petal, was born in November 1902 and lived to old age.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{studied in}} Coupvray {{until the age}} of ten. Because of his {{combination}} of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, <b>ramshackle</b> affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together.|$|E

5|$|David Livingstone, {{who visited}} Feira in 1856, {{described}} it as utterly ruined at that time, but still conspicuous by the <b>ramshackle</b> monastery buildings on the site. When Clark arrived about three decades later, the Portuguese still maintained a boma (fort) called Zumbo on the opposite bank of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, then called Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, {{and out of the}} control of any government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a letter he wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.|$|E

The immense library contains the <b>ramshackle</b> spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's reign {{is known}} as the Elizabethan era. The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the {{seafaring}} prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was <b>ramshackle</b> and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. Such was the case with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{is located in}} the district of St Giles, a short distance to the east of the east end of Oxford Street. The area was once notorious for being one of the worst slums in London, known as the Rookery – a maze of <b>ramshackle</b> houses, alleys and courtyards inhabited by thousands of destitute people. It was famously depicted by William Hogarth in his 1751 print Gin Lane. Central Saint Giles stands on the site of St Giles Court, an office development originally erected in the 1950s for the Ministry of Supply and latterly used by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). It consisted of a series of linked brick blocks of six to eight storeys high, arranged in an S-shape around two inner courtyards to which there was no public access. The grim appearance of St Giles Court contributed to the area becoming a magnet for prostitutes and the homeless. The building was owned by Legal & General but was occupied by the MOD on a lease that was not due to expire until 2011. However, {{at the start of the}} 21st century the MOD began undertaking a process of reducing its London estate and discontinued the use of several buildings in the capital, including St Giles Court. It vacated the building in April 2005.|$|E

The Alehouses helped create the [...] "Public Houses" [...] - the first true British Pubs in an effort to appeal to a wider audience and gain greater acceptance. Prior to this the pubs (not taverns) appealed to local tastes and often were the fronts of actual homes. These were rather <b>ramshackled</b> affairs appealing to occupational men.|$|R

The property had once belonged to the Archbald family. Grace Archbald, the last surviving member of the family and unmarried died in 1942: [...] The <b>ramshackled</b> old house soon degenerated further and was vandalised. Remnants of the foundations of some of their buildings and some of their shrubs remained east of Yarran Avenue. Also, with the advent of widespread refrigeration and bottled milk the dairy was no longer required in the region. The paddocks were sold: CER, POD, street direcrories.|$|R

Stewarts Gully is located 8 {{kilometres}} north-east of central Christchurch. It borders on the Waimakariri River 3. 5 kilometres {{from the mouth of the}} river. Originally, Stewarts Gully was a small, quiet holiday resort for keen fishermen from the Christchurch area. They built <b>ramshackled</b> batches there in a rather haphazard manner with no legal section boundaries. Recently some of the batch owners have chosen to make it their pemanent place of residence. At the same time its popularity with day trippers has increased with the introduction of such commercial ventures as a dairy mini golf course and a bus service. "Riverlea Estates Incorporated", the present owners, a group of residents who clubbed together and bought the land are concerned about the dilapidated appearance of the area...|$|R
60|$|A narrow, winding slough; a half tide, exposing mud {{surfaced}} with gangrenous slime; {{the water}} itself filthy and discoloured by the waste from the vats of a near-by tannery; the marsh grass {{on either side}} mottled with all the shades of a decaying orchid; a crazy, <b>ramshackled,</b> ancient wharf; {{and at the end}} of the wharf a small, white-painted sloop. Nothing romantic about it. No hint of adventure. A splendid pictorial argument against the alleged joys of small-boat sailing. Possibly that is what Cloudesley and I thought, that sombre, leaden morning as we turned out to cook breakfast and wash decks. The latter was my stunt, but one look at the dirty water overside and another at my fresh-painted deck, deterred me. After breakfast, we started a game of chess. The tide continued to fall, and we felt the sloop begin to list. We played on until the chess men began to fall over. The list increased, and we went on deck. Bow-line and stern-line were drawn taut. As we looked the boat listed still farther with an abrupt jerk. The lines were now very taut.|$|R
25|$|Magdalene's old {{buildings}} {{are representative of}} the college's <b>ramshackle</b> growth from a monks' foundation into a centre of education. It is also distinctive in that most of the {{old buildings}} are in brick rather than stone (save for the frontage of the Pepys Building). Magdalene Street divides the most ancient courts from more recent developments. One of the accommodation blocks in the newer part of the college was built by Edwin Lutyens in the early 1930s. Opened in 2005, Cripps Court, on Chesterton Road, features new undergraduate rooms and conference facilities.|$|E
25|$|Adivasi Colony is a {{backwards}} {{community of}} Ambalakars living in <b>ramshackle</b> huts of mud, coconut fronds and palmyrah {{leaves on the}} edge of Kodaikarai village. Their traditional livelihood was the collection of non-timber forest products in the areas that are now the sanctuary. These practices are now prohibited but not fully eliminated. Many of these people catch fish and small prawns in the nearby mudflats and swamps simply by groping in the water with their hands. Some work as day labour in the nearby salt pans. They have little interaction with other communities on the island.|$|E
25|$|The case came {{to court}} in January 2008 where Hodgson denied taking Nicholl {{to any of}} his <b>ramshackle</b> huts hidden in the Sandbeck Plantation near to the A6136 road, south of Richmond. DNA {{evidence}} contradicted this as did the discovery of Nicholl's nightdress, teddy bear and cassette player at the same location. Police believed that Hodgson became jealous of his brother's relationship with Nicholl and he killed her on the night she disappeared. Hodgson's elder daughter, stated in court that Nicholl was seen alive in Richmond two days after her disappearance and had been staying with her uncle (Hodgson's elder brother). Robert Hodgson denied this claim and stated in court {{that he had not}} seen Nicholl for some time.|$|E
60|$|The bay of Port-au-Prince {{is hot and}} simmering, a deep basin {{enclosed}} in a ringing semicircle of mountains, with scarce a breath blowing on the harbour, and with tall cocoa-nut palms rising unmoved into the still air above on the low sand-spits that close it in to seaward. The town itself is wretched, squalid, and hopelessly <b>ramshackled,</b> a despondent collection of tumbledown wooden houses, interspersed with indescribable negro huts, mere human rabbit-hutches, where parents and children herd together, in one higgledy-piggledy, tropical confusion. I had never in my days seen anything more painfully desolate and dreary, and I feared that Césarine, {{who had not been}} here since she was a girl of fourteen, would be somewhat depressed at the horrid actuality, after her exalted fanciful ideals of the remembered Haiti. But, to my immense surprise, as it turned out, Césarine did not appear at all shocked or taken aback at the squalor and wretchedness all around her. On the contrary, the very air of the place seemed to inspire her from the first with fresh vigour; her cough disappeared at once as if by magic; and the colour returned forthwith to her cheeks, almost as soon as we had fairly cast anchor in Haitian waters.|$|R
6000|$|The great {{peculiarity}} of Meran is {{the number}} of schlosses (I believe my plural is strictly irregular, but very convenient to English ears) which you can see in every direction from its outskirts. A statistical eye, it is supposed, can count no fewer than forty of these picturesque, <b>ramshackled</b> old castles from a point on the Küchelberg. For myself, I hate statistics (except as an element in financial prospectuses), and I really don't know how many ruinous piles Isabel and Amelia counted under Césarine's guidance; but I remember that most of them were quaint and beautiful, and that their variety of architecture seemed positively bewildering. One would be square, with funny little turrets stuck out at each angle; while another would rejoice in a big round keep, and spread on either side long, ivy-clad walls and delightful bastions. Charles was immensely taken with them. He loves the picturesque, and has a poet hidden in that financial soul of his. (Very effectually hidden, though, I am ready to grant you.) From the moment he came he felt at once he would love to possess a castle of his own among these romantic mountains. [...] "Seldon!" [...] he exclaimed contemptuously. [...] "They call Seldon a castle! But you and I know very well, Sey, it was built in 1860, with sham antique stones, for Macpherson of Seldon, at market rates, by Cubitt and Co., worshipful contractors of London. Macpherson charged me for that sham antiquity a preposterous price, at which one ought to procure a real ancestral mansion. Now, these castles are real. They are hoary with antiquity. Schloss Tyrol is Romanesque--tenth or eleventh century." [...] (He had been reading it up in Baedeker.) [...] "That's the sort of place for me!--tenth or eleventh century. I could live here, remote from stocks and shares, for ever; and in these sequestered glens, recollect, Sey, my boy, there are no Colonel Clays, and no arch Madame Picardets!" ...|$|R
40|$|The Song Remains the Same' premiered on the 19 th October 1976 at Cinema 1 in New York City. Adorning {{the walls}} of the cinema’s foyer was the cover art of the double soundtrack album that {{accompanied}} the film that very quickly went Platinum. It features a chicly run-down picture theatre that resonates with homely echoes of small town movie houses, vestigial monuments of a nostalgic past of shared social experience. But the nostalgia for the decrepit building and what it once represented is bittersweet, as in the elegiac conclusion of Peter Bogdanovich’s 'The Last Picture Show' (1971). Unknown to the band and its legions of followers throughout the world, that image of <b>ramshackled</b> former glory suggested, in advance, how Led Zeppelin would be judged and how mercilessly run down the film would be by both fans and critics alike. Negativity towards the film characterised virtually every moment of its making, an atmosphere of bad vibes generated from within the inner circle of the band and its management and the two hapless directors, Joe Massot and Peter Clifton, who attempted to exercise their craft {{and at the same time}} appease the hammer of the gods. In retrospect, it is no surprise why it was subject to such vicious critical scrutiny. Generically, the film sits awkwardly between a rockumentary that details the highs and lows of being on tour and a live concert experience of the biggest rock band in the world at the time, captured on stage at Madison Square Garden in New York (the film was promoted as a ’front row seat on Led Zeppelin’). Uneasily woven into this mix of the more familiar attributes of the rock film genre was a series of autobiographical, highly stylised fantasy sequences, of the kind noted previously, designed to explore the personalities and imaginations of the band members themselves. But, unlike previous films that documented famous rock musicians at work (such as The Beatles in Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s 'Let It Be' [1970] and The Rolling Stones in Jean-Luc Godard’s 'Sympathy for the Devil' [1968]), 'The Song Remains the Same' sought to portray the band ‘in concert and beyond‘, transforming the four musicians and their manager into larger than life characters, roguish scoundrels straight out of the picaresque tradition...|$|R
