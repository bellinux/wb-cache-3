5000|$|The 1969 Monaco offered, as a $50 option, {{the first}} modern polyellipsoidal (projector) {{automotive}} <b>road</b> <b>lamp.</b> Called [...] "Super-Lite" [...] and mounted in the driver's side of the grille, this auxiliary headlamp was produced in {{a joint venture between}} Chrysler Corporation and Sylvania. It uses an 85 watt halogen bulb and was intended as a mid-beam, to extend the reach of the low beams during turnpike travel when low beams alone were inadequate but high beams would produce excessive glare to oncoming drivers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Metal {{lamp pole}} {{is widely used}} in <b>road</b> <b>lamp.</b> The {{structure}} of the metal lamp pole {{is more and more}} complex. It needs to open holes on the metal lamp pole. To determine bearing capacity and safety properties of the lamp pole after opening hole, this paper used ABAQUS software to make finite element analysis of the metal lamp pole and accurately got the deformation and stress of metal lamp pole. By means of comparing the stress situation of the metal lamp pole with and without holes, it summaries up the influence rules of holes on the mechanical behavior of metal lamp pole. There is an obvious stress concentration phenomenon around holes and the influence degree of different holes location of stress concentration is also different. Through finite element simulation analysis, it meets the project safety and provides reference value for optimization design of lamp pole...|$|E

40|$|China is in {{the period}} with rapid {{development}} and great economics growth. Unsustainable development made China face the energy crisis and environmental problems. In the last two decades, over 100 industrial parks supported by the Chinese central government were built in over 20 provinces. And {{the number of the}} industrial parks supported by local governments (at the level of provinces and cities) is much higher. However, most of the industrial parks have not been systematically optimized with considerations of integrated solution with low energy consumption. On the other hand, since the introduction of the industrial ecology concept by Frosch and Gallopoulos in 1989, and the apparent success of the Kalundborg Industrial Symbiosis project, attention to planned eco-industrial park (EIP) development projects has grown all over the world. Furthermore, there are a great number of companies producing the solar energy equipment in China. This project is a feasibility study for the design of an industrial park with low energy consumption and energy integration between the manufacturing and residential buildings, which is supported by the Asia Pro Eco Program that aims to promote sustainable solutions for the environment between Europe and Asia. In this paper, the situation of EIP development in the world and China is introduced. By analyzing the EIP development and the situation of the industrial park in China, the solutions for China to gain the sustainable development are introduced. As the result, the feasibility study will focus on solar energy system that will be used in the Himin Industrial park. In this park, the solar energy is used to provide the energy for the district heating, hot water and air conditioning in the residential buildings and the workshops. Furthermore, the photovoltaic products can provide the electricity for the light in the workshop and the <b>road</b> <b>lamp.</b> Therefore, as the solar energy replaced the fossil fuel that provides heat by combustion, the park can decrease the consumption of the fossil fuel and reduce the environmental impact of industrial activity. At the same time, the cost on this industrial park will be much less than the generic industrial parks in China. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Bandung is a {{historical}} city which inherits many architectural heritages, including Gedung Sate as the office for West Java Governor. Development of Gedung Sate area are moving from widening the building’s wings, the Gazebo field, up to the Monument of West Java People’s Struggle; altogether in one axis toward Mount Tangkuban Parahu to become an urban icon in Bandung. As monumental buildings and landscape, proper lighting design concept is {{required in order to}} support visual performance and comfort around the area during nighttime. In this research, field measurements were conducted to map the existing lighting condition around the axis of Gedung Sate - Monument of West Java People’s Struggle. Subjective opinions from people at the area were also submitted by questionnaires. These data were considered as input for designing the lighting concept. Some ideas applied to develop the most suitable lighting concept for the area are constructing the imaginary axis, by arranging lighting installment in a linear path from south to north. Light emmiting diodes (LED) will be used at most to achieve the needs for color effect, energy efficiency, as well as long lifetime. Some decorative <b>road</b> <b>lamps</b> and pathway lamps will use HIT type, while underwater lamps in pond area will use MR 16 type, combined with LED to get the desired effect of color changing. From questionnaires regarding the new lighting design concept, 95 % felt satisfy with the simulation result and 80 % agreed if the design is implemented at the site area...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 22) This analytical study {{compared the}} median beam pattern {{of a sample}} of 19 HID low beams manufactured for model year 2000 vehicles sold in the U. S. with a market-weighted median beam pattern of tungsten-halogen lamps for vehicles of the same model year. The {{results indicate that the}} HID lamps tended to provide wider beam patterns than did the tungsten-halogen lamps, which, in turn, should improve the visibility of pedestrians on curves and may make the lane-maintenance task less demanding. On right curves, there was an increase in glare illumination towards oncoming drivers, while on left curves there was a decrease in glare illumination. On straight <b>roads,</b> the HID <b>lamps</b> produced more illumination for pedestrians and road delineation {{on the left side of}} the road. This was also the case for the right side of the road, but only for the projector HID lamps; the nonprojector HID lamps produced less illumination at the relevant locations than did the tungsten-halogen lamps. Finally, on straight <b>roads</b> HID <b>lamps</b> produced less glare for oncoming drivers than did the tungstenhalogen lamps. The results for traffic-sign illumination varied with the location of the sign. HID lamps produce more light than do tungsten-halogen lamps. Consequently, they hold great promise for improving the nighttime safety of driving by improving the lowbeam light distribution. The present analysis indicates that this promise has already been partially met in the first generation of HID lamps on vehicles in the U. S...|$|R

Finsensvej and present-day Howitzvej were collectively called Lampevej (<b>Lamp</b> <b>Road)</b> from about 1860. The name referred to one of the first outdoor street lamps in Copenhagen which was situated outside a midwife's practice {{to make it easier for}} customers to find their way ind the dark.

50|$|White LED lamps have {{achieved}} market dominance in applications where high efficiency is important at low power levels. Some of these applications include flashlights, solar-powered garden or walkway lights, and bicycle lights. Monochromatic (colored) LED lamps are now commercially used for traffic signal lamps, where {{the ability to}} emit bright monochromatic light is a desired feature, and in strings of holiday lights. LED automotive lamps are widely used for their long life and small size (allowing for multiple bulbs), improving <b>road</b> safety. LED <b>lamps</b> are also becoming popular in homes, especially for bathroom and medicine cabinet lighting.|$|R
40|$|It is {{observed}} that the power consumption of road lighting is increased with the length of trafficable road in Hong Kong. The energy used in road lighting is increasing, {{which means that the}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from power plant for generating electricity for road lighting {{is at the same time}} increasing. To compare the performance of light emitted diode (LED) road lighting with road lighting of other lamp sources, literature review, life cycle assessment (LCA) and technical assessment are adopted to give an overall comparison. This research focuses more on the environmental impacts of road lighting. LCA is adopted in order to give a comprehensive view on the environmental impact of road lighting. A total of 3 different lamp sources are compared: high pressure sodium (HPS) lamp, induction lamp and light emitted diode (LED) lamp. From the model result, it is found that due to the low power consumption and long life time, LED and induction <b>lamp</b> <b>road</b> lighting gives generally less environmental impact than HPS road lighting. As induction lamp has a longer life span than LED, the environmental impact of induction <b>lamp</b> <b>road</b> lighting is found slightly less than that of LED road lighting. Taking account the future development in LED technology, leading to longer life time, higher efficacy and lower production cost, LED road lighting is expected to be a replacement for road lighting in Hong Kong for the future. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

We report about a project of producing 3 D city models with TLS data. Essentially we have interfaced TLS data with CyberCity Modeler functionality and have produced two data sets over Yokohama. We will report briefly about the current status of TLS functionality (the system is still under development) and we will describe the related generation of city models. We show highresolution photo-textured models of Yokohama, including items like street <b>lamps,</b> <b>roads,</b> waterways, parking lots, bridges and trees. The combination of two modern technologies from sensing and processing opens interesting perspectives for future applications in 3 D virtual environment generation. 1...|$|R
60|$|From one {{of these}} spells he was awakened by the {{stoppage}} of the cab; and, getting down, found himself in quite a country <b>road,</b> the last <b>lamp</b> of the suburb shining some way below, and the high walls of a garden rising before him in the dark. The Lodge (as the place was named) stood, indeed, very solitary. To the south it adjoined another house, but standing in so large a garden as to be well out of cry; on all other sides, open fields stretched upward to the woods of Corstorphine Hill, or backward to the dells of Ravelston, or downward towards {{the valley of the}} Leith. The effect of seclusion was aided by the great height of the garden walls, which were, indeed, conventual, and, as John had tested in former days, defied the climbing schoolboy. The lamp of the cab threw a gleam upon the door and the not brilliant handle of the bell.|$|R

50|$|The {{village of}} Kiondroghad {{remained}} little changed {{for a couple}} of centuries apart from the old cottages being replaced by newer ones if they fell into disrepair. Gradually the village moved out of Church Road, known locally as The Butt, and spread a little. At the junction with the track that led towards the mountains (Avondale Road) a few more cottages appeared in the early 19th century. As Onchan approached the 20th century land was sold off for terraces of houses to be built. The area surrounding Church Road today is the village's heritage area and the location of Molly Carooin's Cottage which is maintained by the Friends Of Onchan's Heritage, a local volunteer group. The area features period lamp standards and since 2001 has been home to the newly developed Village Green which links Church Road with the Onchan Wetlands to the north west. There is also a vehicle garage, highways department depot, barber shop and several residential dwellings in the area which leads to St Peter's Church via the one-way <b>road.</b> The Jubilee <b>Lamp</b> was erected in this road in 1987 following relocation from White City, and this was the first electrically lit lamp standard on the island.|$|R

60|$|Twenty minutes later, he {{was turning}} through the {{scrolled}} iron gates {{into the road}} for London. It was falling dark; and in the tremulous sky clouds were piled up, and drifted here and there {{with a sort of}} endless lack of purpose. No direction seemed to have been decreed unto their wings. They had met together in the firmament like a flock of giant magpies crossing and re-crossing each others' flight. The smell of rain was in the air. The car raised no dust, but bored swiftly on, searching out the <b>road</b> with its <b>lamps.</b> On Putney Bridge its march was stayed by a string of waggons. Lord Valleys looked to right and left. The river reflected the thousand lights of buildings piled along her sides, lamps of the embankments, lanterns of moored barges. The sinuous pallid body of this great Creature, for ever gliding down to the sea, roused in his mind no symbolic image. He had had to do with her, years back, at the Board of Trade, and knew her for what she was, extremely dirty, and getting abominably thin just where he would have liked her plump. Yet, as he lighted a cigar, there came to him a queer feeling--as if he were {{in the presence of a}} woman he was fond of.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1900s, Kenton was a farming {{community}} {{similar to other}} townships in the area like University Park and St. Johns until it became a company town built by the Swift Meat Packing Company. By 1910, US$120,000 worth of buildings had been erected in the neighborhood with many fashioned out of concrete and brick. Two three-story brick hotels were built in Kenton in 1910. Plants from companies like the National Wood Pipe Company, Davis Safe and Lock Company, Union Meat Company and Portland Union Stockyards called Kenton home. A concrete apartment building was built by C. H. Carey costing US$22,000. In 1909, Portland, Oregon Mayor Joseph Simon took an automobile trip to Kenton where he announced general improvements for the community like <b>road</b> pavement, street <b>lamps</b> and a fire station. The streets were still dirt in 1910, leading the Kenton Push Club to lobby the Portland City Council to pass a bond to pave the roads. After a long fight with the city council, the roads were paved in 1911. By 1913, US$300,000 had been spent on paving the streets of Kenton. The growing community soon demanded a park, library and schoolhouse. Just a few years later, Kenton was annexed with St. Johns by the City of Portland, becoming home to Portland's main stockyards {{and the center of}} the West Coast cattle trade for a time.|$|R

6000|$|I {{suffered}} acutely {{the sickness}} of exile in Norwood. For weeks I wandered {{the streets of}} the suburb, haunted by the spirit of some part of Nethermere. As I went along the quiet <b>roads</b> where the <b>lamps</b> in yellow loneliness stood among the leafless trees of the night I would feel the feeling of the dark, wet bit of path between the wood meadow and the brooks. The spirit of that wild little slope to the Mill would come upon me, and there in the suburb of London I would walk wrapt {{in the sense of a}} small wet place in the valley of Nethermere. A strange voice within me rose and called for the hill path; again I could feel the wood waiting for me, calling and calling, and I crying for the wood, yet the space of many miles was between us. Since I left the valley of home I have not much feared any other loss. The hills of Nethermere had been my walls, and the sky of Nethermere my roof overhead. It seemed almost as if, at home, I might lift my hand to the ceiling of the valley, and touch my own beloved sky, whose familiar clouds came again and again to visit me, whose stars were constant to me, born when I was born, whose sun had been all my father to me. But now the skies were strange over my head, and Orion walked past me unnoticing, he who night after night had stood over the woods to spend with me a wonderful hour. When does day now lift up the confines of my dwelling place, when does the night throw open her vastness for me, and send me the stars for company? There is no night in a city. How can I lose myself in the magnificent forest of darkness when night is only a thin scattering of the trees of shadow with barrenness of lights between! ...|$|R
