5000|$|There {{were certain}} {{responsibilities}} or [...] "duties" [...] {{that came with}} receiving a free plot of land from the seigneur. Firstly, habitants were expected to cultivate and live on the land. If {{a piece of land}} was not cultivated within a year, the seigneur had the [...] "droit de réunion," [...] meaning the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>repossession.</b> Secondly, there were several dues that habitants had to pay to the seigneur. One due was the [...] "cens", which ranged between 2 and 6 sols. This charge was mostly symbolic, since it was a fairly paltry sum. Rent was typically set {{at an annual rate of}} 20 sols for every [...] "arpent" [...] of land. Seigneurs also received [...] "lods et ventes" [...] if habitants sold their land, which was equivalent to one-twelfth of the sale price. Another duty of habitants was to grind wheat at the seigneurial mill and pay a fee of one-fourteenth of the wheat ground. Some habitants also owed the seigneur one-thirteenth of the total amount of fish they caught. In addition, some habitants were responsible for completing 1-4 days of mandatory work during the sowing, harvesting, or haying season, which were called [...] "corvées". Habitants were expected to fulfill all of these obligations to repay the seigneur for granting them land in the first place.|$|E

40|$|With the {{implementation}} of the Basel II regulatory framework, it became increasingly important for financial institutions to develop accurate loss models. This work investigates the loss given default (LGD) of mortgage loans using a large set of recovery data of residential mortgage defaults from a major UK bank. A Probability <b>of</b> <b>Repossession</b> Model and a Haircut Model are developed and then combined to give an expected loss percentage. We find that the Probability <b>of</b> <b>Repossession</b> Model should consist of more than just the commonly used loan-to-value ratio, and that the estimation of LGD benefits from the Haircut Model, which predicts the discount which the sale price of a repossessed property may undergo. This two-stage LGD model is shown to perform better than a single-stage LGD model (which models LGD directly from loan and collateral characteristics), as it achieves a better R 2 value and matches the distribution of the observed LGD more accurately...|$|R

2500|$|In 1940 the Supreme Court {{departed}} from the realization concept described in Eisner v. Macomber when the Court held, in Helvering v. Bruun, , that [...] "severance" [...] is not an element of realization. In Bruun, a taxpayer-landlord repossessed a property from a tenant—property that had been subject to a 99-year lease—after the tenant failed to pay rent and taxes. The lease had allowed for the tenant to construct a new building or other improvements. The tenant had removed the existing building and had built a new one. The value of the new building as of the date <b>of</b> <b>repossession</b> was $64,245.68. The government contended that the landlord realized a gain of $51,434.25, {{the difference between the}} value of the building at the date <b>of</b> <b>repossession</b> and the landlord's basis in the old building of $12,811.43. The landlord argued that there was no realization of the property because no transaction had occurred, and that the improvement of the property that created the gain was unseverable from the landlord's original capital. The Court ruled against the landlord, deciding that the landlord had realized a gain upon <b>repossession</b> <b>of</b> the property, and said that [...] "severance" [...] is no longer an element of realization.|$|R
