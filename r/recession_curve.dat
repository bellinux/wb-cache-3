40|$|Storage {{of water}} within a river basin is often {{estimated}} by analyzing <b>recession</b> flow <b>curves</b> as it cannot be `instantly' estimated {{with the aid}} of available technologies. In this study we explicitly deal with the issue of estimation of `drainable' storage, which is equal to the area under the `complete' <b>recession</b> flow <b>curve</b> (i. e. a discharge vs. time curve where discharge continuously decreases till it approaches zero). But a major challenge in this regard is that <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> are rarely `complete' due to short inter-storm time intervals. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and model recession flows meaningfully. We adopt the wellknown Brutsaert and Nieber analytical method that expresses time derivative of discharge (dQ/dt) as a power law function of Q : -dQ/dt = kQ(alpha). However, the problem with dQ/dt-Q analysis {{is that it is not}} suitable for late recession flows. Traditional studies often compute alpha considering early recession flows and assume that its value is constant for the whole recession event. But this approach gives unrealistic results when alpha >= 2, a common case. We address this issue here by using the recently proposed geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) that exploits the dynamics of active drainage networks. According to the model, alpha is close to 2 for early recession flows and 0 for late recession flows. We then derive a simple expression for drainable storage in terms the power law coefficient k, obtained by considering early recession flows only, and basin area. Using 121 complete <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> from 27 USGS basins we show that predicted drainable storage matches well with observed drainable storage, indicating that the model can also reliably estimate drainable storage for `incomplete' recession events to address many challenges related to water resources.

40|$|Since Brutsaert and Neiber (1977), <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> {{are widely}} used to analyse {{subsurface}} systems of river basins by expressing -dQ/dt {{as a function of}} Q, which typically take a power law form: -dQ/dt=kQ, where Q is the discharge at a basin outlet at time t. Traditionally recession flows are modelled by single reservoir models that assume a unique relationship between -dQ/dt and Q for a basin. However, recent observations indicate that -dQ/dt-Q relationship of a basin varies greatly across recession events, indicating the limitation of such models. In this study, the dynamic relationship between -dQ/dt and Q of a basin is investigated through the geomorphological recession flow model which models recession flows by considering the temporal evolution of its active drainage network (the part of the stream network of the basin draining water at time t). Two primary factors responsible for the dynamic relationship are identified: (i) degree of aquifer recharge (ii) spatial variation of rainfall. Degree of aquifer recharge, which is likely to be controlled by (effective) rainfall patterns, influences the power law coefficient, k. It is found that k has correlation with past average streamflow, which confirms the notion that dynamic -dQ/dt-Q relationship is caused by the degree of aquifer recharge. Spatial variation of rainfall is found to have control on both the exponent,, and the power law coefficient, k. It is noticed that that even with same and k, <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> can be different, possibly due to their different (recession) peak values. This may also happen due to spatial variation of rainfall. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Himalayan {{region of}} Nepal and {{northern}} India experiences hydrological extremes from monsoonal floods during July to September, {{when most of}} the annual precipitation falls, to periods of very low flows during the dry season (December to February). While the monsoon floods cause acute disasters such as loss of human life and property, mudslides and infrastructure damage, the lack of water during the dry season has a chronic impact on the lives of local people. The management of water resources in the region is hampered by relatively sparse hydrometerological networks and consequently, many resource assessments are required in catchments where no measurements exist. A hydrological model for estimating dry season flows in ungauged catchments, based on <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> behaviour, has been developed to address this problem. Observed flows were fitted to a second order storage model to enable average annual recession behaviour to be examined. Regionalised models were developed, using a calibration set of 26 catchments, to predict three <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> parameters: the storage constant; the initial recession flow and the start date of the recession. Relationships were identified between: the storage constant and catchment area; the initial recession flow and elevation (acting as a surrogate for rainfall); and the start date of the recession and geographic location. An independent set of 13 catchments was used to evaluate the robustness of the models. The regional models predicted the average volume of water in an annual recession period (1 st of October to the 1 st of February) with an average error of 8 %, while mid-January flows were predicted to within ± 50 % for 79 % of the catchments in the data set.

With the onset of monsoon, throughout the monsoon the curve form rising limb and once the monsoon retrieve the curve starts forming recession limb, which continue until the next monsoon (annual cycle). Successive annual cycles join together to form long-term hydrograph. With the full knowledge of fluctuation of groundwater level, the hydraulic conductivity/filtration conditions can be calculated by analyzing <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> of well hydrograph (Ferdowsian et al. 2001; Gailuma and Vitola 2009; Posavec et al. 2006; Sujono et al. 2004). The rapid decline in <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> corresponds to better filtration conditions (Gailuma and Vitola 2009). Therefore, it can be stated comparatively that the U shape curves correspond to better hydraulic conductivity (k) than the V shape, whereas the S shape curves represents the lowest hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. So, based on hydraulic conductivity (k) aquifers can be classified as U > V > S type curve. In the Peninsular hard rock V type is more abundant over U type, while S type is the least abundant type since it largely corresponds to aquicludes.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{analysis}} of hydrograph recessions {{can be used}} to identify the parameters of a conceptual catchment storage irnodel and, with the advent of large-scale digital data storage and automated logging systems, it has become desirable to automate <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> analysis. Various studies have thus reported algorithms used to infer 'baseflow' storage models automatically from recession data. Such algorithms commonly operate by maximising the fit of measured recession data to some a priori function. Here, an alternative approach is taken in which the appropriate form for a catchment saturated zone store is investigated by combining observed recession data to form a Master <b>Recession</b> <b>Curve</b> (MRC). This is done within a software package that offers automated functions to help select recession periods suitable for inclusion within the MRC. These recession periods are combined automatically to form a "prototype" MRC, which can be modified interactively to overcome problems such as unrepresentative or sparse data. The master recession for a catchment is used to calculate an empirical catchment-averaged discharge-relative storage (Q?S) relationship. The method is considered to be general because the Q?S relationship may be of arbitrary form. Examples are given, showing the derivation for three catchments of different Q?S functions...|$|E

A methodology is presented, proposing filter calibration with the runoff influence and inflection of the <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> for dry season. Filters are improved with a logic constraint that limits water flow overestimation within algorithm iteration. The results were coherent with previous studies and with hydrogeological and climatological maps...|$|E
40|$|Baseflow is an {{important}} component in hydrological modeling. This process is usually modeled by using the linear aquifer storage–discharge relation approach, although the outflow from groundwater aquifers is nonlinear. To identify the accuracy of baseflow estimates in rivers dominated by snow and/or glacier melt in arid and cold northwestern China, a nonlinear storage–discharge relationship for use in SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tools) modeling was developed and applied to the Manas River basin in the Tianshan Mountains. Linear reservoir models and a digital filter program were used for comparisons. Meanwhile, numerical analysis of flow <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> from 78 river gauge stations revealed variation in the coefficients of the nonlinear relationship. It was found that the nonlinear reservoir model can improve the streamflow simulation, especially for low-flows. The highest Nash–Sutcliff efficiency and lowest Percent Bias were obtained when compared to the one- or two-linear reservoir approach. The exponent b of the aquifer storage–discharge function varied mostly between 0. 0 and 0. 1, which is much smaller than the suggested value of 0. 5. The coefficient a of the function is related to catchment properties, primarily the basin and glacier areas...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater has {{received}} increasing attention {{as an important}} strategic water resource for adaptation to climate change. In this regard, the separation of baseflow from streamflow and the analysis of <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> make {{a significant contribution to}} integrated river basin management. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) RECESS model adopting the master-recession curve (MRC) method can enhance the accuracy with which baseflow may be separated from streamflow, compared to other baseflow-separation schemes that are more limited in their ability to reflect various watershed/aquifer characteristics. The RECESS model has been widely used for the analysis of hydrographs, but the applications using RECESS were only available through Microsoft-Disk Operating System (MS-DOS). Thus, this study aims to develop a web-based RECESS model for easy separation of baseflow from streamflow, with easy applications for ungauged regions. RECESS on the web derived the alpha factor, which is a baseflow recession constant in the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and this variable was provided to SWAT as the input. The results showed that the alpha factor estimated from the web-based RECESS model improved the predictions of streamflow and recession. Furthermore, these findings showed that the baseflow characteristics of the ungauged watersheds were influenced by the land use and slope angle of watersheds, as well as by precipitation and streamflow...|$|R

Moving from a classic study on the base flow characteristics of six basins in the Finger Lakes region [1], a set of Brutsaert <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> (the lower envelope of available records of |dQ/dt| as a function of Q, where Q is at-a-station gauged flow rate) has been constructed from Swiss streamflow data relatively unaffected by snowmelt. The Lecture builds on the functional dependences found in [1] (chiefly through Boussinesq’ nonlinear solution of free-surface groundwater flow, yielding a specific relation to local drainage area and total stream length) and on the expedient avoidance of proper time references, to apply and generalize recent results aimed at the geomorphic origins of <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> [2], that is, fully integrating sizable geometric and topologic complexity. In particular, such results propose a link between river network morphology and the parametrization in [1], in particular by assimilating the basic scaling exponent a (i. e. |dQ/dt|µQa) to that characterizing the empirical relation N(x) µ G(x) a (where x is the downstream distance from the channel heads, N(x) is the number of channel reaches exactly located at distance x from their heads, and G(x) is the total drainage network length at a distance greater or equal to x down to the gauging station where Q is recorded [2]). Application of the method, originally tested on DTMs and daily discharge observations in 67 US basins, suggests a definite linkage of active drainage and source functions with the basic features of the Brutsaert envelopes. The possible morphological predictability of base flow features is central to transport processes at catchment scales, not least for its implications on our understanding of the geomorphic structure of the hydrologic response [3] and of the stationarity of the ensuing travel time distributions leading to the so-called old water paradox [4]. These issues are briefly discussed in the Lecture. Here, through a broad survey of Swiss field data, we go on suggest that the method [2] provides excellent results only in catchments where drainage density (roughly defined as the ratio of total channel network length to its drainage area [L- 1], defined at a station) can be regarded as spatially constant. When uneven drainage densities are observed, chiefly in our test cases for high mountainous areas where drainage density varies significantly owing to complex cryosphere dynamics and geologic or pedologic constraints, the method’s assumptions do not hold. In the Lecture a detailed reexamination of the premises of the approaches [1, 2] is proposed. A revision is then proposed, which includes geomorphic corrections based on a proper description of the drainage density seen as a random space function [5]. Such corrections properly vanish should drainage density become spatially constant. Overall, it is recognized a definite geomorphic origin for Brutsaert recessions, with notable implications.
