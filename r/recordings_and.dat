5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced <b>recordings</b> <b>and</b> a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.|$|E

Duophonic holds the copyrights to the band's <b>recordings,</b> <b>and</b> on this label the band has released many limited-edition records. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website {{that they were going}} on indefinite hiatus.|$|E
