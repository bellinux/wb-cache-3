5|$|The green <b>rosella</b> or Tasmanian <b>rosella</b> (Platycercus caledonicus) is {{a species}} of parrot native to Tasmania and Bass Strait islands. It was {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, and named on the mistaken assumption it came from New Caledonia. At 37cm (14.5in) long {{it is the largest}} species of the <b>rosella</b> genus, Platycercus. Two subspecies are recognised. The green rosella's underparts, neck and head are yellow, with a red band above the beak and violet-blue cheeks. The back is mostly black and green, and its long tail blue and green. The sexes have similar plumage, except the female has duller yellow plumage and more prominent red markings, as well as a smaller beak. Juvenile and immature birds have predominantly green plumage.|$|E
5|$|Found across Tasmania and Bass Strait islands, {{the green}} <b>rosella</b> {{is one of}} the commonest birds encountered. It also occurs on {{offshore}} islands such as Maria, Bruny, De Witt and Maatsuyker Islands. Its movements have not been much studied. Although possibly locally nomadic in places, the green <b>rosella</b> is sedentary; even birds at higher altitudes do not migrate. It has become rare on King Island, due to land clearing and possibly competition with the introduced common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for nesting sites. During breeding season there it is restricted to the Pegarah forest, though may venture elsewhere at other times.|$|E
40|$|Eastern <b>rosellas,</b> Platycercus eximius, and pale-headed <b>rosellas,</b> P. adscitus, fed in single-species {{flocks of}} {{generally}} {{less than five}} birds. Eastern <b>rosellas</b> fed in larger groups, particularly at ground level, and showed greater seasonal and daily changes in flock sizes than pale-headed <b>rosellas.</b> These interspecific differences are attributed to: (1) their feeding stations; (2) the social structure of each species; (3) the relative degree of aridity of the study areas...|$|R
50|$|Almost all <b>rosellas</b> are sedentary, {{although}} occasional {{populations are}} considered nomadic; no <b>rosellas</b> are migratory. Outside of the breeding season, crimson <b>rosellas</b> tend to congregate in pairs or small groups and feeding parties. The largest groups are usually composed of juveniles, who will gather in flocks {{of up to}} 20 individuals. When they forage, they are conspicuous and chatter noisily. <b>Rosellas</b> are monogamous, and during the breeding season, adult birds will not congregate in groups and will only forage with their mate.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1910, a {{small number}} of crimson <b>rosellas</b> were {{released}} off the Otago heads, New Zealand, along with eastern <b>rosellas.</b> These interbred and by the 1950s no pure crimson <b>rosellas</b> remained. This mixed population has remained there ever since. Crimson <b>rosellas</b> were also present in Wellington City from 1963 through the early 1990s as an introduced species. Two crimson <b>rosellas</b> were also recorded from the Tararua foothills in 1971. It is now thought to be extinct in the wild in New Zealand. They have also been introduced to Norfolk Island, where they are often known as [...] "red parrots", to distinguish them from the native Norfolk Island parakeet or [...] "green parrots".|$|R
5|$|Gould {{noted that}} early Tasmanian {{settlers}} regarded the abundant green <b>rosella</b> highly as food, and often shot and ate it. He {{agreed that it}} was very tasty after trying it himself. Many farmers saw the species as a pest of orchards, and green rosellas were shot.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{the green}} <b>rosella</b> was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range—greater than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)—and small rate of decline in population. The King Island {{subspecies}} is listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as vulnerable, and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green <b>rosella</b> is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
5|$|The green <b>rosella</b> has a {{repeated}} two-syllable contact call, {{which has been}} written as kussik kussik or cossack cossack and is heard in flight. When perched, it utters a rising kwik-kweek kwik-kweek contact call. Birds also make a chattering call during courtship. They can screech shrilly when alarmed.|$|E
50|$|Crimson <b>rosellas</b> forage in trees, bushes, and on {{the ground}} for the fruit, seeds, nectar, berries, and nuts {{of a wide variety of}} plants, {{including}} members of the Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, and Rosaceae families. Despite feeding on fruits and seeds, <b>rosellas</b> are not useful to the plants as seed-spreaders, because they crush and destroy the seeds in the process of eating them. Their diet often puts them at odds with farmers whose fruit and grain harvests can be damaged by the birds, which has resulted in large numbers of <b>rosellas</b> being shot in the past. Adelaide <b>rosellas</b> are known to feed on dormant cherry flower buds. <b>Rosellas</b> will also eat many insects and their larvae, including termites, aphids, beetles, weevils, caterpillars, moths, and water boatmen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rosellas</b> feed {{predominantly}} on {{seeds and}} fruit, with food {{held in the}} foot. They enjoy bathing in puddles {{of water in the}} wild and in captivity. <b>Rosellas</b> scratch their heads with the foot behind the wing.|$|R
5000|$|The You Yangs {{are home}} to more than 200 bird species such as tawny frogmouths, white-naped, white-plumed, New Holland and brown-headed honeyeaters, kookaburras, white-winged choughs, crested shrike-tits, eastern <b>rosellas,</b> crimson <b>rosellas,</b> purple-crowned lorikeets, sulphur-crested cockatoos, eastern yellow robins, jacky winters and scarlet robins.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Roma {{underwent}} a change of ownership, with the former club owner <b>Rosella</b> Sensi being replaced by an American consortium led by Thomas DiBenedetto. Under the new management, the club did not offer a permanent contract to Montella, which led to him leaving to coach another Serie A side, Catania. The Roma management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B side, in a bid to emulate Barcelona's football style.|$|E
5|$|The green <b>rosella</b> is {{predominantly}} herbivorous, with {{the seeds of}} grasses and trees—especially eucalypts—forming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), cranberry heath (Astroloma humifusum), myrtle beech (Lophozonia cunninghamii), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and buttercups (Ranunculus), berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), shining tea-tree (Leptospermum nitidum), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), Tasmanian bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus), Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida), messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua), snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), small-fruit hakea (Hakea microcarpa) and native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida). The green <b>rosella</b> has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common osier (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint (Eucalyptus amygdalina).|$|E
5|$|In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages {{more often}} on the foliage of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, though it does also show some {{preference}} for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson <b>rosella</b> (Platycercus elegans), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.|$|E
5|$|Green <b>rosellas</b> are {{generally}} encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather {{in groups of}} 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern <b>rosellas.</b> They fly in a straight line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between.|$|R
40|$|Adult Eastern <b>Rosellas</b> have {{a single}} post-breeding moult each year, from December to May. This moult is {{complete}} except in some bids, mostly females, that defer moult of outer primaries until the following year. Birds fledge in juvenile plumage, pass into pre-adult plumage when two to six months old with a moult {{of the head and}} body feathers and pass into adult plumage when twelve to eighteen months old with a complete moult. Replacement of primaries starts with middle primaries and progresses inwards and outwards from this focus. Average duration of primary moult is 114 days. A major difference between Eastern <b>Rosellas</b> and the taxonomically related Budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus is that Eastern <b>Rosellas</b> moult regularly after breeding, while Budgerigars moult continuously, even when breeding. Budgerigars moult into pre-adult and adult plumages at a younger age than do Eastern <b>Rosellas...</b>|$|R

5|$|The green <b>rosella</b> {{generally}} breeds at {{two years}} of age, though younger birds may pair up and look for nests. The breeding season is September to January, with one brood. The nesting site is usually a hollow over 1m (3ft) deep in a tree trunk anywhere up to 30m (100ft) above the ground. The tree chosen is generally a eucalypt such as Tasmanian bluegum, manna gum or mountain ash (E. regnans), or myrtle beech. Chimneys, holes in walls and even the vertical pipes of tennis court fences have been used. Green rosellas nested in a wall cavity at Port Arthur convict prison site in 1958 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{state has}} a rich history in ballet with five Native American ballerinas {{attaining}} worldwide fame. These were Yvonne Chouteau, sisters Marjorie and Maria Tallchief, <b>Rosella</b> Hightower and Moscelyne Larkin, known collectively as the Five Moons. The New York Times rates the Tulsa Ballet {{as one of the}} top ballet companies in the United States. The Oklahoma City Ballet and University of Oklahoma's dance program were formed by ballerina Yvonne Chouteau and husband Miguel Terekhov. The University program was founded in 1962 and was the first fully accredited program of its kind in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii {{provides}} an important food source, as flowers and seeds, for the threatened short-billed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris). Other bird species {{that have been}} observed feeding on B.menziesii include the red-capped parrot (Purpureicephalus spurius), western <b>rosella</b> (Platycercus icterotis), red-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii), Australian ringneck (Barnardius zonarius), western gerygone (Gerygone fusca) and several honeyeater species, the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), white-cheeked honeyeater (P.nigra), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), singing honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) and western wattlebird (A.lunulata). Insects recorded include ants and bees, as well as rove beetles (family Staphylinidae). A field study south of Perth noted that Banksia menziesii appeared particularly popular with the brown honeyeater and western spinebill, compared with other banksias.|$|E

5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green <b>rosella</b> is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.|$|E
5|$|The adult green <b>rosella</b> has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E
