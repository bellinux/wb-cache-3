50|$|Local {{telephone}} companies were installing <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> in distant {{rural areas as}} recently as the 1970s. While many of these points have subsequently been moved to conventional dial exchanges, in 1999 just over six hundred <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> were still in service in the North American Numbering Plan. Many were a lone party line serving some remote hamlet too small for its own telephone exchange. In 1999, {{more than half of the}} remaining <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> were in Canada, with Quebec and Newfoundland the largest users. The remaining US <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> mostly served rural Nevada, with a handful in California and Oregon.|$|R

50|$|Freeways in Taiwan are {{not exactly}} toll roads {{in the sense that}} toll gates/stations are not located at the {{entrance}} and exits of the freeway. <b>Toll</b> <b>stations</b> with weigh stations are located every thirty to forty kilometres on the No. 1 and No. 3 National Freeways of the Republic of China. There are usually no freeway exits once a <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> notification sign appears, making it necessary for the driver to be familiar with the locations of the <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> in advance.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively lorry {{drivers who}} rarely use German toll roads can log-on {{manually}} {{at one of}} 3,500 <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> terminals or over the internet. The log-on to a <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> terminal, located near motorway access ramps, is similar to purchasing a ticket. The driver enters the vehicle information, starting point and destination. The <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> calculates the fees based on the shortest route within the toll road network. As of December 2006 90% of the lorries on German roads paid the toll automatically. In 2006 the toll-collection rate for automatic transactions was 99.75% (Toll Collect, 2007).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} the development of a microscopic traffic simulation model for design, assessment, and operational analysis of <b>toll</b> <b>stations.</b> A simulation software using VB. NET was created to simulate the stochastic nature of traffic arrival, toll collection time, and driver decision making. The developed simulation model was used to analyze different scenarios of traffic volumes, toll booth capacity, driver types, and configuration of <b>toll</b> <b>station.</b> Results showed that volume per toll lane and method of payment significantly affect the average delay and maximum queue lengths of a <b>toll</b> <b>station.</b> Recommendations on number of toll booths are presented in order to process peak traffic hours without excessive delay times or long queues...|$|R
40|$|In July 2008, {{system of}} partial {{payments}} on motorways was aborted {{and for most}} of the traffic replaced by a vignette system. Vignettes are bought in advance and are valid {{for a longer period of}} time. The switch of system caused major changes on traffic – traffic increased on motorways and decreased on some lower order state roads (for which payment is not demanded). The biggest change is seen in <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> areas. Increased traffic on motorways caused shorter distances among vehicles and more interplays, which demands higher concentration of a driver. On the other hand, increased traffic on motorways loosened traffic on lower order state roads, especially on those which were used before as a bypass of <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> areas (with intention of avoiding paying toll). The vignette system does not require stopping at <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> for vehicles lighter than 3, 5 tone. It means higher flow and less traffic jams in <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> areas. But at the same time, it makes integrating trucks back to lane even more effortful. The increase of traffic in <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> areas and changes related to it are demonstrated in this thesis. In order of making those demonstrations, I interpreted information about:  car accidents (number, type, cause, classification),  traffic flow reorganisation in <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> areas,  changes of traffic structure. Information about traffic is collected from automatic traffic counters and car accidents are summarized after information collected by Police.

5000|$|Road tolls {{usually had}} to be paid at {{strategic}} locations such as bridges (sometimes called a bridge toll) or gates. In Europe, the road toll {{goes back to the}} practice of the Germanic tribes, who charged fees to travellers if they wanted to cross over mountain passages. From that time, road tolls became commonplace in medieval times, especially in the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire had a [...] "passage system" [...] whereby a number of <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> would be established on a route where small tolls were collected. Examples were the Ochsenweg in Schleswig-Holstein which had <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> at Königsau and Rendsburg, Neumünster, Bramstedt and Ulzburg, as well as the Gabler Road with the Karlsfried Castle as its <b>toll</b> <b>station.</b> Another form of road tax was Liniengeld, which {{had to be}} paid when entering the city of Vienna {{from the beginning of the}} 18th century.|$|R

50|$|Another way {{to collect}} money from {{motorway}} using is so-called closed system, on {{which there are}} <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> on every interchange both entering and exiting the motorway, as well as toll booths on the motorway, which signifies {{the end of the}} concession section. In this case the driver receives a ticket while entering the motorway, which must be kept all the time using the motorway. He pays at either <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> while exiting the motorway or at the toll booth. The amount of money depends not only on the type of the car, but also on the distance driven. It is more expensive at the building and maintenance, as the <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> have to be built at every interchange. However, it requires fewer toll booths across the motorway, which is a big advantage, as the traffic is free-flowing, and there is less fuel consumption. The queues before the tolls are put off the motorway, and are put onto the exits and interchanges.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{quantify}} the impact of rainfall on freeway traffic flow using <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> data and precipitation data. Five rainfall categories were classified based on precipitation intensity. Hourly traffic volume and travel times were retrieved and analysed in three spatial scales: at <b>toll</b> <b>stations,</b> on freeway sections between two <b>toll</b> <b>stations,</b> and on freeway corridors composed of multiple sections. Travel times for passenger cars in each rainfall category were studied and the impact of rainfall on traffic volume and travel time was quantified. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to check the significance of difference among various categories. Calculated traffic volume reduction coefficients and travel time incremental coefficients for each rainfall category were compared with existing research results, which showed obvious differences. Potential causes are discussed to explain the discrepancy in coefficient values. freeway traffic; motorway traffic; rainfall impact; non-parametric testing; traffic volume; travel time; China; precipitation intensity; passenger cars...|$|R
30|$|In Hunan province, each highway <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> must {{transfer}} the collected information on vehicles and roads to the Management Center located in Changsha city {{from time to}} time. The Management Center (MC) plays a role as centralized data center for highway information computing, storage, and monitoring. A <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> can {{transfer the}} traffic information by private highway fiber network or by VPN rented from China Telecom as a backup line. While in some areas, especially the mountainous areas, the wired channel to MC is very disruption prone due to disrepair and aging of lines. <b>Toll</b> <b>stations</b> would have to choose the wireless broadband service rented from China Mobile when the wired channel failed and <b>toll</b> <b>stations</b> were disconnected from the MC. But in these areas, all stations are not equipped with access points connecting RRHs, and those with access points may have a different wireless channel QoS due to the difference of distance, terrain, and devices. One of possible solutions under this condition is to select a <b>toll</b> <b>station</b> as a relay node, which should have the best wireless QoS compared to other stations nearby. The nearby stations could transfer the traffic information to the relay node by wired channel (providing the wired channel between them is working well) or by D 2 D communications. After that, the relay node would transfer the traffic information to MC by wireless broadband channel. Thus, it is desirable for the relay node to be dynamically configured to choose an optimal solution for reducing communication cost while subject to time constraints. The service provided by this relay node is the data service in this context. The relay node is a service provider who should take responsibilities of configuring and optimizing the data transferring procedure.|$|R
