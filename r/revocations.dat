We are particularly interested in two key issues: how to perform the <b>revocation</b> and how to manage the <b>revocation</b> policy. We show {{how to deal with}} these two aspects in our delegation model based on the OrBAC formalism and its administration licence concept. This model provides means to manage several types of of delegations, such as the delegation or the transfer of permissions and roles, multi-step delegation and temporary delegation. We state formally in this paper how to manage the <b>revocation</b> of these delegations schemes.

40|$|Abstract — Key {{management}} is a core mechanism {{to ensure the}} security of applications and network services in wireless sensor networks. It includes two aspects: key distribution and key <b>revocation.</b> Key distribution has been extensively studied {{in the context of}} sensor networks. However, key <b>revocation</b> has received relatively little attention. Existing key <b>revocation</b> schemes can be divided into two categories: centralized key <b>revocation</b> scheme and distributed key <b>revocation</b> scheme. In this paper, we first summarize the current key <b>revocation</b> schemes for sensor networks. Then, we propose an efficient centralized key <b>revocation</b> scheme, KeyRev, for wireless sensor networks. Unlike most proposed key <b>revocation</b> schemes focusing on removing the compromised keys, we propose to use key updating techniques to obsolesce the keys owned by the compromised sensor nodes and thus remove the nodes from the network.

40|$|In ownership-based {{access control}} {{frameworks}} {{with the possibility}} of delegating permissions and administrative rights, chains of delegated accesses will form. There are different ways to treat these delegation chains when revoking rights, which give rise to different <b>revocation</b> schemes. Hagström et al.

This paper is based on the observation that there are some problems with Hagström et al.

In order to formally study the merits and demerits of various definitions of <b>revocation</b> schemes, we propose to apply the axiomatic method originating in social choice theory to <b>revocation</b> schemes. For formulating an axiom, i. e. a desirable property of <b>revocation</b> frameworks, we propose a logic, Trust Delegation Logic TDL), with which one can formalize the different reasons an agent may have for performing a <b>revocation.</b> We show that our refined graph-theoretic definitions of the <b>revocation</b> schemes, unlike Hagström et al.

The defendant has the burden of establishing that if released pending further proceedings, they will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community. The law mandates revocation for some violations, such as possession of a controlled substance, possession of a firearm, or refusal to take a drug test. The statute specifies the possible consequences of revocation, and the sentencing guidelines establish grades of violations and a revocation table recommending various terms of imprisonment depending on the seriousness of the violation and the defendant's criminal history when he/she was originally sentenced.|$|E

The sample consisted of federally sentenced women who were granted a conditional release between 1995 and 2000, and identified at intake as having a substance abuse problem.

500|$|The {{amendments}} to the Constitution {{paved the way for}} intended {{amendments to}} the ISA. The new Article 149(3) stated that if the issue of the validity of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister for Home Affairs arose in any court proceedings commenced before or after 27 January 1989, it was to be determined in accordance with any law enacted by Parliament for this purpose, and Article 93 of the Constitution could not be relied upon to invalidate such a law. Pursuant to Article 149(3), Parliament then inserted new sections into the ISA. In particular, section 8B(1) confirmed the judgment in Lee Mau Seng by declaring that [...] "the law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the provisions of this Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971; and no part of the law before, on or after that date of {{any other country in the}} Commonwealth relating to judicial review shall apply". In addition, section 8B(1) was made subject to section 8B(2), which seeks to oust judicial review in any court of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister under the ISA, save where there is any question which relates to compliance with any procedural requirement of the ISA governing such acts or decisions. Jayakumar said in Parliament that section 8B(2) sought not only to prevent the courts from questioning the soundness of the subjective test, but also to anticipate any legal challenges on the basis that the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng only applies to the judicial review of detention orders and not to other acts or decisions under the ISA by the President or Minister, such as suspension directions and <b>revocations</b> of such directions.|$|E

40|$|Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is {{increasingly}} popular as the security infrastructure {{of choice in}} corporate information systems and Internet applications. In particular, certificates are used to distribute public keys associated with the identity of its owner. One of the main concerns associated with PKI is that mechanisms for <b>revocation</b> of certificates are required. Certificate <b>Revocation</b> is the action of declaring a certificate invalid before its validity period is at an end. Investigations of PKI have demonstrated that the traditional means of certificate <b>revocation</b> are the most expensive part of a PKI system. In response to this problem, several different schemes and protocols have been suggested to provide more efficient certificate <b>revocation.</b> This thesis provides a survey and an analysis of existing schemes for public key certificate <b>revocation.</b> The analysis includes the traditional certificate <b>revocation</b> lists, protocols that provide on-line certificate <b>revocation,</b> as well as <b>revocation</b> systems with reduced data structures. Some techniques for improving the existing schemes are also suggested. Based on the analysis, the different schemes are compared in order to highlight advantages and disadvantages. A guideline for using this information in selecting a <b>revocation</b> solution is developed and applied to different example scenarios.
