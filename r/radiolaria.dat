5|$|Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) painted {{beautiful}} {{illustrations of}} marine organisms, in particular <b>Radiolaria,</b> emphasising their symmetry {{to support his}} faux-Darwinian theories of evolution.|$|E
5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine <b>radiolaria,</b> Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radiolaria</b> {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and <b>radiolaria.</b> Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E

25|$|Deposits of chert {{formed from}} the {{accumulation}} of siliceous skeletons of microscopic organisms such as <b>radiolaria</b> and diatoms.|$|E
25|$|In the Haeckel’s work, Collodaria {{was named}} {{the first order of}} <b>Radiolaria,</b> and defined as “Spumellaria without {{latticed}} shell.” This definition of Collodaria was further expanded to include organisms that either completely lack the skeleton or have numerous spicules that loosely scatter throughout the calymma around the central capsule. In recent literature, the definition of Collodaria has been altered with molecular phylogenetic characteristics. In Haeckel’s phylogeny, the second order in <b>Radiolaria,</b> Sphaerellaria, includes all <b>Radiolaria</b> with any trace of latticed or fenestrated shell. In the last decade, Radiolarians are reclassified in five taxonomic orders as characterized by the composition and morphology of the mineral skeletons which include Acantharia with strontium sulphate skeleton, Taxopodida with silica skeleton, Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria with polycystine silica skeleton. Hence, in the current classification Collodaria now has four sister orders instead of having one sister order as in Haeckel’s original tree. Collodaria, Nassellaria and Spumellaria are sometimes called the Polycystines for their shared skeleton composition character.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Ernst Haeckel {{described}} (Haeckel, 1904) {{a number of}} species of <b>Radiolaria,</b> some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include Circoporus octahedrus, Circogonia icosahedra, Lithocubus geometricus and Circorrhegma dodecahedra. The shapes of these creatures should be obvious from their names.|$|E
25|$|Micropaleontology can {{be roughly}} {{divided into four}} areas of study {{on the basis of}} {{microfossil}} composition: (a) calcareous, as in coccoliths and foraminifera, (b) phosphatic, as in the study of some vertebrates, (c) siliceous, as in diatoms and <b>radiolaria,</b> or (d) organic, as in the pollen and spores studied in palynology.|$|E
25|$|Silicon is an {{essential}} element in biology, although only tiny traces are required by animals. However, various sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and <b>radiolaria,</b> secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues, {{such as in the}} bark and wood of Chrysobalanaceae and the silica cells and silicified trichomes of Cannabis sativa, horsetails and many grasses.|$|E
25|$|Haeckel was a zoologist, an {{accomplished}} artist and illustrator, {{and later a}} professor of comparative anatomy. Although Haeckel's ideas {{are important to the}} history of evolutionary theory, and although he was a competent invertebrate anatomist most famous for his work on <b>radiolaria,</b> many speculative concepts that he championed are now considered incorrect. For example, Haeckel described and named hypothetical ancestral microorganisms that have never been found.|$|E
25|$|It is undisputable that Haeckel’s {{contribution}} {{built the}} foundation of morphological knowledge in <b>Radiolaria</b> and its orders including Collodaria. However, research {{in recent years has}} found major discrepancies between molecular phylogenetic trees and Haeckel’s morphology-based phylogenetic trees. Mistakes in phylogeny were likely made when Haeckel characterized different lifecycles as two species. Some of these discrepancies are addressed in the summary of the most recent research on the phylogenetic relationships within Collodaria found in following section.|$|E
25|$|Polyhedra {{appear in}} biology as well. In the early 20th century, Ernst Haeckel {{described}} {{a number of}} species of <b>Radiolaria,</b> some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra (Haeckel, 1904). Examples include Circoporus octahedrus, Circogonia icosahedra, Lithocubus geometricus and Circorrhegma dodecahedra; the shapes of these creatures are indicated by their names. The outer protein shells of many viruses form regular polyhedra. For example, HIV is enclosed in a regular icosahedron.|$|E
25|$|The {{story behind}} this order {{involved}} the historic voyage of H.M.S. Challenger. As {{recorded in the}} manuscript of “Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873-1876,” the HMS Challenger embarked from Portsmouth, England in December 1872. Onboard this military vessel that had auxiliary steam power were physicists, chemists and biologists led by Captain Wyville Thomson, collaborating in an interdisciplinary venture to discover the diversity of life. With guns removed from the ships and replaced with long sampling rope, wire, thermometers, bottom samplers and water bottles, “naturalists” on board collected samples of marine organisms and fossils throughout the ocean waters. After the death of Wyville Thomson, his successor John Murray supervised the publication and research of collected data from the voyage at which point samples of radiolarians were passed onto Haeckel who was already {{a professor at the}} University of Jena, Germany. In the editorial notes of the report, Murray stated that Haeckel’s “Report on the <b>Radiolaria</b> collected by H.M.S. Challenger” represents Haeckel’s ten years’ devotion. In Haeckel’s report, all existing knowledge on <b>Radiolaria</b> was recorded, and older species and fossils were redescribed into three volumes.|$|E
25|$|The summit area of Mount Diablo {{is made up}} of {{deposits}} of gray sandstone (graywacke), chert, oceanic volcanic basalts (greenstone) and a minor amount of shale. The hard red Franciscan chert is sedimentary in origin and rich in microscopic <b>radiolaria</b> fossils and seashells. In the western foothills of the mountain there are large {{deposits of}} younger sandstone rocks also rich in seashells, severely tilted and in places forming dramatic ridgelines. Mount Diablo is a double pyramid and some say it resembles a volcano (which it isn't).|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} species produce exoskeletons, which {{are composed of}} a range of materials. Bone, cartilage, or dentine is used in the Ostracoderm fish and turtles. Chitin forms the exoskeleton in arthropods including insects, arachnids such as spiders, crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters, and in some fungi and bacteria. Calcium carbonates constitute the shells of molluscs, brachiopods, and some tube-building polychaete worms. Silica forms the exoskeleton in the microscopic diatoms and <b>radiolaria.</b> One species of mollusc, the scaly-foot gastropod, even makes use of the iron sulfides greigite and pyrite.|$|E
25|$|Although silicon {{is readily}} {{available}} {{in the form of}} silicates, very few organisms use it directly. Diatoms, <b>radiolaria</b> and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica phytoliths (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example rice, need silicon for their growth. There is some evidence that silicon is important to nail, hair, bone and skin health in humans, for example in studies that show that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density, and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis. Silicon is needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen, of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body.|$|E
2500|$|Collodaria is an {{unicellular}} order (organisms {{within the}} order are called Collodarians) under the phylum Radiozoa (or <b>Radiolaria)</b> and the infrakingdom Rhizaria. Like {{most of the}} <b>Radiolaria</b> taxonomy, Collodaria was first described by Ernst Haeckel, a German scholar who published three volumes of manuscript describing the extensive samples of <b>Radiolaria</b> collected by the voyage of HMS Challenger. [...] Recent molecular phylogenetic studies concluded that there are Collodaria contains three families, Sphaerozodae, Collosphaeridae, and Collophidilidae.|$|E

2500|$|Ernst Haeckel is {{the main}} {{contributor}} to species description in the phylum <b>Radiolaria,</b> which contains the order Collodaria. Members of Collodaria were first described in 1862. In 1881, Collodaria was defined by Haeckel in 1881 as “Spumellaria without latticed shell.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Next, imagine sponges, <b>Radiolaria,</b> Foraminifera, and diatomaceous plants, such {{as those}} which now exist in the deep-sea, to be introduced: they would be {{distributed}} according to the same laws as at present, the sponges (and possibly some of the Foraminifera), covering the bottom, while other Foraminifera, with the <b>Radiolaria</b> and Diatomacea, would increase and multiply in the surface waters. In accordance with the existing state of things, the <b>Radiolaria</b> and Diatoms would have a universal distribution, the latter gathering most thickly in the polar regions, while the Foraminifera would be largely, if not exclusively, confined to the intermediate zone; and, {{as a consequence of}} this distribution, a bed of [...] "chalk" [...] would begin to form in the intermediate zone, while caps of silicious rock would accumulate on the circumpolar regions.|$|E
60|$|In {{the great}} {{intermediate}} zone, occupying some 110° of latitude, which separates the circumpolar Arctic and Antarctic areas of silicious deposit, the Diatoms and <b>Radiolaria</b> {{of the surface}} water and the sponges of the bottom do not die out, and, so far as some forms are concerned, do not even appear to diminish in total number; though, on a rough estimate, {{it would appear that}} the proportion of <b>Radiolaria</b> to Diatoms is much greater than in the colder seas. Nevertheless the composition of the deep-sea mud of this intermediate zone is entirely different from that of the circumpolar regions.|$|E
60|$|But if the <b>Radiolaria</b> and Diatoms {{are thus}} rained upon {{the bottom of}} the sea, from the {{superficial}} layer of its waters in which they pass their lives, it is obviously possible that the Globigerinae may be similarly derived; and if they were so, it would be much more easy to understand how they obtain their supply of food than it is at present. Nevertheless, the positive and negative evidence all points the other way. The skeletons of the full-grown, deep-sea Globigerinae are so remarkably solid and heavy in proportion to their surface as to seem little fitted for floating; and, as a matter of fact, they are not to be found along with the Diatoms and <b>Radiolaria,</b> in the uppermost stratum of the open ocean.|$|E
6000|$|But if the <b>Radiolaria</b> and Diatoms {{are thus}} rained upon {{the bottom of}} the sea, from the {{superficial}} layer of its waters in which they pass their lives, it is obviously possible that the Globigerinoe may be similarly derived; and if they were so, it would be much more easy to understand how they obtain their supply of food than it is at present. Nevertheless, the positive and negative evidence all points the other way. The skeletons of the full-grown, deep-sea Globigerinoe are so remarkably solid and heavy in proportion to their surface as to seem little fitted for floating; and, as a matter of fact, they are not to be found along with the Diatoms and <b>Radiolaria</b> in the uppermost stratum of the open ocean. It has been observed, again, that the abundance of Globigerinoe, in proportion to other organisms, of like kind, increases with the depth of the sea; and that deep-water Globigerinoe are larger than those which live in shallower parts of the sea; and such facts negative the supposition that these organisms have been swept by currents from the shallows into the deeps of the Atlantic. It therefore seems to be hardly doubtful that these wonderful creatures live and die at the depths in which they are found.[2] ...|$|E
60|$|In 1850, Captain Penny {{collected}} in Assistance Bay, in Kingston Bay, and in Melville Bay, which lie between 73° 45' and 74° 40' N., specimens of the residuum left by melted surface ice, {{and of the}} sea bottom in these localities. Dr. Dickie, of Aberdeen, sent these materials to Ehrenberg, who made out[2] that the residuum of the melted ice consisted {{for the most part}} of the silicious cases of diatomaceous plants, and of the silicious spicula of sponges; while, mixed with these, were a certain number of the equally silicious skeletons of those low animal organisms, which were termed Polycistineoe by Ehrenberg, but are now known as <b>Radiolaria.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Thus, in {{the whole}} of the [...] "intermediate zone," [...] the silicious deposit which is being formed there, as elsewhere, by the {{accumulation}} of sponge- spicula, <b>Radiolaria,</b> and Diatoms, is obscured and overpowered by the immensely greater amount of calcareous sediment, which arises from the aggregation of the skeletons of dead Foraminifera. The similarity of the deposit, thus composed of a large percentage of carbonate of lime, and a small percentage of silex, to chalk, regarded merely as a kind of rock, which was first pointed out by Ehrenberg,[5] is now admitted on all hands; nor can it be reasonably doubted, that ordinary metamorphic agencies are competent to convert the [...] "modern chalk" [...] into hard limestone or even into crystalline marble.|$|E
60|$|In 1856, a very {{remarkable}} {{addition to}} {{our knowledge of the}} nature of the sea bottom in high northern latitudes was made by Professor Bailey of West Point. Lieutenant Brooke, of the United States Navy, who was employed in surveying the Sea of Kamschatka, had succeeded in obtaining specimens of the sea bottom from greater depths than any hitherto reached, namely from 2,700 fathoms (16,200 feet) in 56° 46' N., and 168° 18' E.; and from 1,700 fathoms (10,200 feet) in 60° 15' N. and 170° 53' E. On examining these microscopically, Professor Bailey found, as Ehrenberg had done in the case of mud obtained on the opposite side of the Arctic region, that the fine mud was made up of shells of Diatomacoe, of spicula of sponges, and of <b>Radiolaria,</b> with a small admixture of mineral matters, but without a trace of any calcareous organisms.|$|E
60|$|Among those, Professor Haeckel, of Jena, is the Coryphaeus. I {{know of no}} {{more solid}} and {{important}} contributions to biology {{in the past seven}} years than Haeckel's work on the <b>Radiolaria,</b> and the researches of his distinguished colleague Gegenbaur, in vertebrate anatomy; while in Haeckel's Generelle Morphologie there is all the force, suggestiveness, and, what I may term the systematizing power, of Oken, without his extravagance. The Generelle Morphologie is, in fact, an attempt to put the doctrine of Evolution, so far as it applies to the living world, into a logical form; and to work out its practical applications to their final results. The work before us, again, may be said to be an exposition of the Generelle Morphologie for an educated public, consisting, as it does, of the substance of a series of lectures delivered before a mixed audience at Jena, in the session 1867-8.|$|E
60|$|As I have mentioned, the {{soundings}} {{from the}} great Atlantic plain are almost entirely made up of Globigerinae, with the granules which have been mentioned and some few other calcareous shells; but {{a small percentage of}} the chalky mud--perhaps at most some five per cent of it--is of a different nature, and consists of shells and skeletons composed of silex, or pure flint. These silicious bodies belong partly to the lowly vegetable organisms which are called Diatomaceae, and partly to the minute, and extremely simple, animals, termed <b>Radiolaria.</b> It is quite certain that these creatures do not live at the bottom of the ocean, but at its surface--where they may be obtained in prodigious numbers by the use of a properly constructed net. Hence it follows that these silicious organisms, though they are not heavier than the lightest dust, must have fallen, in some cases, through fifteen thousand feet of water, before they reached their final resting-place on the ocean floor. And, considering how large a surface these bodies expose in proportion to their weight, it is probable that they occupy a great length of time in making their burial journey from the surface of the Atlantic to the bottom.|$|E
6000|$|Among the {{scientific}} {{instructions for the}} voyage drawn up by a committee of the Royal Society, however, there is a remarkable letter from Von Humboldt to Lord Minto, then First Lord of the Admiralty, in which, among other things, he dwells upon {{the significance of the}} researches into the microscopic composition of rocks, and the discovery of the great share which microscopic organisms take {{in the formation of the}} crust of the earth at the present day, made by Ehrenberg in the years 1836-39. Ehrenberg, in fact, had shown that the extensive beds of [...] "rotten-stone" [...] or [...] "Tripoli" [...] which occur in various parts of the world, and notably at Bilin in Bohemia, consisted of accumulations of the silicious cases and skeletons of Diatomaceoe, sponges, and Radiolaria; he had proved that similar deposits were being formed by Diatomaceoe, in the pools of the Thiergarten in Berlin and elsewhere, and had pointed out that, if it were commercially worth while, rotten-stone might be manufactured by a process of diatom-culture. Observations conducted at Cuxhaven in 1839, had revealed the existence, at the surface of the waters of the Baltic, of living Diatoms and <b>Radiolaria</b> of the same species as those which, in a fossil state, constitute extensive rocks of tertiary age at Caltanisetta, Zante, and Oran, on the shores of the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|D-Shape {{successfully}} {{created the}} tallest printed sculpture, <b>Radiolaria,</b> in 2009. <b>Radiolaria,</b> a sculpture created by Italian architect Andrea Morgante and inspired by radiolarians, unicellular organisms with intricate mineral skeletons, shows off D-Shape's ability to print large freeform structures. The {{current version of}} the sculpture is only a 3 x 3 x 3m scale model of the full-size <b>Radiolaria</b> that is planned {{to be put in}} a roundabout in Pontedera, Italy.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between the Foraminifera and <b>Radiolaria</b> is also debated. Molecular trees supports their close relationship—a grouping termed Retaria. But whether they are sister lineages or if the Foraminifera should be included within the <b>Radiolaria</b> is not known.|$|E
50|$|The Summary Report of the HMS Challenger {{expedition}} lists <b>radiolaria</b> {{from the}} two dredged samples taken when the Challenger Deep was first discovered. These (Nassellaria and Spumellaria) were reported in the Report on <b>Radiolaria</b> (1887) written by Ernst Haeckel.|$|E
50|$|German {{biologist}} Ernst Haeckel produced finely detailed {{drawings of}} <b>radiolaria</b> in Kunstformen der Natur (1904), helping to popularize these protists among parlor microscopists alongside foraminifera and diatoms, {{in addition to}} two lengthy illustrated monographs from field observation dedicated to <b>Radiolaria,</b> intended for academic study.|$|E
