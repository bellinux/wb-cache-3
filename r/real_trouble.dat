The New South Welshmen batted first and Charlie Barker (101) became only the second player to make a century in a minor game against the MCC since the war. He added 196 for the fourth wicket with Michael Hill (98) as the home team made 334, with Bob Barber taking 4/57 with his leg-spin. The MCC were in <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> at 106/5, but M.J.K.

Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast.

25|$|February {{featured}} three Premier League encounters. Derby County were in <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> in the Premier League, occupying 20th position, with 19th-place Fulham {{well out}} of reach for the East Midlands club. Their visit to St Andrew's also saw the return of Robbie Savage who left the Blues back in 2005. A Larsson goal looked like it had secured a valuable three points for the Blues before an 89th-minute Emanuel Villa goal secured a point for Derby. A trip to West Ham was next up for the Blues. Fredrik Ljungberg scored in the opening encounters for the Hammers, but a penalty from new signing McFadden made sure that the Blues would at least leave with a point. The last game of the month was a home match between the Blues and Arsenal. A 28th-minute free kick from McFadden opened the scoring, before two Theo Walcott goals within five minutes looked to have given the points to Arsenal, before an injury time McFadden penalty stole a point for the Blues. The game became highly controversial as within minutes of the kick off, a badly timed challenge by centre-back Martin Taylor broke the leg of Arsenal striker Eduardo. No one could complain about the automatic red card that referee Mike Dean showed Taylor, but comments after the game by Arsène Wenger campaigned for a much longer ban than the traditional three-match ban. Although Wenger later retracted his comments, his idea gained support with Sepp Blatter in particular, who campaigned for Taylor to be punished with a season-long ban. The defender also received death threats from supporters of the Croatia national team, as Eduardo would miss Euro 2008 in the summer.|$|E

It was decided to stay with someone who understood the [...] "gestalt of Star Trek", and Frakes was given the job. Frakes reported {{to work every day}} at 6:30am. A major concern during the production was security—the script to Generations had been leaked online, and stronger measures were taken to prevent a similar occurrence.

[...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart.

500|$|Goldfinger {{received}} more positive reviews than Fleming's previous novel, Dr. No, which had faced widespread {{criticism in the}} British media. Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only {{in the direction of}} an atomic, sophisticated Sapper." [...] Even when leaving reality behind, however, Richardson considers that Fleming, [...] "even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek, ... remains maniacally readable". Richardson picked up on two areas relating to the characters of the book, saying that Goldfinger [...] "is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends", whilst, referring to the novel's central character, observed that [...] "the <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he {{is becoming more and more}} synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps it is just as well." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that [...] "Goldfinger...will not let [...] close admirers down". Perrott thought that overall [...] "Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe"; he summarised the book by saying that it was [...] "hard to put down; but some of us wish we had the good taste just to try." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Kramer was the {{catalyst}} {{in the founding}} of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), a direct action protest organization that chose government agencies and corporations as targets to publicize lack of treatment and funding for people with AIDS. ACT UP was formed at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York City. Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. He began by having two-thirds of the room stand up, and told them they would be dead in five years. Kramer reiterated the points introduced in his essay [...] "1,112 and Counting": [...] "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in <b>real</b> <b>trouble.</b> If what you're hearing doesn't rouse you to anger, fury, rage, and action, gay men will have no future here on earth.

2500|$|Secretary of State Dean Rusk {{commented on}} the most {{significant}} area of disagreement regarding the resolution:There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from [...] "the" [...] territories or from [...] "all" [...] territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning [...] "the." [...] We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be [...] "rationalized"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take {{a fresh look at}} the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel {{as a result of the}} June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I'm not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.|$|E

2500|$|The royal courts, {{fixed to}} meet in London by the Magna Carta 1215, {{accepted}} claims for [...] "trespass on the case" [...] (more like a tort today). A jury would be called, and no wager of law was needed, but some breach of the King's peace had to be alleged. Gradually, the courts allowed claims where {{there had been no}} <b>real</b> <b>trouble,</b> no tort with [...] "force of arms" [...] (vi et armis), but it was still necessary to put this in the pleading. For instance, in 1317 one Simon de Rattlesdene alleged he was sold a tun of wine that was contaminated with salt water and, quite fictitiously, this was said to be done [...] "with force and arms, namely with swords and bows and arrows". The Court of Chancery and the King's Bench slowly started to allow claims without the fictitious allegation of force and arms from around 1350. An action for simple breach of a covenant (a solemn promise) had required production of formal proof of the agreement with a seal. However, in The Humber Ferryman's case a claim was allowed, without any documentary evidence, against a ferryman who dropped a horse overboard that he was contracted to carry across the River Humber. Despite this liberalisation, in the 1200s a threshold of 40 shillings for a dispute's value had been created. Though its importance tapered away with inflation over the years, it foreclosed court access to most people. Moreover, freedom to contract was firmly suppressed among the peasantry. After the Black Death, the Statute of Labourers 1351 prevented any increase in workers' wages fuelling, among other things, the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{weakness}} {{that could}} be seen in the Australian team was their batting, Don Bradman (99.94), Sid Barnes (63.05) and Bill Brown (46.82) had all retired and had not been fully replaced. The vice-captain Arthur Morris (46.48) was labeled [...] "Bedser's Bunny" [...] as the English bowler dismissed him easily in the first three Tests, but he made 168 and 105 against the tourists for New South Wales and 100 for an Australian XI. He finally laid the bunny to rest with his highest Test century in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, making 206 out of 371. The <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> was finding him a suitable opening partner as Jack Moroney made a pair, Ken Archer never made a Test 50 and Jim Burke failed when promoted after making an unbeaten century on his Test debut. It was a problem that was not solved and Lindsay Hassett took to opening the batting in 1953 and Morris had another succession of partners in 1954-55. Neil Harvey (48.42) was still a baby-faced youngster in 1950-51, committed to strokeplay regardless of the situation. He had a steady series and initially came in at number 3 before being moved down to his natural position at number 4. Lindsay Hassett replaced him and the Australian captain made more runs than anybody else in the team, but failed to make a century. However, he did have strength in depth, Keith Miller (36.97) and Ray Lindwall (21.15) were all-rounders of Test class, Miller topped the Australian batting averages and was the only man who could - briefly - take the attack to the accurate bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. Sam Loxton (36.93) was a big-hitting all-rounder, but his bowling days were behind him and was used as a middle order batsmen, without success. Ian Johnson was a useful tailender who could have been a fully-fledged all rounder with greater application and made 77 in the Third Test at Sydney. Don Tallon was a useful lower-order batsmen in 1948, but failed in all the Tests and his increasing deafness made him a poor runner. Bill Johnston was an awkward batsmen who could be difficult to remove, but the last man was Jack Iverson [...] "...whose batting pretensions are possibly no higher than those of a third-grade schoolboy player".|$|E
2500|$|Bob Willis {{opened the}} bowling {{with a stiff}} breeze behind him, but Peter Lever found it too much going into the wind and Mike Hendrick (2/64) {{replaced}} him after one over. Hendrick got Wally Edwards to mis-hook a short ball to a tumbling Dennis Amiss. At the other end Ian Redpath was backing away to leg to avoid Willis's bouncers, but exposed his off-stump and was yorked for 5, leaving Australia 10/2. The Chappell brothers recovered the innings with a stand of 100 runs in 155 minutes with Denness rotating his bowlers every four overs so they could rest. Ian Chappell was out of form and took 97 minutes to make 11 runs, but after lunch the fast bowlers were replaced by Tony Greig, who suffered as the brothers took advantage of his poor length. In {{the end it was}} Derek Underwood who dismissed Greg Chappell for 58 with the best ball of the day, a leg-spinner which clipped the edge of his bat and was taken by Keith Fletcher at slip. The Australian captain started arguing with Greig as the lanky bowler's footmarks were in line with the stumps and obliterating Chappell's block mark. Greig kept scuffing the block mark to even the ground so he would not trip and Chappell kept re-marking his block until they looked like schoolboys kicking dirt at each other. Chappell built up another partnership of 87 with Ross Edwards until the captain reached 90, decided to attack the bowling in the last hour of play and hooked Willis (4/56) into the hands of Greig, soon followed by Doug Walters who hooked him to Lever. Edwards was caught behind by another deadly delivery from Underwood (2/54) and 197/3 became 205/6 and 216/6 at stumps. The overnight batsmen Rod Marsh and Terry Jenner had to face Willis with the new ball and Jenner mis-hooked him to square-leg, where Lever ran 22 yards to take the catch. Marsh was beaten by Hendrick's swing and was caught by Denness to leave Australia 228/8 and in <b>real</b> <b>trouble</b> when they were saved by a wagging tail. The 6'4" [...] Max Walker started swinging the bat for 41 not out and added 29 with Dennis Lillee, who fell over trying to hook a medium-paced bouncer from Greig (1/70) and gloved the ball to the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, who had missed a chance off Walker at 242/8. After Lillee had given Greig a few words of discouragement and walked off Jeff Thomson hit 23 and added 52 runs for the last wicket until he was run out by a brilliant pick up and throw from the England captain and Australia were all out for 309.|$|E
