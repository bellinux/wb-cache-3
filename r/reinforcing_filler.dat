The utilization of different sidestream materials and wastes is the future also in rubber industries. The focus of the present work is on unconventional filler materials in rubber compounds. The theoretical part is comprised basic rubber theory, to help understand the rest of the work better, and a review of researches about unconventional filler materials in different rubbers. The rubber theory includes the presentation of the most commonly used elastomers, fillers, and other additional materials in rubber compounds as well as the basis of rubber compounding. In the review chapter, many different kinds of materials studied as a filler for rubber are discussed. Majority of the studied materials proved to be non-reinforcing fillers and no major property improvements were noted. None of the studied materials showed properties that could replace the most used commercial <b>reinforcing</b> <b>filler,</b> carbon black. Several possibilities as non-reinforcing filler were noted with unconventional fillers, but further research is needed. In the experimental part, the aim was to find out properties of the selected sidestream materials in rubbers. Three different materials were compounded with natural rubber and EPDM with different quantities and compared to reference compounds. Mechanical properties such as tensile properties, tear strength, and hardness, and processability such as curing characteristics, Mooney viscosity, and The Payne effect was tested.

Processability with all the studied materials was good or adequate. The main reason of the studied materials for not working as a <b>reinforcing</b> <b>filler</b> was their too large particle size.
