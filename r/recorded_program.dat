50|$|The two (pre and de-emphasis) {{processes}} {{are intended to}} {{cancel each other out}} as far as the actual <b>recorded</b> <b>program</b> is concerned. Only de-emphasis is applied to the incoming signal and noise during playback. After playback de-emphasis is complete, apparent noise in the output signal is reduced, and this process should not produce any effect noticeable to the listener (other than reduced noise of course). Playback without noise reduction produces a noticeably brighter sound, however.|$|E
