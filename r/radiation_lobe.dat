A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, <b>radiation</b> <b>lobing,</b> phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers.

30|$|In {{order to}} assess the item impact on signal polarization, the {{cross-polar}} discrimination (XPD) values have been extracted from the measured data and are reported in the last column of Table  2. The XPD {{is defined as the}} ratio between the received powers in co- and cross-polarized configurations [21]. Without OUT, the XPD is solely determined by antenna cross-polarization isolation (XPI) [23], that is often rather good within the antenna main <b>radiation</b> <b>lobe</b> (23 dB in our case), but it may strongly decrease outside. In order to avoid that the XPD evaluation is shadowed by the poor antenna XPI for some line of sight (LoS) Rx locations, a proper time gating has been therefore applied to the impulsive responses to remove the LoS contribution from the co- and cross-polarized received power values. Despite the propagation delays of the signal contributions coming from the OUT may be very close to the LoS delay for some Rx locations, a sufficient accuracy can be expected on the average due to the excellent time resolution of the measurement equipment (~ 0.15  ns).|$|E

In particular, the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability {{as a function}} of the frequency are used to evaluate the electromagnetic absorption capability of the nanocomposites. The aim is the study of possible applications in advanced coating able to tune the electromagnetic reflectivity of satellite surfaces in specific frequency ranges, in a special way for those surfaces that for some reason could be exposed to the antenna radiation pattern. In fact, the interference caused by the spurious electromagnetic multipath due to good electric conductive satellite surface components could in turn affect the main <b>radiation</b> <b>lobe</b> of TLC and Telemetry antennas, thus modifying its main propagation directions and finally increasing the microwave channel pathloss. The work reports the analysis of different nanostructured materials in the 2 – 10 GHz frequency range.

The possibility to design multi-layered structures optimized to provide specific microwave response is finally analyzed by the aid of swam intelligence algorithm.

40|$|A Navier-Stokes {{computer}} code {{is used to}} predict one of the ducted-fan engine acoustic modes that results from rotor-wake/stator-blade interaction. A patched sliding-zone interface is employed to pass information between the moving rotor row and the stationary stator row. The code produces averaged aerodynamic results downstream of the rotor that agree well with a widely used average-passage code. The acoustic mode of interest is generated successfully by the code and is propagated well upstream of the rotor, temporal and spatial numerical resolution are fine enough such that attenuation of the signal is small. Two acoustic codes are used to find the far-field noise. Near-field propagation is computed by using Eversman's wave envelope code, {{which is based on}} a finite-element model. Propagation to the far field is accomplished by using the Kirchhoff formula for moving surfaces with the results of the wave envelope code as input data. Comparison of measured and computed far-field noise levels show fair agreement in the range of directivity angles where the peak <b>radiation</b> <b>lobes</b> from the inlet are observed. Although only a single acoustic mode is targeted in this study, the main conclusion is a proof-of-concept: Navier Stokes codes can be used both to generate and propagate rotor-stator acoustic modes forward through an engine, where the results can be coupled to other far-field noise prediction codes...|$|R
40|$|Electroporation of neurons, i. e. electric-field induced {{generation}} of membrane nanopores to facilitate internalization of molecules, {{is a classic}} technique used in basic neuroscience research and recently has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy {{in the area of}} neuro-oncology. To optimize electroporation parameters, optical techniques capable of delivering time and spatially-resolved information on electroporation pore formation at the nanometer scale would be advantageous. For this purpose we describe here a novel optical method based on second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Due to the nonlinear and coherent nature of SHG, the 3 D <b>radiation</b> <b>lobes</b> from stained neuronal membranes are sensitive to the spatial distribution of scatterers in the illuminated patch, and in particular to nanopore formation. We used phase-array analysis to computationally study the SHG signal as a function of nanopore size and nanopore population density and confirmed experimentally, in accordance with previous work, the dependence of nanopore properties on membrane location with respect to the electroporation electric field; higher nanopore densities, lasting < 5 milliseconds, are observed at membrane patches perpendicular to the field whereas lower density is observed at partly tangent locations. Differences between near-anode and near-cathode cell poles are also measured, showing higher pore densities at the anodic pole compared to cathodic pole. This technique is promising for the study of nanopore dynamics in neurons and for the optimization of novel electroporation-based therapeutic approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a simple beam steered phased array antenna was undertaken to demonstrate the operational principles behind such devices. The antenna {{can be used as}} a receiver or transmitter, however power requirements dictated that the antenna be tested as a receiver. The design is modular to allow for redevelopment without complete reconstruction. The array is made up of the control module, voltage controlled attenuators and a phase shifting unit. The antenna consists of 16 quarter wave monopoles arranged in a 4 X 4 square array on an aluminium ground plane. Practical considerations lead to a carrier frequency of 200 MHz. The heart of a phased array antenna is the phase shifting device. This device controls the direction in which the main <b>radiation</b> <b>lobe</b> propagates. Several phase shifting principles were investigated but time did not allow for an exhaustive investigation of every kind of phase shifter. Initially, a relatively new and novel approach was attempted. When this proved to be unachievable a more traditional (but far less elegant) method was used. During the phase shifting process, the signal necessarily suffers attenuation as well as the designed phase shift, consequently it is necessary to tailor the signal amplitudes of each array element. The required amplitude control is achieved through the use of 16 voltage controlled attenuators. A computer package is used to control the phase shifter and attenuators. The design of this package depends on only three factors. The first is the interface between the hardware and the computer (via a serial port in this case). The second factor is the type of control signal the phase shifter and attenuators respond to (in this case a dc voltage). The third factor is the range of voltage required for the phase shifter and attenuators so that their full range can be utilised. This is realised through the use of a microprocessor, a "sample and hold" circuit and several D/A converters. The antenna and computer control package are essentially independent of each other. If an 8 bit digital phase shifter were to be employed later, the hardware could be used to control this with minimal alteration. In this case the advantage of a modular design is apparent. Various parts of the device can be incrementally improved without alteration to the remaining system. Radical change can be accommodated with minimal adjustments...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} activity has concerned diagnostics for antennas and other intentional or un-intentional radiating structures (e. g. for EMI considerations). The diagnostics effort {{is based on}} measured field, and on information on the device under test (DUT) wrapping volume; the latter is used to reconstruct equivalent currents that radiate the same field as measured. Current reconstruction {{is based on a}} previous work. The activity has involved testing of the existing approach -not reported in this thesis document-, and its extension. The main emphasis has been on relating the polarization of the radiated field to the (equivalent) currents on the DUT, especially to allow the designer a clear view of what the origin could be of possible deviations from expected or desired performance. In this sense, the geometry of the current reconstruction surface plays a key role: one would like to do this reconstruction on a closely wrapping surface to maximize the information content. The basic idea is to split the measured field into two polarization components (co- and cross-polarization), and then observe the corresponding equivalent currents; for example, the sources of cross-polarization could be directly tracked this way. However, this approach cannot be applied in a straightforward manner for two different reasons. In the first place, {{it is well known that}} polarization (co-polarized and cross-polarized orthogonal components of the radiated field) is not defined uniquely, and the definition of co- and cross-polarization depends on utility for the specific use. This problem can be handled in a conventional way, but requires attention, and in view of the subsequent use, and in particular for the definition of the cross-polarized field. Second, and more important for the present purpose, there is no guarantee that a purely polarized field could be radiated by a set of currents having spatial support on the wrapping surface of the DUT (e. g., a purely polarized field might require a larger antenna). Also, one is normally interested in co- and cross-polarizations levels only in the main <b>radiation</b> <b>lobe,</b> or a portion thereof. This has prompted the definition of an "improved" field. This "improved" field has a given polarization purity only in a portion of the main beam, via a windowing process that sets the level of cross-polarization and the extent of the (angular) region where the improvement is enforced. The improvement is in any case a perturbation of the actual measured fields, that potentially worsens the current reconstruction process; therefore, trade-offs have been studied in several cases between the information conveyed by the current reconstruction via improved field, and the accuracy in reproducing the measured field. The concept is more general, though, and can indeed be used to "improve" a prototype DUT whose measured performances are below the level of expectation, e. g. by lowering the side lobes. This can be recognized as a linear synthesis ("field synthesis") procedure, whose results is a useful indication for the designer on what parts of the DUT have to be modified and on how to get a better performance. Issues about the extent of the "improvement" (distance from actually measured pattern) and physical realizability in the volume occupied by the DUT are still to be considered. Conversely, and to some extent counter-intuitively, the polarization splitting is simpler when two polarizations are specified at the source level; this is what commonly happens for dual-polarized antennas. In this case it can be seen that the field splitting in polarization leads to a stable reconstructions of the related current...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Detailed {{computational}} {{studies of}} electrostatic electron Bernstein waves (EBW) propagation in the WEGA stellarator are performed and compared to experimental results. Using the WEGA antenna, the two O-/X-mode <b>radiation</b> <b>lobes</b> are modeled by sets of rays whose intensities are {{proportional to the}} measured radiation pattern. After projecting these rays onto the plasma periphery, the O-X-EBW mode conversion efficiency around the upper hybrid resonance is determined from a full wave adaptive mesh solver of the cold plasma equations. From {{the roots of the}} electrostatic EBW dispersion relation, ray tracing is performed to determine the power absorption on the first or second cyclotron harmonic as well as current drive assuming the Fisch-Boozer mechanism. Good agreement is achieved between our EBW simulations on specific WEGA equilibria and the experimental results from the antenna launch of 2. 45 GHz waves. The experimentally observed off-axis power deposition and the outward shift dependence of the absorption maxima on increasing magnetic field can only be explained by the existence of a hot electron component in the WEGA plasma. It is this hot electron component that permits wave absorption at the second harmonic near the plasma boundary. Moreover, the simulations not only reproduce the current density reversal at the plasma centre for low magnetic fields but also the destruction of this current density reversal for larger magnetic fields.
