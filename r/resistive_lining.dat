50|$|Most {{power systems}} use {{alternating}} current (AC). This is due {{mostly to the}} ease with which AC voltages may be stepped up and down, by means of a transformer. When the voltage is stepped up, current through the line is reduced, and since resistive losses in the line are proportional to the square of the current, stepping up the voltage significantly reduces the <b>resistive</b> <b>line</b> losses. The lack of a similarly simple and efficient system to perform the same function for DC made DC systems impractical in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. (Available devices, such as the rotary converter, were less efficient and required considerably more maintenance.) As technology improved, it became practical to step DC voltages up or down, though even today the process is much more complex than for AC systems. A DC voltage converter often consists of an inverter - essentially a high-power oscillator - to convert the DC to AC, a transformer to do the actual voltage stepping, and then a rectifier and filter stage to convert the AC back to DC.|$|R

The existence of these factors has brought challenges to {{the stability of the}} power distribution network, as well as increasing the risk of exceeding transmission capacity of distribution lines. The appearance of flexible load control technology provides a new idea to solve the above problems. Air conditioners (ACs) account for a great proportion of all loads.

Highly <b>resistive</b> <b>lines,</b> typical of rural low voltage networks, always create a big challenge for conventional droop control.

The first method considers no communication among the distributed generators (DGs) and regulates the converter output voltage and angle ensuring proper sharing of load in a system having strong coupling between real and reactive power due to high line resistance. The second method, based on a smattering of communication, modifies the reference output volt-age angle of the DGs depending on the active and reactive power flow in the lines connected to point of common coupling (PCC). It is shown that with the second proposed control method, an economical and minimum communication system can achieve significant improvement in load sharing. The difference in error margin between proposed control schemes and a more costly high bandwidth communication system is small and the later may not be justified considering the increase in cost. The proposed control shows stable operation of the system for a range of operating conditions while ensuring satisfactory load sharing...|$|R

The nominal detection area of DRAGONS is 1 sq m, consisting of four 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m independently operated panels. The concept of the DRAGONS design is to combine three different detection technologies to maximize information extracted from each detected impact. The first technology is a resistive grid consisting of 62. 5 -microns-wide <b>resistive</b> <b>lines,</b> coated in parallel and separated by 62. 5 micron gaps on a Kapton film. When a particle a few hundred micrometers or larger strikes the grid, it world penetrate the film and sever some <b>resistive</b> <b>lines.</b> The size of the damage area can be estimated from the increased resistance. The second technology employs a dual-layer, 25 -microns-thick Kapton film with a 10 cm separation. By measuring the time difference between impacts on the two films, the impact speed can be calculated. The third technology is based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) acoustic impact sensors. Multiple PVDF sensors are attached to the backside of both Kapton films to provide impact timing measurements. The impact location on each film can be identified from the triangulation of signals received at different PVDF sensors and provides an estimate of the impact direction. The development of DRAGONS is supported by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. The project is led by the U. S. Naval Academy (USNA), with additional collaboration from the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the University of Kent at Canterbury in Great Britain, and Virginia Tech (VT). The short-term goal of DRAGONS is to advance its Technology Readiness Level to 9 and to demonstrate the system capabilities of detecting and characterizing submillimeter MMOD impacts.

These MMOD particles are too small to be detected by ground-based radars and optical telescopes, but still large enough to be a serious threat to human space activities and robotic missions in the low Earth orbit (LEO) region. The nominal detection area of DRAGONS is 1 sq m, consisting of four 0. 5 m 0. 5 m independent panels, but the dimensions of the panels can easily be modified to accommodate different payload constraints. The approach of the DRAGONS design is to combine three particle impact detection concepts to maximize information that can be extracted from each detected impact. The first is a resistive grid consisting of 75 -micrometer-wide <b>resistive</b> <b>lines,</b> coated in parallel and separated by 75 micrometer gaps on a 25 -micrometer thin film. When a particle a few hundred micrometers or larger strikes the grid, it would penetrate the film and sever some <b>resistive</b> <b>lines.</b> The size of the damage area can be estimated from the increased resistance. The second concept is based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) acoustic impact sensors. Multiple PVDF sensors are attached to the thin film to provide the impact timing information. From the different signal arrival times at different acoustic sensors, the impact location can be calculated via triangulation algorithms. The third concept employs a dual-layer film system where a second 25 -micrometer film is placed 15 cm behind the resistive-grid film. Multiple PVDF acoustic sensors are also attached to the second film. The combination of impact timing and location information from the two films allows for direct measurements of the impact direction and speed. The DRAGONS technology development has been funded by several NASA organizations since 2002, first by the NASA Science Mission Directorate and the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, then by the NASA JSC Innovative Research and Development Program and the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. The NASA Orbital Debris Program Office leads the effort with collaboration from the U. S.

The project recently reached a major milestone when DRAGONS was approved for a technology demonstration mission by the International Space Station (ISS) Program in October 2014. The plan is to deploy a 1 sq m DRAGONS on the ISS with the detection surface facing the ram-direction for 2 to 3 years. The tentative launch schedule is in early 2017.

A sizable portion of this capacity is connected to sub-transmission networks that typically have mesh configurations and are characterized by <b>resistive</b> <b>lines</b> (i. e. lines with X=R 4). The resistivity of subtransmission networks creates a strong coupling between power flows and voltage magnitudes that is atypical in high-voltage transmission systems. In the presence of generation variability, this can lead to extreme voltages, unacceptable voltage fluctuations, unusual (active and reactive) power flow patterns throughout the network, line congestions and increased losses. This can also cause excessive tap-changing operation of transformers with On-Load Tap Changers (OLTCs).

40|$|Abstract—Power loss {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the main targets in power industry and so in this paper, the problem of finding the optimal configuration of a radial distribution system for loss {{reduction is}} considered. Optimal reconfiguration involves the selection of the best set of branches to be opened,one each from each loop, for reducing <b>resistive</b> <b>line</b> losses, and reliving overloads on feeders by shifting the load to adjacent feeders. However,since there are many candidate switching combinations in the system,the feeder reconfiguration is a complicated problem. In this paper a new approach is proposed based on a simple optimum loss calculation by determining optimal trees of the given network. From graph theory a distribution network can be represented with a graph that consists a set of nodes and branches. In fact this problem can be viewed as a problem of determining an optimal tree of the graph which simultaneously ensure radial structure of each candidate topology. In this method the refined genetic algorithm is also set up and some improvements of algorithm are made on chromosome coding. In this paper an implementation of the algorithm presented by [7] is applied by modifying in load flow program and a comparison of this method with the proposed method is employed. In [7] an algorithm is proposed that the choice of the switches to be opened is based on simple heuristic rules.
