After the revolution in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it began to fall. Although the overall crime rate is <b>reassuringly</b> low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E
25|$|Diamandy's {{enthusiasm for}} {{intervention}} was {{held back by}} reports that Romania risked going into war without proper weapons and ammunition. With this in mind, he and Constantin Istrati were sent to Italy by Premier Brătianu, and successfully negotiated a treaty of mutual assistance between the two neutral countries. He also visited traditionally-hostile Bulgaria, and claimed to have obtained assurances from Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov {{that she would not}} join the Central Powers. His brother Constantin Diamandy, noted for his highly optimistic combative stance and his martial attire, became one of Brătianu's confidants. During his diplomatic missions, he had also informed the government, <b>reassuringly,</b> about the goings-on in Bulgaria, and acted as liaison with the Russian Empire.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Harrison's 2014 Apple reissues, Paul Trynka of Classic Rock cites [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] as [...] "the perfect example" [...] of how All Things Must Pass still [...] "sounds fresh despite its familiarity". Trynka continues: [...] "Like many of Harrison's songs, the opening and chords are sweet, <b>reassuringly</b> recognisable, but just as we settle down the melody skips away, aided by his {{trademark}} trick of a brief switch of time signature. It's dazzling craftsmanship – yet sweet and unforced." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critic for}} Time {{magazine}} referred to previous criticism of Fleming {{and thought that}} [...] "in Fleming's latest Bond bombshell, there are disquieting signs that he took the critics to heart" [...] when they complained about [...] "the consumer snobbery of his caddish hero". The critic mourned that even worse was to follow, however, when [...] "Bond is threatened with what, for an international cad, would clearly be a fate worse than death: matrimony". However, eventually a [...] "deus ex machina (the machine, <b>reassuringly,</b> is a lethal red Maserati)... saves James Bond from his better self." ...|$|E
500|$|Holst's {{absorption}} of folksong, {{not only in}} the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic [...] "sweeping modal tunes mov <b>reassuringly</b> above the steps of a descending bass", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.|$|E
500|$|Ryan Bray, {{writer for}} Consequence of Sound, {{concluded}} So was an [...] "all-too-rare record that manages {{to have it}} both ways, earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving so much as an artistic inch". He added that [...] "it still stands on its own two feet as one of the consensus best records of the 80s". Mark Blake of Q described the album as [...] "carbon-dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths". He added that [...] "Gabriel crafted an album of user-friendly pop that was still <b>reassuringly</b> odd." [...] Terry Staunton of Classic Rock wrote [...] "Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged, but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record's muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence." [...] Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed [...] "a masterful confidence, delivering a satisfyingly unified whole".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the novel}} for The Guardian, Mark Lawson wrote that Faulks {{had made a}} good job of imitating Fleming, as the plot [...] "persistently picks up whispers from the books Fleming left behind", and using a style and turn of phrase that [...] "read as if they were {{directly}} borrowed from Fleming." [...] The main difference Lawson identified between Fleming and Faulks was that Faulks [...] "misses the chilling indifference of tone which Bond's creator brought to both kissing and killing". Overall, Lawson considered that Devil May Care [...] "is a smart and enjoyable act of literary resurrection. Among the now 33 post-Fleming Bonds, this must surely compete only with Kingsley Amis's for the title of the best." [...] Nicola Barr, writing for The Guardians Saturday edition, was broadly supportive of Faulks, commenting that [...] "No one expects or wants subtlety from Bond, and Faulks delivers a thriller that manages to feel <b>reassuringly</b> familiar rather than predictable." ...|$|E
500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, <b>reassuringly</b> close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz {{disliked the}} two {{original}} ballads, [...] "Christmas Time Is In the Air Again" [...] and [...] "One Child", describing them [...] "both thick with gooey orchestration", but praised [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] and [...] "When Christmas Comes" [...] for their uptempo melodies. However, she was {{confused by the}} re-recording of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", saying that [...] "It's {{hard to figure out}} what's 'extra festive, and quipped that it is [...] "far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)". Ganz concluded with [...] "the LP's warm heart is in the right place." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half stars}} our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey’s sequel to 1994’s buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is <b>reassuringly</b> predictable." [...] While he continued to label it as an [...] "incredibly adventureless album," [...] he also wrote that it is a [...] "remarkably comforting listen". He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel, or a remake, but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey's part. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You. He described [...] "One Child" [...] as a [...] "needless retelling", [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)" [...] as a desperate attempt at Carey canonising herself for re-recording her own song. [...] "The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake is all over Merry Christmas II You: A [...] "gift" [...] to her fans (or so she claims) that they, of course, must pay for, it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell." ...|$|E

2500|$|Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) or diffuse optical {{tomography}} (DOT) is {{a medical}} imaging modality which uses near infrared light to generate images of the body. The technique measures the optical absorption of haemoglobin, and relies on the absorption spectrum of haemoglobin varying with its oxygenation status. [...] High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) has been compared directly to fMRI using response to visual stimulation in subjects studied with both techniques, with <b>reassuringly</b> similar results. HD-DOT has also been compared to fMRI in terms of language tasks and resting state functional connectivity.|$|E
2500|$|The Auto Union 1000 is {{a compact}} {{front-wheel-drive}} automobile manufactured by Auto Union GmbH between 1958 and 1965. [...] It {{was the first}} (and in many markets the last) model branded as an Auto Union by the manufacturer since the 1930s: it replaced the paradoxically named DKW 3=6, although the latter continued in production, <b>reassuringly</b> now branded as the DKW 900, for another year. [...] The two cars were broadly similar, but the new car had its two-stroke engine enlarged to 981 cc yielding a 10% - 37% (according to model) power increase.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 July 2007, the Newport Pagnell plant {{rolled out}} the last of nearly 13,000 cars made there since 1955, a Vanquish S. The Tickford Street {{facility}} was converted to Aston Martin's service and restoration department. UK production is now concentrated at Gaydon on the former RAF V-bomber airfield. In March 2008 Aston Martin announced a partnership with Magna Steyr to outsource manufacture of over 2,000 cars annually to Graz, Austria, <b>reassuringly</b> stating: [...] "The continuing growth and success of Aston Martin is based upon Gaydon as the focal point and heart of the business, with the design and engineering of all Aston Martin products continuing {{to be carried out}} there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting the {{international}} sensitivities involved, negotiations progressed outside the [...] "usual" [...] diplomatic channels. To confirm his {{approval for the}} proposal, Cavour sent his diplomat, Costantino Nigra, to Paris, where Nigra made contact with another friend and confidant of the emperor (and another physician) called Henri Conneau. On 9 May 1858 Conneau was able to confirm to Nigra that the alliance proposal had {{the full support of}} the emperor himself. Further talks now took place in Turin involving Conneau, Cavour and the king, Victor Emanuel. At this point a suggestion came from the emperor for a meeting between himself and Cavour at Plombières-les-Bains, a once fashionable health resort in a [...] in Eastern France, <b>reassuringly</b> far from Paris or Turin, and off the beaten track of those following international diplomacy and politics.|$|E
2500|$|One {{criticism}} of Strauss and Howe's theory, {{and the field}} of [...] "generational studies" [...] in general, is that conclusions are overly broad and {{do not reflect the}} reality of every person in each generation regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or genetic information For example, Hoover cited the case of Millennials by writing that [...] "commentators have tended to slap the Millennial label on white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great things as they grow up in the suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to super-selective colleges, and who multitask with ease as their helicopter parents hover <b>reassuringly</b> above them. The label tends not to appear in renderings of teenagers who happen to be minorities, or poor, or who have never won a spelling bee. Nor does the term often refer to students from big cities and small towns that are nothing like Fairfax County, Va. Or who lack technological know-how. Or who struggle to complete high school. Or who never even consider college. Or who commit crimes. Or who suffer from too little parental support. Or who drop out of college. Aren't they Millennials, too?" ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{division}} of Germany after 1949 looking increasingly permanent, there were practical and legal disputes over which Germany should inherit those German brand names from before the war that still conferred value {{in the eyes of}} consumers. [...] One particularly bitter dispute concerned the BMW brand. [...] Another concerned the national airline, known till 1945 as Deutsche Luft Hansa. [...] Directly {{after the end of the}} Second World War, one thing on which the Soviet Union and the United States were able to agree was that no new German state should be permitted to operate an airline. [...] The military implications of a German state having access to a permanent pool of trained pilots and air industry expertise were uppermost in the minds of politicians. [...] However, geo-political priorities moved on, and in 1953 Lufthansa was founded, a West German airline with its primary hub <b>reassuringly</b> located next door to a massive US airbase south of Frankfurt am Main. [...] In 1955 the East German government responded, staking a claim to the [...] "Lufthansa" [...] brand by creating Deutsche Lufthansa. [...] Since the Lufthansa name had already been registered by the West German airline, the East German entity faced a succession of lawsuits and was, in the meantime, not able to register as a member of the International Air Transport Association. [...] Eventually it would be rebranded as Interflug. [...] In the meantime, reflecting the intensely political nature of the airline business, when Deutsche Lufthansa was created in 1955 it made sense that its Director in Chief should be the son of the aging East German President. [...] On 1 July 1955 Arthur Pieck, who had no experience of flying or of the airline business, was appointed [...] "Hauptdirektor" [...] of the national airline.|$|E
