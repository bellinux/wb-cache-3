The invasion, {{which took place in}} July 1943, was spearheaded by Colonel Gavin's 505th PIR (<b>reinforced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team by the 3rd Battalion of Tucker's 504th). Despite some successes, Sicily nearly saw an end to the airborne division. Due mainly to circumstances beyond Ridgway's control the 82nd suffered heavy casualties in Sicily, including the division's ADC, Brigadier General Charles L. Keerans. During the 504th's drop on the night of July 11, which was widely scattered due to friendly fire, Ridgway had to report to Lieutenant General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. Seventh Army (under whose command the 82nd fell), that, out of the more than 5,300 paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division who had jumped into Sicily, he had fewer than 400 under his control.|$|E
5000|$|In {{accordance}} to Ashley Lutz, {{an editor}} of Business Insider, 90% of the media, in 2011, was owned by merely six companies. Such limits the exposure to information, at least the perspective on information. The limited exposure to the perspectives of information results in increase of particular social conditioning. Through repetition of a particular perspective of an ideal, the view is <b>reinforced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> audience and results in a formed social norm. This contributes {{to the formation of}} a reflection of the culture in media. Conley states that [...] "culture is a projection of social structures and relationships into the public sphere, a screen onto which the film of the underlying reality or social structure of our society is shown". Such cycling repetition creates a method of socialization and a manner in which society further molds its current members or new ones into the culture.|$|E

40|$|Pendleton, Indiana is an {{historical}} small town located in Madison County, Indiana, just northeast of Indianapolis along the Interstate 69 corridor. Pendleton’s long history encompasses important events {{of national and}} regional significance relating to Indiana’s settlement, the social unrest {{leading up to the}} Civil War, Indiana’s industrialization, railroads, and the gas boom, and the recreational culture of the roaring twenties. Ongoing themes that emerge from this history and have been continually <b>reinforced</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> present day include Pendleton’s role as a transportation hub, the town’s identity as a recreational destination, and the town’s local exceptionalism. This exceptionalism is expressed in the local community’s active and ambitious nature, is evident in the town’s high quality of life, numerous community resources and strong economy, and is best symbolized by the falls on Fall Creek. Historically, the falls on Falls Creek served as a nexus for the town’s growth along a progressively increasing number of highways and railroads. This plan examines the goals and community input from the 2006 Comprehensive Plan update against a thorough analysis of local and current (2011) conditions to derive a set of specific, actionable goals for the Town of Pendleton. One of the most significant results of that process is that a multi-use, multi-function trail along the former right of way of the Indiana (Interurban) Railroad would serve as a catalyst and physical magnet for progress (as defined by the 2011 Plan Goals). As such, the plan then suggests an incrementally more-detailed design framework for construction of this trail and concludes with site-scale design of the most important node of this trail located where the trail intersects State Street (SR- 38) in downtown.

The addition of CNT as a <b>reinforcing</b> material <b>into</b> <b>the</b> matrix improves the mechanical, thermal, tribological, and electrical properties. In this research paper multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), with different weight percentage (5 %, 10 %, and 15 %), was <b>reinforced</b> <b>into</b> manganese dioxide (MnO 2) matrix using solution method.

The XRD analysis indicates the formation of MWCNT/MnO 2 nanocomposites. The FESEM surface morphology analysis shows that MnO 2 nanotube is densely grown on the surface of MWCNT. Further, microhardness of MWCNT/MnO 2 nanocomposite was measured and it was found that 10 [*]wt% has higher microhardness in comparison to 5 and 15 [*]wt%.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} fast and robust {{hierarchical}} face detection system which finds and localizes face images with {{a cascade of}} classifiers. Three modules contribute to the efficiency of our detector. First, heterogeneous feature descriptors are exploited to enrich feature types and feature numbers for face representation. Second, a PSO-Adaboost algorithm is proposed to efficiently select discriminative features from a large pool of available features and <b>reinforce</b> them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> final ensemble classifier. Compared with the standard exhaustive Adaboost for feature selection, the new PSO-Adaboost algorithm reduces the training time up to 20 times. Finally, a three-stage hierarchical classifier framework is developed for rapid background removal. In particular, candidate face regions are detected more quickly by using a large size window in the first stage. Nonlinear SVM classifiers are used instead of decision stump functions in the last stage to remove those remaining complex nonface patterns {{that can not be}} rejected in the previous two stages. Experimental results show our detector achieves superior performance on the CMU+MIT frontal face dataset...|$|R

This process includes increasing the weight bearing capabilities and performance of in-situ soil and sand. Soil nailing is a construction technique {{that can be used}} as a remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as a construction technique that allows the safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes.

Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination. Soil nail components may also be used to stabilize retaining walls or existing fill slopes like embankments and levees and this is normally undertaken as a remedial measure.

This article presents an experimental study on the strengthening of reinforced concrete cantilever slabs where the anchorage of the top steel <b>reinforcing</b> bars <b>into</b> <b>the</b> adjacent wall was insufficient. The experimental study involved the use of a fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening system and fibre Bragg grating sensors for strain monitoring. The fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening system consisted of glass fibre-reinforced polymer sheets and glass fibre- reinforced polymer spike anchors which connected the glass fibre-reinforced polymer sheets to the adjacent concrete wall. The test results showed that the fibre-reinforced polymer strengthening system was effective in improving the load-carrying capacity of reinforced concrete cantilever slabs and the fibre Bragg grating sensors worked efficiently and reliably for strain monitoring. The debonding in glass fibre-reinforced polymer sheet/glass fibre-reinforced polymer anchor-to-concrete bonded joints was found to be a progressive process associated with an increasing load.
