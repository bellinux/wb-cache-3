The salchichon, a <b>ripened</b> pork sausage, was produced {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of two different <b>ripening</b> durations with and without rosemary powder on salchichon sausage quality, and the treatments were: i) 45 days of <b>ripening</b> without rosemary, ii) 60 days of <b>ripening</b> without rosemary, iii) 45 days of <b>ripening</b> with 0. 05 % rosemary, and iv) 60 days of <b>ripening</b> with 0. 05 % rosemary. Significant differences were observed in both moisture and fat content for <b>ripening</b> durations, with the highest moisture and least fat content observed in salchichon modified sausage (SMS) <b>ripened</b> for 45 days. <b>Ripening</b> duration and rosemary addition appeared to influence water activity (aw) of salchichon sausages. The aw of SMS <b>ripened</b> for 45 days was 0. 80, whereas the other had aw values < 0. 80. Lactic acid bacteria were predominant, as Korean traditional fermented red pepper paste was added to sausages; however, the Bacillus cereus population was significantly affected by rosemary powder addition. Chewiness and gumminess decreased significantly due to the addition of rosemary powder compared to SMS without rosemary powder, and both 45 days of <b>ripening</b> and rosemary powder addition influenced the hardness of SMS. In conclusion, <b>ripening</b> duration of SMS for 45 days {{in the presence of}} rosemary powder provided superior SMS quality with an economical <b>ripening</b> duration compared to that of <b>ripening</b> with rosemary powder or <b>ripening</b> for 60 days...|$|R

5|$|The Champagne {{province}} {{is located}} near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel. The high altitude and mean annual temperature of 10°C (50°F) creates a difficult environment for wine grapes to fully <b>ripen.</b> Ripening is aided {{by the presence of}} forests which helps to stabilize temperatures and maintain moisture in the soil. The cool temperatures serve to produce high levels of acidity in the resulting grape which is ideal for sparkling wine.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the term}} Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name derives from the terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency to <b>ripen</b> earlier than other varieties.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>ripening</b> temperature, {{relative}} humidity and time on chemical and textural {{characteristics of a}} ‘probiotic’ goat’s milk cheese were examined. The experimental layout followed a 23 factorial design, with all possible combinations of 5 7 C and 10 7 C (<b>ripening</b> temperature), 85 % and 95 % (<b>ripening</b> relative humidity) and 1 day and 70 days (<b>ripening</b> time). All proteolytic indices measured (water-soluble nitrogen, trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen and phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen) were enhanced with increased <b>ripening</b> temperature {{to a greater extent}} than with increased <b>ripening</b> relative humidity; the increase in phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen was the most significant. Free fatty acid concentrations in cheeses were not influenced by <b>ripening</b> relative humidity but increased with <b>ripening</b> temperature and time. A higher <b>ripening</b> temperature and a lower relative humidity gave rise to firmer cheeses. Postulated empirical models have provided a good fit to the experimental data set generated; such models were able to predict a decrease of 25 days in <b>ripening</b> time with no impairment of either proteolytic or lipolytic indices if a cheese were to be <b>ripened</b> at 10 7 C (rather than 5 7 C) and 95 % relative humidity...|$|R

A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to <b>ripen</b> 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

40|$|Cheeses made on {{milk protein}} coaggregate basis are {{different}} thantraditionally made cheeses, in technological production process and sensory characteristics, especially texture and taste. In this research {{it was assumed}} that applied milk thermal treatment, as well as curd processing, will have appropriate influence on proteins as substratum. During <b>ripening,</b> due to a presence of whey proteins, which influence decrease of casein content in total cheese proteins, substratum is hydrolyzed. In traditionally made cheeses, casein is the basis of protein matrix. In comparison to whey proteins, casein is substantially faster changed during <b>ripening,</b> while whey proteins incorporated in the curd give so called «unspecific» <b>ripening.</b> Besides, application of high temperatures influences decrease of plasmin activity in cheese, regardless of its significant thermal stability. During 4 months ofexperimental cheeses <b>ripening,</b> changes of nitrogen matter were investigated. Significant changes of milk proteins, such as increase of soluble nitrogen matter content, the primary and secondary nitrogen products of protein breakdown during cheese <b>ripening,</b> as well as non-protein nitrogen (12 % TCA) and phospho-tungstic-soluble nitrogen (5 % PTA) were observed. The average content of soluble nitrogen after production after 15, 30, 60 and 120 days of <b>ripening</b> were: 135. 48 mg %, 358. 72 mg %, 473. 52 mg %, 672. 32 mg % and 845. 13 mg %,respectively. According to soluble nitrogen content increase, coefficient of <b>ripening</b> also increased and for the same <b>ripening</b> period was: 4. 42 %, 10. 14 %, 12. 95 %, 18. 21 % and 23. 60 %, respectively. Content of primary and secondary products of protein breakdown during cheese <b>ripening</b> had significant rising trend from the first day of production to 120 th day of <b>ripening.</b> At the end of investigated <b>ripening</b> period, content of primary products of protein decomposition was 4. 90 times higher compared to the first day of <b>ripening,</b> while content of secondary products of protein decomposition was 13. 32 times higher, for the same <b>ripening</b> period. The most intensive primary products formation occurred in the first 15 days of <b>ripening.</b> Compared to the literature, experimental cheeses were similar to traditionally made cheeses in the Edam type, and even to cheeses with longer <b>ripening</b> period such as Cheddar, regarding <b>ripening</b> «depth» and «width». Compounds soluble in 12 % TCA and 5 % PTA can be significant parameters of proteolytic processes dynamics during cheese <b>ripening.</b> Also, they can describe <b>ripening</b> «width», and especially «depth» of <b>ripening.</b> Nitrogen content soluble in 12 % TCA increased during <b>ripening.</b> After 120 days of <b>ripening,</b> nitrogen content soluble in 12 % TCA was 19. 58 times higher compared to the first day of <b>ripening.</b> Nitrogen matter soluble in 5 % PTA, with molecule masses less than 600, also had permanent rising trend.

It is also responsive to exogenous application of ethylene, auxin and abscisic acid (ABA). Over-expressing ARF 2 A in tomato resulted in blotchy <b>ripening</b> in which certain fruit regions turn red and possess accelerated <b>ripening.</b> ARF 2 A over-expressing fruit displayed early ethylene emission and ethylene signaling inhibition delayed their <b>ripening</b> phenotype, suggesting ethylene dependency.

However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to <b>ripen</b> while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic.

5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that <b>ripen</b> late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
40|$|Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an {{established}} model to study fleshy fruit development and <b>ripening.</b> Tomato <b>ripening</b> is regulated independently and cooperatively by ethylene and transcription factors, including nonripening (NOR) and ripening-inhibitor (RIN).

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes <b>ripen</b> more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs.
