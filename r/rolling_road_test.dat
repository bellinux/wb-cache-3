The aim of {{the work}} {{reported}} here {{was to investigate the}} potential benefits of rear suspension systems for mountain bikes and to develop numerical models {{that could be used in}} future to help with the design of improved suspension configurations. As the basis for a study of the effect of rear suspensions, two bicycles were chosen: one with full suspension and one with only front suspension (hard tail). Apart from the rear suspension, all other aspects of the bicycles were closely matched. In order to control the number of variables, a special <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> <b>test</b> rig was used. Eight subjects were asked to ride each bicycle on the rig in random order. Measurements were taken of pedal torque and speed, rear wheel speed, forward thrust at front axle and vertical acceleration at the saddle and handlebars. Physiological measurements were also taken, but these are reported elsewhere. A DADS model of the rolling road rig, bicycle and rider was created and numerical sim-ulations were performed. The results of the numerical simulations compared well with the experimental results. Unmeasured parameters predicted by the DADS model could therefore be used with reasonable confidence to aid the understanding of the suspension performance. Physiological results, mechanical measurements and simulation results all in-dicate that the full suspension bicycle shows a significant improvement in terms of comfort and energy expenditure when riding over regular bumps. The good correlation between measurement and simulation provides a tool that can be used in future for optimization of bicycle suspension design. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between transfer path analysis and operational path analysis methods using an electric vehicle {{is presented in}} this study. Structure-borne noise paths to the cabin from different engine and suspension points have been considered. To realise these methods, two types of test have been performed; operational <b>tests</b> on a <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> and hammer <b>tests</b> in static conditions. The main aim of this work is assessing the critical paths which are transmitting the structure-borne vibrations from the electric vehicle's vibration sources to the driver's ear. This assessment includes {{the analysis of the}} noise contribution of each path depending on the frequency and vehicle speed range and moreover, the assessment of the path noise impact for harmonic orders which arise due to the physical components of the electric vehicle. Furthermore, the applicability of these methods to electric vehicles is assessed as these techniques have been extensively used for vehicles powered with internal combustion engines...|$|R
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world car {{manufacturers}} are required by law to state the fuel economy performance of their vehicles when undertaking one or more Standard Drive Cycles such as the Urban and Extra Urban test cycle definitions required in Western Europe. Such Standard Drive Cycles have their roots in obscure vehicle testing undertaken decades ago in the USA, and no physical test track exists in Europe which enables the precise re-creation of these test characteristics. Furthermore, the fundamental validity of these test cycles as a means of gauging and comparing passenger car fuel economy is seldom considered. This paper documents the early stages of a research project which aims to segment the Standard Drive Cycle definitions into a series of operating characteristic windows which can then be searched for and automatically extracted from general driving behaviour of a car on the road, and thereafter concatenated to re-creating a real-world equivalent of the Standard Drive Cycle without the need for <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> or laboratory <b>testing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mountain bike {{suspension}} {{systems have}} been designed to improve riding performance and comfort for the cyclist. Additionally, a suspension system may reduce fatigue, energy expenditure, and enhance time trial performance. It has also been proposed, however, that using a rear suspension system on a mountain bike may be detrimental to the cyclist, causing the cyclistâ€™s energy to be dissipated via the rear suspension system. Prior to undertaking the current research, a survey into mountain bike suspension systems was conducted to establish rider preferences, as well as their perceptions of suspension systems and riding styles. The resulting responses - that the majority of cross-country cyclists chose to ride a bike with front suspension only (a hardtail bike), despite the significant advantages that a fully suspended system has to offer â€“ aided in the decision to address the unanswered questions that remain in this area of research. This thesis presents an investigation into mountain bike suspension systems and their effect on rider performance, quantifying the dynamic loads exerted on the bike frame and rider. Both the psychological and physiological effects of using a rear suspension system on cross-country cycling are additional considerations of this study. An initial laboratory experiment was completed to investigate the effects of rear wheel dynamics on a rough track with a high impact frequency and the consequent impact this terrain has on rider performance, comparing a full suspension and hardtail bike. Further testing was conducted on a <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> rig, specifically designed for the purpose of the current research, which more closely represented the conditions encountered by a cyclist on a cross-country track. Testing was conducted on the <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> rig on both a flat road and rough track, examining the interaction forces between the bike and rider. Greater resistance was experienced by cyclists when cycling on the <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> rig compared to the roller rig which equated to the resistance encountered when cycling uphill or into a headwind. The mechanical results from both rigs were compared to dynamic simulations as a means of validating and comparing the mechanical results. An additional series of tests was carried out on an indoor track which had a similar terrain to that of the <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> rig. This set of tests placed fewer restrictions on the cyclist as only physiological data was collected using unobtrusive portable measurement devices, and provided further results to illuminate correlations or discrepancies between the roller rig and <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> rig experiments. The experimental <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> rig results indicated that, when cycling on a smooth surface, the hardtail bike offered no significant physiological advantage to the cyclist; however, more power was required by the rider to pedal the fully suspended bike. This was also advocated by the simulation results. Conversely, it was highlighted that the fully suspended bike provided a significant advantage to the rider compared to the hardtail bike when cycling on extremely rough terrain on the roller rig. This was the case across the simulation results, mechanical measurements, physiological measurements and psychological measurements. Similarly, the indoor track tests indicated that cycling on a fully suspended bike provided significant advantages to a cyclist in terms of rider performance. On the contrary, the experimental <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> rig results on a rough surface demonstrated that no significant difference was apparent between cycling on either the hardtail or fully suspended bike. This result suggests that, when a rider encounters added resistance to cycling, as is the case when cycling uphill, there is less of an advantage for a fully suspended bike even on rough terrain.

The <b>rolling</b> <b>road</b> accurately simulates the dynamics of a car on the race track, unlike traditional fixed-floor tunnels. Construction of the new wind tunnel began in 2007 and was completed by year-end. After six months of commissioning, the wind tunnel opened to its first customer, a Formula One race team, in July 2008. Today the Wind Shear facility counts numerous NASCAR, IndyCar, Formula One and American Le Mans Series teams as customers. Wind Shear is owned 100% by Haas.|$|R

INTERVENTIONS: Predriving assessments and <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The suitability to resume driving based on a team decision and performance in the <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: Forty-one patients (39. 4 %) were judged suitable, 45 (43. 3 %) not immediately suitable, and 18 (17. 3 %) not suitable to drive. Correlation coefficients and comparisons between groups revealed that most variables had significant individual relationships with the team decision and performance on the <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> After logistic regression analysis, side of lesion, kinetic vision, visual scanning, and a <b>road</b> <b>test</b> led to the best model in predicting the team decision (R(2) =. 53).
