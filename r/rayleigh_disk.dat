40|$|The Boltzmann-Ehrenfest {{principle}} of adiabatic invariance relates the acoustic potential {{acting on a}} sample positioned in a single-mode cavity to the shift in resonant frequency caused {{by the presence of}} this sample. This general and simple relation applies to samples and cavities of arbitrary shape, dimension, and compressibility. Positioning forces and torques can, therefore, be determined from straightforward measurements of frequency shifts. Applications to the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>disk</b> phenomenon and levitated cylinders are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to verify whether the superfluid component of liquid helium, flowing through a stationary normal fluid background, would exert the same torque on a <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>disk</b> as expected for perfect potential flow in classical hydrodynamic. The disk was suspended by a fine quartz fiber in a "superfluid wind tunnel" which is a device for obtaining pure superfluid flow at temperatures other than zero degrees using the fountain effect to pump helium through a chamber closed at each end by a jewelers rouge plug. A disk 0. 15 cm in radius was used with a quartz fiber of torsion constant of approximately 10 (- 5) dyne-cm deg, and the superfuid velocity was varied between. 01 and 0. 1 cm/sec. Observed torque showed the proper dependence on fluid velocity for each temperature investigated to within the experimental error of about ten percent. Also, by comparing results at different temperatures, {{it was possible to}} measure ps/p as a function of temperature. This parameter was determined at thirteen different temperatures between 1. 11 °K and 2. 11 °K, and the results obtained agreed with previously accepted values...|$|E
40|$|A rocket-borne {{spectrograph}} detected H I Lyman-alpha emission {{from the}} disk of Saturn {{and from the}} vicinity of the planet. The signal is consistent with an emission brightness of 700 <b>rayleighs</b> for the <b>disk</b> and 200 <b>rayleighs</b> for the vicinity of Saturn. The emission from {{the vicinity of the}} planet may be due to a hydrogen atmosphere associated with the Saturnian ring system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{works have}} {{examined}} the thermal and dynamical aspects of natural convection occurring in tilted hemispherical cavities whose disk constitutes the hot active wall. The influence of some important aspects on the natural flows have been considered such as the <b>Rayleigh</b> Number, the <b>disk</b> inclination angle {{with respect to the}} horizontal plane and the thermal boundary condition on the disk (Dirichlet, Neumann). Combinations of these parameters have been treated in steady state as well as is transient regime. Correlations of Nusselt–Rayleigh type (steady state) and Nusselt–Rayleigh–Fourier type (transient regime) that allow quantifying the heat transfer are proposed in these surveys. The objective {{of this paper is to}} synthesize and summarize these works in order to facilitate their implementation in engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|Current {{models of}} planet and {{satellite}} formation are marred by {{our lack of}} understanding regarding the turbulent state of accretion disks. According to the <b>Rayleigh</b> criterion, Keplerian <b>disks</b> are hydrodynamically stable. Indeed, {{it has been argued}} that a carefully designed Taylor Couette experiment shows stability in the case of positive radial gradients in specific angular momentum even for high Reynolds numbers [1], in agreement with numerical simulations which consistently show turbulence decay [2]. Other possible sources of turbulence may fail due to low ionization, may decay as the optical depth decreases due to dust coagulation, may involve unrealistic boundary conditions, or result in limited transport. The difficulty stems not only from the degree of turbulence, but also from the kind of turbulence, and whether it may be characterized by an alpha parameter...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{high-resolution}} Ly-alpha {{observations of the}} Saturn vicinity were completed with the Princeton spectrometer on board the Copernicus satellite. They showed that near a minimum solar activity the emissions related to several sources are 250 + or - 50 rayleighs for the interplanetary medium in a near-downwind direction, less than 100 rayleighs for the rings, 200 + or - 100 rayleighs for a torus linked to the Titan orbit, and 1400 + or - 450 <b>rayleighs</b> for the <b>disk</b> of Saturn. These results induce some constraints through the corresponding theoretical evaluations: the B ring as {{the primary source of}} the atoms for the ring emissions; an efficient production mechanism for hydrogen atoms in the Titan torus; and a slightly larger eddy diffusion coefficient in the Saturn atmosphere than in the Jupiter atmosphere near solar minimum...|$|R
40|$|On 1999 August 27, Io was {{observed}} with HST STIS/CCD using a 2 "x 2 " aperture soon after it entered into eclipse (CML = 342 to 346). Two G 750 M/I spectral images, covering 5815 Angstroms to 6380 Angstroms and starting 3 and 17 minutes after 2 nd contact, recorded emissions of Na I 5890, 5896 Angstroms and [O I] 6300, 6364 Angstroms. The oxygen and sodium emissions show several similar features. (1) Downstream wake emission that correlates in location with jovian magnetic field orientation; (2) Enhanced emissions near the sub-jovian region, albeit a relatively weak enhancement for sodium; and (3) Limb glow that is brighter {{in the hemisphere}} facing the jovian magnetic equator. These features are qualitatively similar to [O I] 6300 Angstrom images obtained with HST WFPC 2 and to the UV STIS results of Roesler et al. 1999 (Science, 283, 353), as well as broadband images taken by the Galileo SSI (Geissler et al. JGR submitted) and more recent Cassini images. The integrated oxygen (6300 Angstrom + 6364 Angstrom) emission intensity (10. 5 k <b>Rayleighs</b> (kR) <b>disk</b> averaged) did not change between the two exposures while the integrated disk averaged sodium D emission intensity decreased by 19 % from 5. 7 kR to 4. 6 kR. Also, {{in contrast to the}} oxygen emission, sodium showed relatively enhanced emission in the northern polar regions. Likewise, on 1999 August 23, Io eclipse STIS observations were made in the near-UV and blue regions to try to identify the Galileo SSI violet filter emissions. Preliminary analysis reveals a residual signal after subtraction of a dominant scattered light background that is suggestive of a SO 2 band structure. In addition, the largest individual emission at about 4075 Angstrom could be the S(+) doublet...|$|R
