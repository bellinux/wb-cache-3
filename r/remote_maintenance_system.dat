40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> project (WPRM) for the {{demonstration}} fusion power reactor (DEMO). Following ITER, DEMO aims to confirm the capability of generating several hundred of MW of net electricity by 2050. The main objective of these activities is to develop an efficient and reliable remote handling (RH) system for replacing the divertor cassettes. This paper presents the preliminary results of the concept design of the divertor RH system. The proposed divertor mover is a hydraulic telescopic boom driven from the transportation cask through the maintenance tunnel of the reactor. The boom is divided in three sections of 4 m each, and it is driving an end-effector in order to perform the scheduled operations of maintenance inside the vacuum vessel. Two alternative design of the end effector to grip and manipulate the divertor cassette are also presented in this work. Both the concepts are hydraulically actuated, basing on the ITER previous studies.

40|$|The Industry 4. 0 {{paradigm}} aims {{to introduce}} smart factories which employ {{a high degree}} of automation and interconnectivity of the elements of their production networks. These factories are composed of autonomous production machines which can predict breakdowns or failures, and are capable of decision making. Human supervision is minimized, but in some cases, a human expert might be needed. To reduce the costs of travel, it is desirable to employ a remote maintenance procedure. As this opens up possible security breaches, a security policy must be designed and enforced in the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis proposes a Software Defined Networking (SDN) based solution to enforce a security policy in the remote maintenance scenario. This solution is implemented as an application module for the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) SDN controller interacting with the policy management tool AuthZForce. The security requirements have been gathered from industry standards such as ISO 27033, and the recommendations of the German Federal Office of Information Security (BSI) for remote maintenance. The derived security policy rules are represented in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the commercial application of an innovative plasma mass separator called the Archimedes Filter to a pre-treatment plant {{that can be}} integrated into the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford and Savannah River Sites to significantly enhance the treatment of radioactive high-level waste. The output of the Archimedes Filter is completely compatible with existing waste immobilization processes such as vitrification and requires no new waste form to be developed. A full-geometric-scale Demonstration Filter Unit (DEMO) has been constructed and is undergoing initial testing at the Archimedes Technology Group Development Facilities in San Diego. Some of the technology and engineering development is being performed by other organizations in collaboration with Archimedes. The Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) is developing the plasma calcination technology and all of the associated systems for AFP feed preparation. Two Russian institutes are involved {{in the development of the}} ICP torch and injector system. The Remote System Group (UT-Battelle) at ORNL is developing the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> for the filter units. Conceptual design of the Archimedes Filter Plant (AFP) is being developed concurrently with the DEMO testing program. The AFP mission is to significantly reduce the cost and accelerate the rate of vitrification of high-level waste by separating low activity waste from the sludge removed from underground storage tanks. Mass separation is accomplished by vaporizing the sludge feed and injecting it into a partially ionized, neutral plasma. In a single pass, heavy ions are deposited near the center of the filter and light mass ions are transported by the plasma to the ends of the cylindrically-shaped vacuum vessel. Responding to the DOE programs for cost reduction and cleanup acceleration, the AFP Project is planned on an expeditious schedule that executes all phases of the project with private sector funding. The initial AFP implementation is targeted for the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) at the Hanford Site. Hot commissioning is scheduled for late 2007 with design throughput and availability achieved by end of 2008. It is anticipated that AFP revenues will be based on a shared cost savings model, thus providing first revenues by late 2007. Preliminary safety studies have shown that AFP process hazards are similar to or less hazardous than those in a radio-chemical pre-treatment plant for high-level waste. Conservative criticality evaluations indicate very large margins from criticality. Development of a Preliminary Safety Analysis Report will begin in mid 2003 to support licensing activities. A detailed permitting plan has been developed which, when combined with other activities, support a start of construction in 2005...|$|E
40|$|Haptic {{bilateral}} teleoperation {{is often}} a challenging and mentally demanding job for the operators of robot control systems. It is especially difficult in cases such as the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the ITER divertor region. The difficulty of the ITER divertor maintenance hails from a multitude of reasons: the residual radiation level of the ITER reactor during a shutdown is too high for any human access, the maintenance tunnels of the divertor are confined, the operators have to operate heavy loads in delicate tasks, and {{only a limited number}} of radiation tolerant cameras are available for providing video feedback. In addition, most of the maintenance work cannot be automated because of the dynamic nature and complexity of the tasks. Haptic shared control systems can be used for reducing the amount of mental and physical workload perceived by the operators of <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>systems.</b> To reduce the workload, a haptic shared control system assists the operators by generating virtual forces based on the virtual models of the teleoperation environment and sensor data from the slave manipulator. The generated assistance forces are laid over the force feedback signals from the teleoperation environment. The assisting forces can e. g. guide the operators along optimal paths and prevent collisions in the teleoperation environment. In addition to the reduction of the operator workload, teleoperation tasks also become faster and safer with haptic shared control. This thesis investigates the implementation techniques and theory of haptic bilateral teleoperation and shared control systems. Based on the theoretical analysis, an experimental haptic shared control system, called the Computer Assisted Teleoperation (CAT) was developed. The intention of CAT is to assist the remote handling (RH) system operators of the Divertor Test Platform 2 (DTP 2) in ITER <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> research. The effectiveness of CAT is evaluated in a teleoperation experiment performed with a 6 DOF Water Hydraulic MANipulator (WHMAN) developed for the ITER divertor maintenance. The results of the experiment gives directive indication that the CAT system improves the execution times of a bilateral teleoperation task and simultaneously reduces the workload perceived by the operators of the system...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} {{study of the}} design {{considerations}} involved in interfacing medical analysers to computer systems for remote monitoring. Most medical analysers provide a serial port connection for interfacing to a computer. Due to the limitations of this physical link, {{it is necessary for}} the interfacing computer to be within a radius of several metres. This computer can perform all the data monitoring and processing of the medical analyser. Monitoring the operational performance of a medical analyser can assist in maintenance programs. If it relays relevant data to a remote computer, a powerful <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> and monitoring <b>system</b> can be developed when the remote monitoring computer collects data from a number of remote medical analysers. To satisfy the demands of <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> and monitoring the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/P) network protocol was investigated. The existing worldwide base of support for this protocol on numerous platforms and its universal addressing scheme made it the preferred choice for “openness” concerns.

A Client/Server architecture was investigated with a central server and remote clients which were connected to clinical analysers. The monitoring computer local to an analyser connects to the server using the TCP/IP network protocol. This Client-Server configuration is particularly suited to the distributed nature of medical laboratories where instruments are typically not centralised and the lack of availability of powerful computers makes it necessary to resort to using simple computers locally to the instrument to relay data to the more powerful server computer.

A minimal task space parametrization relying on stereographic projection is constructed which achieves relative end effector alignment tracking without introducing representational or algorithmic singularities.
