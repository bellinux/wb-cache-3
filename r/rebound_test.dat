This paper {{presents the results of}} a systematic approach to determine the uniaxial compressive strength of rock material using the Schmidt hammer <b>rebound</b> <b>test.</b> A total of five distinct locations (Graham Coast, Davis Coast, Nanson Island, Danco Coast and Trinity Island) were tested using the Schmidt rebound hammer test. Peninsula Antarctic located at northwest of Antarctic region comprising of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Statistical analysis of the results at 95 % confidence level showed the Schmidt rebound value of the Graham Coast ranges from 40 ± 1. 7 to 41 ± 1. 3 with standard deviation of 8. 2 to 6. 4. The rebound value for Davis Coast was 39 ± 1. 6 with standard deviation of 7. 7. Rocks from Nanson Island and Danco Coast have the Schmidt rebound value of 54 ± 1. 7 with standard deviation of 8. 0 and 36 ± 1. 3 with standard deviation of 6. 2, respectively. The Schmidt rebound value of rocks at Trinity Island ranges from 29 ± 1. 4 to 32 ± 1. 7 with standard deviation of 6. 8 to 8. 1. Thus, the respective uniaxial compressive strengths of rock materials from Graham Coast, Davis Coast, Danco Coast, Nanson Island and Trinity Island were 73 - 108, 50, 59, 164 and 45 - 59 MPa.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the structural characteristics (geometry, structural details, materials quality, etc.) is a crucial step {{in the assessment of}} existing reinforced concrete (RC) constructions especially after earthquakes, fire or explosions, increase of live loads, etc. Specifically, the {{investigation of}} materials quality can also be required for new constructions in the case of non-conformity of the strength obtained from standard test specimens. Therefore the knowledge of the in-situ mechanical properties of constituent materials (concrete and steel) is a key issue in the evaluation of structural capacity. In order to achieve this goal, destructive (DT; e. g., cores) and non-destructive (NDT; e. g., ultrasonic, <b>rebound)</b> <b>test</b> methods are often adopted, either alone or combined.

It also, using a duly selected number of destructive test values (i. e., cores), establishes a multivariate relation between NDT and DT data for each homogeneous area, thus also permitting the estimation of concrete strength in the other points where only NDT tests are provided.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 27). There are many ways to test the compressive strength of concrete to include both destructive and non-destructive methods.

The purpose of this research is to determine the current compressive strength of concrete by analyzing the acoustic pattern of a sound made by a hammer striking the surface of a concrete cylinder in a lab environment. Concrete cylinders were made in the traditional fashion and the sound generated when a ball-ping hammer strikes the cylinder was recorded then analyzed.

40|$|International audienceNine {{experienced}} endurance runners performed individual marathon runs {{that involved}} several tests of neuromuscular performance before, {{during and after}} the marathon. The tests were performed with special force platform and dynamometer techniques. The results showed an overall decrease in performance from the marathon. The maximal sprint velocity decreased parabolically during the marathon, reaching the final value of 84 % of the pre-marathon one. Similarly, the other test results after marathon indicated that maximal isometric knee extension torque was 78 %, the performance in a special <b>rebound</b> <b>test</b> (drop jump) 84 % and the 5 -jump performance 92 % of the pre-marathon values. These reductions were accompanied by alteration in the ground reaction force curves in the sprint and jump tests, suggesting reduced tolerance to stretch load as well as loss in the recoil characteristics of the muscles. Repeated strech-shortening cycle (SSC) exercises induce fatigue that is likely to affect force production both in isometric and dynamic type performances. In fact, force reduction has been demonstrated in prolonged exercises of primarily aerobic type such as 85 -km skiing race (1) or marathon running (2) as well as in shorter periods of intensive repetition with the arm muscles (3). Because of the successive stretching loads, the decreased performance may result partly from alterations in stiffness regulation. Thus, repeated and fatiguing SSC efforts may modify neuromuscular behavior so that, depending on the test load, the regulation either increases the muscle stiffness or favors damping mechanisms. These changes may be specifically reflected by disturbances in the interaction person-(shoe) -surface. To investigate further the effects and adaptations induced by this type of fatigue, we examined the short-term influences of a marathon race. The run was performed individually in a research situation, simulating as closely as possible a real competitive race. The parameters covered several aspects of neuromus-cular functioning.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Few {{comprehensive}} {{studies on}} the effects of stacking sequence and rein-forcement form (unidirectional versus woven) have been published to date and much of the available data is contradictory. In the present study, instrumented impact tests were used to characterize such effects for carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic toughened epoxy laminates. Impact resistance was characterized in terms of load and energy parameters measured during penetration tests. These parameters were related to damage in the lami-nates by conducting <b>rebound</b> <b>tests</b> followed by ultrasonic imaging and microscopy. The results clearly demonstrated a relationship between the onset of damage and the first peak in the load versus deflection plots obtained in the penetration tests. No major effects of stacking sequence or reinforcement form were apparent in terms of the energy required for the onset of damage in the laminates. Energy to maximum load was found to be highly de-pendent on stacking sequence. Substitution of woven reinforcement for unidirectional tape in a quasi-isotropic layup resulted in a substantial decrease in the energy to maximum load. The results in terms of peak load showed similar trends. No effects of stacking se-quence or reinforcement form were observed in terms of energy after peak load.

The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is introduced for training and testing the data sets consisting of various parameters. To investigate the influence of various parameters which affect the compressive strength, 1551 data pairs are collected from the technical literature. These data sets cover early and late compressive strengths from 3 to 365 days and low and high strength in the range 6 · 3 – 107 · 7 MPa.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: It is unknown if different locomotor activities are equally effective at meeting the stabled horse's need for exercise {{and if they}} attenuate unwanted behaviour. Hypothesis: Alternative forms of exercise influence the intensity of locomotor activities {{during a period of}} turn-out (the so-called rebound effect) and the occurrence of unwanted or undesirable activities during standard handling situations. Method: Twenty-four horses kept in stables were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 4 exercise regimes (walker, treadmill, turn-out and riding) for 4 consecutive days. Because these forms of exercise provide additional environmental stimulation, beyond that provided by exercise, each horse served as its own control in 4 corresponding (no exercise) control treatments presented in a balanced order. Unwanted behaviour was tested by taking horses to weighing scales and loading and unloading them onto a 4 -horse float by an experienced handler and the <b>rebound</b> effect was <b>tested</b> by releasing them into a large arena for a period of 15 min at the end of the exercise and control treatments. Results: Locomotor activities made up a large part of behaviour in the large arena following control treatments and all exercise regimes were sufficient to reduce the intensity of walking (P< 0. 05), trotting (P< 0. 01) and cantering (P< 0. 001) on release into a large arena. Exercise regime reduced the number of bucks (P< 0. 01) and rolling (P< 0. 05) during <b>rebound</b> <b>tests</b> suggesting that turn-out was having a stronger effect than the other 3 exercise regimes. Exercise regimes significantly reduced the amount of unwanted behaviour and the number of commands given by the handler during weighing (P< 0. 05) but had no effect on these behaviours during loading onto a float. Conclusion: Providing stabled horses with one hour/day of exercise on a walker, treadmill, turn-out or by being ridden are all effective at allowing expression of locomotor activities in stabled horses. Potential relevance: Providing stabled horses with regular exercise is likely to provide positive effects on horse welfare, training ability and handler safety...|$|R
