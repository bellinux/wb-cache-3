40|$|Business process {{management}} (BPM) {{has become an}} extensive area of research with several specialized aspects. BPM is viewed from highly diverse angles ranging from a management strategy to a software system. It is widely acknowledged that process enforcement technologies hold the potential to provide the so called missing middle that can assist in overcoming the notorious business-IT divide. BPM technologies are considered {{as one of the}} key success stories in providing process control and monitoring functions, and addressing complex integration requirements in enterprise systems. However, the expectation of what this technology must deliver is a moving target. Whereas the success of coordinative processes depends upon the conformance to the prescribed control flow, the success of the <b>collaborative</b> <b>process</b> depends upon the ability to detect and react to changing conditions. What was true for workflow systems is no longer acceptable in the dynamic and cross organizational requirements for management of <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes.</b> The intention of the TCoB workshop was to provide a forum wherein challenges in modelling and deployment of specifically <b>collaborative</b> business <b>processes</b> can be debated.

40|$|International audienceWith an {{increasing}} background in inter-enterprise collaboration and interoperability, the automatic deduction of <b>collaborative</b> business <b>processes</b> is increasingly being {{viewed as a}} crucial research subject. The common solution is believed to involve either semantic ontologies or metamodeling, which can be combined with semantic algorithms or transformation rules. However, {{from the viewpoint of}} enterprises, the modeling of <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes</b> should be software integrated and can be changed to workflow. The design of the targeted <b>collaborative</b> <b>process</b> model does not fit the need. This has led to a lack of concepts and transformation rules for the ontology or metamodel. In this paper, a new <b>collaborative</b> <b>process</b> model called <b>collaborative</b> <b>process</b> cartography is designed.

40|$|Although <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes</b> {{are already}} being {{promoted}} as a strategy for managing environmental justice conflicts, the factors that promote and hinder effective <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes</b> in cases of environmental justice {{have not yet been}} explored. A case study approach identified the unique characteristics of environmental justice conflicts and provides a nuanced insight into the implications of these characteristics for collaborative problem-solving in environmental justice conflict situations. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>processes</b> in New York City’s West Harlem, Washington, D. C., and Richmond, California are studied. Environmental justice conflicts have characteristics that distinguish them from other types of environmental conflicts. The issues in an environmental justice conflict have a human rights orientation and are framed to emphasize dimensions of race, class, discrimination, and injustice. Past procedural injustices and the suppression or inaccessibility of relevant information characterize the nature of the decision-making processes traditionally followed in managing environmental justice conflicts. Parties to an environmental justice conflict have traumatic histories of racial and economic discrimination, different social locations, perceived power differentials, high distrust, low network ties, and incongruent communication norms. These characteristics challenge common assumptions about the nature of collaboration in environmental justice conflict situations. When presented with opportunities to participate in a <b>collaborative</b> <b>process,</b> environmental justice participants’ incentives to participate were limited. The presence of trusted and respectful leaders who are motivated to build relationships with other groups and communities can transform the nature of the opportunity and enhance participation. Building the capacities of environmental justice participants is important in fostering effective <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes,</b> but it is equally important to build the capacities of all parties engaged in the <b>collaborative</b> <b>process</b> to recognize and address the unique attributes of the environmental justice dimension of the conflict. Finally, the unique characteristics of environmental justice conflicts create complexities in <b>collaborative</b> problem-solving <b>processes</b> that warrant attention in how processes are structured and managed in an environmental justice context...|$|R

Collaboration {{addresses}} the ???knottiest??? {{of problems that}} society faces, and collaboration addressing natural resource management issues becomes as complex as the ecosystems collaborative groups affect. While <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes</b> have received more scholarly attention in recent years, relatively little work has investigated the nature of two key roles {{and the relationship between}} them: project managers and facilitators. My study focused on these topics and how they may influence outcomes in <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes</b> involving natural resource management issues. A data set that investigates all possible factors controlled by project managers and facilitators does not exist. Additionally, individual research methods carried risks and weaknesses that were unacceptable. Accordingly, I relied on multiple research methods. I utilized observation of collaborative meetings and interviews with project managers and facilitators to identify components of the <b>collaborative</b> <b>process</b> that improve outcomes in natural resource management. Observation of collaborative meetings provided opportunities to understand and witness various <b>collaborative</b> <b>processes</b> and the relationship between individuals in the project manager and facilitator roles.
