5|$|In 1981, Sexual Preference {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the historian Paul Robinson in Psychology Today and Richard P. Halgin in Library Journal, a negative review from the sociologist John Gagnon in The New York Times, a notice in Newsweek, and a discussion in The Chronicle of Higher Education, {{which focused on}} the controversy surrounding the book. The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work on grounds such as the questionable <b>representativeness</b> of its sample of homosexuals, though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including the sophistication of its path analysis.|$|E
5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the <b>representativeness</b> of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E
25|$|The optimistic bias is {{possibly}} {{also influenced by}} three cognitive mechanisms that guide judgments and decision-making processes: the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic, singular target focus, and interpersonal distance.|$|E
25|$|In a 1974 paper, psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman {{argued that}} a broad family of biases (systematic errors in {{judgment}} and decision) were explainable {{in terms of a}} few heuristics (information-processing shortcuts), including availability and <b>representativeness.</b> In a 2002 revision of the theory, Kahneman and Shane Frederick proposed attribute substitution as a process underlying these and other effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in <b>representativeness</b> heuristics.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparative}} research {{study conducted by}} the Catena Institute of Wine and University of California, Davis, examined the difference between the phenolic composition of Malbec wines from California, USA, and Mendoza, Argentina. Sixteen vineyards in California and twenty-six blocks in Mendoza were selected based on their uniformity and regional <b>representativeness.</b> The study concluded that there are distinct flavor and compositional differences in Malbec wines produced in Mendoza and California.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of 1960 some counter-movements to Taylorism arose. Representatives of the {{so-called}} Human Relations movement urged humanization and democratization of the working world. The criticism of Taylorism supports the unilateral approach of labor. Strictly speaking, Taylorism is not a scientific theory. All theories of F.W. Taylor are based on experiments. On the basis of samples, conclusions were made, which were then generalized. There is no <b>representativeness</b> of the selected sample.|$|E
25|$|The psychologists Stanton L. Jones and Mark A. Yarhouse {{observed}} that Homosexualities {{is one of}} the most influential studies ever conducted on homosexuality, but that like several other iconic studies, including those by Hooker, Kinsey, J. Michael Bailey, and Richard Pillard, its authors' conclusions were based on convenience samples, which have no known <b>representativeness.</b> They nevertheless consulted Bell and Weinberg's interview protocols when developing a questionnaire for their own study of ex-gays.|$|E
25|$|As a {{reaction}} of the abdication of king Ferdinand VII in favour of Napoleon, the Junta declared itself sovereign and supreme authority of the Kingdom on June 18, 1808, during the Peninsular war, becoming so the legitimate and de facto government of the Kingdom until Galicia was conquered by the Napoleonic troops in 1809. At the effect of having a broader base and <b>representativeness,</b> it briefly admitted among its members churchmen (the bishop of Ourense) and titled noblemen.|$|E
25|$|France {{came out}} bled of the Second World War. Through a {{constituent}} assembly, it sets up new institutions {{to revive the}} country's political activity. The <b>representativeness</b> of France is then extended to the Overseas territories such as the AEF, whose indigenous people {{have the opportunity to}} elect representatives. While the old colonies like the West Indies elect their deputies by universal suffrage, the AEF. and AOF have two separate electoral colleges: the first reserved for metropolitan citizens and the second for indigenous, non-citizens. Gabon and the Middle Congo, because of their low population, constitute a single constituency for the election of a Member of Parliament for this second college.|$|E
25|$|Heuristics are {{cognitive}} short cuts. Instead of weighing all {{the evidence}} when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias. The <b>representativeness</b> heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of. Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight bias is a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation bias {{is a type of}} bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.|$|E
500|$|In September 1986, {{the local}} {{government}} and the Council of Communal Development ( [...] , CODECO) made a public call for tenders to create a coat of arms for the commune, {{with the purpose of}} [...] "counting with a symbolic expression of <b>representativeness,</b> and to exalt distinctive features of the area and its people,"}} adding that they were [...] "seeking a coat of arms similar, but not identical to that of the province of Cardenal Caro." [...] Participants could send as many designs as they wanted, as far as it included the name of the commune and the date of its creation, 21 December 1891. Authors could add a motto and an inscription to their coat of arms if they wanted to. An article in local newspaper Pichilemu stated that the new coat of arms was to be chosen by a jury composed of the mayor of Pichilemu, the director of Municipal Works, two members of the CODECO, a representative of the culture department of the regional secretariat of the Education Ministry, an artist, and a teacher. The eventual winner would earn a prize of 100,000 pesos, and a diploma. Once past the deadline, set for 31 October 1986, the jury had a month to make a decision.|$|E
500|$|Although angler {{effects are}} {{sometimes}} disregarded {{in the overall}} picture today, recent population {{studies have shown that}} while all year classes are well represented up to the minimum legal angling size (now 60centimetres in most states), above that size, numbers of fish are dramatically reduced {{almost to the point of}} non-existence in many waters. Some emphasis has been made of the results of two small surveys which suggested a majority of Murray cod are released by anglers. However, there are valid questions as to the <b>representativeness</b> of these surveys, these surveys do not explain the dramatic disappearance of large numbers of young Murray cod at exactly the minimum size limit, and most importantly, any emphasis on these surveys miss the fundamental point — as a large, long-lived species with relatively low fecundity and delayed sexual maturity wild Murray cod populations are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, even with only modest angler-kill. A tightening of fishing regulations for wild Murray cod, as referred to above, and a switch by fishermen to a largely catch and release approach for wild Murray cod would alleviate this problem. Recognising these issues, in late 2014 the New South Wales and Victorian fishery departments amended their regulations so that a slot limit of 55 to 75cm now applies in these states. (I.e. Only Murray cod between 55 and 75cm may be taken; those above and below this size range or [...] "slot" [...] must be released.) This measure should have positive effects for the Murray cod population by protecting and increasing the proportion of large breeding Murray cod.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the legislative process {{and the work of}} the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society. The actual performance and <b>representativeness</b> of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.|$|E
2500|$|The musical {{examples}} for Cantometrics had {{not been}} chosen randomly, however, but for their <b>representativeness,</b> following the scholarly guidance of specialists who had studied the regions and /or supplied the audio or film clip samples. This was done because {{it was found that}} style tends to be very repetitive, and in most instances relatively few examples captured the stable performance norms, so that in most cases, coding many examples per culture yielded little new information. Lomax and Grauer settled on about ten examples per culture for Cantometrics, which had the largest dataset. Ten examples per culture usually sufficed, although for some cultures one or more sub-styles needed to be sampled as well.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{his works}} are serene in tones, in {{contrast}} with those expressing Tonitza's involvement in social issues. They proposed a classical aesthetical ideal, viewing art as a treasurer of spiritual values. This message is most obvious in his Northern Dobruja landscapes, his still life studies, the portraits of clowns (celebrated for their way of sublimating the comic and grotesque elements in masks and makeup, in order to reveal a sad humanity), young women and children. The so-called [...] "Tonitza eyes", both point-shaped and expressive, are a characteristic trait in his children portraits. In contrast with their appreciation for these pieces, Zambaccian {{and other members of}} Grupul celor patru expostulated the Balchik landscapes: Zambaccian remarked that his were [...] "more like arabesques in colored tones, [...] at a time when Şirato evolved upward toward a nuanced painting of a beautiful <b>representativeness</b> in a luminous space".|$|E
2500|$|Rind, Bauserman and Tromovitch {{responded to}} this {{criticism}} by saying that [...] "the <b>representativeness</b> of college samples is in fact irrelevant to the stated goals and conclusions of our study" [...] since the purpose of their research was [...] "to examine {{the validity of the}} clinical concept" [...] of CSA. They added that according to the commonly understood definition of the term, child sexual abuse is extremely and pervasively harmful, meaning that [...] "in any population sampled - drug addicts, psychiatric patients, or college students - persons who have experienced CSA should show strong evidence of the assumed properties of CSA." [...] The authors of the study say that because the college sample did not show pervasive harm, [...] "the broad and unqualified claims about the properties of CSA are contradicted". Rind et al. also said that using college samples was appropriate because their study found similar prevalence rates and experiences of severity and outcomes between college samples and national samples.|$|E
2500|$|Harry M. Benshoff {{writes that}} Bergler's claim that {{homosexuality}} {{had become more}} widespread through the [...] "creation of new recruits {{as a result of}} the dissemination of misleading statistics" [...] is an expression of the paranoia about homosexuality that was typical of the time Bergler was writing, adding that Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?, as well as Bergler's other writings, [...] "seem fueled by a neurotic hysteria found more regularly among Fundamentalist preachers and right-wing politicians." [...] Kenneth Lewes, author of a survey of psychoanalytic views on homosexuality, writes that he was surprised and shocked by Bergler's comments about homosexuals in Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?, which he describes as one of a number of works in which Bergler [...] "provided a whole bestiary of homosexual monstrosities". Lewes characterized Bergler's views as extreme, but nevertheless identified him as [...] "the most important analytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s" [...] and wrote that his statements about homosexuals represent the general psychoanalytic consensus at the time his book was written, which he summarizes as maintaining that homosexuals were incapable of [...] "achieving any peace of mind, any satisfying relations with other people, or any genuine artistic accomplishment." [...] Lewes writes that of all psychoanalysts it was Bergler who waged [...] "the most vigorous campaign against connecting homosexuality with creativity", with Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? being a continuation of Bergler's previous efforts. Lewes criticized Bergler for his [...] "insularity and imperviousness to criticism", giving as an example Bergler's insistence on the <b>representativeness</b> of his clinical experience.|$|E
60|$|But {{according}} to what view you take of it, it is either the gracious or the malicious gift of the great gods to man, that {{on the threshold of}} any wholly new and momentous devoted enterprise, the thousand ulterior intricacies and emperilings to which it must conduct; these, at the outset, are mostly withheld from sight; and so, through her ever-primeval wilderness Fortune's Knight rides on, alike ignorant of the palaces or the pitfalls in its heart. Surprising, and past all ordinary belief, are those strange oversights and inconsistencies, into which the enthusiastic meditation upon unique or extreme resolves will sometimes beget in young and over-ardent souls. That all-comprehending oneness, that calm <b>representativeness,</b> by which a steady philosophic mind reaches forth and draws to itself, in their collective entirety, the objects of its contemplations; that pertains not to the young enthusiast. By his eagerness, all objects are deceptively foreshortened; by his intensity each object is viewed as detached; so that essentially and relatively every thing is misseen by him. Already have we exposed that passing preposterousness in Pierre, which by reason of the above-named cause which we have endeavored to portray, induced him to cherish for a time four unitedly impossible designs. And now we behold this hapless youth all eager to involve himself in such an inextricable twist of Fate, that the three dextrous maids themselves could hardly disentangle him, if once he tie the complicating knots about him and Isabel.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>representativeness</b> {{heuristic}} is {{seen when}} people use categories, for example when deciding {{whether or not}} a person is a criminal. An individual thing has a high <b>representativeness</b> for a category if it is very similar to a prototype of that category. When people categorise things on the basis of <b>representativeness,</b> they are using the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic. [...] "Representative" [...] is here meant in two different senses: the prototype used for comparison is representative of its category, and <b>representativeness</b> is also a relation between that prototype and the thing being categorised. While it is effective for some problems, this heuristic involves attending to the particular characteristics of the individual, ignoring how common those categories are in the population (called the base rates). Thus, people can overestimate the likelihood that something has a very rare property, or underestimate the likelihood of a very common property. This is called the base rate fallacy. <b>Representativeness</b> explains this and several other ways in which human judgments break the laws of probability.|$|E

50|$|When {{judging the}} <b>representativeness</b> {{of a new}} stimulus/event, people usually pay {{attention}} to the degree of similarity between the stimulus/event and a standard/process. It is also important that those features be salient. Nilsson, Juslin, and Olsson (2008) found this to be influenced by the exemplar account of memory (concrete examples of a category are stored in memory) so that new instances were classed as representative if highly similar to a category as well as if frequently encountered.Several examples of similarity have been described in the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic literature. Research has focused on medical beliefs. People often believe that medical symptoms should resemble their causes or treatments. For example, people have long believed that ulcers were caused by stress, due to the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic, when in fact bacteria cause ulcers. In a similar line of thinking, in some alternative medicine beliefs patients have been encouraged to eat organ meat that corresponds to their medical disorder. Use of the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic can be seen in even simpler beliefs, such as the belief that eating fatty foods makes one fat. Even physicians may be swayed by the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic when judging similarity, in diagnoses, for example. The researcher found that clinicians use the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic in making diagnoses by judging how similar patients are to the stereotypical or prototypical patient with that disorder.|$|E

50|$|Some {{research}} has explored base rate neglect in children, {{as there was}} a lack of understanding about how these judgment heuristics develop. The authors of one such study wanted to understand the development of the heuristic, if it differs between social judgments and other judgments, and whether children use base rates when they are not using the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic. The authors found that the use of the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic as a strategy begins early on and is consistent. The authors also found that children use idiosyncratic strategies to make social judgments initially, and use base rates more as they get older, but the use of the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic in the social arena also increase as they get older. The authors found that, among the children surveyed, base rates were more readily used in judgments about objects than in social judgments. After that research was conducted, Davidson (1995) was interested in exploring how the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic and conjunction fallacy in children related to children’s stereotyping. Consistent with previous research, children based their responses to problems off of base rates when the problems contained nonstereotypic information or when the children were older. There was also evidence that children commit the conjunction fallacy. Finally, as students get older, they used the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic on stereotyped problems, and so made judgments consistent with stereotypes. There is evidence that even children use the <b>representativeness</b> heuristic, commit the conjunction fallacy, and disregard base rates.|$|E
