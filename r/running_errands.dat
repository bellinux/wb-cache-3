Ron approaches April and tells her that she should either forgive Andy or cut him loose, believing that she is only stringing Andy along and going to Indianapolis to spite him. When Andy returns, April finally forgives him and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of <b>running</b> <b>errands.</b> Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|From about 1970, Hubbard was {{attended}} aboard ship {{by the children}} of Sea Org members, organized as the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops, who were responsible for <b>running</b> <b>errands</b> for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to {{other members of the}} crew. In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, though not his first son Nibs, who had defected from Scientology in late 1959. The younger Hubbards were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors, though Quentin Hubbard reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid-1974.|$|E

5|$|As a teenager, {{he began}} to work for Los Tejas, a gang that ran the {{criminal}} activities {{in his hometown of}} Nuevo Laredo. From washing cars, <b>running</b> <b>errands,</b> and stealing car parts in Nuevo Laredo, Treviño Morales turned to the drug trade, starting with small-scale drug retail sales and smuggling. Unlike the first members of Los Zetas, he was never in the military. He was hired by them and the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s for his experience moving contraband across the border. His fluent English and his criminal contacts {{on both sides of the}} U.S.-Mexico border allowed him to gain the trust of the then-leader of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. When he joined the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, Los Tejas, the local gang he once worked for, was absorbed by the former groups. Around 2005, Treviño Morales became the regional boss of Nuevo Laredo; he was in charge of fighting off the incursions of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was attempting to take control of the smuggling routes in the area. The Laredo–Nuevo Laredo area is a lucrative smuggling route for narcotics because of the Interstate 35 highway, which serves as a strategic pathway to San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas for future drug distribution. While in power, he orchestrated a number of assassinations in American cities and in Mexico by young U.S. citizens whom he put on his payroll. Treviño Morales was good at identifying and grooming young teenagers who he believed had the potential to become professional assassins for Los Zetas. These recruits, sometimes called Zetitas ("Little Zetas"), usually joined organized crime as young as twelve-years old to work first as smugglers and later as paid assassins.|$|E

Ōkōchi, apparently impressed with Tanaka's energy and ambition, agreed to help the young man start a drafting office in Tokyo. Japan {{did not have a}} state qualification for architects at the time; Tanaka would have a role in creating the licensing system for architects later in his career.|$|E

Almost a year later, Tory convinces his mother to pull him from public school and send him to St. Peter's, where he expects to be more academically challenged. This is, however, merely an orchestration {{to get closer to}} Colin, who also happens to attend the same institution.|$|E

Work entered with Senior class status and graduated in June 1891 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.|$|E
25|$|Nels Rasmussen told Nuttall about Lazarus' {{continued}} {{contact with}} his daughter, which {{had not been in}} the files, despite him mentioning it frequently during Mayer and Hook's interviews. Realizing that Lazarus was now their prime suspect, the detectives informed their superiors of this and arranged to discreetly collect a voluntarily discarded DNA sample from her, knowing they would have to do so without getting a warrant, which would have let Lazarus know she was under investigation for the murder. While off-duty <b>running</b> <b>errands,</b> Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved. A sample was taken from it, and it matched the DNA from the bite mark on Sherri Rasmussen.|$|E
25|$|Garbo first {{worked as}} a soap-lather girl in a barber's shop but eventually, {{on the advice of}} her friends, applied for, and accepted, a {{position}} in the PUB department store, <b>running</b> <b>errands</b> and working in the millinery department. Before long, she began modeling hats for the store's catalogues, which led to a more lucrative job as a fashion model. In late 1920, a director of film commercials for the store began casting Garbo in roles advertising women's clothing. Her first commercial premiered on 12 December 1920 and was followed by others the following year. Thus began Garbo's cinematic career. In 1922, Garbo caught the attention of director Erik Arthur Petschler who gave her a part in his short comedy, Peter the Tramp.|$|E

25|$|Toombs {{was born}} in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on April 17, 1954, and was raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He {{attended}} Windsor Park Collegiate. His father, Stanley Baird Toombs, was an officer with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while they lived in The Pas, Manitoba. His mother was Eileen (née Anderson) Toombs. After being expelled from junior high for having a switchblade in school and falling out with his father, Piper left home and stayed in youth hostels. He picked up odd jobs at local gyms, <b>running</b> <b>errands</b> for several professional wrestlers. As a young man, he became proficient in playing the bagpipes, though he repeatedly stated that he was unsure exactly where he picked them up. His childhood (and lifelong) best friend was ex-NHL player and Stanley Cup winner Cam Connor.|$|E
25|$|His mother {{separated}} from Rose, and Lee {{had to get}} a job, his sister already working as a secretary for the Church of England Pensions Board. With most employers on or preparing to go on summer holidays, there were no immediate opportunities for Lee, and so he was sent to the French Riviera, where his sister was on holiday with friends. On his way there he stopped briefly in Paris, where he stayed with the journalist Webb Miller, a friend of Rose, and witnessed the execution of Eugen Weidmann, the last person to be executed in public in France. Arriving in Menton, he stayed with the Russian Mazirov family, living among exiled princely families. It was arranged that he should stay on in Menton after his sister had returned home, but with Europe on the brink of war, he returned to London instead. He worked as an office clerk for United States Lines, taking care of the mail and <b>running</b> <b>errands.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reconciling with Titulescu, who {{supported}} similar views at the League of Nations, Filipescu {{became the first}} president of the Romanian Telephone Company (SART), partly privatized in 1929, serving from 1930 until his death. He also presided over the Tobacco Monopoly {{and a number of other}} commercial enterprises. His term at SART saw the purchase of controlling interest by ITT Corporation, then the construction of the Bucharest Telephone Palace, completed in 1933, and back the tallest building in Romania. This assignment became the focus of additional controversy, with critics noting that, although the company was profitable, and the third-larges ITT subsidiary, services had improved only by a slim margin. He was denounced by the PNȚ's Virgil Madgearu, who audited the Company and found that Filipescu took a monthly salary of 100,000 lei, more than three times what a minister made—and, effectively, a lifeline for Epoca. A nationalist deputy, Leon Scridon, also accused Filipescu of <b>running</b> <b>errands</b> for Hungarian and Jewish entrepreneurs, and publicized alleged proof of mismanagement. For his part, Filipescu noted that the Romanian state was habitually cheating on the company's American shareholders, diverting investments and forcing them to accept redundant employees. From his managerial position, Filipescu also obtained intercepts of calls. This allowed him to spy on behalf of Carol, who consequently protected Filipescu against all backlash.|$|E

500|$|Like Albert Einstein and Edward Teller, Feynman was a late talker, and by {{his third}} {{birthday}} had yet to utter a single word. He retained a Brooklyn accent as an adult. That accent was thick enough {{to be perceived as}} an affectation or exaggeration – so much so that his good friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a [...] "bum". The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering, maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios. When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day <b>running</b> <b>errands.</b>|$|E

2500|$|For much of Eton's history, junior {{boys had}} to act as [...] "fags", or servants, to older boys.

[...] or [...] "Boy, Queue!", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of House and Games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from School Office.|$|E

Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914, with [...] "a very good First" [...] in Jurisprudence. He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at Oxford House in Bethnal Green for a year.

2500|$|Sutton {{committed}} suicide by {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} on March 16, 2009, apparently to avoid a federal prison term due to begin a few days later.
