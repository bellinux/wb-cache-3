[...] The half-life of fluorine-18 is long enough that <b>radiotracers</b> labeled with fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially at offsite locations and shipped to imaging centers.

However, clinical implementation of an 18 F-fluorine-based <b>radiotracer</b> in {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) has lagged, despite of its superior physical decay properties. 18 F-tetrafluoroborate (18 F-TFB) has received renewed interest as a promising iodide analog <b>radiotracer</b> for PET imaging in preclinical imaging studies [7 – 10].

2500|$|Radionuclides used in PET {{scanning}} {{are typically}} isotopes with short half-lives [...] such as carbon-11 (~20 min), nitrogen-13 (~10 min), oxygen-15 (~2 min), fluorine-18 (~110 min), gallium-68 (~67 min), zirconium-89 (~78.41 hours), or rubidium-82(~1.27 min). These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally {{used by the}} body such as glucose (or glucose analogues), water, or ammonia, [...] or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action. Such labelled compounds are known as <b>radiotracers.</b> [...] PET technology {{can be used to}} trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), [...] provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. [...] Thus, the specific processes that can be probed with PET are virtually limitless, and <b>radiotracers</b> for new target molecules and processes are continuing to be synthesized; as of this writing there are already dozens in clinical use and hundreds applied in research. At present, however, by far the most commonly used radiotracer in clinical PET scanning is fluorodeoxyglucose (also called FDG or fludeoxyglucose), an analogue of glucose that is labeled with fluorine-18. This radiotracer is used in essentially all scans for oncology and most scans in neurology, and thus makes up the large majority of all of the radiotracer (> 95%) used in PET and PET-CT scanning.|$|E

2500|$|Neurology: PET neuroimaging {{is based}} on an {{assumption}} that areas of high radioactivity are associated with brain activity. What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is, in general, believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer oxygen-15. However, because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical cyclotron for such uses, which is difficult. In practice, since the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose, and since brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease greatly decrease brain metabolism of both glucose and oxygen in tandem, standard FDG-PET of the brain, which measures regional glucose use, may also be successfully used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of FDG-PET for these uses is its much wider availability. [...] PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of seizure focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several <b>radiotracers</b> (i.e. radioligands) have been developed for PET that are ligands for specific neuroreceptor subtypes such as [...] raclopride, [...] fallypride and [...] desmethoxyfallypride [...] for dopamine D2/D3 receptors, [...] McN 5652 and [...] DASB for serotonin transporters, [...] Mefway for serotonin 5HT1A receptors, [...] Nifene for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-FDOPA for the AADC enzyme). These agents permit the visualization of neuroreceptor pools {{in the context of a}} plurality of neuropsychiatric and neurologic illnesses.|$|E

2500|$|Limitations to the {{widespread}} use of PET arise from the high costs of cyclotrons needed to produce the short-lived radionuclides for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus to produce the radiopharmaceuticals after radioisotope preparation. Organic radiotracer molecules that will contain a positron-emitting radioisotope cannot be synthesized first and then the radioisotope prepared within them, because bombardment with a cyclotron to prepare the radioisotope destroys any organic carrier for it. Instead, the isotope must be prepared first, then afterward, the chemistry to prepare any organic radiotracer (such as FDG) accomplished very quickly, in the short time before the isotope decays. Few hospitals and universities are capable of maintaining such systems, and most clinical PET is supported by third-party suppliers of <b>radiotracers</b> that can supply many sites simultaneously. This limitation restricts clinical PET primarily to the use of tracers labelled with fluorine-18, which has a half-life of 110 minutes and can be transported a reasonable distance before use, or to rubidium-82 (used as rubidium-82 chloride) with a half-life of 1.27 minutes, which is created in a portable generator and is used for myocardial perfusion studies. Nevertheless, in recent years a few on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and [...] "hot labs" [...] (automated chemistry labs that are able to work with radioisotopes) have begun to accompany PET units to remote hospitals. The presence of the small on-site cyclotron promises to expand in the future as the cyclotrons shrink in response to the high cost of isotope transportation to remote PET machines. In recent years the shortage of PET scans has been alleviated in the US, as rollout of radiopharmacies to supply radioisotopes has grown 30%/year.|$|E

This disparity may be related to a shortcoming of the SUV as a widely employed measure of tissue FDG uptake. Inherent in the use of SUV is the assumption of a constant <b>radiotracer</b> input function. However, <b>radiotracer</b> input functions markedly differed between study groups. In the insulin-treated animals, FDG cleared more rapidly from plasma so that a decrease in circulating <b>radiotracer</b> activities was associated with a disproportionately lower myocardial SUV.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{quantify}} the effects of injection volume at different technetium- 99 m specific <b>radiotracer</b> doses on its lymphatic movement in animal model. ProceduresEffects of injection volume (50, 100 μl) at different doses (0. 05, 0. 135, 0. 22 nmol) on popliteal node (PN) detection were studied in rats. The <b>radiotracer</b> under study was 99 mTechnetium-cysteine-mannose-dextran conjugate (30 kDa). ResultsAt 0. 05 nmol dose, higher PN uptake was observed at 50 μl injection volume (2. 6 fold increase). Conversely, at 0. 135 nmol dose, an increase of <b>radiotracer</b> retention in PN was achieved at 100 μl volume, 78 % higher than 50 μl. However, at 0. 22 nmol dose, the injection volume changes did not influence on the PN uptake. Considering as suitable <b>radiotracer</b> performance: high PN uptake and extraction, better combinations were 0. 05 nmol/ 50 μl, 0. 135 nmol/ 100 μl, 0. 22 / 50 μl.

50|$|Another of her major accomplishments was the {{development}} of the first <b>radiotracers</b> to map monoamine oxidase (MAO), a brain enzyme that regulates the levels of other nerve-cell communication chemicals and one of the two major enzymes involved in neurotransmitter regulation in the brain and peripheral organs. Using these <b>radiotracers,</b> she discovered that smokers have reduced levels of MAO in their brains and lungs. This may account for some of the behavioral and epidemiological features of smoking, such as the high rate of smoking in individuals with depression and drug addiction, two conditions involving poor nerve-cell communication, and has led to many studies on reduced MAO and smoking.|$|E

30|$|However, {{blocking}} efficacy varied {{among the}} applied COX- 2 inhibitors and was most evident with celecoxib.
