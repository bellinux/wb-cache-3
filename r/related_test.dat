50|$|Critics {{have argued}} that the {{sampling}} theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings. Based on the sampling theory, one might expect that <b>related</b> cognitive <b>tests</b> share many elements and thus be highly correlated. However, some closely <b>related</b> <b>tests,</b> such as forward and backward digit span, are only modestly correlated, while some seemingly completely dissimilar tests, such as vocabulary tests and Raven's matrices, are consistently highly correlated. Another problematic finding is that brain damage frequently leads to specific cognitive impairments rather than a general impairment one might expect based on the sampling theory.|$|R

General Radio, then still {{a major source of}} RF test equipment, designed the incompatible GR-900 as a 14 mm successor to the GR-874, filling the industry's need for a higher performance sexless connector for fully reversible lab standards and <b>related</b> <b>test</b> equipment.

To {{make sure that the}} fix works, the program will be tested again for that criterion.

So, a set of <b>related</b> <b>test</b> cases may have to be repeated again, to make sure that nothing else is affected by {{a particular}} fix. How {{this is going to be}} carried out must be elaborated in this section. In some companies, whenever there is a fix in one unit, all unit test cases for that unit will be repeated, to achieve a higher level of quality.|$|E

However, he was not always successful and in 1931 lost a case that involved his client attempting to set up a business selling tickets for Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake in Britain.
