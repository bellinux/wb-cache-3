40|$|Design and {{implementation}} of I-Cubes, a modular self-reconfigurable robotic system, is discussed. 1 -Cubes is a bipartite collection of individual modules that can be independently controlled. The group consists of active elements, called links, which are 3 -DOF manipulators capable of attaching to~detaching from the passive elements (cubes) acting as connectors. The cubes can be oriented and positioned by the links. Using actuation and attachment properties of the links and the cubes, the system can self-reconfigure to adapt to its environment. Tasks such as moving over obstacles, climbing stairs can be performed by changing the relative position and connection of the modules. The links are actuated using servomotors and worm gear mechanisms. Mechanical encoders and <b>rotary</b> switches provide <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> for semi-autonomous control of the system.

40|$|Motion {{control process}} in modern {{automation}} technology and industry requires highly accurate speed information with high bandwidth. Incremental encoders {{are widely used}} as <b>rotary</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>position</b> and speed sensors which convert the motor position and speed information into coded electrical pulses. An accurate speed decoding system is therefore needed to extract necessary position and speed information from encoder output, which is further required by the motion control process. The level of accuracy and bandwidth highly depend on resolution of encoder being used as well as data processing technique. In this thesis, different incremental encoders and state-of-the-art speed decoding algorithms are discussed. These algorithms are implemented in Matlab Simulink and a comparative analysis is done based on accuracy, rapid response and wide speed range application. Further, the best choice is made based on this comparison and corresponding speed decoding algorithm is implemented in Xilinx FPGA. Analytical simulation results are presented in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Design of neuro-controller {{for complex}} dynamic systems {{is a big}} {{challenge}} faced by the researchers. In this paper we present a design of a robust neuro-controller for a dynamic system {{to make the system}} response fast with no overshoot. Here the control action decided by the controller completely depends on the value of the error at that point of time. The <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> which controls the bandwidth of the system as well as the dynamic response {{is a function of the}} system error. For large error the <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> is made large increasing the bandwidth of the system, and for small errors the <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> value is small. Thus, during the dynamic response of the system the bandwidth of the system is controlled by the system error. Similarly, the velocity feedback which controls the damping in the system is kept very small for large errors, and large for small errors. Thus, in the proposed neuro-controller the <b>position</b> <b>feedback,</b> and velocity feedback 	 are made as a function of error which yields a very fast response with no or very little overshoot...|$|R

40|$|Background/Purpose: To {{improve the}} {{recognition}} of articulating facet displacement of lateral atlantoaxial joint (AFDLAJ), and to evaluate the significance of AFDLAJ in diagnosing atlantoaxial subluxation. Methods: The three-dimensional computed tomography (3 D CT) imaging findings of 54 patients with atlantoaxial subluxation were retrospectively analyzed, and the imaging features of AFDLAJ were discussed. All the patients were examined in neutral position, and 25 in an additional <b>rotary</b> <b>position.</b> 3 D images of the atlantoaxial joints were obtained by surface shade display and volume rendering. The diagnostic results of 3 D CT, routine CT and X-ray were compared. Results: All the 54 patients with atlantoaxial subluxation were correctly diagnosed by 3 D CT with no suspicious or missed diagnoses, including 38 cases of rotatory subluxation, 11 of anterior subluxation and five of posterior subluxation. AFDLAJ was found in all the 54 patients in neutral position, with the extent of subluxation between 2. 0 mm and 9. 0 mm. Among the 25 cases in <b>rotary</b> <b>position,</b> rotational fixation was found in 10 cases and rotational asymmetry in 15. The diagnostic accuracy of 3 D CT was {{higher than that of}} X-ray or routine CT. Conclusion: Once AFDLAJ appears in neutral position and rotational fixation or asymmetry in <b>rotary</b> <b>position,</b> atlantoaxial subluxation can be ascertained, as well as the type and extent of subluxation, and fake subluxation due to the head's rotation or normal lateralized odontoid can be excluded. AFDLAJ is a vital direct sign in diagnosing atlantoaxial subluxation...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} for vibration suppression in Large Space Structures is demonstrated in laboratory experiments on a thin cantilever beam, resulting in substantially reduced dynamic response. This technique, called Positive <b>Position</b> <b>Feedback,</b> {{makes use of}} generalized displacement measurements to accomplish vibration suppression. The concept of a piezoelectric active-member is developed in relation to controlling space-truss type structures. The active-member functions dually as a structural member and a control actuator. Piezoelectric ceramic material is adhered to a thin cantilever beam and simulates {{the use of an}} active-member. This space-realizable control scheme makes use of strain measurements, a preferred measurement quantity for vibration suppression, and internal control forces which completely decouple the rigid-body motion from the elastic motion. A simple necessary and sufficient condition for stability with Positive <b>Position</b> <b>Feedback</b> is presented. This condition is non-dynamic and is in general easily satisfied. As a result, Positive <b>Position</b> <b>Feedback</b> is demonstrated to have superior robust stability properties. It is also demonstrated that with Positive <b>Position</b> <b>Feedback,</b> all control and observation spillover is stabilizing.

40|$|It {{has long}} been a {{research}} hotspot to diagnose atlanto-axial disorder by observing the shape and motions of atlanto-axial joints. The basis for correlative studies is to ascertain the normal anatomic features of atlanto-axial joints. In our study, 33 normal subjects were examined for atlanto-axial joints, by three-dimensional CT (3 D-CT) in functional positions (neutral, left and right <b>rotary</b> <b>position).</b> The contraposition between superior and inferior articular facets of lateral atlanto-axial joints (AFLAJ), including its shape and type, the width of rotational facets displacement (RFD), head's rotational angle (HRA) and rotational angle at C 1 - 2 (RAC(1 - 2)) were observed and measured on 3 D-CT images. In neutral position, a complete contraposition of AFLAJ was found in 25 subjects as well as a basic contraposition in 8. In <b>rotary</b> <b>position,</b> the width of RFD was between 6. 16 and 8. 68 mm, the angle of HRA was between 30. 2 degrees and 45. 8 degrees, and RAC(1 - 2) between 26. 7 degrees and 38. 9 degrees. There is no significant difference in RFD, HRA or RAC(1 - 2) (P > 0. 05) in between levorotatory and dextrogyrate orientation, and there is a positive correlation between RFD and RAC(1 - 2) (r = 0. 5078, P < 0. 05). Our study results show that the contraposition of AFLAJ can be clearly displayed by 3 D-CT, and complete or basic contraposition in neutral position and symmetry RFD, HRA and RAC(1 - 2) in <b>rotary</b> <b>position,</b> are the normal anatomic features of atlanto-axial joints...|$|R

The objective of this pilot study was to better understand the effect of <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> during task-oriented reach training of the upper limb in people with chronic stroke. Five subjects participated in the training for 30 minutes three times a week for 6 weeks. During training, subjects performed reaching movements over a predefined path. When deviation from this path occurred, shoulder and elbow joints received <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> using restraining forces. We recorded the amount of <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> used by each subject.

40|$|Abstract: In {{vibration}} control of distributed-parameter mechanical systems {{the main problem}} arises from endeavoring to achieve even damping in the desired frequency range and robustness simultaneously. These two important properties usually compromise each other so that more sophisticated techniques are needed to improve the {{vibration control}} of large structures. In the case of classical velocity feedback, for example, some kind of low-pass filter {{should be used to}} achieve better stability. In the case of <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> use of dynamic controllers like Positive <b>Position</b> <b>Feedback</b> (PPF) or Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) is an alternative, but considering their low robustness and more complicated design there are no advantages within the control of large structures with variable parameters. The control method suggested in this work, i. e. PI control with <b>position</b> <b>feedback,</b> is {{based on the fact that}} integral of the position can replace the velocity sensing with the idea of suppressing the influence of higher frequencies (which are responsible for instability) while phase shift in working low-frequency range remains in desired bounds. Numerical root-loci analysis as well as experimental examples presented in this paper can show that PI control with <b>position</b> <b>feedback</b> is able to add damping to vibrating structure within low-frequency bands at comparable level as velocity feedback can do, but with a smaller influence on higher frequencies...|$|R
