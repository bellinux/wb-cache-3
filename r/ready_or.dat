Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E

25|$|The West adopted {{many of the}} Byzantine {{iconographic}} elements, but {{preferred the}} stable rather than the cave, though Duccio's Byzantine-influenced Maestà version tries to have both. The midwives gradually dropped out from Western depictions, as Latin theologians disapproved of these legends; sometimes the bath remains, either being got <b>ready</b> <b>or</b> with Mary bathing Jesus. The midwives are still seen where Byzantine influence is strong, especially in Italy; as in Giotto, one may hand Jesus over to his mother. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.|$|E
25|$|Hitler was {{disappointed}} with Halder's plan and initially reacted by deciding that the German army should attack early, <b>ready</b> <b>or</b> not, {{in the hope}} that Allied unreadiness might bring about an easy victory. Hitler proposed beginning the invasion on 25 October 1939 but accepted that the date was probably unrealistic. On 29 October, Halder presented another plan, Aufmarschanweisung N°2, Fall Gelb, featuring a secondary attack on the Netherlands. On 5 November, Hitler informed Walther von Brauchitsch that he intended the invasion to begin on 12 November. Brauchitsch replied that the military had yet to recover from the Polish campaign and offered to resign; this was refused but two days later Hitler postponed the attack, giving poor weather as the reason for the delay. More postponements followed, as commanders persuaded Hitler to delay the attack for a few days or weeks, to remedy some critical defect in the preparations or to wait for better weather. Hitler also tried to alter the plan, which he found unsatisfactory; his weak understanding of how poorly prepared Germany was for war and how it would cope with losses of armoured vehicles were not fully considered. Though Poland had been quickly defeated, many armoured vehicles had been lost and were hard to replace. This eventually resulted in a dispersion of the German effort; although the main attack would remain in central Belgium, secondary attacks would be undertaken on the flanks. Hitler made such a suggestion on 11 November, pressing for an early attack on unprepared targets.|$|E

500|$|All Ballantyne's novels are, {{in his own}} words, [...] "adventure {{stories for}} young folks", and The Coral Island is no exception. It is a Robinsonade, a genre of fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), {{one of the most}} popular of its type, and one of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes. Susan Maher, professor of English, [...] notes that in comparison to Robinson Crusoe such books generally replaced some of the original's romance with a [...] "pedestrian realism", exemplified by works such as The Coral Island and Frederick Marryat's 1841 novel Masterman <b>Ready,</b> <b>or</b> the Wreck of the Pacific. Romance, with its attention to character development, was only restored to the genre of boys' fiction with Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island argues literary critic Lisa Honaker. The Coral Island, for all its adventure, is greatly occupied with the realism of domestic fiction (the domain of the realist novel); Ballantyne devotes about a third of the book to descriptions of the boys' living arrangements. The book exhibits a [...] "light-hearted confidence" [...] in its description of an adventure that was above all fun. As Ralph says in his preface: [...] "If there is any boy or man who loves to be melancholy and morose, and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of fun, let me seriously advise him to shut my book and put it away. It is not meant for him." [...] Professor of English [...] has observed that [...] "the swift movement of the story from coastal England to exotic Pacific island is similar to the swift movement from the real world to the fantastic in children's fantasy".|$|E

2500|$|Anxiety is {{distinguished}} from fear, {{which is an}} appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat. Anxiety {{is related to the}} specific behaviors of fight-or-flight responses, defensive behavior or escape.

David Barlow defines anxiety as [...] "a future-oriented mood state in which one is not <b>ready</b> <b>or</b> prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events," [...] and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear. Another description of anxiety is [...] agony, dread, terror, or even apprehension. In positive psychology, anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills.|$|E
