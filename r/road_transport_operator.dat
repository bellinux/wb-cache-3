40|$|The {{efficiency}} of road transport is typically influenced by factors such as, weather, choice of road, {{and time of}} day, and day of the week. Knowledge about interactions between different traffic- and transport related factors and their influence on the execution of transport is important in transport planning. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the impact of different factors on the performance of road transport. We aim to contribute to improved transport planning by analysing traffic and transport data obtained from different sources in order to support data driven decision making. Through a review of existing literature and discussions with a Swedish <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operator,</b> we identified factors that could be relevant to consider when planning a transport, e. g., related to weather, location of roads where the transport will take place, and planned time of the transport. As a result of variation in size, type and volume of the data representing these factors, suitable machine learning algorithms were selected, such as Decision Stump, M 5 model tree, M 5 regression tree, RepTree, M 5 rules, and linear regression in order to study the data. Our experimental results illustrate the complexity associated to the performance of road transport systems mainly because of the dependency between the choices of influencing factors and geographic location of the road segment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper uses a {{structured}} survey to {{provide insight into}} how the <b>Road</b> <b>Transport</b> Management System (RTMS), SABS standard SANS 1395 : 2014, has developed and is viewed within the <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> industry in South Africa. The RTMS is an industry-led, government-supported, voluntary, self-regulation scheme that encourages consignees, consignors and <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators</b> to implement a management system that demonstrates compliance with road traffic regulations and contributes to preserving road infrastructure, improving road safety and increasing productivity. The surveyed views of the road traffic authorities, banks, insurance companies, the RTMS steering committee, and <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators</b> provide insights into the perceptions and experiences {{with respect to the}} RTMS from diverse stakeholders. Respondents indicate that improved safety, operational efficiency and reduced road crashes are seen as attractive benefits to implementing the RTMS. The main obstacles to certification are a lack of awareness of the RTMS and a poor understanding of the requirements for becoming RTMS certified. The clients of road transporters {{play a significant role in}} the transporter’s decision to become RTMS certified...|$|R

40|$|In {{terms of}} efficiency, <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> {{operations}} have historically seen very little development {{relative to other}} supply chain areas and some authors have even referred to freight transportation as the “forgotten factor. ” Several studies world-wide have shown a generally low level of efficiency in <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> operations. The U. S. Department of Transportation published a report in 2008 on the costs of inefficiencies in <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> operations, stating that inefficiencies related to, e. g., loading and unloading cost the nation’s <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators</b> over 3 billion USD annually. The literature discusses the various efficiency issues in <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> operations, in areas such as, i. e., route planning, organization, routines at loading and unloading and efficiency issues related to security initiatives and wasteful operations. Waste corresponds to everything (resources, time, activities, etc.) that does not add value, e. g., waiting, defects and unnecessary administration. Due to the large environmental and societal impact of transport operations, interest and legislation from authorities and societies is mounting on supply chain members involved in freight transportation to increase operational efficiency. Previous literature has proposed that information deficiency is a reason for inefficiency and has pointed to information sharing (an overarching term involving the adaptation of processes, information and enabling technology) to improve efficiency, yet it is unclear both how to address waste in <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> operations and how information sharing can improve efficiency and the potential of it. This thesis addresses those questions with the focus “to explore and define waste in <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> operations and estimate the efficiency potential of information sharing. ” The findings of this thesis are relevant for industry, academia and policy-makers. This thesis brings the attention of managers to the various other types of waste prevalent in <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> operations and provides frameworks that are useful in addressing waste in a structured fashion. The drivers’ working time is the biggest individual cost for <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators</b> and even minor reductions of waste of drivers’ working time can enable significant cost savings. The academic contribution is definitions on waste, a conceptual framework of information sharing, insights on supply chain transport relationships and quantification of the potential of information sharing. Several authorities are now investing in research and creating roadmaps on how investments in Information Communication Technologies (ICT) can improve efficiency of <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> operations.

Different inter-organisational relationships have emerged as important structures in supply chains. There {{is a need for}} firms in any supply chain to successfully manage a portfolio of different relationship from contractual arms-length relationships to fully integrated strategic alliances. Many researchers have investigated the nature and drivers of buyer-supplier relationships, stressing the importance of more cooperative and long-term relationship. Nevertheless, there is little empirical research conducted on the relationship between suppliers (i. e., single road freight supplier – integrated road freight supplier providing warehousing). The <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> sector is critical to every product supply chain. This pilot study uses survey data on twenty five <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>operators</b> in Australia to examine how these operators manage the different relationships with their supply chain partners such as warehouse service providers; distribution centers; and other road freight operators. The preliminary findings show that although the literature supports the benefits of cooperation and collaboration throughout the supply chain, Australian road freight businesses are only slightly shifting from arm’s length to closer relationships with the members of their supply chain. More unexpected results show that there is a severe imbalance and lack of trust relative to the relationship between road and freight operators and their supply chain partner...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{telematic}} systems, {{also known}} as intelligent transportation systems, can be expensive to implement but the services they provide may offer substantial benefits. However, what services the system can provide depends on the architectural choices made, which also affects {{the cost of the}} system. We propose an optimization model to support a more informed decision before investing in a multiple service transport telematic system. The model evaluates the possible choices of services and architectures, and aims to maximize the total net societal benefit. We argue that the optimization model can provide support for strategic decisions by highlighting the consequences of adopting different system architectures, including both societal value and cost. This can be useful for decision makers, such as governments, <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> telematic service providers, and commercial <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R
