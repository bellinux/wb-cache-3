40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of short and moderate intervals of recovery with and without equated volume during an acute bout exhaustive strength exercise on metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory responses in healthy adults. Eight physically active men (23. 5 ± 3. 1) performed three randomized sequences: Short (70 % of 1 RM with 30 seconds of rest); Moderate (70 % of 1 RM with 90 seconds of rest); and Volume-Equated Short (70 % of 1 RM with 30 seconds of rest between sets with a repetition volume equal to that performed in Moderate). All sequences of exercises were performed until movement failure in the squat, bench press and T-bar row exercises, respectively. Glucose, lactate, testosterone, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 1 ra and MCP- 1 levels were assessed at rest, immediate post-exercise, and 1 hour post. There was a main effect of time for testosterone (p< 0. 001). The post hoc indicated differences between post-exercise and rest and post- 1 hour and post-exercise (p< 0. 001). Lactate increased post-exercise when compared to pre and post- 1 hour (p< 0. 001) and maintained higher post- 1 hour in relation to rest. IL- 6 was greater post-exercise than <b>rest</b> (p= <b>0.</b> 045) and post- 1 hour and <b>rest</b> (p= <b>0.</b> 020).

40|$|The Sheffield {{electrical}} impedance tomography; (EIT) system produces images {{of changes in}} the distribution of resistivity within tissue. The paper reports on the application of {{electrical impedance}} tomography in monitoring volume changes in the limb during venous occlusion. The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility, reproducibility and validity of calf blood flow measurements by EIT. In 14 healthy volunteers calf blood flow is compared, as determined in a calf segment by strain-gauge plethysmography (SGP), with the impedance changes measured by EIT during rest and post-ischaemic hyperaemia. The measurements are repeated to assess reproducibility. The reproducibility for the EIT, assessed from the repeated measurements and expressed as a reproducibility coefficient, is <b>0.</b> 88 during <b>rest</b> and <b>0.</b> 89 during hyperaemia. The reproducibility coefficient for SGP data is <b>0.</b> 83 at <b>rest</b> and <b>0.</b> 67 during hyperaemia. Flow measurements, assessed by means of two methods, correlate well at <b>rest</b> (r = <b>0.</b> 89), but only moderately during hyperaemia (r = 0. 51). The correlation coefficient for the pooled flow measurements is 0. 98. It is concluded that EIT is a valid and reliable method for assessing blood flow in the limb.

Monoplane end-diastolic (EDV), end-systolic volumes (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated using the ‘area-length' method and were {{compared with the same}} parameters obtained by conventional left ventricular cineangiocardiography. A first group of 20 patients was studied at rest and a second group of 10 patients during bicycle exercise at a work load of 64 watts during 2 min, by DSA and conventional cineangiocardiography. Three different subtraction modes were evaluated: (1) mask mode subtraction (MMS), (2) time interval difference (TID) method and (3) a combination of MMS and TID called MMS+TID method. With the MMS method good correlations were obtained for EDV, ESV and EF at <b>rest</b> (r> <b>0.</b> 91) and during exercise (r> 0. 91). The TID method showed only moderate correlations for patients at <b>rest</b> (r> <b>0.</b> 86) and during exercise (r> 0. 79). Similar results as with MMS were achieved by the combined method (MMS+TID) at <b>rest</b> (r> <b>0.</b> 91) and during exercise (r> 0. 91). Interobserver variability indicated a high reproducibility for all methods except for TID during exercise.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} resistance training on the response of mixed muscle protein fractional synthesis (FSR) and breakdown rates (FBR) by use of primed constant infusions of [2 H 5]phenylalanine and [15 N]phenylalanine, respectively, to an isolated bout of pleiometric resistance exercise. Trained subjects, who were performing regular resistance exercise (trained, T; n = 6), were compared with sedentary, untrained controls (untrained, UT;n = 6). The exercise test consisted of 10 sets (8 repetitions per set) of single-leg knee flexion (i. e., pleiometric muscle contraction during lowering) at 120 % of the subjects' predetermined single-leg 1 repetition maximum. Subjects exercised one leg while their contralateral leg acted as a nonexercised (resting) control. Exercise resulted in an increase, above resting, in mixed muscle FSR in both groups (UT: <b>rest,</b> <b>0.</b> 036 ± 0. 002; exercise, 0. 0802 ± 0. 01; T: <b>rest,</b> <b>0.</b> 045 ± 0. 004; exercise, 0. 067 ± 0. 01; all values in %/h; P less than  0. 01). In addition, exercise resulted {{in an increase in}} mixed muscle FBR of 37 ± 5 % (<b>rest,</b> <b>0.</b> 076 ± 0. 005; exercise, 0. 105 ± 0. 01; all values in %/h; P less than  0. 01) in the UT group but did not significantly affect FBR in the T group. The resulting muscle net balance (FSR - FBR) was negative throughout the protocol (P less than  0. 05) but was increased in the exercised leg in both groups (P less than  0. 05). We conclude that pleiometric muscle contractions induce an increase in mixed muscle protein synthetic rate within 4 h of completion of an exercise bout but that resistance training attenuates this increase. A single bout of pleiometric muscle contractions also increased the FBR of mixed muscle protein in UT but not in T subjects...|$|E

Design and Setting: observational study, case series; single center, university hospital. Patients: 30 patients with coronary artery disease and collateral-dependent myocardium and 17 healthy volunteers. Methods: Resting and hyperemic (adenosine) MRPI was used to determine delay time (Δtd) of contrast arrival between the left ventricle and collateral-dependent or antegradely-perfused myocardium, and myocardial perfusion (MP, ml/g/min). Results: In healthy volunteers Δtd at rest and during hyperemia were 0. 8 ± 0. 4 and 0. 3 ± 0. 3 sec., and MP was 1. 14 ± 0. 21 and 4. 23 ± 1. 12 ml/min/g.

Ten healthy college males (21. 2 ± 1. 0 yr) volunteered for this experiment. Autonomic nervous activities associated with energy metabolism were examined at 30 min intervals for a total of 120 -min while at rest and every 5 -min during exercise at 50 % of the ventilation threshold before and after intake of the compound or placebo with 100 ml of water for 10 days. In addition, heart rate variability power spectral analysis was used to assess human autonomic nervous activities. The results indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} in heart rate during rest and exercise among trials. Furthermore, the autonomic nervous activity tended to increase after 10 -days of consumption of the test compounds during the experimental period, but the differences did not reach statistical significance.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{compared}} {{left ventricular}} (LV) ejection fraction obtained by gated SPECT with that obtained by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography {{in a large}} cohort of patients. METHODS: Within 1 week, 514 subjects with suspected or known coronary artery disease underwent same-day stress-rest (99 m) Tc-sestamibi gated SPECT and radionuclide angiocardiography. For both studies, data were acquired 30 min after completion of exercise and after 3 h rest. RESULTS: In the overall study population, a good correlation between ejection fraction measured by gated SPECT and by radionuclide angiocardiography was observed at <b>rest</b> (r= <b>0.</b> 82, p< 0. 0001) and after stress (r= 0. 83, p< 0. 0001). In Bland-Altman analysis, the mean differences in ejection fraction (radionuclide angiocardiography minus gated SPECT) were - 0. 6 % at rest and 1. 7 % after stress. In subjects with normal perfusion (n= 362), a good correlation between ejection fraction measured by gated SPECT and by radionuclide angiocardiography was observed at <b>rest</b> (r= <b>0.</b> 72, p< 0. 0001) and after stress (r= 0. 70, p< 0. 0001) and the mean differences in ejection fraction were - 0. 9 % at rest and 1. 4 % after stress.

40|$|The two-microelectrode, voltage-clamp {{technique}} {{was applied to}} rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers to study the interaction of tetrodotoxin (TTX) with the slowly inactivating Na current. Binding of TTX to rested, inactivated, and activated channels was estimated by measuring the relative decrease of current at the beginning (rested and inactivated channels) and the end (activated channels) of a 1 s depolarizing clamp to - 45 mV. The accelerated decline of the Na current {{in the presence of}} a submaximal dose of TTX was interpreted as an increase in blocking efficiency upon depolarization. The experiments show that activated as well as inactivated channels are more sensitive to TTX than are rested channels. The dissociation equilibrium constants for the three states are 3. 5 X 10 (- 6) M for the <b>rested,</b> <b>0.</b> 94 X 10 (- 6) M for the activated, and 0. 75 X 10 (- 6) M for the inactivated channels.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{determine}} the original stress state of a clay massif in the town Brno. Stress state of rock mass is generally expressed by an empirical relationship of coefficient of earth pressure at <b>rest</b> K <b>0.</b> This coefficient can be determined by numerical methods, laboratory tests and also using inverse numerical analysis. This diploma thesis deals with the determination of the original stress state in rock mass by means of numerical modeling. Excavation of an exploratory adit R 2 has been selected as a case study for the backanalysis. It was excavated for the purpose of engineering geological survey within the construction of Královopole tunnels. The numerical model was developed using geotechnical software Plaxis 2 D and 3 D using two advanced hypoplastic models. These models did not consider stiffness anisotropy. The results of the presented diploma thesis are the values of the coefficient of earth pressure at <b>rest</b> K <b>0,</b> obtained using four different types of numerical analyses. In addition, overconsolidation preassure of a natural clay was determined using empirical relationship by Mayne and Kulhawy (1982) and using oedometric compression tests on undisturbed samples of brno clay...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{methods are}} used to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of botulinum toxin A in the treatment of hyperkinetic facial wrinkles. So far nearly very few have been investigated for its reproducibility. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the reproducibility of two widely used clinical 0  3 scales (from none to severe) for lateral canthal frown lines (crow's feet). Methods: Based on standardized photographs of the crow's feet area at rest and at maximum frown a consensus atlas depicting different severity grades was developed. Using the photographs of this atlas the investigators and experts of an upcoming clinical trial were trained. In the main study 49 photographs taken at rest and 48 photographs taken at maximum smile were shown on two consecutive days to 9 (first day) respectively 8 (both days) investigators and several months later on two consecutive days to 4 experts. The reproducibility of the scores was investigated by conventional kappa statistics. Results: The overall reproducibility for both scores was moderate to good both for the investigators and the experts. Among the investigators an unweighted kappa according to Fleiss of <b>0.</b> 6 at <b>rest</b> and of <b>0.</b> 58 at maximum smile for the interobserver reproducibility could be measured. For the intraobserver reproducibility the unweighted kappa according to Cohen measured between 0. 47 and 0. 86 for each observer at <b>rest</b> and between <b>0.</b> 63 and 0. 81 for each observer at maximum smile. The weighted kappa with weights used according to Cicchetti and Allison ranged between 0. 63 and <b>0.</b> 91 at <b>rest</b> and between <b>0.</b> 71 and 0. 86 at maximum smile. Among the experts an unweighted kappa according to Fleiss of <b>0.</b> 63 at <b>rest</b> and of <b>0.</b> 50 at maximum smile for the interobserver reproducibility could be measured. For the intraobserver reproducibility the unweighted kappa according to Cohen measured between 0. 53 and 0. 75 for each observer at <b>rest</b> and between <b>0.</b> 35 and 0. 62 for each observer at maximum smile. The weighted kappa with weights used according to Cicchetti and Allison ranged between 0. 64 and <b>0.</b> 83 at <b>rest</b> and between <b>0.</b> 49 and 0. 74 at maximum smile. Conclusions: The clinical 0 - 3 scores of crow's feet both at rest and at maximum smile show a moderate to good inter- and intraobserver reproducibility. As it allows a better discrimination than a single score combined for both situations the use of these scores in clinical trials can be recommended...|$|R
