40|$|Abstract—Wide-area {{coordinating}} {{control is}} becoming an important issue and a challenging problem in the power industry. This paper proposes a novel optimal wide-area monitor and wide-area coordinating neurocontroller (WACNC), based on wide-area measurements, for a power system with power system stabilizers, a large wind farm, and multiple flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. The wide-area monitor is a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that identifies the input-output dynamics of the nonlinear power system. Its parameters are optimized through a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based method. The WACNC is designed by using the dual heuristic programming (DHP) method and RBFNNs. It operates {{at a global level}} to coordinate the actions of local power system controllers. Each local controller communicates with the WACNC, receives <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> from the WACNC to enhance its dynamic performance, and therefore helps improve system-wide dynamic and transient performance.
