5|$|After the Second World War, {{the suburb}} began {{to expand rapidly}} with the {{construction}} of many private homes. Yarralumla's image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices began to rise coincident with a <b>rejuvenation</b> of the suburb. Many of the original government-built monocrete, brick, and weatherboard houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers was a {{major theme}} in the Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war featured in the programme of moral <b>rejuvenation</b> promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea was the idea of prisoners of war as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to redeem France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940.|$|E

Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when he discovered the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning the planet in the process). Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave. Picard states the <b>rejuvenation</b> benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the Prime Directive.

5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the <b>rejuvenation</b> powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was no different, with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a <b>rejuvenation</b> of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E

5|$|In state {{legislative}} assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK {{was returned to}} power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis. On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for <b>Rejuvenation</b> and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, {{as well as for}} the restoration of water bodies and tanks.

25|$|<b>Rejuvenation</b> is {{distinct}} from life extension. Life extension strategies often study the causes of aging and try to oppose those causes in order to slow aging. <b>Rejuvenation</b> is the reversal of aging and thus requires a different strategy, namely repair of the damage {{that is associated with}} aging or replacement of damaged tissue with new tissue. <b>Rejuvenation</b> can be a means of life extension, but most life extension strategies do not involve <b>rejuvenation.</b>|$|E

30|$|In the {{previous}} section, we omitted {{the analysis of}} availability (A). When not considering <b>rejuvenations,</b> A can be deduced by integrating the reliability (R) across time and normalizing the result to the MT (see (19) in the Appendix). Both R and A increase with <b>rejuvenations,</b> because it becomes more difficult for an attack to succeed in surpassing the intrusion tolerance thresholdf. However, with <b>rejuvenations</b> A has the extra benefit of accounting also the moments of correctness obtained after a first global failure. Thus, A is positive even for an infinite mission time (MT). This is pertinent whenever global failure is not considered as a catastrophic event and the re-establishment of service is considered worthy. The focus of A {{is not on the}} first global failure (probability of never failing), but instead on the accumulated delivery of service (probability of not being failed at a random instant).|$|R
30|$|We {{have seen}} how to go from Fig.  8 to Fig.  9 a. Following the same logic, we can simplify the {{analysis}} of sequential-rejuvenating systems with non-instantaneous <b>rejuvenations</b> (i.e., with k> 0) for other values of n. To simplify, we shall look instead to the system with n′=n−k nodes and k′= 0 offline nodes at any time (and consequently with instantaneous <b>rejuvenations).</b> In {{the remainder of this}} section, we shall compare different 〈n,f,k〉 systems, the biggest of which being 〈 4, 1, 1 〉 (i.e., n= 2 f+k+ 1, with f= 1 and k= 1) and 〈 5, 1, 1 〉 (i.e., n= 3 f+k+ 1, with f= 1 and k= 1). Their respective equivalent diagrams are depicted in Fig.  9 b (n= 3 and k= 0) and Fig.  9 c (n= 4 and k= 0).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Seventeen {{patients}} averaging 51 {{years of}} age underwent 23 surgical procedures, including suture suspension for both midface and neck <b>rejuvenations.</b> A 3 / 0 polypropylene thread with bioabsorbable cones with multiple point fixations in addition to 2 0. 5 -cm polypropylene surgical mesh are used in this technique. The mean postoperative, follow-up time was 9 months. Of the 17 patients, 12 underwent this procedure for midface <b>rejuvenations,</b> 3 for facial palsy, 5 for neck aesthetic procedures, 2 for brow ptosis, and 1 for brow asymmetry. The average number of sutures used for each face was 4 and 2 were used for each neck. The authors present an anatomic study for the safe placement of sutures, the surgical technique, and a microscopic photo documentation of the fibrosis around the suture knot and cone.

30|$|The diagram in Fig.  1 b, {{which is}} {{actually}} a sub-diagram of the one in Fig.  1 a, naturally suits the representation of a particular choice of sequential attack, if one considers that: each position of inner triangle (inside a circle) represents a particular node; and each arrow has an associated constant IR (λ). Actually, while not considering <b>rejuvenations,</b> all paths of sequential attack leading to failure are equally efficient, i.e., the ordering in which nodes are attacked is irrelevant. With some flexibility (and this will be important when interpreting more complex diagrams {{in the remainder of}} the paper), this diagram can also be interpreted as representing a parallel attack model, if: the (i+ 1)th leftmost circle stands for all possible states containing exactly i intruded nodes (see Fig.  1 a); and the respective outbound arrow of each circle stands for (3 −i) possible transitions from each imagined source state to the respective possible (3 −i) destination states. In particular, each of the middle circles ((I, H, H) and (I, H, I)) in Fig.  1 b would represent 3 possible states (the circles in the respective column in Fig.  1 a), and each of the lateral circles ((H, H, H) and (I, I, I)) in Fig.  1 b would represent a single state (equivalent in Fig.  1 a). Later in the paper (see Section  4), we shall augment these types of diagrams to include also the effect of <b>rejuvenations.</b>|$|R

However, the gentrification of both cities has led to older tenants of shophouses driven out by the rising costs of renting or buying properties within historical districts.
