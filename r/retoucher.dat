40|$|International audienceRetouchers are {{fragments}} of bone {{used during the}} Paleolithic to strike stone flakes in order to transform them into retouched tools. Our experiments show that the mark produced on <b>retouchers</b> differs depending on whether {{they were used to}} strike flint or quartzite. Our results suggest that numerous pits, most often with an ovoid form, characterize the retouching of quartzite flakes. Most of the scores produced with this material have a sinuous morphology with rough interior faces. The areas with superposed traces have a pitted appearance. On the other hand, the retouching of flint flakes, produces pits that are most often triangular in form. Most of the scores have a rectilinear morphology with smooth interior faces and their superposition results in the formation of hatch marks. There is also a relationship between the characteristics of the mark and the relative state of freshness of the <b>retouchers.</b> The validity of the criteria identified was confirmed by a blind test. These diagnostic criteria were applied to archaeological <b>retouchers</b> from the Mousterian site of Noisetier Cave. The results obtained improve our knowledge of the technical behaviors of Neanderthals and allow us to address questions concerning their techno-economic implications...|$|R

These photographers have got a trick now, if your face is one of the long kind, of raising the camera, bending your head forward, and firing down at you. So our Minnie becomes quite chubby again. Then, this thing has been retouched." [...] My uncle peered into the photograph. [...] "It seems to me it is pretty nearly all retouching. For instance, {{if you look at the}} eye, that high light is not {{perfectly}} even; that was touched in on the negative with a pencil. Then about the neck of our Minnie I have observed certain bones, just the slightest indication of her collar-bone, George, but that has disappeared under the retoucher's pencil. Then the infantile smoothness of her cheek, and the beautifully-rounded outline, is produced by the <b>retoucher</b> carefully scraping off the surface of the film where the cheekbone projected with a sharp knife. There are also in real life little lines between the corner of our Minnie's mouth and her nostril. And again, Minnie is one of those people whose dresses never seem to fit, but this fits like a glove. These retouchers are like Midas, and they turn all that comes to their hands to gold; or, like Spring, the flowers come back at their approach. They reverse the work of Ithuriel, and restore brightness to the fallen. They sit at their little desks, and scratch, scratch, scratch with those delicate pencils of theirs, scratching away age, scratching away care, making the crooked straight, and the rough smooth. They are the fairies of photography, and fill our albums with winsome changelings. Their ministry anticipates in a little way the angels who will take us when we die, releasing us from the worn and haggard body of this death, and showing something of the eternal life and youth that glows within. Or one might say that the spirit of the <b>retoucher</b> is the spirit of Love. It makes plain women beautiful, and common men heroic.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} Prehistory {{is to understand}} the mechanisms involved in the behavioural evolution of human groups. The degree of technological and cultural development of prehistoric groups is assessed mainly through stone tools. However, other elements can provide valuable information as well. This paper presents two bone <b>retouchers</b> dated to the Middle Pleistocene MIS 9 used for the shaping of lithic artefacts. Originating from Bolomor Cave (Spain) and Qesem Cave (Israel), these two bone <b>retouchers</b> are among the earliest of the Old World. Although the emergence of such tools might {{be found in the}} latest phases of the Acheulean, their widespread use seems to coincide with independently emergent post-Acheulean cultural complexes {{at both ends of the}} Mediterranean Sea: the post-Acheulean/pre-Mousterian of Western Europe and the Acheulo Yabrudian Cultural Complex of the Levant.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{analysis}} of three human cranial fragments from a Mousterian context {{at the site of}} La Quina (France), which show anthropogenic surface modifications. Macroscopic and microscopic analyses, including SEM observation, demonstrate that the modifications visible on one of these fragments are similar to those produced on bone fragments used experimentally to retouch flakes. The microscopic analysis also identified ancient scraping marks, possibly resulting from the cleaning of the skull prior to its breakage and utilisation of a resulting fragment as a tool. The traces of utilisation and the dimensions of this object are compared to those on a sample of 67 bone <b>retouchers</b> found in the same excavation area and layer. Results show that the tool size, as well as the dimensions and location of the utilised area, fall well within the range of variation observed on faunal shaft fragments from La Quina that were used as <b>retouchers.</b> This skull fragment represents the earliest known use of human bone as a raw material and the first reported use of human bone for this purpose by hominins other than modern humans. The two other skull fragments, which probably come from the same individual, also bear anthropogenic surface modifications in the form of percussion, cut, and scraping marks. The deliberate versus unintentional hypotheses for the unusual choice of the bone are presented in light of contextual information, modifications identified on the two skull fragments not used as tools, and data on bone <b>retouchers</b> from the same layer, the same site, and other Mousterian sites...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{retouching}} tools made on hard animal materials has a broad chronological {{and geographical}} distribution throughout the Palaeolithic period in Europe. The earliest evidences of such tools {{are found in}} the Late Mousterian culture. In Italy, the analysis on <b>retouchers</b> are not particularly numerous. The present work aims to present the preliminary results obtained from the study of 78 <b>retouchers</b> recovered from two settlements located in northern Italy (Riparo Tagliente and Grotta della Ghiacciaia, Verona). Results from the site of Riparo Tagliente are statistically significant. They provide both qualitative and quantitative data as the sample is more abundant and spans several occupation levels with a great variability of traces on the cortical surfaces of these bone tools. The site of Grotta della Ghiacciaia yields only qualitative data because of a small sample size. Overall, the samples analyzed are mostly made on bone shafts of medium to large sized mammals, especially red deer and cervids, which were the most commonly hunted animals but also on small sized mammals such as roe deer. This variability can contribute to the identification of such tools and to better define a methodology for their analysis...|$|R

40|$|Beginning with {{excavations}} {{during the}} 1970 s, Vindija Cave (Croatia) has yielded significant Middle and Upper Paleolithic fossil and archaeological finds. We report on seven recently identified hominid fossils, a newly associated partial hominid cranial vault from level G 3, nine possible bone <b>retouchers,</b> and a revised {{interpretation of the}} Mousterian artifact assemblage from the site. This new information reinforces {{our knowledge of the}} complex biocultural phenomena revealed in unit G and earlier deposits at Vindija. Six of the new hominid fossils derive from stratigraphic units G and I, while one lacks exact provenience. All specimens preserving diagnostic anatomy are from Neandertals. One of the postcranial remains, a radius fragment which exhibits Neandertal-like anatomy, comes from level G 1 and is congruent with the previously established association of Neandertals with an early Upper Paleolithic industry at the site. The partial cranial vault represents the most complete Neandertal from Vindija. The possible <b>retouchers</b> derive from unit G. Our analysis of these artifacts suggests that both percussion and pressure techniques may have been used by Neandertals in the final stage of tool production (retouching). This paper also presents a revision of the artifact analysis for late Mousterian level G 3. We separated raw materials into two main groups due to the differing ways that the materials fracture and the differing morphology of the debitage.

By then CEL had a large back order for scanners from rotogravure printers in Europe and the US. Colour scanners became the biggest money earner for the company and Crosfield continued their development, launching the Diascan, an improved and cheaper model in 1965 and the enlarging Magnascan in 1969. This machine scanned a colour slide and had all the equipment and software necessary to adjust the size, form, colour and hue to get the desired result for the publisher.

40|$|Hard osseus <b>retouchers</b> {{have been}} ever more {{accurately}} studied {{and it appears}} that they are very diffused; their role in the shaping of lithic tools is now well known. In North Italia, they are abundant in final Middle and Early Upper Palaeolithic. In order to pinpoint the possible cultural discrepancies in using these artefacts, this study mostly relies on a qualitative stratigraphical comparison within the Fumane Cave (VR) sequency, where over 370 elements from four different techno-complexes were discovered (Discoid, Levallois, Uluzzian and Aurignacian). The faunal spectra of the <b>retouchers</b> present an important homogeneity as far as the species (mostly red deer) and the anatomical segments (femurs and tibias) are concerned. However, the Aurignacian layers have a bigger amount of medium game, such as ibex, chamois and roe deer, which follows the general trend at Fumane. Archaeozoological studies in fact show that a shift occurs between the end of the Middle Palaeolithic, when cervids are predominant {{and the beginning of the}} Upper Palaeolithic, where bovids are more frequent (Fiore et al. 2004; Gurioli et al. 2005; Romandini et al. in press; Tagliacozzo et al. in press). The taphonomical analysis seems to attest some degree of systematic selection of the diaphysis. Four kind of stigmata have been identified: punctiform and streteched impressions, strias and notches. They are usually located in small superficies, with up to three areas on the same shape. We noticed generally wide technical similarities, but some differences were observed, such as a difference in the intensity and the utilisation modalities. Indeed, the important changes in the lithic technologies (from Late Mousterian to Aurignacian) does not seem to alter the frequency nor the function of this little elaborated tool...|$|R
