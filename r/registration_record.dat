5000|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{thought to have}} been made in September or October 1905, based on the angles of shadows showing the sun's position. Film historian David Kiehn noticed that there were puddles of water seen in the street, and after he examined contemporary newspapers and weather reports, he realized that the early estimates were wrong: no rain had fallen in those months. Kiehn located the February 1906 <b>registration</b> <b>record</b> for a car license plate recorded in the film, and he found that the sun's angle would be the same in March as it had been in September. In 2009 Kiehn suggested that A Trip Down Market Street was filmed in late March or early April 1906, a period with many rainy days reported. He found an advertisement for the film published in the New York Clipper on April 28, 1906, which stated that the film had been shot [...] "just one week before the complete destruction of every building shown in the picture," [...] though this was a somewhat hyperbolic claim given that a number of buildings seen in the film were heavily damaged and later repaired. If the [...] "one week" [...] statement was correct then the film would have been shot on April 11. Kiehn also found a San Francisco newspaper article published on March 29, 1906, describing the Miles Brothers' intent to film aboard a cable car. In October 2010, Kiehn was featured in a 60 Minutes segment discussing the historiography of the film, especially the problem of dating it. In 2011, Richard Greene, an engineer with Bio-Rad Laboratories, published research dating the film to March 24-30, 1906, based on the sun throwing well-defined shadows on the Ferry Building. Greene confirmed that the film was shot at about 3:17 in the afternoon, based on the Ferry Building clock. Greene notes that his calculated date range is consistent with Kiehn's findings, but not consistent with the date of April 14 which was published in 2011 by the Internet Movie Database without a supporting cite. He also notes that his date range is about three weeks prior to the earthquake, inconsistent with the [...] "one week" [...] claim in the New York Clipper advertisement.|$|E

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the master's thesis, an overview of the set up of the buildings cadastere and real estate land register in Slovenia is given. The overall view of the activities in the set-up field of these two registers is followed by the presentation of the actual data model of the real estate register (REN). The thesis especially emphasises the analysis of the data model REN and the studies of the data needed for individual models of mass assessment of general market value of real estate. The manner of data changes in REN is presented in more detail. The steps of value calculations are described for the chosen models of mass assessment i. e. apartments, houses, premises and offices and the equations used to calculate the general market value are given. The practical part of the thesis contains the description of the data model REN including the graphic presentation of the connections between the individual dependent tables of the data collection. Study examples have been chosen to show examples of mistakes in REN. Data changes with the study report (for cadastre <b>registration</b> <b>record)</b> are presented for the chosen examples accompanied by the simplified manner of <b>registration</b> <b>record.</b> In the conclusion, the findings on the imperfection of the data collection REN are given together with suggestions how {{to improve the quality of}} real estate data...|$|E
