After undergoing acceptance trails the first entered service in September 1972 with the last delivered in May 1973. Originally intended for use hauling coal services in the Hunter Valley, they were allocated to Bathurst to operate services in the state's west from Lithgow to Euabalong West, Bourke and Cootamundra and all branches in between.

50|$|A large {{proportion}} of the high development cost was due to the Mondeo being a completely new design, sharing very little, if anything, with the Ford Sierra. Unlike the Sierra, the Mondeo is front-wheel drive in its most common form, with a rarer four-wheel drive version available on the Mk I car only. Over optimistically the floor pan was designed to accept virtually any conceivable drivetrain, from a transverse four to a longitudinal V-8. This resulted in a hugely obtrusive and mostly disused bellhousing cover and transmission tunnel. The resulting interior front of the car, especially the footwells, feel far more cramped than would be expected from a vehicle of this size. The Mondeo featured new manual and automatic transmissions and sophisticated suspension design, which give it class-leading handling and <b>ride</b> <b>qualities,</b> and subframes front and rear to give it executive car refinement. The automatic transmission featured electronic control with sport and economy modes plus switchable overdrive. The program manager from 1988, and throughout its early development, was David Price.|$|E
5000|$|Benchmarked {{against the}} Mercedes E-class, CAR rated it as {{superior}} in 1991. When {{compared to the}} BMW 5-series the same journal considered it both inferior and superior. By 1994, the XM {{was described as a}} car that “deals less smoothly with surface abrasions”. Motoring magazine programme Top Gear, reviewing the [...] "high speed hold-all" [...] market, compared the XM estate with the Audi 100 in 1991 (Season 14, episode 16). The presenter reported Citroëns claim that its XM had the worlds largest estate loading bay and went on to say: [...] "with this high rear window line you have truly a vast volume of space hidden from prying eyes." [...] The load capacity of the boot was cited as 25 cubic feet with the load bay tonneau removed, helped by a [...] "low sill and a spare tyre you get at from underneath." [...] The Audi 100 had less concealed load space, a flimsy cover and less load space overall. The Audis maximum capacity was 44 cubic feet versus the Citroëns 69 cubic feet. On driving quality, the XM [...] "is acknowledged to have one of the finest <b>ride</b> <b>qualities</b> {{in the world and the}} estate version is just as good." [...] But the minor controls were said to be [...] "intimidating" [...] and the high rear window line was criticized for its effect on outward visibility. [...] "Behind the helm the XM shows itself to be a disarmingly fine car," [...] reported the presenter. [...] "Its poised magic carpet ride and velvetty drive train make for gentle and unruffled progress." [...] At autobahn speed the car was said to be able [...] "to soak up every pimple and declivity without so much as a solitary thud."

40|$|State {{variable}} {{techniques are}} utilized {{to generate the}} RMS vertical load factors for the B- 52 H and B- 1 bombers at low level, mission critical, cruise conditions. A <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> index is proposed to provide meaningful comparisons between different controls or conditions. <b>Ride</b> <b>quality</b> is shown to be relatively invariant under various popular control laws. Handling quality variations are shown to be major contributors to <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> variations on both vehicles. Relaxed static stability is artificially implemented on the study vehicles to investigate its effects on <b>ride</b> <b>quality.</b> The B- 52 H <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> is generally degraded when handling characteristics are automatically restored by a feedback control to the original values from relaxed stability conditions.

50|$|Initially, {{items that}} were subject to the most abuse from racing {{were the first to}} be remade. Originally made of die cast aluminum, the clutch basket was found to be weak when power was {{increased}} or subjected to race conditions. The first aftermarket clutch basket was a machined steel piece campaigned by Gary Denton in 1989.3 Wayne Hinson, who would later found worldwide clutch component manufacturer Hinson Racing, designed the clutch basket and later changed it to billet aluminum in 1991.3 A regular trend that started on the Fourtrax that would not carry over to the four strokes was the use of aftermarket frames. Stock frames on most mass-produced quads are made of mild steel and, though suitable for recreational use, will quickly develop cracks when raced. Without new quads available after the 1989 model year, stronger replacement frames for racing were soon needed. The first aftermarket frame for the 250R was made by dirt track motorcycle chassis builder, C&J in 1991 for CT Racing.3 This frame was a direct replacement for the original, maintaining stock suspension geometry. The first altered geometry frame was introduced by JP Racing a short while later. 3 This design brought the front suspension mounts in one inch on each side, allowing the use of longer suspension arms in competition, which increased wheel travel and improved the <b>ride</b> <b>qualities.</b> By 2003, a myriad of aftermarket frames could be had from numerous manufacturers in both stock and altered geometry, made of steel and aluminum. Lone Star Racing produced a titanium frame, but AMA rules prevented its use in competition. Though Honda was initially concerned with reliability and detuned the original 250cc motor, with the release of the Pro-X (pro-cross) cylinder and head in 1994, the 250R’s displacement could be increased well into the 300cc range by changing the cylinder alone. Additionally, this and other aftermarket cylinders offered advanced port layout for more tuning options. With modifications to the transmission cases, later aftermarket cylinders and crankshafts permitted engine displacements to reach 500cc’s. The last version of the Pro-X cylinder, as well as others, also added an exhaust operated powervalve, a feature that was left off the 250R but used almost universally by the competition, as well as in Two-Stroke motocross bikes since the mid-eighties.|$|E

The <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> meter provides estimates of passenger ride discomfort as a function of cabin noise and vibration (acceleration) in five axes (yaw axis omitted). According to the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> meter, in smooth air the cabin noise was the dominant source of passenger discomfort, but the total discomfort was approximately the same as that for the smooth-air condition. The researcher's subjective opinion, however, is that the total ride discomfort was much worse in the moderate turbulence {{than it was in the}} smooth air. The discrepancy is explained by the lack of measurement of the low-frequency accelerations by the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> meter...|$|R

The attitude-command control system also improved the <b>ride</b> <b>qualities</b> of the airplane. A rate-command control system was less beneficial than an attitude-command control system. Although this paper deals primarily with general aviation aircraft, the results presented pertain to other types of aircraft. Short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) aircraft would be a natural application of the control systems because, {{as a result of their}} low speeds, they encounter many of the handling-qualities problems noted on light aircraft.

40|$|When {{introducing}} autonomous functionality {{in personal}} vehicles {{the ability to}} control the <b>quality</b> of the <b>ride</b> is transferred from the driver to the vehicle control system. In this context, a reference method for quantifying <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> may be a useful tool in the development and tuning process. This master’s thesis investigates whether general quantitative measures of <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> can be of value in the tuning of motion controllers for autonomous vehicles. A set of tools is built for a specific case study, analysing a lateral path planning algorithm, based on a finite horizon linear quadratic tracking controller, and how its tuning affects <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance. A graphical user interface is built, with functionality for frequency domainanalysis of the path planning algorithm, individually and in combination with the remaining lateral control system, as well as <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation based on lateral acceleration data, from logged test runs and simulation results. In addition, a simulation environment for the lateral control system is modified to be used in combination with the evaluation tool. Results of the case study indicate a measurable difference in <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance when comparing manual and autonomous driving with the current implementation. Attempts were made to improve <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> by re-tuning the path planning algorithm but little or no improvement from the previous tuning was made. The work has recognized the potential of using <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> measures in the development and tuning process for autonomous vehicles as well as devising a tuning strategy incorporating frequency analysis and <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation through simulation for the lateral control system. To further increase <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> performance via the path planning algorithm an altered controller structure, such as a frequency weighted linear quadratic controller is suggested...|$|R

The paper discusses needs and drivers influencing freight transport costs, vehicle-pavement interaction concepts, and the potential physical effects and costs from roads with deteriorating <b>riding</b> <b>quality.</b> A case study is presented analysing vehicle-pavement interaction for selected roadways in California. It is concluded that investments in pavement and freight transport industry improvements can be investigated by applying vehicle-pavement interaction analysis to evaluate damage to pavement, vehicle and freight that would result from alternative levels of pavement <b>riding</b> <b>quality.</b> The paper recommends that existing concepts, tools and resources such as dedicated truck lanes and vehicle-pavement interaction analysis can help to improve the freight transport system.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of magnetically levitated (maglev) ground transportation systems has important consequences {{for safety and}} <b>ride</b> <b>quality,</b> guideway design, and system costs. <b>Ride</b> <b>quality</b> is determined by vehicle response and by environmental factors such as humidity and noise. The dynamic {{response of}} the vehicles is the key element in determining <b>ride</b> <b>quality,</b> while vehicle stability is an important safety-related element.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a summary index of a rutted profile for the estimation of <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> of road vehicles in a rutted road. First, the spatial frequency analysis of the rutted profiles by the continuous wavelet transform is conducted to comprehend the wavy characteristics of the profiles associated with the vehicle motion caused by the lane-change maneuver in the rutting. The result shows that the wavy characteristics in the wavelength of 0. 4 m affect the vehicle dynamics with respect to the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> deterioration. Second, a difference filter is designed to detect the wavelength of 0. 4 m from a rutted profile. The filtering manipulation enhances the wavy characteristics of the profile corresponding to the <b>ride</b> <b>quality</b> of the vehicle.
