2500|$|Newfoundland Irish Catholics, {{mainly from}} the {{southeast}} of Ireland, settled in the cities (mainly St. John's {{and parts of the}} surrounding Avalon Peninsula), while British Protestants, {{mainly from the}} West Country, settled in small fishing communities. Over time, the Irish Catholics became wealthier than their Protestant neighbours, which gave incentive for Protestant Newfoundlanders to join the Orange Order. In 1903, Sir William Coaker founded the Fisherman's Protective Union in an Orange Hall in Herring Neck. Furthermore, during the term of Commission of Government (1934–1949), the Orange Lodge was {{one of only a handful}} of [...] "democratic" [...] organizations that existed in the Dominion of Newfoundland. In 1948, a referendum was held in Newfoundland as to its political future; the Irish Catholics mainly supported a return to independence for Newfoundland as it existed before 1934, while the Protestants mainly supported joining the Canadian Confederation. Newfoundland then joined Canada by a 52-48% margin, and with an influx of Protestants into St. John's after the closure of the east coast cod fishery in the 1990s, the main issues have become one of <b>Rural</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>Urban</b> interests rather than anything ethnic or religious.|$|E

Overall, family socioeconomic status played an important role in determining the educational outcomes of rural students.

40|$|Background Scaling up {{innovative}} healthcare programs {{offers a}} means to improve access, quality, and health equity across multiple health areas. Despite large numbers of promising projects, {{little is known about}} successful efforts to scale up. This study examines trans-national scale, whereby a program operates in two or more countries. Trans-national scale is a distinct measure that reflects opportunities to replicate healthcare programs in multiple countries, thereby providing services to broader populations. Methods Based on the Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) database of nearly 1200 health programs, the study contrasts 116 programs that have achieved trans-national scale with 1, 068 single-country programs. Data was collected on the programs' health focus, service activity, legal status, and funding sources, as well as the programs' locations (<b>rural</b> <b>v.</b> <b>urban</b> emphasis), and founding year; differences are reported with statistical significance. Findings This analysis examines 116 programs that have achieved trans-national scale (TNS) across multiple disease areas and activity types. Compared to 1, 068 single-country programs, we find that trans-nationally scaled programs are more donor-reliant; more likely to focus on targeted health needs such as HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, or family planning rather than provide more comprehensive general care; and {{more likely to engage in}} activities that support healthcare services rather than provide direct clinical care. Conclusion This work, based on a large data set of health programs, reports on trans-national scale with comparison to single-country programs. The work is a step towards understanding when programs are able to replicate their services as they attempt to expand health services for the poor across countries and health areas. A subset of these programs should be the subject of case studies to understand factors that affect the scaling process, particularly seeking to identify mechanisms that lead to improved health outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Socioeconomic {{factors can}} have {{profound}} effects onthe health {{of individuals and}} populations, and theperinatal domain is particularly susceptible to such influences. The principal pathways by which socioeconomic status affects perinatal health include those that operate through lifestyle and behavioural factors: a large fraction of socioeconomic differences in adverse perinatal outcomes can be explained {{on the basis of}} factors such as maternal age, 1, 2 smoking, 3, 4 marital status, 5, 6 alcohol consumption, 7 obesity, 8, 9 residence (<b>rural</b> <b>v.</b> <b>urban),</b> 10 education, 7, 11 weight gain, 12 early prenatal care, 13 prenatal class attendance, parity and breast-feeding. 7 Differential access to good-quality obstetric services and neonatal care is another main reason for socioeconomic dis-parities in perinatal health. We have previously shown that the system of health care prevalent in Canada provides obstet-ric, neonatal and related health care services to women re-gardless of their socioeconomic status. 14 In fact, we found that rates of labour induction and cesarean delivery were higher among women from lower income families than among those from higher income families, after controlling for lifestyle and behavioural factors. 14 More generally, {{it has been shown that}} the introduction of universal access to es-sential health services in Canada in 196815 led to a decline in regional disparities in infant mortality, whereas such dispari-ties have tended to increase globally. 16 We carried out a population-based study to quantify the ef-fects of socioeconomic factors (e. g., family income) on peri-natal and infant outcomes in a setting where obstetric, neonatal and related health care services are widely available and provided with no out-of-pocket payments. Whereas other studies have examined this question previously using eco-logic measures such as neighbourhood income, 17 – 19 we used highly reliable individual-level information on family income and related measures of socioeconomic status.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{impact of}} {{geographic}} isolation on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) {{care in the}} United States is unknown. It has been postulated but not proven that rural patients have less access to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), vascular surgeons, and high-volume treatment centers than their urban counterparts, resulting in inferior AAA care. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the national experience for treatment of intact AAA for patients living in rural areas or towns with those living in urban areas. MethodsPatients who underwent intact AAA repair in 2005 to 2006 were identified from a standard 5 % random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries. Data on patient demographics, comorbidities, type of repair, and specialty of operating surgeon were collected. Hospitals were stratified into quintiles by yearly AAA volume. Primary outcomes included 30 -day mortality and rehospitalization. ResultsA total of 2616 patients had repair for intact AAA (40 % open, 60 % EVAR). Patients from rural and urban areas were equally likely to receive EVAR (<b>rural</b> 60 % <b>vs</b> <b>urban</b> 61 %; P =. 99) and be treated by a vascular surgeon (<b>rural</b> 48 % <b>vs</b> <b>urban</b> 50 %; P =. 82). Most rural patients (86 %) received care in urban centers. Primary outcomes occurred in 11. 6 % of rural patients (1. 3 % 30 -day mortality; 10. 3 % rehospitalization) vs 16. 0 % of urban patients (3 % 30 -day mortality, 13 % rehospitalization; P =. 04). In multivariate analyses, rural residence was independently associated with treatment at high-volume centers (odds ratio, 1. 64; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 - 2. 01; P <. 0001) and decreased death or rehospitalization (odds ratio, 0. 69; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 49 - 0. 97; P =. 03). ConclusionsDespite geographic isolation, patients in rural areas needing treatment for intact AAAs have equivalent access to EVAR and vascular surgeons, increased referral to high-volume hospitals, and improved outcomes after repair. This suggests that urban patients may be disadvantaged even with nearby access to high-quality centers. This study supports the need for criteria that define centers of excellence to extend the benefit of regionalization to all patients...|$|R

In this quality assurance study, we sought to compare rural and urban care by prehospital EMS evaluation/management indicators from patients assessed at an urban Canadian stroke center. Materials and Methods: One hundred adult patients {{were randomly selected from}} the stroke registry. Patients were transported through Rural EMS bypass protocols or urban EMS protocols (both bypass and direct) to our stroke center between January and December 2013. Patients were excluded if they were first evaluated at any other health center. Prehospital care was assessed using ten indicators for EMS evaluation/management, as recommended by acute stroke guidelines. Results: Compliance with acute stroke EMS evaluation/management indicators were statistically similar for both groups, except administrating a prehospital diagnostic tool (<b>rural</b> 31. 8 <b>vs.</b> <b>urban</b> 70. 3 %; P = 0. 002). Unlike urban EMS, rural EMS did not routinely document scene time. Conclusion: Rural EMS responders' compliance to prehospital stroke evaluation/management was similar to urban EMS responders. Growth areas for both groups may be with prehospital stroke diagnostic tool utilization, whereas rural EMS responders may also improve with scene time documentation...|$|R

40|$|Globally, rural {{to urban}} {{migration}} {{is accompanied by}} changes in dietary patterns and lifestyle that have serious health implications, including development of low bone mass. We hypothesized that serum 25 (OH) vitamin D 3 (25 [OH]D 3) levels will be lower, bone turnover higher, and nutrition inadequate in urban postmenopausal black women, increasing risk for low bone mass. We aimed to assess the prevalence of risk factors for low bone mass in 1261 black women from rural and urban areas in the North West Province of South Africa (Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology–South Africa project). Fasting blood samples were taken; and participants were interviewed to complete questionnaires on self-reported diseases, fractures, and dietary intakes. Bone health markers were assessed in a subgroup of 658 women older than 45 years. Specific lifestyle risk factors identified were inactivity, smoking, injectable progestin contraception use, and high alcohol consumption. Dietary risk factors identified were low calcium and high animal protein, phosphorous, and sodium intakes. The 25 (OH) D 3 and C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) levels were significantly higher in the <b>rural</b> <b>vs</b> the <b>urban</b> women older than 50 years. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increased with age in both groups. The 25 (OH) D levels were inversely correlated with CTX and PTH in rural women. In urban women, PTH and CTX were correlated while dietary calcium was inversely correlated with CTX and PTH with 25 (OH) D 3. The combination of low dietary calcium (< 230 mg/d), marginally insufficient 25 (OH) D 3 status, and raised PTH may result in increased bone resorption.

The contents of free forms of six B-vitamins in these human milk samples were analyzed by using UPLC-MS/MS. The median concentrations of free form of 6 B-vitamins in colostrums, transitional milk, 15 - 180 d mature milk and 181 - 330 d mature milk were respectively as follows: thiamin 5. 0 µg/L, 6. 7 µg/L, 21. 1 µg/L and 40. 7 µg/L; riboflavin 29. 3 µg/L, 40. 6 µg/L, 33. 6 µg/L and 29. 6 µg/L; niacin 470. 7 µg/L, 661. 3 µg/L, 687. 0 µg/L and 571. 3 µg/L; vitamin B- 6 4. 6 µg/L, 16. 1 µg/L, 62. 7 µg/L and 80. 7 µg/L; flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) 808. 7 µg/L, 1162. 8 µg/L, 1023. 9 µg/L and 1057. 2 µg/L; pantothenic acid 1770. 9 µg/L, 2626. 8 µg/L, 2213. 0 µg/L and 1895. 5 µg/L.

40|$|Introduction Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is a {{rare and}} potentially severe connective tissue disease, characterized by skin fibrosis and involvement of internal organs. Because of its rarity and heterogeneous clinical presentation, reliable epidemiological studies on SSc have been particularly difficult to carry out. Objectives The {{purpose of this study}} was to present SSc epidemiology among hospitalized patients in Poland. Material and Methods The analysis was based on population-based administrative data, taken from a Polish hospital morbidity study carried out by the National Institute of Public Health between January 2008 – December 2012. Results Analyzed data covered 9, 049 hospitalization records. The final sample comprised 3, 653 patients with first-time hospitalizations for SSc. The average age of the sample was 53 years (SD 16. 2; range 0 – 91 years); 84 % of patients were female and 16 % male. Based on hospitalization registers, the average SSc incidence was estimated to be 1. 9 / 100, 000 per year and peak age of incidence was 55 years. The point prevalence was estimated to be 9. 4 / 100, 000 at the end of 2012. SSc was more common in females, with F:M ratio ranging from 6. 2 : 1 – 4. 6 : 1 depending on the year. Analysis of hospitalization trends revealed that overall numbers of SSc hospitalizations increased, while first-time hospitalizations decreased between 2008 – 2012. Clusters of higher incidence were observed in more <b>rural</b> regions <b>vs.</b> <b>urban</b> regions. Conclusions Estimated incidence of SSc in Poland was comparable to reported incidence in other European countries.

There was no influence of ethnicity, marital status, transportation availability, <b>rural</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>urban</b> residence, distance of residence from clinic, or prior prenatal care on the timing of women's first access to prenatal care. A woman's first prenatal visit was associated with self-referral to care, more prenatal care advocates, and fewer children.

In this paper, I have analyzed five songs from the country subgenre of honky-tonk in terms of lyrical content, style, and sound in an effort to show how the <b>rural</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>urban</b> dichotomy is constructed and also how it has evolved in light of shifting socio-cultural influences and changes brought by modernity.

Counter to earlier academic explorations of country music that only investigated non-musical elements such as lyrics and audience demographics, I integrate musical analysis into my approach to better understand how particular sounds and styles contribute to reinforcing and interacting with not only lyrical content, but also artistic individualism and country???s core concerns, particularly divisions between the rural and urban...|$|E
