Here, she participated in extensive training operations with Scharnhorst and the heavy cruiser , which lasted {{until the middle of}} the year. In early September, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and ten destroyers bombarded the island of Spitzbergen, which served as a British <b>refuelling</b> <b>station.</b> The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned safely to Altenfjord; {{this was the first time}} Tirpitz fired her main guns in anger. On 22–23 September, six British midget submarines attacked Tirpitz while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive charges against the battleship's hull, which did serious damage. Tirpitz had been successfully neutralised. Over the next six months, a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.|$|E

50|$|The HyNor-project {{started out}} as a {{hydrogen}} highway-project in Norway. It was initiated by large industrial actors such as Statoil and Norsk Hydro in 2003 with the goal of a market-realistic demonstration of hydrogen <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations,</b> as well as hydrogen vehicles. Several hydrogen <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> were built along the 580 km route from Oslo to Stavanger. Norway's first hydrogen fueling station was opened in 2006 near Stavanger, the second in Porsgrunn in 2007, and two stations were opened in Oslo and Lier in 2009.

40|$|International audienceThe {{planning}} of a hydrogen infrastructure with production facilities, distribution chains, and <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> {{is a hard}} task. Difficulties may rise essentially {{in the choice of}} the optimal configurations. An innovative design of hydrogen network has been proposed in this paper. It consists of a network of green hydrogen <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> (GHRSs) and several production nodes. The proposed model has been formulated as a mathematical programming, where the main decisions are the selection of GHRSs that are powered by the production nodes based on distance and population density criteria, as well the energy and hydrogen flows exchanged among the system components from the production nodes to the demand points. The approaches and methodologies developed can be taken as a support to decision makers, stakeholders and local authorities in the implementation of new hydrogen infrastructures. Optimal configurations have been reported taking into account the presence of an additional hydrogen industrial market demand and a connection with the electrical network. The main challenge that has been treated within the paper is the technical feasibility of the hydrogen supply chain, that is mainly driven by uncertain, but clean solar and wind energy resources. Using a Northern Italian case study, the clean hydrogen produced can be technically considered feasible to supply a network of hydrogen <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations.</b> Results show that the demands are satisfied for each time period and for the market penetration scenarios adopte...|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} aspect of supply chain management is the maintenance of an efficient and costeffective system for the distribution of goods or products to retailing outlets. Nowadays, it is almost inevitable that an efficient distribution network can only be achieved {{with the support of}} computer based optimization software. We show in this paper how an evolutionary algorithm (EA) can play an effective role in this aspect. Besides being an effective and efficient optimization tool capable of handling problems of significant computational complexity, it enjoys great flexibility in coping with the constraints of typical real-life supply chain problems. Our work considers the problem of managing a distribution network for replenishing the supply of fuel to <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> located all over the island. It is designed to generate a set of routes for a fleet of fuel trucks. The trucks are dispatched according to a pre-specified plan to replenish the supply of the various <b>refuelling</b> <b>stations</b> subject to several dynamic constraints. Our solution methodology is an EA capable of generating approximate solutions with reasonable computational time...|$|R
