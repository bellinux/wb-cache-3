This navigation computer information system, which complies with {{the rules of the}} International Maritime Organization (IMO) and NATO STANAG 4564 (Standard Agreement 4564) helps the navigational offi cer in his daily work. Navigational offi cer has the ability to use diff erent tools and information necessary for the protection and effi cient use of a warship. The emergence of new technologies in the fi eld of warfare is in the most aspects of naval operations computerised and digitalised with the intent to build, display and allow manipulation with the <b>Recognised</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Picture</b> (RMP). It is therefore surprising that a lot of Navies are still navigating using only paper charts although the advantages and effi ciency provided by the WECDIS, if used correctly, are signifi cant. In the fi rst part of the paper WECDIS is analysed as a navigational system used on warships with all the advantages and disadvantages recognised during its use in navigation.

40|$|Maritime {{awareness}} is a keystone of counter-piracy activities, {{as they are}} nowadays unfortunately {{called for in the}} Gulf of Aden and the Western Indian Ocean. There are a number of space-based systems {{that can be used to}} obtain knowledge of shipping and ship traffic patterns beyond coastal range, e. g. Satellite AIS, LRIT and satellite SAR.

40|$|Abstract:- The Recognized <b>Maritime</b> <b>Picture</b> (RMP) {{is defined}} as a {{composite}} picture of activity over a maritime area of interest. In simplistic terms, building an RMP comes down to finding if something is there or not, and determining what it is, what it is doing, and whether some type of follow-up action is required. The generation and maintenance of an RMP consists in part of associating contact reports from sensor sources with existing tracks or initiating new tracks. This paper presents the use of fuzzy sets in the data fusion process. The proposed approach is based on the incomplete nature of the data and uses two stages of fusion, a contact level fusion and a track level fusion. The algorithm’s implementation is also presented as well as fusion specific examples with real data acquired off the East Coast of Canada.

40|$|Iron Age coastal {{communities}} in England have been poorly understood {{since the beginning}} of our discipline. This is mainly as result of the lack of evidence for everyday maritime activities and also the focus of research on explaining an agro-pastoral way of living. Evidence of fishing, boats, harbour structures and ports are very rare archaeologically, and thinking about people living by the sea in this period has been widely overlooked as most of the interest has been the nature of the connections and trade-networks (mainly by Cunliffe 2008). In contrast, evidence for non maritime activities, such as farming and cattle rearing is so rich that looking to the coast only happens in special situations. Using the Isles of Scilly as a case study, this research challenges the established views that societies on the coasts of south-west of England were mainly cattle herders and farmers. Through palaeolandscape reconstruction, site analysis and material culture study, this research argues that settlement on the coastline is as important as that found inland. It shows that Iron Age maritime aspects of culture were deeply embedded within cultural traditions and that the maritime way of living {{had little to do with}} extraordinary or unusual situations. This research shows that preconceived ideas of what a maritime site should look like, as is the case of harbour structures and important ports, divert the attention from the subtleties of <b>recognising</b> <b>maritime</b> culture’s signature. It is through the study of archaeological context and environmental evidence that these are likely to become more obvious. Therefore, throughout this document the analysis of maritime landscape, settlement pattern and material culture generates new perspectives on how to approach the study of maritime societies in archaeology. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Ship {{detection}} is {{an important}} application of monitoring of environment and security or safety issues in African Waters. In order to overcome the limitations by other monitoring systems, e. g. coastal radar, surveillance with satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is used because of its potential to detect ships at high resolution over wide swaths and in all weather conditions and independent from sun illumination. TerraSAR-X (TS-X) is an X-band polarimetric SAR capable of imaging up to 1 m resolution in Spotlight mode. TS-X can be used fo r {{a wide variety of}} applications and methods of analysis including visual interpretation, mapping, digital-elevation-model creation, disaster monitoring, and oceanography. Results on the combined use of TS-X ship detection, automatic identification system (AIS), and satellite AIS (Sat AIS) are presented. Using AIS is an effective terrestrial method for tracking vessels in real time typically up to 40 km off the coast. SatAIS is a space-based system with nearly global coverage for monitoring of AIS equipped ships. Since not all ships operate their AIS and smaller ships are not equipped with AIS, space borne SARs provide complimentary means for ship monitoring. As cases, images were acquired over the Somali Coast Area, South African Coast and Gibraltar in Stripmap mode with a resolution of 3 m at a coverage of 30 km× 50 km. The rapid tasking performance as well as the short response time of the TS-X data acquisition of the ground segment DLR-BN (Ground Station Neustrelitz, Germany), are very helpful to monitor hotspot areas such as the Gulf of Aden. For ascending orbits the delivery time of ship detection products is less than 20 min. Along with the detected ship positions, estimated wave heights and wind fields derived from large-area TS-X imagery can be used to get a detailed <b>maritime</b> <b>picture</b> of the situation...|$|R
