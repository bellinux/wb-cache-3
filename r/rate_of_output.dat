In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt.

Breen, in his earlier book on U.S. coins, stated that the coin was delivered to Harding by messenger on January 3, 1922, but does not state the source of his information. A few proofs of the 1921 production were struck early in the run, in both satin and matte finishes, but it is unknown exactly how many with either finish were created; numismatic historians Leroy Van Allen and A.

We analyze the characteristics and performance of alternative monetary policy rules given the estimated covariance of parameter esti-mates.

2500|$|The {{period from}} 1890 to 1910 {{was one of}} rapid {{economic}} growth of above 4%, {{in part due to}} rapid population growth. However, a sharp break in the growth rate to around 2.8% occurred from 1910 to 1929. [...] Economists are uncertain what combination of supply and demand factors caused the break, but productivity growth was strong, enabling the labor cost per unit of output to decline from 1910 to 1929. [...] The growth rate in hours worked fell 57% compared to the decline in the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> of 27%. [...] It is generally accepted that the new technologies and more efficient business methods permanently shifted the supply and demand relationship for labor, with labor being in surplus (except during both world wars when the economy was engaged in war-time production and millions of men served in the armed forces.) [...] The technologies that became widespread after 1910, such as electrification, internal powered transportation and mass production, were capital saving.

40|$|In {{our view}} {{there has been}} a "Neoclassical Revival " in growth {{economics}} spurred by the empirical findings of Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), and Young (1994 and 1995).

Marshaling evidence from the labor literature on the returns to schooling and experience, we construct new measures of human capital across countries. We find that productivity differences are the dominant source of the large international dispersion in levels and growth <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> per worker. We conclude that, although models that focus on physical and human capital are clearly important, research needs to be re-focused on explaining the causes of productivity differences across countries.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} it is shown {{that for the}} purpose of {{nonlinear}} power amplifier behavioural modelling, the sampling rate can be set to the Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the input signal, rather than to the Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>output</b> signal by making use of Zhu’s generalized sampling theorem. This claim is supported by measurements on a basestation power amplifier. The findings are that the model error obtained when the output signal is sampled at the Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the input signal is approximately 1. 5 dB higher than when the sampling rate is set to the Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>output</b> signal. However, if a sampling <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> twice the Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the input signal is used, which is still typically, much lower than the Nyquist <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>output</b> signal, the degradation is only 0. 2 dB. These are important findings that will substantially ease the requirements on ADCs used in measurement setups used for amplifier modelling...|$|R
