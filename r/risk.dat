5|$|In a {{study of}} <b>risk</b> taking, some types of <b>risk,</b> such as {{physical}} or heroic <b>risk</b> for others' benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of <b>risk,</b> such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of heroic <b>risk</b> for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic <b>risk</b> taking by male friends, but preferred less of it in female mates. Females valued heroic <b>risk</b> taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer heroic <b>risk</b> taking by male friends {{as they could be}} good allies.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} <b>risk</b> {{management}} programs, only <b>risk</b> adjustment was permanent. <b>Risk</b> adjustment attempts to spread <b>risk</b> among insurers to prevent purchasers with good {{knowledge of their}} medical needs from using insurance to cover their costs (adverse selection).

5|$|<b>Risk</b> is an {{essential}} element in the battle system. A <b>Risk</b> bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the <b>Risk</b> Points the player has accumulated. <b>Risk</b> Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his <b>Risk</b> Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase <b>Risk</b> faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase <b>Risk</b> at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high <b>Risk.</b> The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of <b>risk</b> parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of <b>risk,</b> different ways of allocating <b>risk</b> within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future <b>risk</b> and different ways of implementing exposure to <b>risk.</b> However, many <b>risk</b> parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management. The {{extent to which a}} <b>risk</b> parity portfolio is managed, is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of <b>risk</b> parity funds available today.|$|E
5|$|A high <b>risk</b> day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high <b>risk</b> on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high <b>risk</b> days. Such days are rare; a high <b>risk</b> is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high <b>risk</b> days). High <b>risk</b> areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate <b>risk</b> area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
50|$|Potential global catastrophic <b>risks</b> include {{anthropogenic}} <b>risks</b> (technology <b>risks,</b> governance <b>risks)</b> {{and natural}} or external <b>risks.</b> Examples of technology <b>risks</b> are hostile artificial intelligence, biotechnology <b>risks,</b> or nanotechnology weapons. Insufficient global governance creates <b>risks</b> {{in the social}} and political domain (potentially leading to a global war with or without a nuclear holocaust, bioterrorism using genetically modified organisms, cyberterrorism destroying critical infrastructures like the electrical grid, or the failure to manage a natural pandemic) as well as problems and <b>risks</b> in the domain of earth system governance (with <b>risks</b> resulting from global warming, environmental degradation, including extinction of species, or famine as a result of non-equitable resource distribution, human overpopulation, crop failures and non-sustainable agriculture). Examples for non-anthropogenic <b>risks</b> are an asteroid impact event, a supervolcanic eruption, a lethal gamma-ray burst, a geomagnetic storm destroying all electronic equipment, natural long-term climate change, or extraterrestrial life impacting life on Earth.|$|R

5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at <b>risk.</b> The increased <b>risk</b> may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased <b>risk.</b> The size of the increased <b>risk</b> is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased <b>risk</b> of chronic psychoses.|$|E

30|$|It is well {{recognized}} {{that in order}} to combat climate change, GHG emissions need to be managed from the supply chain perspective. This paper moves one more step forward on the base of literature by introducing one concept—supply chain emission trading and one framework in addressing emission trading in the context of supply chains. To implement the supply chain emission trading, this paper proposed to assign the responsibility of supply chain GHG emissions to the focal company in the supply chain by including the scope 3 emissions of the focal company into ETS. Moreover, this paper discerns itself from others by identifying <b>risks</b> for supply chains under emission trading program. From a corporate perspective, these <b>risks</b> are from policy instability, market variation, supply chain agreement dispute, green investment uncertainty, and supply chain GHG emission accounting failure. Moreover, based on the concept of supply chain <b>risks,</b> this paper attributes green investment <b>risks</b> to internal and external <b>risks,</b> policy and market <b>risks</b> to supply chain environmental <b>risks,</b> accounting <b>risks</b> to internal <b>risks,</b> and agreement <b>risks</b> to external <b>risks.</b>|$|R

In this thesis, supply chain <b>risks</b> mainly contain endogenous <b>risks</b> which include <b>risks</b> of cooperation, purchasing, logistics, management and information, and exogenous <b>risks</b> which include <b>risks</b> of law, policy, sudden disasters and market. Based on this conclusion, further studies can be done in the aspects of evaluation on supply chain <b>risks</b> and the related research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the vulnerability of}} households in rural India, based upon the ICRISAT panel survey. We employ both ex ante and ex post measures of vulnerability. The latter are decomposed into aggregate and idiosyncratic <b>risks</b> and poverty components. Our decomposition shows that idiosyncratic <b>risks</b> account for the largest share, followed by poverty and aggregate <b>risks.</b> Despite some degree of risk-sharing, the landless or small farmers are vulnerable to idiosyncratic <b>risks,</b> forcing them to reduce consumption. Income augmenting policies therefore must be combined with those that not only reduce aggregate and idiosyncratic <b>risks</b> but also build resilience against them. aggregate <b>risks,</b> idiosyncratic <b>risks,</b> poverty, vulnerability, semi-arid conditions...|$|R

5|$|Conditions and <b>risk</b> {{factors that}} {{predispose}} to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease.

5|$|Depending {{upon the}} <b>risk</b> for DVT, {{different}} preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, {{which increases the}} <b>risk</b> of bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The <b>risk</b> of major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year, and the point where annual VTE <b>risk</b> is thought to warrant long-term anticoagulation {{is estimated to be}} between 3 and 9%. Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE <b>risk</b> is long-term anticoagulation a common consideration. Antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong <b>risk</b> factor, carries an annual <b>risk</b> of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long-term anticoagulation.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Table  5 that the {{technical}} <b>risks</b> contribute most to the MPD process, followed by strategy <b>risks</b> and market <b>risks,</b> respectively.

5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in <b>risk</b> to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics.

The greatest single <b>risk</b> factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (<b>risk</b> is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected.

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the <b>risk</b> that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher <b>risk</b> for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic <b>risk</b> factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the <b>risk</b> of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong <b>risk</b> factor.|$|E
30|$|The {{time frame}} of <b>risks</b> can be {{differentiated}} into short term {{and long term}} <b>risks.</b> Long term <b>risks</b> refer to <b>risks</b> that lie relatively far in the future (e.g., hurricanes that are near the coast for days in advance); for the present paper, short term <b>risks</b> lie {{in the immediate future}} (within hours, minutes or even less time). The long term perspective could be seen as the general tendency of a person to expect a threat. In the case of building fire evacuation, the time frame of <b>risks</b> is most likely short term.|$|R
