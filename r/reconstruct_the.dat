5|$|Attempts to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> uncut {{version of}} Greed without {{use of the}} lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique named Greed {{as one of the}} twelve {{greatest}} films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for Greed, which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> uncut version of Greed, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.|$|E

5|$|After the {{introduction}} which shows parts of Cord's missions, the game {{starts with a}} scene in which Cord is interrogated by now premier Dmitri Nagarov, while he is being tortured by his assistant Lukyan. After the torture, Cord is fighting for his sanity, and all he knows for sure is that he was betrayed. He tries to piece together the fragments of his memory, and the player must <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> events that led to his capture.|$|E
5|$|Depletion or {{enrichment}} of europium in minerals {{relative to}} other rare-earth elements {{is known as the}} europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form igneous rocks (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> relationships within a suite of igneous rocks.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{had long}} {{intended}} to architecturally <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> German capital Berlin {{into a new}} imperial metropolis, which he decided in 1942 to rename Germania upon its scheduled completion in 1950.

5|$|In 1963, Rastrelli's {{original}} {{plans for}} the building were found in Vienna, Austria. This {{made it possible to}} <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> original images on the building. The plan of restoration was carried out in the 1970s, overlooked by the main architect-restorer, V. Korneyeva. Since 1968, the church has been opened as a museum to tourists and visitors. The church is now owned by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|When {{tissue is}} {{deficient}} or mutilated {{by the loss}} of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments.

The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> soft tissues around lost teeth.|$|E

Moses soon prepared extensive plans to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> city's parks, renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools, zoos, playgrounds and parks. Moses acquired substantial Civil Works Administration, and later, Works Progress Administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight-year citywide construction program, relieving some of the high unemployment in New York City in this Depression year.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} the island, the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base. The 24th Brigade {{left from the}} island to capture {{the eastern shore of}} Brunei Bay in late June, and the island's airfield was repaired and expanded to host Royal Australian Air Force units. While occupying Labuan, the Allies had to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> island's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands of civilians who had been rendered homeless by the pre-invasion bombardment. Following the war, a major Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery was established on Labuan.|$|E
5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>the</b> movements of the three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
