40|$|Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) {{strategies}} vary significantly across {{industries in}} the manufacturing sector {{depending on the product}} being built. Such strategies range from simple statistical analysis and process controls, decision-making process of reworking, repairing, or scraping defective product. This study proposes an optimal QC methodology in order to include <b>rework</b> <b>stations</b> during the manufacturing process by identifying the amount and location of these workstations. The factors that are considered to optimize these stations are cost, cycle time, reworkability and rework benefit. The goal is to minimize the cost and cycle time of the process, but increase the reworkability and rework benefit. ^ The specific objectives of this study are: (1) to propose a cost estimation model that includes energy consumption, and (2) to propose an optimal QC methodology to identify quantity and location of rework workstations. The cost estimation model includes energy consumption as part of the product direct cost. The cost estimation model developed allows the user to calculate product direct cost as the quality sigma level of the process changes. This provides a benefit because a complete cost estimation calculation {{does not need to be}} performed every time the processes yield changes. This cost estimation model is then used for the QC strategy optimization process. ^ In order to propose a methodology that provides an optimal QC strategy, the possible factors that affect QC were evaluated. A screening Design of Experiments (DOE) was performed on seven initial factors and identified 3 significant factors. It reflected that one response variable was not required for the optimization process. A full factorial DOE was estimated in order to verify the significant factors obtained previously. ^ The QC strategy optimization is performed through a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which allows the evaluation of several solutions in order to obtain feasible optimal solutions. The GA evaluates possible solutions based on cost, cycle time, reworkability and rework benefit. Finally it provides several possible solutions because this is a multi-objective optimization problem. The solutions are presented as chromosomes that clearly state the amount and location of the <b>rework</b> <b>stations.</b> The user analyzes these solutions in order to select one by deciding which of the four factors considered is most important depending on the product being manufactured or the company’s objective. The major contribution of this study is to provide the user with a methodology used to identify an effective and optimal QC strategy that incorporates the number and location of rework substations in order to minimize direct product cost, and cycle time, and maximize reworkability, and rework benefit. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Adjusted {{discrete}} Multi-Objective Invasive Weed Optimization (DMOIWO) algorithm, {{which uses}} fuzzy dominant approach for ordering, {{has been proposed}} to solve No-wait two-stage flexible flow shop scheduling problem. Design/methodology/approach: No-wait two-stage flexible flow shop scheduling problem by considering sequence-dependent setup times and probable <b>rework</b> in both <b>stations,</b> different ready times for all jobs and rework times for both stations as well as unrelated parallel machines {{with regards to the}} simultaneous minimization of maximum job completion time and average latency functions have been investigated in a multi-objective manner. In this study, the parameter setting has been carried out using Taguchi Method based on the quality indicator for beater performance of the algorithm. Findings: The results of this algorithm have been compared with those of conventional, multi-objective algorithms to show the better performance of the proposed algorithm. The results clearly indicated the greater performance of the proposed algorithm. Originality/value: This study provides an efficient method for solving multi objective no-wait two-stage flexible flow shop scheduling problem by considering sequence-dependent setup times, probable <b>rework</b> in both <b>stations,</b> different ready times for all jobs, rework times for both stations and unrelated parallel machines which are the real constraints.

50|$|Finally, {{the boards}} are {{visually}} inspected for missing or misaligned components and solder bridging. If needed, they {{are sent to}} a <b>rework</b> <b>station</b> where a human operator repairs any errors. They are then usually sent to the testing stations (in-circuit testing and/or functional testing) to verify that they operate correctly.Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) systems are commonly used in PCB manufacturing. This technology has proven highly efficient for process improvements and quality achievements.|$|E
5000|$|Terminology is {{not totally}} standardised. Anything with a base unit with {{provision}} {{to maintain a}} stable temperature, pump air in either direction, etc., is often called a [...] "station" [...] (preceded by rework, soldering, desoldering, hot air); one, or sometimes more, tools may be connected to a station, e.g., a <b>rework</b> <b>station</b> may accommodate a soldering iron and hot air head. A soldering iron with a hollow tip and a spring-, bulb-, or electrically-operated suction pump may be called a [...] Terms such as [...] "suction pen" [...] may be used; the meaning is usually clear from the context.|$|E
50|$|A {{soldering}} station, invariably temperature-controlled, {{consists of}} an electrical power supply, control circuitry with provision for user adjustment of temperature and display, and a soldering iron or soldering head with a tip temperature sensor. The station will normally have a stand for the hot iron when not in use, and a wet sponge for cleaning. It is most commonly used for soldering electronic components. Other functions may be combined; for example a <b>rework</b> <b>station,</b> mainly for surface-mount components may have a hot air gun, vacuum pickup tool, and a soldering head; a desoldering station will have a desoldering head with vacuum pump for desoldering through-hole components, and a soldering iron head.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the package}} is {{soldered}} into place, {{it is difficult to}} find soldering faults. X-ray machines, industrial CT scanning machines, special microscopes, and endoscopes to look underneath the soldered package have been developed to overcome this problem. If a BGA is found to be badly soldered, it can be removed in a <b>rework</b> <b>station,</b> which is a jig fitted with infrared lamp (or hot air), a thermocouple and a vacuum device for lifting the package. The BGA can be replaced with a new one, or it can be refurbished (or reballed) and re-installed on the circuit board. Pre-configured solder balls matching the array pattern can be used to reball BGAs when only one or a few need to be reworked.|$|E
40|$|Rework {{stations}} are commonly established {{as part of}} each assembly stations causing the material flow of the process to be constantly interrupted. Another option is to place the <b>rework</b> <b>station</b> {{at the end of}} the production, but this is not cost effective. This breakeven point between reworkability and cost methodology has been proposed in this thesis to identify the location of a single <b>rework</b> <b>station</b> in an assembly line in order to enhance reworkability using the Design for Disassembly (DfD) principles. The methodology uses the 17 guidelines of DfD in a manufacturing scenario in order to propose a reworkability index of a product. This index is compared to cost index in order to find their breakeven point. This breakeven point allows the methodology to identify a location in the assembly process for the <b>rework</b> <b>station</b> in order to find a balance between these two factors. The methodology proposed is a series of simple step that can allow a company to reduce extra work and improve material flow by establishing one <b>rework</b> <b>station</b> in any production line. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the manufacturing process of a finished product assembled out of one unit of an expensive subassembly and some other non-expensive parts. The subassembly itself is assembled out of several components delivered just in time from outside suppliers. After {{the production of the}} subassemblies as well as after the production of the finished products quality tests are performed. If already one item of a production batch does not satisfy the quality requirements, the whole production batch is transported to a <b>rework</b> <b>station</b> where more extensive tests are done and the quality problems solved. The non-expensive parts, the subassemblies, and the finished products are hold on stock. While it can be assumed that the non-expensive parts are always on stock due to a two-bin system, the problem arises to guarantee a specified customer service level with minimal stock levels for subassemblies and finished products. The inventories are controlled by base-stock policies. We are interested in the optimal base-stock levels with respect to total holding costs subject to a service level constraint. We derive approximations for the cost function whose performance is tested in a detailed numerical study. We are able to describe the parameter settings leading to a good performance of our approximation. We further use our model to illustrate that an improvement of the assembly process has more impact on costs than an improvement on the production of subassemblies. Moreover, working with two rework stations needs less inventory investment than working with one <b>rework</b> <b>station...</b>|$|E
