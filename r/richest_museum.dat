The museum asset is made up of documents of more than 8 kinds, ranging from passport records to photos/cards and building-drawings. In this chapter, the authors discuss the approach used to create the exhibition rooms of the virtual Web-based museum. Each room consists of the information contained in those single or interrelated resources. The information exhibited in each room is described by an ontology, written in OWL. The authors also discuss the approach used to take advantage of a combination of structural and semantic information to efficiently retrieve documents from the MEC collection. Both approaches can be automatised to allow a very systematic way to deal with the huge and <b>rich</b> <b>museum</b> assets...|$|R

60|$|As one motors {{through these}} ripe and {{beautiful}} towns {{and through the}} rich valleys that link them--it is a smiling land abounding in old castles and villas, Vicenza is a <b>rich</b> <b>museum</b> of Palladio's architecture and Bassano is full of irreplaceable painted buildings--one feels that the things was a narrow escape, but from the military point of view it was merely an insane escapade. The Austrians had behind them--and some way behind them--one little strangulated railway and no good pass road; their right was held at Pasubio, their left was similarly bent back. In front of them was between twice and three times their number of first class troops, with an unlimited equipment. If they had surmounted that last mountain crest they would have come down to almost certain destruction in the plain. They could never have got back. For a time {{it was said that}} General Cadorna considered that possibility. From {{the point of view of}} purely military considerations, the Trentino offensive should perhaps have ended in the capitulation of Vicenza.|$|R

40|$|Italian {{universities}} have a <b>rich</b> <b>museum</b> heritage accumulated since their origins, {{which in some}} cases {{date back to the}} Sixteenth century. From that period it has been enriched and transformed, to include at least 265 museums, collections and monuments, unfortunately mostly unknown. Is this heritage a marginal one, or is it to be valued? This research will propose an answer, starting from the description of the heritage, considering its role, interpreting the universities policies, and examining the dynamics of its management and prospects for improvement. There is no specific complete and updated bibliographical source on Italian university museums in general, nor on the specific aspects covered by this research, while there are many articles and monographs on individual museums and “museum systems” that have been particularly useful in reconstructing the history and characteristics of exhibition. For this reason the research was carried out by using and comparing other sources of different types such as documents, websites, interviews and appropriately compiled questionnaires. University policies turn out to be various and contradictory and just a few of them perceive their museum heritage as a point of strength, dedicating it adequate resources. However, it still has a priceless value, closely linked to research and teaching, both for the university community and society, thanks to its quality and consistency of collections, as well as its current function, that could easily be enhanced in better conditions. In many cases, the situation could be improved simpley using coordinated management, in order to optimise resources and limit investment, and general planned policies...|$|R
40|$|The work of Ed Rossbach, his colleagues, and {{students}} at the University of California, Berkeley during the 1960 s and 1970 s was critical in forming the modern movement of American fiber art. What {{may not be as}} well known is the continuity of this work with a tradition of textile art and study at UC Berkeley going back to 1912. Founded as a department of Household Art as part of the home economics movement, it became a department of Decorative Art in 1939, under the leadership of Berkeley anthropologist and textile scholar Lila M. O’Neale (1886 – 1948). A cultural approach to the teaching of historic textiles was carried forward by her successors, anthropologists Anna Gayton and Ruth Boyer (who taught 1948 – 65 and 1962 – 72, respectively). The most important creative weaver in the department was C. Edmund Rossbach (1914 – 2002), who taught from 1950 to 1979. Although he never knew O’Neale, he was inspired to creatively adopt the ethnic and historic influences which he encountered in the teaching of her colleagues and in the <b>rich</b> <b>museum</b> collections at Berkeley. This approach was also taken up by Professor Lillian Elliott (1930 – 94) and student Joanne Segal Brandford (1933 – 94). As an introduction for the other essays from my session, my article reviews the political battles over the status of the department from its entry into the College of Environmental Design, through its official demise in 1974, until the last textile classes with Rossbach’s retirement in 1979...|$|R
