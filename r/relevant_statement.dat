40|$|Pilinszky’s {{presence}} in Szilárd Borbély’s Halotti Pompa [The Splendours of Death] The presence of Pilinszky’s lyrical poetry in Borbély Szilárd’s works is common knowledge which {{can easily be}} proved with examples taken from Borbély’s statements and the reception of his works. This study examines the connections between the poetic history of the two oeuvres from two aspects. First, the ways they relate to Christian traditions are brought into discussion. Arguing with the canonized interpretations of Pilinszky’s reception too, the question to be answered is whether only the theologically anti-dogmatic articulation {{of the experience of}} not-being-redeemed can be the poetically <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> from poets in the lyrical poetry of modernity and postmodernity. Second, the analysis of the poem about camp commander Otto Moll in the cycle entitled Haszid szekvenciák [Hasidic Sequences] of Halotti Pompa through the dialogue between the religious traditions intends to illustrate how Szi- lárd Borbély was able to reinterpret Pilinszky’s well-known paradox of “atoning the unatonable” in his own pessimistic world, and in so doing how he can preserve something from passing hope...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{argument for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} Einstein field equation is based on Lovelock's Theorem, the <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> of which is restricted to four dimensions. I prove a theorem similar to Lovelock's, with a physically modified assumption: that the geometric object representing curvature in the Einstein field equation ought to have the physical dimension of stress-energy. The theorem is stronger than Lovelock's in two ways: it holds in all dimensions, and so supports a generalized argument for uniqueness; it does not assume that the desired tensor depends on the metric only up second-order partial-derivatives, that condition being a consequence of the proof. This has consequences for understanding the nature of the cosmological constant and theories of higher-dimensional gravity. Another consequence of the theorem is that it makes precise the sense in which there can be no gravitational stress-energy tensor in general relativity. Along the way, I prove a result of some interest about the second jet-bundle of the bundle of metrics over a manifold.

40|$|We {{present a}} catalog of 857 white dwarf-M {{binaries}} from the sixth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), most of them known before. For 636 of them, we give a spectral analysis and derive the basic parameters of the stellar constituents and their distances from Earth. The analysis shall give a statistically <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> about the fundamental parameters of such systems. Our purpose is to test the models applied in the fitting procedure {{on the one hand}} and to confine the respective evolutionary scenarios on the other hand. The chi(2) minimization technique we use, in order to decompose each combined spectrum and yield independent parameter estimates for the components, differs from that typically applied to break down combined spectra. In the corresponding SDSS photometric data we find 41 optically resolved systems. For these we also derive a minimum real spatial separation and a lower limit for the orbital periods - typically some 10 (4) yr. 167 spectra show significant hydrogen emission and mostly no additional He I or He II features. Furthermore, we identify 70 very low-mass objects, meaning secondaries with masses smaller than about 0. 1 M-circle dot, as candidate substellar companions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} three basic defects for which three-taxon analysis has been rejected {{as a method}} for biological systematics are reviewed: (1) character evolution is a priori assumed to be irreversible; (2) basic statements that are not logically independent are treated as if they are; (3) three-taxon statements that are considered as independent support for a given tree may be mutually exclusive on that tree. It is argued that these criticisms only relate to the particular way the three-taxon approach was originally implemented. Four-taxon analysis, an alternative implementation that circumvents these problems, is derived. Four-taxon analysis is identical to standard parsimony analysis except for an unnatural restriction on {{the maximum amount of}} homoplasy that may be concentrated in a single character state. This restriction follows directly from the basis tenet of the three-taxon approach, that character state distributions should be decomposed into basic statements that are, in themselves, still informative with respect to relationships. A reconsideration of what constitutes an elementary <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> in systematics leads to a reformulation of standard parsimony as two-taxon analysis and to a rejection of four-taxon analysis as a method for biological systematics.

The book looks good, {{it feels like}} a good text, it contains many of the ‘big names ’ in economic geography, and more importantly it is a <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> within economic geography. A Companion to Economic Geography fulfils its aim of demonstrating to an audience of undergraduate and postgraduate students that economic geography (as distinct to geographical economics) matters. The book stresses the centrality of (economic) geography to understanding society as we (as academics and social agents) confront, engage and exist within it. Indeed the broad argument is that “(t) he recent changes in the economy, which have affected so many people in so many different ways, are not only economic but also fundamentally geographical ” (4). Positioned between other recent economic geography textbooks (Bryson et al., 1999; Clark et al., 2000) the Companion offers a thorough introduction into “the art of economic geography ” (2) : the editors and authors demonstrate that these are indeed interesting times to be studying within the sub-discipline. The book explicitly characterises ‘doing ’ geography as attempting to synthesise and represent multiple and changing phenomena as they are observed. Along these lines it perhap...|$|E
40|$|Extract:The general {{principle}} in common law jurisdictions is that relevant evidence is admissible, unless it falls within a category which is excluded by law, {{or it is}} excluded inthe exercise of a recognized judicial discretion. If evidence falls within a legally excluded category, it is excluded irrespective of general factors that may favor its admission (such as the public interest in convicting the guilty), unless it falls within {{an exception to the}} exclusionary rule (eg hearsay is generally excluded but certain hearsay statements such as admissions are not). In the English tradition illegally or improperly obtained evidence was not a category of evidence excluded by operation of law, and was thus admissible, whatever its character (eg whether brought into existence by the illegality or not). However, such evidence could be excluded even though relevant by the coua in the exercise of its general faimess discretion. This fairness discretion focused primarily on exclusion of unreliable evidence and was thus rarely if ever exercised in relation to illegal real evidence, as opposed to confessional evidence. Evidence could he classed as illegal by reference to the ordinary law applicable to its obtaining, or, mostly where it was confessional in nature, as improperly obtained, ie given voluntarily hut in circumstances where conduct by the authorities later judged improper resulted in the <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> being made. In more recent times most of the common law jurisdictions have abandoned sole reliance on the fairness discretion and have developed discreet rules and discretionary powers concerning admission or exclusion of illegal and improper evidence, with human rights provisions becoming the main reference frame for determining admissibility...|$|E
40|$|Collective memory {{studies as}} a field {{has always been the}} {{interdisciplinary}} study of how and why memories have been created. The difference between collective or cultural memory studies and that of a strictly historical study is often discussed and debated as people question whether memory or history is more valuable regarding past events. Jan Assmann explains that “in the context of cultural memory, the distinction between myth and history vanishes. Not the past as such, as it is investigated and reconstructed by archaeologists and historians, counts for the cultural memory, but only the past as it is remembered. ” Assmann has the perspective that while an historical event took place in a certain way the memory of the event in itself is worthy of recognition and exploration. However, whether or not studying the past as history or as memory is more appropriate is not the concern here. This paper will focus on how the approach of memory studies is able to bring memory into historical perspective as an element of influence and a catalyst for memorialization that took place through painting in Quattrocentro Florence. The use of paintings as objects of immediate memory was practiced by the Florentines as a form of “social memory,” a term coined by art historian Abby Warburg to refer to a cultural level of memory. Interestingly enough despite the use of paintings for immediate memory in fifteenth century Florence, Jan Assmann credits Warburg with being the first art historian to recognize and treat images or “cultural objectivizations” as carriers of memory. This may be a <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> for contemporary art history, however a key theorist of the fifteenth century, Battista Alberti noted that in regard to paintings as a form of memory of deceased individuals, “the dead were seen by ‘the living many centuries later,’” referencing a clear recognition of the power of images to act as carriers of memory centuries before any field of memory studies was formalized...|$|E

40|$|Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome {{has become}} the whole world {{pandemic}} in a short time. It is a virus that is transmitted primarily by blood, breast milk and body fluids, but by means of normal contact with an infected a transfer will not occur if the person does not behave dangerously. The clinical picture of this virus has a very large range of expressions, {{it depends on what}} stage is the infected in. In the first few weeks the infected may suffer of temperature, nausea, joint pain. After that infection passes into the asymptomatic period. In the third period of the infection there comes persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, which gradually passes into the fourth stage, which leads to the development of opportunistic infections, malignancies and neurological disorders. To become familiar with the current state of knowledge, which is described on the following pages, it was necessary to study a large number of bibliographic publications by leading Czech and foreign experts in the field of HIV infection. In the Czech scientific environment is this topic, among others, covered by MD. Džamila Stehlíková, from whose scholarly articles and books we have drawn. Another important resource for the bachelor thesis were also journals from abroad, ICAP Columbia University, Czech Health Statistics Yearbook and the magazine of UNAIDS company. From the Czech magazine sources, I would like to mention Florence, Závislosti a my, Lékařské listy and Sestra magazine. The bachelor thesis also includes Internet resources from abroad and the Czech Republic, which deal with such problems, that is www. unaids. org, www. aids-pomoc. cz.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is acute as {{the most common cause}} of death in most Western European {{countries}} is a cardiac arrest. Mortality after an arrest outside hospital is around 65 - 95 % and 40 - 50 % after an cardiac arrest in hospital. The prognosis is uncertain, but it could be improved by early and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As everyone can encounter a situation in which they should be able to use parts of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is therefore necessary to know its basic principles and to be able to help a person in life-threatening situations. Early and proper first aid is usually life-saving, and therefore laic and professional knowledge of resuscitation is crucial. The emphasis, which is based on the results of many studies, shifts to the fastest and most effective action on the site of the accident. The importance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and nursing care for the patient during this phase led to the elaboration of the theoretical work Nursing Care of Patients after Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. The first chapter of this thesis deals with the basic characteristics of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, in the second chapter describes compact nursing care. Therefore, the third chapter of this thesis deals with the ethical and legal aspects of the decision making about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As it is a psychological burden that threatens medical staff with stress and burnout, the last chapter is devoted to the mental stress of nurses who take care of patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The first objective of this theoretical bachelor thesis was, based on the literature sources, to map comprehensively the care of patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This includes mapping techniques of cardiopulmonary resuscitation according to the latest recommendations, and then mapping the complex nursing care of the patient after successfully restored blood circulation. Given that death has become unacceptable in today's society and is perceived as a failure of medicine, the medical personnel are faced with a difficult situation. Still more and more progress and achievements in the treatment give the public the feeling that medicine is omnipotent. But keep in mind the possible downsides of the success in the treatment, sometimes at the expense of the quality of the patient's life. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to map comprehensively the ethical and legal aspects of the decision to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation. For the theoretical part of the thesis, the method of design and demonstrations was chosen. To obtain the awareness of the latest recommendations in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the subsequent comprehensive care of the patient after the restoration of spontaneous circulation, and ethical and legal aspects of the decision to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which is captured in the following pages, was necessary to study bibliographic publications from experts in the field of anesthesia, resuscitation, law and ethics, as well as Czech and foreign professional journals and articles. Through the detailed study of the professional literature, it has been attempted to give a <b>relevant</b> <b>statement</b> about the ascertained facts. The information obtained is further elaborated in the individual chapters. The study is theoretical and is intended primarily for healthcare professionals in the care of patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Finally, the thesis contains the area of mental health and struggle with stress and burnout. The theme of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is still acute, since today's modern society is full of lifestyle diseases, full of stress and haste, which can threaten individuals with a sudden loss of vital functions; whatever the cause of the problems is...|$|E
