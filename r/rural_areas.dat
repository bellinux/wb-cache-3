5|$|In 1894 the {{authorities}} decided {{to abolish the}} position of bailiff and {{it was decided that}} some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs.

The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate to the chief of police in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
