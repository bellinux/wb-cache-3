5|$|During World War I, Curie {{recognised}} that {{wounded soldiers}} were best served if operated upon {{as soon as}} possible. She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of <b>radiology,</b> anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became {{the director of the}} Red Cross <b>Radiology</b> Service and set up France's first military <b>radiology</b> centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals {{in the first year of}} the war. Later, she began training other women as aides.|$|E
5|$|A further {{survey of}} the graves was {{undertaken}} in 1986. A camera crew filmed the procedure, shown in Novas television documentary, Buried in Ice in 1988. Under difficult field conditions, Derek Notman, a radiologist and medical doctor from the University of Minnesota, and <b>radiology</b> technician Larry Anderson took many X-rays of the crewmen prior to autopsy. Barbara Schweger, an Arctic clothing specialist, and Roger Amy, a pathologist, assisted in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 1881 first International Electrical Congress {{adopted the}} BAAS {{recommendations}} on electrical units, {{followed by a}} series of congresses in which further units of measure were defined and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) was set up with the specific task of overseeing electrical units of measure. This was followed by the International Congress of <b>Radiology</b> (ISR) who, at their inaugural meeting in 1926, initiated the definition of radiological-related units of measure.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Leak Warren (July 19, 1896 - July 26, 1981) was an American {{physician}} and radiologist {{who was a}} pioneer in the field of nuclear medicine and best known for his invention of the mammogram. Warren developed the technique of producing stereoscopic images of the breast with X-rays while working in the Department of <b>Radiology</b> at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Human anatomy, {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and <b>radiology.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{nuclear device}} ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the Trinity test, {{conducted}} at New Mexico's Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used {{a month later}} in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons, promoted {{the development of the}} network of national laboratories, supported medical research into <b>radiology</b> and laid the foundations for the nuclear navy. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947.|$|E
5|$|Warren {{joined the}} faculty of the Department of <b>Radiology</b> at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1926, {{becoming}} an Assistant Professor of Medicine. The department was a new one that had only been founded in 1921, based upon the ideals of medical education propounded by Abraham Flexner in his 1910 Flexner Report. The medical school had opened in 1925 and did not graduate its first class until 1929. Warren was one of the original group that Dean George Whipple assembled to staff the new medical school. At Rochester, Warren investigated the effects of artificial fever, including its possible use for treating gonococci infections. He was also interested in radiography.|$|E
5|$|An Associate Professor of <b>Radiology</b> at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, Warren {{met with}} Dr Albert K. Chapman, the Vice President and General Manager of Eastman Kodak, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the {{director}} of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall, the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED). They asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in <b>radiology</b> research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable to provide all the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Miri Hospital started {{operation}} on 6 May 1995, located 2.5km away from Miri city centre {{and with an}} area of 87.11 hectares. The hospital has 339 beds, and it provides specialist services such as surgery, ophthalmology, obstetrics and gynaecology (ONG), and <b>radiology.</b> It is also the secondary referral hospital in the northern region of Sarawak. There are also 2 polyclinics in Miri namely Miri polyclinic and Tudan polyclinic. Miri City Medical Centre is a private hospital that started its operation in 2002 and has 30 beds. It is located at Hokkien Road, Miri. Columbia Asia Medical Centre was formerly known as Selesa Medical Centre. It was acquired in 1998, located 4km downtown Miri. It serves the communities from Miri, Limbang, Marudi, and Brunei. Shell employees make up the largest customer base for this private hospital.|$|E
5|$|Tawau has one public hospital, four {{public health}} clinics, three {{maternal}} {{and child health}} clinics, seven village clinics, one mobile clinic and two 1Malaysia clinics. Tawau Hospital, on Tanjung Batu Street, is the town's main hospital and an important healthcare facility for patients from Semporna, Lahad Datu, Kunak, and Sandakan. Indonesian patients near the border area also frequently visit the hospital. Tawau Specialist Polyclinics (TSPC) is a walk-in healthcare clinic that sees patients from Tawau and surrounding areas as well as patients from neighbouring Philippines and Indonesia. TSPC has a range of medical specialists, a medical laboratory and <b>radiology</b> services. The hospital has undergone a series of modernisations since 1990 with the construction of specialist clinics, Central Sterile Services Department (CSSD), new wards and operation theatres. Tawau Specialist Hospital is the only private hospital in the town. The Tawau Regional Library is one of three regional libraries in Sabah, the others are at Keningau and Sandakan. These libraries are operated by the Sabah State Library department. Some schools, colleges, or universities have private libraries.|$|E
5|$|Tatlock {{broke up}} with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August that year he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening Harrison, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Harrison had been married three times previously. Her first {{marriage}} lasted only a few months. Her second husband was Joe Dallet, {{an active member of}} the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of <b>radiology</b> at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She finally asked Harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in Reno, Nevada, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth husband on November 1, 1940.|$|E
25|$|Following {{completion}} of residency training, Radiologists may either begin practicing {{as a general}} Diagnostic Radiologist or enter into subspecialty training programs known as fellowships. Examples of subspeciality training in <b>radiology</b> include abdominal imaging, thoracic imaging, cross-sectional/ultrasound, MRI, musculoskeletal imaging, interventional <b>radiology,</b> neuroradiology, interventional neuroradiology, paediatric <b>radiology,</b> nuclear medicine, emergency <b>radiology,</b> breast imaging and women's imaging. Fellowship training programs in <b>radiology</b> are usually {{one or two years}} in length.|$|E
25|$|The <b>radiology</b> {{training}} {{course is a}} post graduate 3-year program (MD/DNB <b>Radiology)</b> or a 2-year diploma (DMRD).|$|E
25|$|UK <b>radiology</b> registrars are {{represented}} by the Society of Radiologists in Training (SRT), {{which was founded in}} 1993 {{under the auspices of the}} Royal College of Radiologists. The society is a nonprofit organisation, run by <b>radiology</b> registrars specifically to promote <b>radiology</b> training and education in the UK. Annual meetings are held by which trainees across the country are encouraged to attend.|$|E
25|$|Veterinary Radiologists are veterinarians who {{specialize}} {{in the use of}} X-rays, ultrasound, MRI and nuclear medicine for diagnostic imaging or treatment of disease in animals. They are certified in either diagnostic <b>radiology</b> or radiation oncology by the American College of Veterinary <b>Radiology.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some {{medical schools}} in the US have started to {{incorporate}} a basic <b>radiology</b> introduction into their core MD training. New York Medical College, the Wayne State University School of Medicine, the Uniformed Services University, and the University of South Carolina School of Medicine offer an introduction to <b>radiology</b> during their respective MD programs. Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine also integrates imaging material into their curriculum early in the first year.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiology</b> is {{the science}} that uses medical imaging to {{diagnose}} and sometimes also treat diseases within the body.|$|E
25|$|Certification {{may also}} be {{obtained}} from the American Osteopathic Board of <b>Radiology</b> (AOBR) and the American Board of Physician Specialties.|$|E

25|$|The <b>radiology</b> {{training}} program in Italy increased {{from four to}} five years in 2008. Further training is required for specialization in radiotherapy or nuclear medicine.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, ROC curves were {{employed}} in psychophysics to assess human (and occasionally non-human animal) detection of weak signals. In medicine, ROC analysis has been extensively used {{in the evaluation of}} diagnostic tests. ROC curves are also used extensively in epidemiology and medical research and are frequently mentioned in conjunction with evidence-based medicine. In <b>radiology,</b> ROC analysis is a common technique to evaluate new <b>radiology</b> techniques. In the social sciences, ROC analysis is often called the ROC Accuracy Ratio, a common technique for judging the accuracy of default probability models.|$|E
25|$|In the 5th category, the Trainee {{immediately}} starts Specialty Training (ST1 {{instead of}} CT1) progressing up to Consultant level without break or further competitive application process (Run-Through Training). Most of the run-through schemes are in stand-alone specialties (such as <b>Radiology,</b> Public Health or Histopathology), {{but there are}} also a few traditionally Surgical specialities which can be entered directly without completing Core Surgical Training - Neurosurgery, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Ophthalmology. The length of this training varies, for example General Practice is 3 years while <b>Radiology</b> is 5 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiology</b> is an {{expanding}} field in medicine. Applying for residency positions in <b>radiology</b> is competitive. Applicants are often {{near the top}} of their medical school classes, with high USMLE (board) scores. The field is rapidly expanding due to advances in computer technology, which is closely linked to modern imaging. Diagnostic Radiologists must complete prerequisite undergraduate education, four years of medical school to earn a medical degree (D.O. or M.D.), one year of internship, and four years of residency training. After residency, Radiologists may pursue one or two years of additional specialty fellowship training.|$|E
