5|$|After President Nixon {{was elected}} in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a <b>Revenue</b> <b>Sharing</b> program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E

The NFL officially recognized the NFLPA's status as the players' collective bargaining representative on July 30, 2011. The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. Under the agreement, which runs through 2021, <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing,</b> the most contentious issue during the lockout, was re-designed so that the players must receive at least 47% of all revenue in salary for the term of the agreement. Additionally, a limit was placed on the amount of money given to rookies. Fifty million dollars was set aside annually for medical research and approximately $1 billion would be set aside for retired player benefits {{over the life of the}} agreement.|$|E

30|$|Let us now {{examine the}} {{estimates}} reported in Table  3. Results {{indicate that the}} Internet exerts a negative and significant effect on countries’ resource revenue performance (i.e., the <b>share</b> of resource <b>revenue</b> in GDP) [see column (1) of the table] and a positive and significant effect on countries’ non-resource revenue performance (i.e., the <b>share</b> of non-resource <b>revenue</b> in GDP) [see column (2) of the table]. Hence, for countries contained in the sub-sample of “ResCountries”, a 1 -percentage point increase in the Internet usage intensity {{is associated with a}} 0.402 -percentage decline in the ratio of resource revenue to GDP. Similarly, over the full sample, a 1 -percentage point increase in the Internet usage intensity leads to a 0.018 -percentage point increase in the <b>share</b> of non-resource <b>revenue</b> (% GDP). Incidentally, as per results in column (1), we note that a rise in the non-resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of GDP influences negatively and significantly the resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of GDP: a 1 -percentage point increase in the non-resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> induces a 2.12 -percentage decline in the ratio of resource revenue to GDP. Likewise, a rise in the resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> exerts a negative and significant impact on the non-resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of GDP: a 1 -percentage point increase in the resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> leads to a 0.072 -percentage point fall in the <b>share</b> of non-resource <b>revenue</b> (% GDP). Results related to other control variables in column (1) suggest that the positive drivers of resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of GDP include higher real per capita income, lower inflation rate, trade policy liberalization, lower quality of institutions and governance, higher oil prices, and lower population size. The resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of GDP exhibits a declining trend over time. This is exemplified by the negative and statistically significant coefficient of the Trend variable in column (1) of the Table. In column (2), we obtain rather that the non-resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of GDP exhibits a rising trend over time. Additionally, at the 5 % level, only better institutional and governance quality and lower oil prices influence positively and significantly the non-resource <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of GDP. The other control variables are not statistically significantly related to this <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> at the 5 % level.|$|R

5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their initial seasons, they struggled financially. A key event in franchise history occurred in the 11th game of the Giants inaugural season. The Chicago Bears, led by star running back Red Grange, came to town attracting a then pro football record 73,000 fans, and giving the Giants a much needed financial influx. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. After these initial struggles, the Giants financial status stabilized, and they {{led the league in}} attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s. By the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continue to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue {{for the benefit of the}} entire league. <b>Revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{existing}} literature, capital taxes should not be imposed {{in the presence of}} optimal profit taxation in either unionised or competitive labour markets. We show that this conclusion does not hold for an economy with both competitive and unionised sectors, where the competitive wage rate provides the outside option for unionised workers. Even with non-distortionary profit taxation it is optimal for such an economy to tax capital if the <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of capital in the unionised sector is lower than the <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> of capital in the competitive sector. This is because taxing capital income reduces employment and lowers the outside option of workers in the unionised sector with the latter effect being stronger.

25|$|Count 2: Modification of a <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> {{agreement}} on pre-paid mobile services. Previously, telecom operators {{had to pay}} the TOT a percentage of their revenues for post-paid mobile services. To offer pre-paid services, which are generally cost less to the consumer, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a <b>revenue</b> <b>sharing</b> agreement for pre-paid services that offered less revenue to the TOT comprising an estimated loss of 14.2billion baht (revenue reduced from 25% to 20%) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56billion baht (revenue reduced from 30% to 20%) from 2006 to 2015. The judges ruled that {{the terms of the}} pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT's total revenue actually increased substantially {{as a result of the}} agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT's post-paid revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13% in 2001 to 80% in 2007, due almost completely to pre-paid services, and the reduction in AIS market share from 68% to 53% in the same period were not taken into account by the court.|$|E

40|$|Consignment {{contracts}} {{have been}} widely employed in many industries. Under such contracts, items are sold at a retailer's but the supplier retains the full ownership of the inventory until purchased by consumers; the supplier collects payment from the retailer based on actual units sold. We investigate how competition among retailers influences the supply chain decisions and profits under different consignment arrangements, namely a consignment price contract and a consignment contract with <b>revenue</b> <b>share.</b> First, we investigate how these two consignment contracts and a price only contract compare {{from the perspective of}} each supply chain partner. We find that the retailers benefit more from a consignment price contract than from a consignment contract with <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> or a price only contract, regardless of the level of retailer differentiation. The supplier's most beneficial contact, however, critically depends upon the level of retailer differentiation: a consignment contract with <b>revenue</b> <b>share</b> is preferable for the supplier if retailer differentiation is strong; otherwise a consignment price contract is preferable. Second, we study how retailer differentiation affects the profits of all supply chain partners. We find that less retailer differentiation improves the supplier's profit for both types of consignment contract. Moreover, less retailer differentiation improves profits of the retailers in a consignment price contract, but not necessarily in a consignment contract with <b>revenue</b> <b>share.</b> Supply chain Consignment Retail competition...|$|R
