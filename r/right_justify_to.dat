The image of Sorel {{that came out}} of Weimar-era sociological debate around Schmitt and Karl Mannheim was simplified and hardened by émigré scholars in the war years, put to good use in the anti-totalitarian combat of the 1950 s, and finally shattered when applied to the unfamiliar situation of the 1960 s in the United States. Scholars taken with the problem of the political intellectual and the closely related problem of the relationship between instrumental and critical reason play the central role in this reception history.

This article shows how gendered narratives also shaped the collective identities of those opposing the ‘War on Terror’. Using interview data and analysis of newspaper editorials from movement leaders alongside focus groups with grassroots Muslim women activists, this article demonstrates how, {{in responding to the}} cynical use of women’s <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> war, participants in the anti-‘War on Terror’ movement offered an alternative story. Movement activists deployed representations of Muslim women’s agency to challenge the trope of the ‘oppressed Muslim woman’.

Yet, respondents in the focus groups illustrated the challenges of seeking agency through an ascribed identity; in that they simultaneously refused and relied upon dominant terms of the debate about Muslim women...|$|R

They would not make the market more transparent or effective, increase the level of protection, or harmonise legislation throughout the EU. Instead, the proposals (which are well intended but excessive) would weaken the spirit of competition on both the supply and demand sides. Consumer protection with a proper degree of moderation would involve regulation that strikes a balance between the consumer's (1) <b>justified</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> protection, (2) obligation to act responsibly and (3) right to self-determination instead of schoolmarmish government intervention.

40|$|Liberal-democratic states’ {{commitments}} to equality and personal autonomy have always proven problematic {{with respect to}} state regulation of relations between parents and children. In the parental authority literature positions have varied from invoking children’s interests to argue for limitations on parental efforts to instill identities and values to invoking parental <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> state privileging of such efforts. This article argues that liberal-democratic states should privilege parental efforts {{to raise their children}} to share their identities and values. Its approach is distinctive in two ways: i) it engages in interdisciplinary reflection upon selected findings in psychological literature on immigrant youth, acculturation, and identity development to assess philosophical arguments about parental authority; and ii) it argues that children’s, and not parental, interests should be viewed as the primary basis for parental rights to instill identities and values. Ultimately, the article argues, parental authority to instill identities and values is justified by children’s interests in psychological wellbeing and personal autonomy...|$|R

40|$|The vast {{improvements}} in medical technology reviled {{the crucial role}} of social determinants of health for the etiology, prevalence and prognosis of diseases. This changed {{the content of the}} right to health concept from a demand of health services, to a claim of having access to all social determinants of health. Thus, the just allocation of scarce resources of health and social determinants of health became an issue of ethical theories. John Rawls developed a theory of justice. His theory suggests that the principles of justice should be determined by individuals in a hypothetic initial position. In the initial position, individuals agree on principles of justice. Rawls puts forth that the institutions of the society should be structured in compliance with these principles to reach a fair social system. Although Rawls did not <b>justify</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> health in his theory, the efforts to enlarge the theory to cover right to health flourished quite fast.

40|$|The {{debate on}} the issue of child {{soldiers}} in international law has been mainly framed around the narrow question of whether child soldiers should be prosecuted or deemed innocent victims. This question, while essential, marginalized several considerations related to the multidimensional and intersecting identities and roles of child soldiers. Few scholars have investigated and evidenced the major gaps related to the legal protection of child soldiers in international law. While recognizing the potential related to the analysis on child soldiers’ criminal liability, this research proposes to focus on the examination of their vulnerabilities and to explore the legal foundations for the strengthening of their legal protection. Thus, this project is not a mere recognition of child soldiers as innocent victims but a careful and extensive examination of several areas of Public International Law such as International Humanitarian Law, International Criminal Law and International Human <b>Rights</b> Law <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the necessity <b>to</b> establish a stronger and exhaustive legal protection for child soldiers.

40|$|The {{following}} discussion {{is based on}} an extensive survey of UK mainstream television news reports broadcast between September and December 2001 during the military attacks on Afghanistan, known as Operation Enduring Freedom. Also conducted was a survey of British radio and print media published and produced within the specified period. I argue that the 2001 news media coverage of Afghanistan was an important precursor to current debates about Muslim women in Europe and the United States since it highlights many of the contradictions and hypocrisies housed within western public discourses on women’s rights. Detailing numerous examples, I contend that the prevalent theme of women’s liberation on international news agendas did nothing to alter the prevailing norm of news media coverage, which denied Afghan women access to media spaces throughout Operation Enduring Freedom. Afghan women were invariably the subjects rather than the agents of such debates. Moreover, regardless of their gender, the vast majority of journalists reporting the 2001 conflict failed to recognise and confront the co-option of women’s rights for the purpose of justifying military aggression on humanitarian grounds. I argue that this has grave implications, not merely for future reporting on Afghan women, but for the widespread practice by mainstream politicians and their associates of co-opting the discourse of women’s <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> military conflict...|$|R

Asda would not have been granted planning permission for a huge out-of-town superstore unless it gave the council the benefit of building the stadium. [...] would move up, permission would be granted, then [...] would exercise the option to buy all the land, sell it to Asda and IKEA for very much more, and the difference would be used to build the stadium."
