These compounds improve the grain refining, and <b>retard</b> recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E

To <b>retard</b> melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E

Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to <b>retard</b> it. Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g. cattle) a broad one. Static magnetic fields, for reasons still unknown, also <b>retard</b> animal development.|$|E

25|$|Transgender men {{who have}} been oophorectomized must {{continue}} androgen therapy to avoid premature osteoporosis. Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, as some of the injected testosterone will be aromatized into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in cisgender men). However, a single small study of trans men after oophorectomy demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to <b>retard</b> bone loss. (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and bone metabolism in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.)

The study examines differences in court processing and final disposition between mentally <b>retarded</b> and nonretarded defendants found incompetent to stand trial. Virtually all subjects were diagnosed as being psychotic.

25|$|Lake breezes {{in spring}} tend to <b>retard</b> fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, {{and in the}} autumn delay the onset of fall frost, {{particularly}} on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also <b>retard</b> early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area. The wine-growing region extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties. Apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake's north shore, around Cobourg.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this article, {{we provide}} a {{historical}} {{glimpse into the}} changing use of terminology for people with intellectual disabilities. In order {{to determine how the}} word <b>retarded</b> is currently used in popular culture in the United States, we analyzed one hundred randomly selected YouTube videos with the word <b>retarded</b> in the title. Five themes emerged: (a) the traditional use of the term <b>retarded,</b> (b) the use of <b>retarded</b> in humorous context, (c) the use of <b>retarded</b> to insult or criticize, (d) the term <b>retarded</b> as a substitute for other words, and (e) the slang use of <b>retarded</b> in a hip hop context. The coexistence of these multiple definitions is an unprecedented situation in the history of disability terminology. While advocates in the US are pushing for abandonment of the “R ” word, establishing rules about language use is clearly a simplistic solution to a complex problem...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} <b>retarded</b> {{settings in}} the context of a Bell-type experiment. The <b>retarded</b> setting is defined as the value the setting would have taken were it not for some external intervention (for example, by a human). We derive <b>retarded</b> Bell inequalities that explicitly take into account the <b>retarded</b> settings. These inequalities are not violated by Quantum Theory (or any other theory) when the <b>retarded</b> settings are equal to the actual settings. We construct a simple model that reproduces Quantum Theory when the <b>retarded</b> and actual settings are equal, but violates it when they are not. We discuss using humans to choose the settings in this type of experiment and the implications of a violation of Quantum Theory (in agreement with the <b>retarded</b> Bell inequalities) in this context.
