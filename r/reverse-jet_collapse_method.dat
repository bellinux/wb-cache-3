In the modified <b>collapsing</b> <b>method,</b> the movements of the locations are dependent on the shape of the distribution of the locations within the confidence ellipsoid, and not just the position of the center of gravity, {{as is the case in}} the original method. Additionally, whereas the original <b>collapsing</b> <b>method</b> implicitly assumes that all locations belong to point structures, in this modified version three types of structure are considered: point, line, and plane. Principal component analysis of the locations is used to evaluate to which type of structure each location most probably belongs. The modified technique has been applied to microseismic events associated with hydraulic stimulation at the Fenton Hill HDR Field, New Mexico, and known small-scale structures were imaged...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} longitudinal {{bending strength}} of thin plated steel {{structures such as}} box girder bridges and ship hulls can be determined using an incremental–iterative procedure known as the Smith progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>method.</b> The Smith method first calculates the response of stiffened panel sub-structures in the girder and then integrates over the cross section of interest to calculate a moment–curvature response curve. A suitable technique to determine the strength behaviour of stiffened panels within the Smith method is therefore of critical importance. A fundamental assumption of the established progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>method</b> is that the buckling and collapse behaviour of the compressed panels within the girder occurs between adjacent transverse frames. However, interframe buckling {{may not always be}} the dominant collapse mode, especially for lightweight stiffened panels such as are found in naval ships and aluminium high speed craft. In these cases overall failure modes, where the buckling mode extends over several frame spaces, may dominate the buckling and collapse response. To account for this possibility, an adaptation to large deflection orthotropic plate theory is presented. The adapted orthotropic method is able to calculate panel stress–strain response curves accounting for both interframe and overall <b>collapse.</b> The <b>method</b> is validated with equivalent nonlinear finite element analyses for a range of regular stiffened panel geometries. It is shown how the adapted orthotropic method is implemented into an extended progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>method,</b> which enhances the capability for determining the ultimate strength of a lightweight stiffened box girder...|$|R

Accuracy of PCM {{is known to be}} dependent on how Load-Shortening and -Elongation (LSE) curve of a structural units are well predicted. This paper presents a new procedure to determine LSE datum based on box girder Finite Element Analyses (FEAs) instead of using finite element model of stiffened panels. To verify reliability of FEA results, the simple box girder collapse test results are compared with FEA results of same box girders. It reveals one frame-based box girder model is sufficiently accurate in terms of ultimate strengths of the box girders. After extracting LSE data from the box girders, PCM-based moment-carrying capacities are compared with those from FEAs of the box girders. PCM results are found to be equivalent to FEAs in terms of moment-carrying capacity if accurate LSE data are secured. The new procedure is applied to well-known 1 / 3 scaled frigate full section.

Here we describe the application of a rare variant <b>collapsing</b> <b>method</b> to a large genome-wide SNP dataset, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium rheumatoid arthritis (RA) GWAS. We partitioned the data into gene-centric bins and collapsed genotypes of low frequency variants (defined here as MAF ≤ 0. 05) into a single count coupled with univariate analysis. We then prioritised gene regions for further investigation in an independent cohort of 3, 355 cases and 2, 427 controls based on rare variant signal p value and prior evidence to support involvement in RA.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} several methods to predict the primary longitudinal bending moment?curvature relationship {{for a series of}} box beams with dimensions equivalent to a large, lightweight aluminium ship. The comparative study includes the application of an extended progressive collapse methodology, which has been developed specifically to predict the strength behavior of lightweight hull structures under primary bending moment and accounts for compartment-level, gross panel buckling effects of the orthogonally stiffened structure. The approach is based on the principles of the Smith progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>method,</b> which {{has been shown to be}} a capable measure of ultimate strength when applied to steel ships. However, a fundamental premise of the Smith method is that buckling forms an interframe. The extended method discards this assumption and includes overall gross panel buckling effects in the determination of girder strength. For the case study, both the interframe and compartment behavior of the case study box girders are compared. The results are also compared with nonlinear finite element analyses of the box girders. The nonlinear finite element method is being increasingly applied to predict hull girder progressive collapse and, provided computation time is acceptable, will predict collapse modes over an entire compartment.

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{and other}} high {{dimensional}} analyses often require one to summarize multiple related variables {{by a single}} representative. This task is also variously referred to as collapsing, combining, reducing, or aggregating variables. Examples include summarizing several probe measurements corresponding to a single gene, representing the expression profiles of a co-expression module by a single expression profile, and aggregating cell-type marker information to de-convolute expression data. Several standard statistical summary techniques can be used, but network methods also provide useful alternative methods to find representatives. Currently few collapsing functions are developed and widely applied. Results We introduce the R function collapseRows that implements several <b>collapsing</b> <b>methods</b> and evaluate its performance in three applications. First, we study a crucial step of the meta-analysis of microarray data: the merging of independent gene expression data sets, {{which may have been}} measured on different platforms. Toward this end, we collapse multiple microarray probes for a single gene and then merge the data by gene identifier. We find that choosing the probe with the highest average expression leads to best between-study consistency. Second, we study methods for summarizing the gene expression profiles of a co-expression module. Several gene co-expression network analysis applications show that the optimal collapsing strategy depends on the analysis goal. Third, we study aggregating the information of cell type marker genes when the aim is to predict the abundance of cell types in a tissue sample based on gene expression data ("expression deconvolution"). We apply different <b>collapsing</b> <b>methods</b> to predict cell type abundances in peripheral human blood and in mixtures of blood cell lines. Interestingly, the most accurate prediction method involves choosing the most highly connected "hub" marker gene. Finally, to facilitate biological interpretation of collapsed gene lists, we introduce the function userListEnrichment, which assesses the enrichment of gene lists for known brain and blood cell type markers, and for other published biological pathways. Conclusions The R function collapseRows implements several standard and network-based <b>collapsing</b> <b>methods.</b> In various genomic applications we provide evidence that both types of methods are robust and biologically relevant tools. </p...|$|R

40|$|Association {{studies using}} tag SNPs have been {{successful}} in detecting disease-associated common variants. However, common variants, with rare exceptions, explain only at most 5 – 10 % of the heritability resulting from genetic factors, which leads to the common disease/rare variants assumption. Indeed, recent studies using sequencing technologies have demonstrated that common diseases can be due to rare variants that could not be systematically studied earlier. Unfortunately, methods for common variants are not optimal if applied to rare variants. To identify rare variants that affect disease risk, several investigators have designed new approaches based on the idea of collapsing different rare variants inside the same genomic block (e. g., the same gene or pathway) to enrich the signal. Here, we consider three different <b>collapsing</b> <b>methods</b> in the multimarker regression model and compared their performance on the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data using the consistency of results across different simulations and the cross-validation prediction error rate. The comparison shows that the proportion <b>collapsing</b> <b>method</b> seems to outperform the other two methods and can find both truly associated rare and common variants. Moreover, we explore one way of incorporating the functional annotations for the variants in the data that collapses nonsynonymous and synonymous variants separately to allow for different penalties on them. The incorporation of functional annotations led to higher sensitivity and specificity levels when the detection results were compared with the answer sheet.

40|$|Although whole-genome {{association}} {{studies using}} tagSNPs are a powerful approach for detecting common variants, they are underpowered for detecting associations with rare variants. Recent {{studies have demonstrated}} that common diseases can be due to functional variants with a wide spectrum of allele frequencies, ranging from rare to common.

The development of cost-effective sequencing technologies enables association studies to use sequence data from candidate genes and, in the future, from the entire genome.

Due to a modest marginal effect size or the rarity of the CNVs, collapsing rare CNVs together and collectively evaluating their effect serves as a key approach to evaluating the collective effect of rare CNVs on disease risk. While a pleth-ora of powerful <b>collapsing</b> <b>methods</b> are available for sequence variants (e. g., SNPs) in asso-ciation analysis, these methods cannot be directly applied to rare CNVs due to the CNV-specific challenges, i. e., the multi-faceted nature of CNV polymorphisms (e. g., CNVs vary in size, type, dosage, and details of gene disruption), and etiological heterogeneity (e. g., heterogeneous effects of duplications and deletions that occur within a locus or in different loci).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comprehensive}} summary of four papers on the development and application of new strategies for locating tremor and relocating events in earthquake catalogs. In the first paper, two new strategies for relocating events in a catalog are introduced. The seismicity pattern of an earthquake catalog {{is often used to}} delineate seismically active faults. However, the delineation is often hindered by the diffuseness of earthquake locations in the catalog. To reduce the diffuseness and simplify the seismicity pattern, a relocation and a <b>collapsing</b> <b>method</b> are developed and applied. The relocation method uses the catalog event density as an a priori constraint for relocations in a Bayesian inversion. The catalog event density is expressed in terms of the combined probability distribution of all events in the catalog. The <b>collapsing</b> <b>method</b> uses the same catalog density as an attractor for focusing the seismicity in an iterative scheme. These two strategies are applied to an aftershock sequence after a pair of earthquakes which occurred in southwest Iceland, 2008. The seismicity pattern is simplified by application of the methods and the faults of the mainshocks are delineated by the reworked catalog. In the second paper, the spatial distribution of seismicity of the Hengill region, southwest Iceland is analyzed. The relocation and <b>collapsing</b> <b>methods</b> developed in the first paper and a non-linear relocation strategy using empirical traveltime tables are used to process a catalog collected by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The reworked catalog reproduces details of the spatial distribution of seismicity that independently emerges from relative relocations of a small subset of the catalog events. The processed catalog is then used to estimate the depth to the brittle-ductile transition. The estimates show that in general {{the northern part of the}} area, dominated by volcanic processes, has a shallower depth than the southern part, where tectonic deformation predominates. In the third and the fourth papers, two back-projection methods using inter-station cross correlations are proposed for locating tremor sources. For the first method, double correlations, defined as the cross correlations of correlations from two station pairs sharing a common reference station, are back projected. For the second method, the products of correlation envelopes from a group of stations sharing a common reference station are back projected. Back projecting these combinations of correlations, instead of single correlations, suppresses random noise and reduces the strong geometrical signature caused by the station configuration. These two methods are tested with volcanic tremor at Katla volcano, Iceland. The inferred source locations agree with surface observations related to volcanic events which occurred during the tremor period...|$|R

We used absolute, differential catalog and differential cross-correlation times obtained from the reservoir’s September and October 1993 hydraulic stimulations along with starting event locations obtained using Joint Hypocenter Determination and <b>Collapsing</b> <b>methods.</b> The stimulations produced over 12000 microseismic events of which we chose 8930 for further analysis. We obtained high accuracy crosscorrelation differential times and then performed a double-difference tomographic inversion to jointly invert for velocity structure and event locations. It is shown through {{a detailed analysis of}} model and data residuals vs smoothing weight, ray path derivative weighted sums, and a synthetic checkerboard test that the double-difference inversion is able to produce interpretable results despite the poor source-receiver geometry employed in the study. The results show that velocity structure for S-waves correlates well with seismicity and show the expected low velocity zones at depths between 2900 and 3600 meters, where fluid was believed to have infiltrated the reservoir. P-wave velocity structure shows less of a correlation with seismicity and shows low velocity zones at shallow depths where no water was believed to have entered the reservoir. Between 2900 and 3600 meters the P-wave velocity structure shows high velocity zones near the injection well. The results also show the NNW-SSE trend of event location clusters and velocity structure which lines up with the maximum horizontal stress orientation.

Furthermore, using the data <b>collapsing</b> <b>method</b> we show that the normalized mean Hamming distance between the master string and the entire population, as well as the properly scaled fluctuations around this mean value, follow universal forms in the critical region.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the introduction of}} structural assessment technology into onboard tools in response to incidents such as grounding and demonstrates how the tool {{can be used to}} assess an emergency scenario. A number of assessment techniques are demonstrated including a progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>method</b> used to analyse the longitudinal strength of the hull girder and fatigue methods are also incorporated to allow the management of any cracks that may occur in the structure as a result of damage or during operation. The information produced by the tool augments the extensive damage control training provided to Royal Navy crew extending the capability to assess scenarios to identify potential recovery plans or whether further failures will result in the lost of the ship...|$|R
40|$|We offer {{predictions}} of symmetron modified gravity {{in the neighborhood}} of realistic dark matter halos. The predictions for the fifth force (FF) are obtained by solving the nonlinear symmetron equation of motion in the spherical NFW approximation. We compare the three major known screening mechanisms: Vainshtein, Chameleon, and Symmetron around such dark matter sources, emphasizing the significant differences between them and highlighting observational tests which exploit these differences. In addition to halos, we investigate the behavior of the FF in voids in chameleon modified gravity models using the spherical <b>collapse</b> <b>method.</b> The FF can be many times larger than the Newtonian force. This {{is very different from the}} case in halos, where the FF is no more than 1 / 3 of gravity. Individual voids in chameleon models grow larger by 10...|$|R
