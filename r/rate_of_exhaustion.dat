40|$|Without {{the input}} of {{fertiliser}} nitrogen {{it is estimated that}} only about half of the current global population can be supplied with sufficient food energy and protein. The anticipated increase in the population to 2050 will increase the dependency on fertiliser inputs. The paper examines the different potential sources of energy and hydrogen required for this essential fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into plant-available nitrogenous fertiliser and concludes that methane from natural gas is clearly the most suitable source. In the absence of a cost-effective alternative source of hydrogen it is recommended that an on-going requirement for methane is acknowledged and that consideration be given to strategic reserves for the production of food. Phosphorus is also an essential and unsubstitutable nutrient for plants and animals, but while the global reserves of atmospheric nitrogen are effectively unlimited, the reserves of phosphate rock are finite. Recent estimates of the reserve suggest that at the current rate of use this resource will become exhausted within some hundreds of years. The annual increment of phosphorus contained in the human population is estimated to be in the order of 1 Mt/yr, which is a small proportion of the quantity mined. There is a clear requirement to ensure that phosphorus is recycled to a large extent, so that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> of the reserves of phosphate rock is significantly reduced.

The authors test the hypotheses that the swimming endurance of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) is independent of fish size and water temperature. Using a swimming flume, swimming endurance was examined across a range of fish sizes (14 – 44 cm) and water temperatures (" 0. 2 to 9. 7) C). All trials were conducted at a swimming speed of 0. 30 ms" 1. This is comparable to the swimming speeds required by flatfish during herding by bottom-trawl sweeps. The data were analysed using failure time (survival) analysis, a more robust statistical technique for endurance-type data. The advantage of this technique over traditional regression analyses is that censored observations can be included in the analysis. An important distinction, however, is that the dependent variable being modelled was not endurance per se, but the instantaneous <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> or hazard rate at a given time t. The results showed that both fish length and water temperature had a negative eVect on the endurance hazard rate. This is equivalent to an increase in the probability of American plaice achieving a given endurance with increasing fish length and water temperature. This was suYcient evidence to reject the null hypotheses that the swimming endurance of American plaice is independent of these variables. Probability curves for the distances the fish would be capable of swimming were calculated for diVerent fish sizes and water temperatures. The findings suggest that the herding eYciency of American plaice by bottom-trawl sweeps may be largely size- and temperature-dependent...|$|E

40|$|The use of PP fibres in apparel {{industry}} is limited {{due to the}} poor dyeability of PP in exhaust-dyeing processes. One reason for the poor dyeing behaviour is the hydrophobic surface of PP, which is only hardly wettable with aqueous dye solutions. Another reason is the low wet fastness, {{as a result of}} the minor ability of PP to fix the dyestuff within the fibres. Consequently, a process has to be applied, which increases the surface wettability and additionally, improves the dyestuff-fibre interaction. Suitable environmentally friendly methods to hydrophilise PP surfaces are microwave-induced low temperature plasmas as well as barrier discharges. The aim of this study was to investigate the plasma-induced hydrophilisation of PP fibres for improving their dyeability. The wettability behaviour of both PP foils and fibres are quite comparable. The wettability of the PP surface increases with increasing treatment time in oxygen plasma and barrier discharge, respectively. The influence of different power levels on the resulting contact angle of the fibre surface is negligible. During storage at atmosphere the wettability of the treated PP fibres decreases with proceeding storage time, whereas storage in water does not affect the contact angles. The plasma-induced improvement of the surface wettability is not only due to the insertion of oxygen containing groups, but can also be attributed to the modification of the surface topography, which was investigated by profilometric measurements. The decreasing contact angle of PP fibres with prolonged treatment in an oxygen plasma correlates with an increased surface roughness of the material. The dye-uptake of the disperse dye Resolin Red FB and the solvent dyes Sudan Blue II and Sudan Red B on plasma treated PP fibres was investigated. Dyeing the oxygen plasma treated fibres for 60 min leads to a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> of the dyestuffs compared to the untreated material, which is attributed to the plasma-induced surface modification of the fibres. Due to the lower degree of hydrophilisation of the barrier discharge treated fibres, no higher dye uptake was achieved. The diffusion coefficients of fibres treated by oxygen plasma or barrier discharge, calculated by the root-t-law, are increased. The increased dye uptake on the oxygen plasma treated fibres also lead to an enhanced colour strength, compared to the dyed untreated fibre. With an extended treatment time a higher colour strength is detected, which correlates with the improved wettability of the fibre at proceeding exposure duration in oxygen plasma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Biathlon is a {{traditional}} Olympic winter sport combining cross-country skiing using the skating technique with rifle shooting. Thus, biathlon is a complex sport, {{that in addition to}} a high endurance capacity and efficient skiing technique, demands rapid and accurate shooting performed directly after intense exercise. There exist only a few studies on biathlon today, and in particular analysis of high-level competitions are lacking. Purpose: The present study was designed to investigate a sprint biathlon competition with respect to the contribution of XC skiing and shooting performance on the overall biathlon performance, as well as the relationship to laboratory determinants of performance obtained during treadmill roller skiing. Methods: Eleven elite male biathletes were tracked by a global positioning system (GPS) device and heart-rate monitor during an international sprint biathlon competition. Within a period of 6 weeks prior to the competition, the participants completed laboratory testing while submaximal and maximal roller skiing on a treadmill. Results: (1) the XC skiing and shooting performance explained 84 % and 14 %, whereas shooting time and range time together explained 2 % of the overall performance, respectively (all p < 0. 01), (2) time in uphill terrain explained 91 % of the variation in XC skiing performance (p < 0. 01), (3) the shooting performance was not significantly correlated with the biathletes pacing towards shooting, the intensity of exercise or shooting time, and (4) relative heart-rate and <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>exhaustion</b> during submaximal, and time to exhaustion during maximal roller skiing in the laboratory correlated significantly with the XC skiing performance, as well as time in different terrains (r = 0. 64 - 0. 95, all p < 0. 05).

40|$|Is {{there an}} {{association}} {{between the number of}} CGG repeats in the FMR 1 gene in the normal and intermediate range and age at natural menopause? The number of CGG repeats in the normal and intermediate range in the FMR 1 gene was not associated with age at natural menopause. Excessive triple CGG repeats in the FMR 1 gene have been widely associated with primary ovarian insufficiency. Recently, the number of CGG repeats in the normal and intermediate range (up to 55 repeats) was found to be associated with serum levels of anti-Mllerian hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, as markers for ovarian ageing. This suggests that repeats in the normal and intermediate range could be involved in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> of the ovarian primordial follicle pool and ultimately the timing of menopause. Cross-sectional study in a population-based sample of 3611 Caucasian women with natural menopause. The FMR 1 CGG repeat number was determined by PCR amplification in 3611 women with a known age at natural menopause. A possible relation between CGG repeats in the normal and intermediate range (up to 55 repeats) and menopausal age were analysed in various ways, including linear regression analysis and analysis of variance. The number of CGG repeats in the normal and intermediate range in the FMR 1 gene was not associated with age at natural menopause. The mean age at menopause was 50. 30 (4. 2) years for women with 45 repeats and 50. 64 (3. 4) years for women with intermediate-sized repeats (P 0. 37). Linear regression analysis of the number of CGG repeats showed no association with menopausal age (0. 019, P 0. 16). In our cohort, age at menopause was self-reported and determined retrospectively. Earlier observations suggesting that the number of CGG repeats in the normal and intermediate range is associated with the individual variation of the ovarian ageing process could not be confirmed in the current, large sample size study. A relation between the number of CGG repeats in the normal and intermediate range and age at natural menopause appeared to be absent.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{kinetics}} of the application and washing process of two different functionalized silicones on cotton fabric. The first, a polyquaternary polysiloxane - blockcopolymer, interacts by hydrogen bonding to the hydroxyl-groups of the cotton fibre. The second, a reactive functionalized polyquaternary polysiloxane-block-copolymer consists of uretdione functions, which can react with either the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose or with OH-groups of the silicone to form a silicone network. In this work the kinetic aspects of the finishing and washing process are decribed. The first examinations to analyse the application process were done using a fluorescent ammonium functionalized silicone softener. This modification allows measurements of the silicone concentration in the bath during the application by photometric detection. The fibre cross section could be analysed by fluorescence microscopy during the application process. The bath analysis shows that the application process follows a sorption isotherm described by Langmuir. The examinations by fluorescence microscopy show {{a change in the}} cross section of the fibre towards an oval shape after treatment and a diffusion of the silicone polymer into the lumen. The examination of the fiber surface during the application process with a non fluorescent modified silicon polymer was accomplished by XPS. The changes in the concentration of silicone in the bath were measured by photometric detection after reaction of the ammonium groups of the silicone with bromophenol blue. The kinetics can be described by the square-root-t-relation. The resulting rate constants do not differ significantly for different bath temperatures. The examinations by XPS and IR-spectroscopy of the washing process showed a diffusion of the silicone molecules from the core {{to the surface of the}} fibre, where they are removed by the surfactants of the washing bath. XPS results show that after one washing cycle the silicone concentration on the surface stays almost constant. The IR-spectroscopic examinations indicate a continuous decrease of silicone in the fibre. In parallel to the spectroscopic analysis of the fiber surface the changes in the silicone concentration in the bath were analysed by photometric detection. The examinations showed a square-root-t-relation for the washing process. In another part the influence of the silicone treatment to the evenness of the coloration of a yellow dyed cotton skirt was examined by datacolor measurement and CIELAB interpretation. Further examinations showed that an overdose of silicone during the finishing causes discoloration which is an undesirable effect. In this part, the application process of the reactive functionalized polyquaternary polysiloxane-block-copolymer silicone was examined by fluorescent microscopy. In a similar manner to the non-reactive silicones, the reactive silicones diffuse into the fibre, but in this case but no change in fiber cross section could be observed. The amount of applied silicone on the fiber was much lower compared with the fibers treated with the non-reactive silicone. The kinetics of the application process follows a square root-t- relation. The rate constants are very similar to those for the non-reactive silicone polymers. It is likely that the silicones build a charged layer in the pores of the cotton fibre, which repels any further silicone molecules diffusing into the pores. That implies that no further molecules can diffuse into the pores, which is proven by a very low swelling of the fibre and a very low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion.</b> The improved washing resistance in comparison to the non-reactive silicones is due to the chemical bonding to the fibre, which is much stronger than for the non-reactive silicone...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A goal of {{extending}} {{the duration of}} unemployment insurance (UI) in recessions {{is to reduce the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> benefit <b>exhaustion</b> and hence increase coverage. However, such extensions potentially come at the cost of increased nonemployment durations. If UI benefit durations vary with the business cycle, {{it is very difficult to}} estimate the effects of this policy because of reverse causality. In this paper, we exploit the fact that the duration of UI benefits in Germany is a function of exact age that is invariant over the cycle. Using the universe of unemployment spells and career histories we implement a regression discontinuity design separately for twenty years and across industries and correlate our estimates with measures of the business cycle. The nonemployment effects of UI extensions we find are at best somewhat declining in large recessions.

For the parameter values considered, resource prices increase over time, and extractions, output, and utility decline over time until a steady-state is reached. Decreasing the intertemporal elasticity of substitution or raising consumers' subjective discount <b>rate</b> hastens <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> the resource stock.

50|$|The {{choice of}} {{pictorial}} designs {{is governed by}} a combination of anniversaries, required annual issues (such as Christmas stamps), postal <b>rate</b> changes, <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> existing stamp stocks, and popular demand. Since postal administrations are either a branch of government or an official monopoly under governmental supervision, the government has ultimate control over the choice of designs. This means that the designs tend to depict a country as the government would like it to be perceived, rather than as it really is. The Soviet Union issued thousands of stamps extolling the successes of communism, even as it was falling apart, while in the US the only contemporary stamp hinting at the unrest of the 1960s is an issue exhorting Americans to support their local police.|$|R
40|$|Fatigue induces {{changes to}} running form; {{therefore}} movement {{is not as}} effective or efficient. Reducing the amount of fatigue or its effects on form would be ideal to improve performance while running. Compressive clothing has unknown effects on musculature, however it claims to reduce fatigue. The {{aim of this study}} was to see the changes in running form while running to exhaustion and to see how compression tights can effect these changes. Eleven runners ran at their current five-kilometer race pace on a treadmill to voluntary exhaustion in a repeated measures design wearing compression tights and regular shorts while their kinematics, kinetics, heart <b>rate</b> and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>exhaustion</b> were recorded. There was not a significant difference in time to exhaustion. Fatigue general effects were significant from beginning to end in knee and ankle angle at initial contact with the knee becoming less extended and the ankle less dorsiflexed. Vertical ground reaction loading rate and impact peak were significantly different from beginning to mid point and beginning to end across conditions. Heart <b>rate</b> and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> perceived exertion increased significantly with fatigue as well in both conditions. Condition effects were significant in stride length and rate with a decreased stride length with compression tights and an increased stride rate with compression tights. The hip experienced a decreased range of motion in the compression tights compared to running shorts. These results indicate that there are effects of fatigue on performance and differences between conditions. These differences did not affect the overall outcome of run as measured in time to <b>exhaustion.</b> School <b>of</b> Physical Education, Sport, and Exercise ScienceThesis (M. S. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> biomass {{production}} is optimised for a prede 0 ned feed exhaustion using the residue ratio as {{a degree of}} freedom. Three modes of operation are considered: continuous, repeated batch, and repeated fed-batch operation. By means of the Production Curve, the transition points of the optimal modes of operation are derived. The analytical expressions of these transitions for variable bioreaction kinetic parameters are determined. The key measures “degree of di 7 culty of conversion ” and “degree <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> ” are introduced to de 0 ne the optimal modes in more general terms. The “degree of di 7 culty ” describes the e,ect of the kinetic parameters and the feed substrate concentration on the conversion; the “degree <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> ” describes the desired 0 nal condition.
