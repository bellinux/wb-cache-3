50|$|A Benchtop nuclear {{magnetic}} <b>resonance</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (Benchtop NMR spectrometer) {{refers to}} a Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer that is significantly more compact and portable than the conventional equivalents, such that it is portable and can reside on a laboratory benchtop. This convenience comes from using permanent magnets, which have a lower magnetic field and decreased sensitivity compared to the much larger and more expensive cryogen cooled superconducting NMR magnets. Instead of requiring dedicated infrastructure, rooms and extensive installations these benchtop instruments can be placed directly on the bench in a lab and moved as necessary (e.g., to the fumehood). These spectrometers offer improved workflow, even for novice users, as they are simpler and easy to use. They differ from relaxometers in {{that they can be}} used to measure high resolution NMR spectra and are not limited to the determination of relaxation or diffusion parameters (e.g., T1, T2 and D).|$|E
50|$|Dipen Sinha of the Los Alamos National Laboratory {{developed}} ARS in 1989. Most {{published work}} in acoustics {{has been in}} the ultrasonic region and their instrumentation has dealt with propagation through a medium and not a resonance effect. One of the first, if not the first publication related to acoustic resonance was in 1988 in the journal of Applied Spectroscopy. The researchers designed a V shaped quartz rod instrument that utilized ultrasonic waves to obtain signatures of microliters of different liquids. The researchers did not have any type of classification statistics or identification protocols; the researchers simply observed ultrasonic resonance signatures with these different materials. Specifically, Sinha was working on developing an ARS instrument that can detect nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. By 1996, he had successfully developed a portable ARS unit {{that can be used in}} a battlefield. The unit can detect and identify deadly chemicals that are stored in containers in matter of minutes. In addition, the instrument was further developed by a different research group (Dr. Robert Lodder, University of Kentucky) and their work was also published in Applied Spectroscopy. The researchers created a V-shaped instrument that could breach the sonic and ultrasonic regions creating more versatility. The term acoustic <b>resonance</b> <b>spectrometer</b> was coined for the V-shaped spectrometer as well. Since the study in 1994, the ARS has evolved and been used to differentiate wood species, differentiate pharmaceutical tablets, determine burn rates and determine dissolution rates of tablets. In 2007 Analytical Chemistry featured the past and current work of the lab of Dr. Lodder discussing the potential of acoustics in the analytical chemistry and engineering fields.|$|E

50|$|NMR spectrometers are {{relatively}} expensive; universities usually have them, {{but they are}} less common in private companies. Modern NMR spectrometers have a very strong, large and expensive liquid helium-cooled superconducting magnet, because resolution directly depends on magnetic field strength. Less expensive machines using permanent magnets and lower resolution are also available, which still give sufficient performance for certain application such as reaction monitoring and quick checking of samples. There are even benchtop nuclear magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>spectrometers.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{technique}} using a cavity-based <b>resonance</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{to quantify the}} anti-damping torque due to the spin Hall effect. Modification of ferromagnetic resonance is observed {{as a function of}} small DC current in sub-mm-wide strips of bilayers, consisting of magnetically soft FeGaB and strong spin-Hall metal Ta. From the detected current-induced linewidth change, we obtain an effective spin Hall angle of 0. 08 - 0. 09 independent of the magnetic layer thickness.

2500|$|In {{its first}} few decades, nuclear {{magnetic}} <b>resonance</b> <b>spectrometers</b> used a technique known as continuous-wave spectroscopy (CW spectroscopy).

50|$|Technological {{applications}} {{could benefit}} from both the higher critical temperature being above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen and also the higher critical magnetic field (and critical current density) at which superconductivity is destroyed. In magnet applications, the high critical magnetic field may prove more valuable than the high Tc itself. Some cuprates have an upper critical field of about 100 tesla. However, cuprate materials are brittle ceramics which are expensive to manufacture and not easily turned into wires or other useful shapes. Also, high-temperature superconductors do not form large, continuous superconducting domains, but only clusters of microdomains within which superconductivity occurs. They are therefore unsuitable for applications requiring actual superconducted currents, such as magnets for magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>spectrometers.</b>|$|R
