40|$|Soil {{moisture}} content and dry density of unbound granular pavement materials are important properties for compaction control that influence pavement performance under cyclic loading. Under these loading conditions, increasing {{moisture content}} can accelerate {{significant changes in}} density. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a method for measuring the moisture content and density of soils with <b>rod</b> <b>probe</b> sensors. This paper introduces new calibration functions for TDR measurements using these <b>rod</b> <b>probe</b> sensors embedded in the soil. TDR measurements were taken in the laboratory for a typical road base material at two basically different conditions: at constant moisture content with different dry densities and at constant dry density with different moisture contents. In this study, a relationship was developed between the voltage drop occurring for the passage of an electromagnetic wave through the soil and the bulk density. The permittivity of the soil sample obtained from the travel time of TDR signals was {{used to calculate the}} volumetric moisture content. Finally, the gravimetric moisture content was obtained from the volumetric moisture content and bulk density relationship. For the validation of the calibration functions, <b>rod</b> <b>probe</b> sensors were installed in a road to obtain in situ moisture content and density under field conditions. Laboratory results indicate that the calibration functions are independent of moisture and density, and the field test shows the applicability of the method. The newly developed calibration functions allow for the monitoring of the long-term pavement performance, leading {{to a better understanding of}} the time-dependent evolution of, for example, rutting of roads...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic {{impacting}} penetrators (USIPs) are recent {{additions to}} the series of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corers (USDCs). A USIP enables a <b>rod</b> <b>probe</b> to penetrate packed soil or another substance of similar consistency, without need to apply a large axial force {{that could result in}} buckling of the probe or in damage to some buried objects. USIPs were conceived for use in probing and analyzing soil to depths of tens of centimeters in the vicinity of buried barrels containing toxic waste, without causing rupture of the barrels. USIPs could also be used for other purposes, including, for example, searching for pipes, barrels, or other hard objects buried in soil; and detecting land mines. USDCs and other apparatuses based on USDCs have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. The ones reported previously were designed, variously, for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. To recapitulate: A USDC can be characterized as a lightweight, low-power, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a tool bit. As shown in the figure, a basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, a backing and a horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can slide axially a short distance between the horn and the shoulder of tool bit), and a tool bit, i. e., probe for USIP. The piezoelectric stack is driven at the resonance frequency of the stack/horn/backing assembly to create ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. To prevent fracture during operation, the piezoelectric stack is held in compression by a bolt. The bouncing of the free mass between the horn and the tool bit at sonic frequencies generates hammering actions to the bit that are more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations in ordinary ultrasonic drills. The hammering actions are so effective that the axial force needed to make the tool bit advance into the material of interest is much smaller than in ordinary twist drilling, ultrasonic drilling, or ordinary steady pushing...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{developed}} for measuring in-place density and moisture content of soil using {{the technique of}} Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR). The method is applicable for construction control of earthworks. The method is extended for measuring moisture content of soil in the laboratory and {{in the field for}} various other geotechnical purposes. Laboratory uses include measuring moisture content of soil in compaction molds; field uses include measuring moisture content of soil in Shelby tubes and soil retrieved during drilling and sampling operations. In the course of achieving these goals, this study develops the principles of TDR probe design, test methodology, and relationships of TDR measured dielectric constant with density and moisture content of soil. TDR was originally developed to locate faults in cables and transmission lines. For the last 20 years, it has also been used (mostly in soil science) to measure the volumetric moisture content of soil by using its capability of measuring density of soil and extends the use of TDR for measuring moisture content of soil for various geotechnical purposes. In order to achieve these goals, this work develops various transmission lines/ probes and devices. It develops coaxial transmission line (CTL) probes, composed of coaxial apparatus (CA) and cylindrical cells (CC). It develops multiple <b>rod</b> <b>probes</b> (MRP) which extend the capabilities of existing multiple <b>rod</b> <b>probes.</b> Analytical and experimental investigations are made to design different parameters of the probes. Investigations are carried out to study the effect of <b>probe</b> <b>rod</b> installation on measurements and experimental methods. Experiments are conducted to develop calibration equations to relate dielectric constant with moisture content and density of soil. The work describes how the TDR method can be used to measure in-situ density and moisture content of soil. The procedure makes use of the designed probes and devices. The concept behind measuring both in-situ density and moisture content is that with a MRP and the TDR instrument, the dielectric constant is measured in-situ. A sample of soil in-situ is then quickly placed in a cylindrical cell (CC) with the assumption that moisture content does not change. In the CC, the soil density and dielectric constant is measured, the former with an electronic balance and the latter with an appropriate coaxial apparatus (CA) and the TDR instrument. With the dielectric constant and density, the moisture content of the soil in the CC is determined by use of known and developed relationships. Again, with the dielectric constant and the density of the soil in the CC and the dielectric constant of the soil in-situ, and with the assumption that the moisture content of soil in-situ is identical to the moisture content of the soil in the CC, it is possible to calculate the in-situ density by use of developed relationships. Significant testing of the procedures on a variety of soil types, along with comparisons with other measures of density and oven dry moisture content indicates that this new method is quick, safe and sufficiently accurate for measuring in place density and moisture content of soil. The use of the methods and the devices (CTL and MRP) are extended to measure moisture content of soil for various other geotechnical purposes. Laboratory compaction mold and Shelby tubes serve as CCs where density are measured using conventional methods and moisture content are measured using CAs and MRPs. A specially designed coaxial transmission line (CTL) can measure moisture content of a soil sample retrieved during drilling operations. Experimental results show that these methods provide accurate measurement of moisture content of soils...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} low {{temperature}} scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and {{atomic force microscopy}} (LT-STM/STS and AFM) studies on colloidal semiconductor and graphene quantum dots (g-QDs). These nanostructures are interesting because they show tunable electrical and optical properties due to the quantum confinement effect. The high spatial resolution of scanning probe microscopy {{makes it possible to}} measure the topography and the electronic properties of individual QDs. In addition to the experiments on the different types of QDs, this thesis also includes our experiments on the moiré pattern of an epitaxial graphene monolayer on Ir(111) and the measurement of the intermolecular interaction between two carbon monoxide molecules probed with the frequency modulation AFM (FM-AFM). In the first chapter, we give a general introduction to the working principles of STM/STS and FM-AFM. In addition, we introduce the basic concepts of double barrier tunneling junction, electron-phonon coupling in semiconductor nanocrystals and the use of a tuning fork force sensor in AFM. In chapter 2, we discuss electron-phonon coupling in CdSe quantum dots (spheres and <b>rods)</b> <b>probed</b> by LT-STM. We resolve the polaronic states of the QDs, which are induced by the coupling between the tunneling electrons and longitudinal optical phonons. Our data show how the electron-phonon coupling strength depends on the orbital envelope function in these QDs and how the conductance spectrum evolves from shell-tunneling into the shell-filling regime once the tip is placed closer to the sample. Numerical calculations based on a dielectric continuum model can reproduce the experimentally measured electron-phonon coupling strength. In chapter 3, we discuss the quantum transport properties of PbSe-CdSe core-shell QDs measured by LT-STM. We observed a series of equally spaced double resonances in the conductance spectra of these QDs. The phenomenon is explained by hole induced electron transport, the hole occupation in the PbSe core enabled by the strong and relatively symmetric potential barrier of the CdSe shell. In chapter 4, the moiré pattern of an epitaxial graphene monolayer on the Ir(111) surface investigated with tuning fork based FM-AFM is presented and discussed. We applied FM-AFM to measure the geometric corrugation of the moiré pattern more directly. In chapter 5, we present our investigation on the confined electronic states in g-QDs with atomically well defined structure on Ir(111). We map the spatially resolved tunneling conductance that allows us to visualize how the confined states evolve with the energy in real space. The low energy carriers still have a linear dispersion down to the smallest g-QDs we have measured (about 2 nm in diameter). Chapter 6 is devoted to the FM-AFM experiments on probing the intermolecular interaction between two carbon monoxide molecules. With one CO molecule attached to the AFM tip apex, we measure how the intermolecular interaction depends on the distance between the molecule on the tip and another molecule adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface. We found that at a close distance (few Å), there is a repulsive interaction induced by the Pauli repulsion between the electrons in the outer orbitals in these molecules...|$|R
40|$|In the {{subjective}} visual vertical (SVV) and {{the subjective}} haptic vertical (SHV) task, participants must judge the alignment of a <b>probe</b> <b>rod</b> with perceived gravitational vertical by sight or by touch. Previous {{research suggests that}} as the body is roll-tilted, SVV and SHV show a systematic, distinct pattern of errors, although reports vary. The purpose {{of this research was}} to identify whether SVV and SHV probe the same underlying representation of gravity. In Experiment 1, I confirmed that SVV and SHV errors are divergent by comparing the two measures in the same participants. In Experiment 2, I varied the tilt of the head and body separately and applied galvanic vestibular stimulation to introduce vestibular noise. I found these manipulations had differential effects on SVV and SHV. Experiment 3 showed that when neck afferents were stimulated, SVV and SHV integrate optimally, pointing to two distinct underlying estimates of gravity vertical...|$|R
