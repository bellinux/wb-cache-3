25|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (SEM) {{is a type of}} electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is scanned in a <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> pattern, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.|$|E
25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} basic data. With the helical-scan system, the radar dish was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal to brighten, producing a spot, or blip on the display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated in this sort of display.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two major}} {{varieties}} of knitting: weft knitting and warp knitting. In the more common weft knitting, the wales are perpendicular to {{the course of the}} yarn. [...] In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel. [...] In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding stitches to each wale in turn, moving across the fabric as in a <b>raster</b> <b>scan.</b> [...] By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale. [...] Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine. [...] Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.|$|E

2500|$|The early black-and {{white vector}} {{displays}} could somewhat distinguish for example a molecular structure from its surrounding electron density map for crystallographic structure solution work by drawing the molecule {{brighter than the}} map. [...] Color display makes them easier to tell apart. [...] During the 1970s two-color stroke-writing Penetron tubes were available, but not used in molecular computer graphics systems. [...] In about 1980 Evans & Sutherland made the first practical full-color vector displays for molecular graphics, typically attached to an E PS-2 or MPS (MPS or Multi-Picture-System refers to several displays using a common graphics processor rack) graphics processor. [...] This early color display (the CSM or Color-Shadow-Mask) was expensive (around $50,000), because it was originally engineered to withstand the shaking of a flight-simulator motion base and because the vector scan was driven by a pair (X,Y) of 1Kw amplifiers. These systems required frequent maintenance and the wise user signed a flat rate Service Contract with E The newer E PS-300 series graphics processors used less expensive color displays with <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> technology and the entire system could be purchased {{for less than the}} older CSM display alone.|$|E

A number of these also understood the color codes from the Tektronix 4105 <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> terminal, which added color to the original 4010 command set.

40|$|There are two {{digitizing}} techniques {{which are}} operable without human interpretation of contour-mapped data and which thus may be performed semi-automatically; line following and <b>raster</b> <b>scanning.</b> After {{a comparison of}} these techniques the author concentrates on <b>raster</b> <b>scanning,</b> as this technique facilitates creation of matrix data, the data structure most widely used in spatial analysis performed by digital computers. The author proposes the quantization method of computing matrix data and shows that quantized data may be used not only for overall computations but also to determine geometrical properties of surfaces - giving the possibility of error estimation-shown by the contour map. In particular such an approach enables pre-determination of a scanning parameter track spacing before digitizing to satisfy the required accuracy of analysis. The different aspects of utilising data obtained by <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> are discussed; storage, display in contour map form - the algorithm to produce the type of map where the contour lines pass exactly through the sample points taken during scanning is included...|$|R
40|$|The Delsarte-Goethals frame {{has been}} {{proposed}} for deterministic compressive sensing of sparse and compressible signals. Its performance in compressive imaging applications falls short of that obtained for arbitrary sparse vectors. Prior work has proposed specially tailored signal recovery algorithms that partition {{the recovery of the}} input vector into clustered and unclustered portions. In this paper we present a formal analysis of the Delsarte-Goethals frame that shows that its hampered performance in compressive imaging is due to the presence of clustered sparse vectors in its null space. Such a clustered structure is characteristic in commonly-used <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> of 2 -D wavelet representations. We also show that a simple randomized <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> of the wavelet coefficient vector can remedy these shortcomings, allowing the use of standard recovery algorithms. Additionally, we propose an alternative deterministic <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> that achieves similar recovery performance. Experimental results confirm the improvements in recovery performance for both the noiseless and noisy measurement regimes...|$|R
30|$|To {{present a}} {{comparison}} of the improvement in the scanning time, the pattern that scanned the object in Fig.  24 needed 27, 110 points for the probe to travel, while—considering the 4000  ×  4000 <b>scanning</b> area—a traditional <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> probe has to travel 16 million points to achieve the same results. This means this scanning time is 0.00169 of the traditional <b>raster</b> <b>scanning</b> time which means 590.2 times faster. Obviously, this great improvement is only achievable by using local scanning and in this case, an intelligent comprehensive method that covers all the situations of different objects.|$|R
5000|$|Vector {{displays}} are a now-obsolete {{alternative to}} <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> displays. In <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> displays, like in TV sets, {{the image is}} a grid of pixel spots and the CRT beam repeatedly sweeps the entire screen in a fixed horizontal pattern, regardless of which dots are turned on. Bitmap raster graphics requires much more memory than vector graphics. XGA-level 1024x768 black/white resolution requires 96 kilobytes of video refresh memory, 12 times more than a basic PDS-1.

5000|$|The red, green, {{and blue}} {{phosphors}} for each pixel are generally {{arranged in a}} triangular shape (sometimes called a [...] "triad"). For television use, modern displays (starting in the late 1960s) use rectangular slots instead of circular holes, improving brightness.

5000|$|In a <b>raster</b> <b>scan,</b> {{an image}} is {{subdivided}} into {{a sequence of}} (usually horizontal) strips known as [...] "scan lines". Each scan line can be transmitted {{in the form of}} an analog signal as it is read from the video source, as in television systems, or can be further divided into discrete pixels for processing in a computer system. This ordering of pixels by rows is known as raster order, or <b>raster</b> <b>scan</b> order. Analog television has discrete scan lines (discrete vertical resolution), but does not have discrete pixels (horizontal resolution) - it instead varies the signal continuously over the scan line. Thus, while the number of scan lines (vertical resolution) is unambiguously defined, the horizontal resolution is more approximate, according to how quickly the signal can change over the course of the scan line.|$|E
