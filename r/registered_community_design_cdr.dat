Press sources reported that customs officials across the European Union have seized inbound shipments of the product after the ruling, effectively locking it out of the key European market, and its listing was removed by online retailer Amazon.co.uk. Samsung stated it did not receive a notice of Apple's request to stop sales of its tablet.

40|$|In {{the face}} of growing levels of {{congestion}} and persistent air quality problems, planners increasingly see <b>community</b> <b>design</b> {{as a way of}} reducing automobile dependence. Because of growing levels of obesity and the attendant health problems, public health officials have also turned to <b>community</b> <b>design</b> as a way of increasing physical activity. Proponents from both camps argue that higher population and employment densities, greater mixes of land uses, more gridlike street networks, and better transit service contribute to lower levels of driving and higher levels of walking, and they cite numerous studies to support their cases. But most studies focus on the population as a whole, and few studies so far consider {{the ways in which the}} effect of <b>community</b> <b>design</b> might differ for particular segments of the population given their particular travel needs. As evidence of the complexity of women's travel accumulates, researchers have begun to explore what <b>community</b> <b>design</b> means for women, both the possibility that <b>community</b> <b>design</b> adds to their travel burden and the possibility that it can help to ease that burden. Women face significant concerns related to family, health, and safety that complicate their daily lives; these concerns contribute to their need for travel and to the constraints they face in attempting to meet those needs. <b>Communities</b> <b>designed</b> so that women must drive long distances to work, to daycare, to shopping, or to medical appointments add to the time and cost of meeting their personal and household needs. In contrast, <b>communities</b> <b>designed</b> for shorter driving distances and for modes other than driving may offer women the option of reducing the time and money they spend on travel. At this time, few questions have been answered and many questions remain, not only about the implications of <b>community</b> <b>design</b> for the travel of women but also about the relationship between <b>community</b> <b>design</b> and travel behavior more generally. As a step toward building a research agenda on the implications for women of the relationship between <b>community</b> <b>design</b> and travel behavior, the available literature is reviewed here, original data analysis is presented, and outstanding issues are discussed for the following questions: - What is <b>community</b> <b>design?</b> - How does <b>community</b> <b>design</b> affect travel behavior? - How might these effects differ for women? - Where do we go from here...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{introduction}} to legal protection of industrial design at EU level through <b>Community</b> <b>design,</b> and comparison of <b>Community</b> <b>design</b> {{with other types of}} legal protection available. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part explains the terms 'design' and 'Community design', while the second part compares <b>Community</b> <b>design</b> with other industrial design legal protection systems. The second part also provides a description of how both <b>Community</b> <b>design</b> and other legal protection systems may be applied concurrently. The first part opens with a definition of the term 'design', and then describes design's relation to intellectual property and industrial design rights. Afterwards, a brief overview of the legal regulation for industrial design protection at national, international, and EU level is presented, and a characterization of institutions that provide design protection at each of the levels, respectively, is given. The key element of {{the first part of the}} thesis is a detailed analysis of <b>Community</b> <b>design.</b> The terms 'registered' and 'unregistered Community design' are thoroughly defined, and their common features as well as differences are described. Furthermore, conditions necessary for <b>Community</b> <b>design</b> registration are listed. Finally, a description of the [...] ...|$|R
