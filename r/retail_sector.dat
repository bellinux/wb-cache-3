5|$|Arbroath has no {{sizeable}} employers {{outside of}} the public sector, with most workers commuting to Dundee. Arbroath itself has an economically active population of 9,192 people, with the public sector (21.8%) the largest employer of Arbroath residents closely followed by the manufacturing (16%) and <b>retail</b> <b>sector</b> (15.4%). The fishing industry accounts for 0.4% (fewer than 50 people) although the processing sector is considered separately under manufacturing and the figure of 50 people relates directly to the catching and support sectors.|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of retail sales is {{of paramount importance}} for retail organizations and retail policy-makers. This study examines the degrees of persistence and seasonality of various <b>retail</b> <b>sectors</b> using innovative seasonal and non-seasonal fractional integration and auto-regressive models. Adapting data from both the Australian and the US <b>retail</b> <b>sectors,</b> the results indicate that the impacts of seasonality and persistence are not consistent across the various <b>retail</b> <b>sectors.</b> It is also clear that retail sales forecasts are better explained in terms of a long memory model that incorporates both persistence and seasonal components...|$|R

Bo sought to balance {{the amount of attention}} given to foreign investors and domestic commercial institutions. He began tackling the imbalance from the <b>retail</b> <b>sector,</b> whose success up to that point was largely dependent on foreign companies. He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.|$|E
5|$|Originally an {{agricultural}} area noted for dairy farming, domestic spinning and weaving {{led to a}} considerable silk and, in the 20th century, cotton industry. Leigh also exploited the underlying coal measures particularly after the town {{was connected to the}} canals and railways. Leigh had an important engineering base. The legacy of Leigh's industrial past {{can be seen in the}} remaining red brick mills– some of which are listed buildings– although it is now a mainly residential town, with Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing packed around the town centre. Leigh's present-day economy is based largely on the <b>retail</b> <b>sector.</b>|$|E
5|$|Retail {{stores such as}} Wal-Mart and Lowe's {{serve the}} {{population}} with jobs and basic needs. The Chambersburg Mall with four anchor stores and about fifty smaller stores {{is located in the}} unincorporated village of Scotland, about four miles (6km) north of town on Interstate 81. Chambersburg's <b>retail</b> <b>sector</b> has grown quickly since 2006 with the opening of Target, Petsmart, Michaels, and Kohls near the newly built Exit 17 of Interstate 81. Several restaurants new to the region have also opened, including Sonic, Starbucks, T.G.I. Fridays, Red Robin, Fuddruckers, Ruby Tuesday, Panera Bread, Chipotle, Texas Roadhouse, Olive Garden, and Longhorn Steakhouse.|$|E

5|$|The British South Africa Company had {{reservations}} about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's {{resources to the}} war effort, {{in part because of}} its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The <b>retail</b> <b>sector</b> suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal ferrochrome. A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, tungsten, near Essexvale in southern Matabeleland in May 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and <b>retail</b> <b>sector</b> caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.|$|E

40|$|Employee gender {{characteristics}} vary {{among different}} <b>retail</b> <b>sectors.</b> For example, male dominated <b>retail</b> <b>sectors</b> such as hardware employ more male staff, while female dominated <b>retail</b> <b>sectors</b> such as cosmetics employ more female staff. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to explain such gender differences in retail employment. The data used for this study is a subset of the ‘Australia at Work’ survey, which is a longitudinal survey tracking the experiences of the Australian labour force via telephone interviews. In answering the research questions, a subset of telephone interview data from the ‘Australia at Work’ survey consisting of 702 respondents employed in the retail industry will be analysed. The results indicate that retail employment in Australia is dominated by females, and that certain <b>retail</b> <b>sectors</b> were found to have different employee gender characteristics. Managerial positions in retail were found to have only a slightly larger proportion of males, implying that there is little gender discrimination in retail managerial positions in Australia as compared to findings from the United Kingdom and the United States. Customers are likely to have preferences as to who they are being served by when shopping for specific products, affecting their purchase decisions and consequently the business performance of stores. Hence, managers can use such information in employment decision making to create a competitive advantage and increase profitability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} price {{transmission}} in a vertically-related set-up where the retail stage may exercise oligopoly and/or oligopsony power, an issue {{addressed by the}} UK anti-trust authority investigation of the food <b>retailing</b> <b>sector.</b> From a theoretical perspective, we set out simple tests {{that relate to the}} way in which market power may affect the transmission of shocks between retail and farm prices. Using price data for the UK beef market over the 1990 s, the empirical results confirm the presence of market power with oligopoly rather than oligopsony being the dominant characteristic of the UK food <b>retailing</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although the <b>retailing</b> <b>sector</b> {{is highly}} {{significant}} in post-fordist advanced capitalist societies, the sector {{has been largely}} ignored in the academic and professional journals. The limited published {{work in this area}} tends, by and large, to be descriptive rather than a theoretically informed analysis. This thesis adopts a theoretical framework derived mainly from the work of Harvey, Barras, Ducatel and Blomley, in an attempt to show that the causes of the locational shifts which have occurred in the <b>retailing</b> <b>sector</b> in Palmerston North over the last fourteen years are not necessarily unique to the location. It further points to ways in which future research may better theorise the retailing industry...|$|R
