5|$|Soviet <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> became, {{after the}} Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most {{developed}} in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> {{can be explained by the}} country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{there was}} {{discussion}} of a rapid transit extension from Kennedy to Scarborough City Centre. As multiple types of technologies were examined many politicians requested a subway extension instead of the then proposed streetcar line. Instead, a medium-capacity <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> system, known as the Scarborough RT was built.|$|E

In 1872, Drammen Line, going through Oslo West, and in 1879, Østfold Line going through Nordstrand opened, {{offering}} a limited rail service to those parts of the city. By 1875, Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS) opened the first horsecar trams. In 1894 electric trams were in service by Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES).|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian Development Bank {{has pledged}} {{to help in the}} {{construction}} of facilities to produce new generation freight cars and freight containers in Tikhvin, Russia and in Osipovichi, Belarus to respond to the increasing demand for <b>rail</b> <b>transport.</b> Projects have also been launched in Kazakhstan, as the landlocked country is highly dependent on railways for trade.|$|E
5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E

5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. <b>Rail</b> <b>transport</b> is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
5|$|Hadspen was an {{important}} stop on the coach route from Launceston to Deloraine from at least the 1840s. The coach service declined from when <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> started in Tasmania in the late 1860s. The State Government began operating a school bus from town, to Hagley, in the 1930s. Meander Valley Highway, formerly known as Bass Highway, passes through {{the edge of the}} town bypassing the old main street. Bass Highway, which connects Launceston, Burnie and Devonport, branches off from this east of the town at Travellers Rest and passes south of Hadspen.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, the Petitcodiac Tidal Power Company {{proposed}} a tidal power project. This {{called for a}} dam to be built between Hopewell Cape and Fort Folly Point. The company sold shares {{to raise funds for}} the project and a series of on-site and airborne studies were conducted by the federal government, but the project fell through by 1928. As <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an airmail service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{serviced}} by the LRT Line 1 and Line 2, which form the Manila Light Rail Transit System. Development of the railway system {{began in the}} 1970s under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, when Line 1 was built, making it the first light <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> in Southeast Asia. These systems are currently undergoing a multibillion-dollar expansion. Line 1 runs {{along the length of}} Taft Avenue (N170/R-2) and Rizal Avenue (N150/R-9), and Line 2 runs along Claro M. Recto Avenue (N145/C-1) and Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard (N180/R-6) from Santa Cruz, through Quezon City, up to Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Somerton {{dates back to}} the Anglo-Saxon era, when it was an {{important}} political and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined, despite being the county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century. Having lost county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining.|$|E
5|$|The inn {{was first}} {{licensed}} in 1844 {{and was at}} first successful. In only a few decades its fortunes declined when a rail line was built from Launceston, reaching nearby Carrick in 1869. The economy of <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> took goods and passengers away, forcing wagons from the road. This reduced the demand for coaching inns, {{and led to a}} general decline in traffic through and business in the town. As of 2004 it was run as a restaurant and, after a 2008 refurbishment, has been used for accommodation and a cooking school.|$|E
50|$|The end of {{nineteenth century}} {{was marked by}} the {{industrialisation}} and {{by the development of}} <b>rail</b> <b>transports.</b> During the Franco-Prussian war, Le Bourget was the site of an important battle and the castle of Ladoucette in Drancy was destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Sioux Center {{continues}} to have freight rail service. The BNSF Railway's main line runs parallel to U.S. Highway 75 through Sioux Center. There are several rail spurs and a BNSF equipment station. Grain is the main <b>rail</b> <b>transported</b> commodity.|$|R

5|$|A post-war {{review of}} <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> in the London area {{produced}} {{a report in}} 1946 that proposed many new lines and identified the Morden branch as being the most overcrowded section of the London Underground, needing additional capacity. To relieve the congestion {{and to provide a}} new service south of Morden, the report recommended construction of a second pair of tunnels beneath the northern line's tunnels from Tooting Broadway to Kennington and an extension from Morden to North Cheam. Trains using the existing tunnels would start and end at Tooting Broadway with the service in the new tunnels joining the existing tunnels to Morden. The extension to North Cheam would run in tunnel. Designated as routes 10 and 11, these proposals were not developed by the London Passenger Transport Board or its successor organisations.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved <b>rail</b> <b>transport</b> links and the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry of Transport convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the congestion problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion on the existing, mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry of Transport agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with <b>rail</b> <b>transport,</b> as {{the location of}} two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at {{what is now the}} SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country.|$|E
