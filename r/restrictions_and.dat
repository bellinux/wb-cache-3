5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E

40|$|<b>Restriction</b> <b>and</b> {{modification}} {{have been}} demonstrated in Streptococcus cremoris KH cells when infected by Streptococcus lactis C 2 phage (designated c 2) at an efficiency of plating of 2 × 10 − 7. The growth of c 2 phage through KH cells produces modified progeny phage capable of unrestricted growth on KH cells. The ability of single-colony isolates of S. cremoris KH cultures to restrict and modify c 2 phage {{was found to be}} variable. From 2 to 6. 5 % of colonies isolated were partially deficient in restrictive capacity, permitting a greater plaquing ability by c 2 phage of 1. 8 to 2. 9 log cycles. No completely restrictionless mutants were isolated from 1, 000 colonies examined. Mutants were shown to be deficient in both <b>restriction</b> <b>and</b> modification capabilities of the same specificity. The frequent occurrence of a genotypic change that resulted in the loss of both <b>restriction</b> <b>and</b> modification capacities indicated the involvement of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in genetically determining this specific <b>restriction</b> <b>and</b> modification system. S. cremoris KH was found to harbor 11 plasmid molecules, with molecular weights (× 106) estimated to be 50, 41, 24, 18, 10, 7. 4, 3. 3, 3. 0, 2. 8, 2. 5, and 1. 5. Of the 27 mutants examined, 25 were missing the 10 -megadalton plasmid. This consistent plasmid difference among the majority of mutants isolated supports the involvement of this plasmid in <b>restriction</b> <b>and</b> modification. Plasmid linkage of <b>restriction</b> <b>and</b> modification systems provides a genetic mechanism for the rapid development of phage-sensitive starter cultures due to the inherent instability of extrachromosomal elements...|$|R
