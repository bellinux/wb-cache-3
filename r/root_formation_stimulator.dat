To study the physiological function of Trp in auxin-related phenotypes, we examined the effect of Trp on lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation.</b> We found that Trp treatment enhanced lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> and, by screening for mutants in which the effect of Trp on lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> was enhanced, we isolated the mm 31 mutant.

40|$|Abstract: The root {{systems of}} higher plant consist of primary, lateral, and {{adventitious}} roots. There is a current hypothesis, named ‘root apical dominance’, that root-derived suppressor negatively regulates {{the formation of}} adventitious and lateral roots. According to this hypothesis, we have studied the mechanisms involved in the regulation of adventitious and lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation.</b> trans-zeatin riboside (ZR), one of cytokinin species, was identified in squash root xylem sap as a main suppressor of adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in cucumber, suggesting that ZR transported from root via xylem sap acts as an endogenous suppressor of hypocotyl adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in planta. Moreover, we isolated Arabidopsis mutant, wooden leg- 3 (wol- 3), for stimulated adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in intact plants. Analyses of wol- 3 mutant have revealed that cytokinin receptors are necessary for the primary and lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> via the formation of auxin-transporting vascular tissues in the hypocotyl, but not for adventitious roots. In this review, we discuss the relationship between cytokinin and adventitious and lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> is an {{important}} developmental component of root systems in vascular plants. Several regu-latory genes for lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> have been identified from recent studies mainly using Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we isolated two dominant mutant alleles, crane- 1 and crane- 2, which are defective in lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in Arabidopsis. The crane mutants have dramatically reduced lateral root and auxin-induced lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation,</b> indicat-ing that the crane mutations reduce auxin sensitivity. In addition, the crane mutants have pleiotropic phenotypes in the aerial shoots, including long hypocotyls when grown in the light, up-curled leaves and reduced fertility. The crane mutant phenotypes are caused by a gain-of-function mutation in domain II of IAA 18, {{a member of the}} Aux/IAA transcrip-tional repressor family which is expressed in almost all organs. In roots, IAA 18 promoter::GUS was expressed {{in the early stages of}} lateral root development. In the yeast two-hybrid system, IAA 18 interacts with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF 7) and ARF 19, transcriptional activators that positively regulate lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation.</b> Taken together, our results indicate that CRANE/IAA 18 is involved in lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in Arabidopsis, and suggest that it negatively regulates the activity of ARF 7 and ARF 19 for lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana is {{regulated}} by two related AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs, ARF 7 and ARF 19, which are transcriptional activators of early auxin response genes. The arf 7 arf 19 double knockout mutant is severely impaired in lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation.</b> Target-gene analysis in arf 7 arf 19 transgenic plants harboring inducible forms of ARF 7 and ARF 19 revealed that ARF 7 and ARF 19 directly regulate the auxin-mediated transcription of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN 16 /ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 -LIKE 18 (LBD 16 /ASL 18) and/or LBD 29 /ASL 16 in roots. Overexpression of LBD 16 /ASL 18 and LBD 29 /ASL 16 induces lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> {{in the absence}} of ARF 7 and ARF 19. These LBD/ASL proteins are localized in the nucleus, and dominant repression of LBD 16 /ASL 18 activity inhibits lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> and auxin-mediated gene expression, strongly suggesting that these LBD/ASLs function downstream of ARF 7 - and ARF 19 -dependent auxin signaling in lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation.</b> Our results reveal that ARFs regulate lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> via direct activation of LBD/ASLs in Arabidopsis...|$|R

40|$|In the {{agriculture}} industry, adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> is a core issue of plants asexual propagation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> is far beyond understanding. In present study {{we found that}} target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling {{plays a key role}} in adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in potato and Arabidopsis. The core components of TOR complex including TOR, RAPTOR, and LST 8 are highly conserved in potato, but the seedlings of potato are insensitive to rapamycin, implying FK 506 Binding Protein 12 KD (FKBP 12) lost the function to bridge the interaction of rapamycin and TOR in potato. To dissect TOR signaling in potato, the rapamycin hypersensitive potato plants (BP 12 -OE) were engineered by introducing yeast FKBP 12 (ScFKBP 12) into potato. We found that rapamycin can significantly attenuate the capability of adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> in BP 12 -OE potatoes. KU 63794 (KU, an active-site TOR inhibitor) combined with rapamycin can more significantly suppress adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> of BP 12 -OE potato than the single treatments, such as KU 63794 or rapamycin, indicating its synergistic inhibitory effects on potato adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation.</b> Furthermore, RNA-seq data showed that many genes associated with auxin signaling pathway were altered when BP 12 -OE potato seedlings were treated with rapamycin + KU, suggesting that TOR may play a major role in adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> via auxin signaling. The auxin receptor mutant tir 1 was sensitive to TOR inhibitors and the double and quadruple mutants including tir 1 afb 2, tir 1 afb 3, and tir 1 afb 1 afb 2 afb 3 displayed more sensitive to asTORis than single mutant tir 1. Consistently, overexpression of AtTIR 1 in Arabidopsis and potato can partially overcome the inhibitory effect of asTORis and promote adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> under asTORis treatments. These observations suggest that TOR signaling regulates adventitious <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> by mediating auxin signaling in Arabidopsis and potato...|$|R

40|$|Lateral root {{branching}} is {{a genetically}} defined and environmentally regulated process. Auxin {{is required for}} lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation,</b> and mutants that are altered in auxin synthesis, transport or signaling often have lateral root defects. Crosstalk between auxin and ethylene in root elongation has been demonstrated, but interactions between these hormones in the regulation of Arabidopsis lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation</b> are not well characterized. This study utilized Arabidopsis mutants altered in ethylene signaling and synthesis to explore the role of ethylene in lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation.</b> We find that enhanced ethylene synthesis or signaling, through the eto 1 - 1 and ctr 1 - 1 mutations, or {{through the application of}} 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), negatively impacts lateral <b>root</b> <b>formation,</b> and is reversible by treatment with the ethylene antagonist, silver nitrate.
