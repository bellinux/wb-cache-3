40|$|The {{usefulness}} {{and relevance}} of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through {{a review of}} empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs {{can be derived from}} fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of <b>reference</b> <b>directions</b> of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and <b>reference</b> <b>directions</b> may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5 - 10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use...|$|R

40|$|Size-based {{community}} and ecosystem metrics, such as mean body mass and {{the slopes of}} size spectra, have been proposed as indicators to support the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). These metrics show relatively consistent responses to size-selective exploitation, and " unexploited" indicator reference points may be predicted with models of size-structured foodwebs. Whereas unexploited reference points provide a baseline for assessing the relative magnitude of fishing impacts, target or limit reference points are needed to guide management. Values for target or limit reference points are difficult to justify on scientific grounds. However, given that fishing impacts in most ecosystems need to be reduced {{to meet the objectives}} of the EAFM, we argue that <b>reference</b> <b>directions</b> provide alternative medium-term management targets. We show that the power of surveys to detect trends consistent with <b>reference</b> <b>directions</b> depends on the range of body size classes included in the analysis. Selection of different size ranges will weight metrics to respond to the release of small fish from predation, the depletion of larger individuals as a consequence of exploitation, or both. Such weightings may not be consistent over time, because the differential vulnerability of larger species, within-population changes, predator-prey relationships, and the effects of competition depend on contemporary rates of fishing mortality and the history of exploitation. The power of the surveys investigated is poor on time scales of less than 5 - 10 years. Therefore, size-based indicators provide better support for medium-term, rather than year-on-year, management decision making...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{agreement}} protocols over {{cooperative and}} cooperative [...] antagonistic multi-agent networks with coupled continuous-time nonlinear dynamics. To guarantee convergence for such systems, {{it is common}} in the literature {{to assume that the}} vector field of each agent is pointing inside the convex hull formed by the states of the agent and its neighbors, given that the relative states between each agent and its neighbors are available. This convexity condition is relaxed in this paper, as we show that it is enough that the vector field belongs to a strict tangent cone based on a local supporting hyperrectangle. The new condition has the natural physical interpretation of requiring shared <b>reference</b> <b>directions</b> in addition to the available local relative states. Such shared <b>reference</b> <b>directions</b> can be further interpreted as if each agent holds a magnetic compass indicating the orientations of a global frame. It is proven that the cooperative multi-agent system achieves exponential state agreement if and only if the time-varying interaction graph is uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected. Cooperative [...] antagonistic multi-agent systems are also considered. For these systems, the relation has a negative sign for arcs corresponding to antagonistic interactions. State agreement may not be achieved, but instead it is shown that all the agents' states asymptotically converge, and their limits agree componentwise in absolute values if and in general only if the time-varying interaction graph is uniformly jointly strongly connected.
