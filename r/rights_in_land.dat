25|$|Braxton also sued Robert Morris in Henrico County {{court for}} ₤28,257 in that year, but the lawsuit {{continued}} {{for eight years}} before commissioners were appointed, then Morris appealed. Finally Virginia's Court of Appeals led by Edmund Pendleton decided mostly in favor of Braxton before Morris was forced into bankruptcy by his own continued land speculations (although Morris as late as 1800 believed he should have won ₤20,000). In 1791, Braxton also purchased Strawberry Hill outside Richmond for his wife (who had received nothing upon her father's death, all his property being given to his sons), and conveyed it to his sons Carter Jr. and Corbin to hold for their mother's benefit. Braxton's biographer {{does not believe that}} Braxton hid assets from his creditors by placing them in relatives' names, although his widow later attempted to recover dower <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> and slaves that her husband sold in his last years. His sons in law, Robert Page and John White (husbands of Molly and Judith, his daughters by his first wife) paid creditors more than ₤2000 on Braxton's behalf.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} {{institutional}} models, land development is primarily {{viewed as a}} process of social interaction in which informal institutional structures, strategies and personal characteristics of agents are influential. The institutional-economic models of land development emphasise the roles of uncertainty, incomplete information or transaction costs. Just recently, attention started to be paid to the formal ‘rules of the game’ and the property <b>rights</b> regime <b>in</b> <b>land</b> development processes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to increase knowledge on the role of the property <b>rights</b> regime <b>in</b> <b>land</b> development and contribute to the further conceptualisation of the impact of the institutions on land development. This study addresses the question of what constitutes the elements of the property <b>rights</b> regime <b>in</b> <b>land</b> development and how the differences <b>in</b> the property <b>rights</b> regime can explain differences <b>in</b> the <b>land</b> development processes. <b>In</b> order to achieve the aim of this study, the analytical model of land development based on the property rights approach is proposed and a comparative analysis on the influence of the property rights regime on <b>land</b> development methods <b>in</b> two countries is conducted. The research approach in this study is a mixture of some key characteristics of qualitative and comparative approaches. In the analytical model developed in this study, the distribution of ‘rights’ <b>in</b> the property <b>rights</b> regime <b>in</b> <b>land</b> development is the central concept. Within the property rights regime the explanatory variables were identified, which are important characteristics of the property rights regimes. The explanatory variables are: the position of the municipality in the development process, the flexibility versus certainty in development control, and the economic <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> development. The delineation and allocation of <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> connection to the explanatory variables were investigated in comparative research in two countries. Furthermore, the distribution of rights within the property rights regime was discussed in relation to the methods of land development.

50|$|Land-use {{planning}} and development control serve as measurable tools for LED. The assignment of property <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> and third party enforcement are essential for the efficient operation of markets. Public intervention ensures the separation of incompatible land-uses, integrated {{planning and}} development of synergistic land uses, and the 'public goods' aspect of necessary public facilities, open space and infrastructure investment (Lai, 1994, 78-80). Land use {{planning and development}} control are essential for the existence and operation of land and property markets (Alexander, 48). For instance, the assignment of and control over land uses will generally reduce transaction costs and can create or enlarge markets (Lai, 1994, 91).|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{essentially}} stated {{two broad}} principles. Firstly, ACL {{is an independent}} source of law, not to be interpreted 'through the common-law lens.'

Women seeking redress in a traditional court may, according to customary law, be unable to represent herself. As a result, most strategies to secure women's <b>rights</b> (<b>in</b> <b>land)</b> in rural South Africa have tended to avoid the customary law arena and instead favoured formal legal initiatives.|$|E
