5000|$|Smith's {{first major}} tournament success {{came during the}} 2007 Full Tilt Online Poker Series, where he tied for 1st in the $1.5 Million Guarantee, good for $175,326.

2500|$|Writing in 1999, Mihai Stoian {{described}} it as anomalous that, {{in the process of}} restoring membership to those deposed by the regime, the Academy had not also posthumously stripped <b>Roller</b> of his <b>title.</b> He calls <b>Roller</b> [...] "a red specter", haunting [...] "the bookcases dusted by lies and servitude." [...] Senior historian Florin Constantiniu reflected back on the communist period, coining the popular (but, according to Cristian Vasile, melodramatic) image of Roller as [...] "the gravedigger of authentic Romanian culture". At that stage, some authors described Roller's influence as criminal, and declared him an anti-Romanian by conviction. The books of antisemitic conspiracy theorist Iosif Constantin Drăgan cited Roller's case as evidence that Jewish communism was working against the Romanians.|$|R
