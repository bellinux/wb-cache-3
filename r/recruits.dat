5|$|In {{contrast}} to Roman <b>recruits,</b> {{the vast majority}} of barbarian <b>recruits</b> were probably volunteers, drawn by conditions of service and career prospects that to them probably appeared desirable, in {{contrast to}} their living conditions at home. A minority of barbarian <b>recruits</b> were enlisted by compulsion, namely dediticii (barbarians who surrendered to the Roman authorities, often to escape strife with neighbouring tribes) and tribes who were defeated by the Romans, and obliged, as a condition of peace, to undertake to provide a specified number of <b>recruits</b> annually. Barbarians could be recruited directly, as individuals enrolled into regular regiments, or indirectly, as members of irregular foederati units transformed into regular regiments.|$|E

5|$|The first {{contingent}} of police enlisted for a three-year term of service, but later <b>recruits</b> enlisted for five year periods, {{with the possibility}} of their purchasing an early discharge. Early in the force's history, the training of <b>recruits</b> was carried out on an ad hoc basis at the police's headquarters; in response, a depot for training new <b>recruits</b> created in Regina in 1885, based on the Royal Irish Constabulary Depot in Dublin, which took a much more structured approach. The use of the depot declined in line with the reduced number of new <b>recruits</b> joining the force after 1895, and was ultimately replaced by the new School of Instruction in 1899. Efforts were taken throughout the 1880s and 1890s {{to improve the quality of}} <b>recruits</b> being accepted by the force, and to tackle the related problems of early discharge and desertion, which was making staff retention a serious problem.|$|E

5|$|In the 1st century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of auxiliary common soldiers were recruited from the Roman peregrine (second-class citizens). In the Julio-Claudian era, conscription of peregrini seems to have been practiced alongside voluntary recruitment, probably {{in the form of a}} fixed proportion of men reaching military age in each tribe being drafted. From the Flavian era onwards, the auxilia were an all-volunteer force. Although <b>recruits</b> as young as 14 are recorded, the majority of <b>recruits</b> (66%) were from the 18–23 age group.|$|E

40|$|Directors {{of college}} <b>recruiting</b> for 145 Fortune 1, 000 {{corporations}} were surveyed about a broad set of college <b>recruiting</b> practices and college <b>recruiting</b> effectiveness measures. The participants completed questionnaires designed {{to obtain information}} on such things as organizational characteristics, <b>recruiting</b> communication, recruiters, applicant qualification levels, and <b>recruiting</b> outcomes. Descriptive results indicate that most college <b>recruiting</b> programs diverge from normative prescriptions. Step-wise regression reveals several statistically significant relationships among organizational characteristics, <b>recruiting</b> practices, and perceived <b>recruiting</b> effectiveness. Some of the {{findings are consistent with}} conventional wisdom; others are not. Overall, college recruitment is not typically regarded as a major strategic function by the firms surveyed, as evidenced by: 1. the low emphasis on program evaluation, 2. the only moderate status of recruiters, 3. the low top-executive involvement, and 4. the low attention to <b>recruiting</b> procedures...|$|R
