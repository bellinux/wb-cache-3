5|$|The {{park has}} its western border {{running along the}} Finland–Norway border. The two most {{prominent}} lakes are Ellenvatn and Ødevatn, both of which flow into tributaries of the river Pasvikelva. The fauna and flora are typical of the Siberian taiga, and include some species uncommon for Norway. The park is a habitat for the brown bear and also has a large population of moose; <b>reindeer</b> <b>husbandry</b> takes place during winter. Eight species of fish live in the lakes and the park has 190 species of flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by <b>reindeer</b> <b>husbandry,</b> and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer. The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with <b>reindeer</b> <b>husbandry.</b> This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the autumnal moth, leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E
50|$|Although {{medium to}} heavy {{industry}} dominated the district, and traditional economic drivers remained underdeveloped, the {{high percentage of}} indigenous Chukchi (around 40%) allowed three farms, centered around three separate rural localities, to carry on traditional <b>reindeer</b> farming and <b>husbandry</b> as well as farming {{a variety of other}} traditional animals.|$|R
50|$|Norwegian {{industrial}} {{expansion in the}} Arctic has caused many Sami communities to voice concerns over effects on their traditional livelihoods, languages, and culture. Over the past hundred years, seventy percent of reindeer habitat in Norway has become ecologically compromised by industrial disturbances. Mining, military activities, and renewable energy projects such as dams and windpower facilities have all encroached on historically Sami territories. Encroachment has resulted in reduced access to land-based resources, threatening the viability of certain Indigenous economies such as <b>reindeer</b> herding and <b>husbandry,</b> which provides both an important economic as well as dietary source of sustenance for many Sami.|$|R
50|$|The Northern Urals {{is home to}} Uralic {{speaking}} {{people like}} Udmurts, Mari, Komi, Mansi and Khanty people. The indigenous population of the Polar Urals consists of the Nenets and Samoyedic peoples who are widespread through the Siberia and have their own languages. Bashkirs form the largest indigenous group of the region. They live in the Southern Ural and speak a language of the Turkic group. Kazakhs are another significant national fraction of the Southern Ural. Many northern tribals still continue their traditional activities, including fishing, hunting and animal <b>husbandry</b> (<b>reindeer).</b> The nomadic people of the south used to breed horses, but are mostly settled now and are involved in agriculture, especially growth of wheat, potato, melons and watermelons. The majority of the Urals population (about 80%) is however Russians, who are mostly concentrated in the cities of the Central and Southern Urals and {{are involved in the}} industry.|$|R
5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. <b>Reindeer</b> <b>husbandry</b> is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Pasvikdalen {{has been}} {{populated}} since the Stone Age; archeological {{findings from the}} Komsa culture have been dated back to 4000 BC. About 2300 BC there was immigration from Finland and later the area was largely used by Skolts for <b>reindeer</b> <b>husbandry.</b> Norwegian immigration started about 1850, and the first land was granted land for farming in 1874, after a road was built along the valley to Svanvatn. This was followed up by Russian immigration {{to the other side}} of the border. The road was extended to Grensefossen in 1939 and after 1945 the population on the Russian side was forcefully moved by the Soviet authorities and the area depopulated. The Soviet Union started planning to regulate Pasvikelva for hydroelectricity in the 1940s, with the first power station opening in 1951. Seven power stations were built which take advantage of the entire height of fall in the river.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Alaska's {{reindeer}} (Rangifer tarandus) {{industry has}} been faced with the competitive need to increase productivity but cautioned to avoid range degradation {{as a result of}} high stocking rates. Consumer demand for lean, healthy, high quality meat has increased throughout the world and has surpassed production. For herders to tap these new domestic and off-shore markets, there will be the need for higher herd numbers and animal productivity, consistent slaughter protocol, and a focused marketing plan. In this paper, we illustrate how record-keeping can benefit <b>reindeer</b> herders in <b>husbandry</b> and management decisions that are necessary to increase animal productivity and, eventually, product quality and profits. These biological parameters were tested in a Lotus ® spreadsheet model designed to predict herd growth and economics. Records of three reinde-er herds on the Seward Peninsula have shown that calf production for adults has ranged from 35 to 98 %. Sensitivity analysis predicted that in some herds, the model was sensitive to small changes in calf survival which could result in insufficient recruitment to maintain long-term harvest. Productivity may be ultimately related to management decisions that cull animals before productivity begins to decline. ...|$|R
40|$|The Nenets, {{one of the}} {{indigenous}} peoples of the North in Russian Federation, {{can be divided into}} two dialect groupsーthe Tundra Nenets and the Forest Nenets. The latter is minority even among the Nenets (42, 000 peoples) and numbers just about 2, 000 peoples, living scattered in the Forest Tundra -Taiga vegetation zones of {{the southern part of the}} Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District and the northern part of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District in West Siberia. The Forest Nenets, as the most of nomadic Tundra Nenets, is also famous as reindeer people, but their dependence on reindeer herding itself as the subsistence activity is lower than that of the Tundra Nenets. Beside reindeer herding they are engaged in fishing, gathering and so on. In this article the author introduces the contents of the main academic works which refers to reindeer herding and published in Russia from 19202 ̆ 7 s to nowadays. Each article or book about reindeer herding mainly concerns with the typology of herding - summer herding pattern, usage of the mosquito-fumigation, existence of reindeer house, small or large number of the herd, the borrowing relationship in the technique of herding with the neighboring people groups - Tundra Nenets, Khanty, Selkup, Enets, Tungus and other elements of the <b>reindeer</b> herding and <b>husbandry,</b> typical for the Forest Nenets. Their reindeer herding, and the Forest Nenets themselves, are on the verge of the catastrophe, faced with oil-natural gas exploring activities from 19702 ̆ 7 s and pollution problems as a result of such activities, and the socio-economic changes...|$|R
25|$|Only a minor part {{is today}} working with <b>reindeer</b> <b>husbandry.</b> There are also minor groups working as fishermen, {{producing}} Sami arts and serving tourism. Besides having a voting length {{in the so-called}} Sami Parliament or influence in any Sami language, the rest are ordinary citizens, adhering to the Scandinavian culture. In Sweden, major parts of Norrland (and not only Sami villages) are also experiencing major emigration to larger towns.|$|E
25|$|Reindeer {{and other}} animals play a central part in Sami culture, though today <b>reindeer</b> <b>husbandry</b> is of dwindling {{economic}} relevance for the Sami people. There is currently (2004) no clear indication when reindeer-raising started, perhaps about 500 AD, but tax tributes were raised in the 16th century. Since the 16th century, Samis have always paid taxes in monetary currency, and some historians have proposed that large scale husbandry is not older than from this period.|$|E
25|$|In Russia, {{the age-old}} {{ways of life}} of the Sami were brutally {{interrupted}} by the collectivization of the <b>reindeer</b> <b>husbandry</b> and agriculture in general. Most Sami were organized in a single kolkhoz, located in {{the central part of}} the Peninsula, at Lovozero (Sami: Lojavri). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the Sami people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including Nenets and other Arctic peoples.|$|E
