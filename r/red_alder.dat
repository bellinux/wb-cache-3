5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and <b>red</b> <b>alder.</b> Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorfâ€™s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E

A vegetation {{assessment of the}} riparian zone beside the Stoney Creek Off-Channel Habitat Project compared with a non-restored site and a previously replanted site showed that the sites were significantly different in their vegetation composition. All three sites had several invasive species of concern playing dominant roles in the ecosystem with the most common two species being English ivy (Hedera helix) and Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor). The previously restored site had significantly lower levels of invasive English ivy than the non-restored site. The non-restored site had greater total foliar cover than the other sites, but this was mostly covered by invasive species. The project site was only {{significantly different from the}} reference sites by having greater ivy levels on trees and a higher number of <b>red</b> <b>alders</b> (Alnus rubra).

500|$|In {{the second}} chapter, [...] "Taking Root", the {{embryonic}} root emerges {{through a small}} opening in the seed coat and through cell division, aided by plant hormones, it grows downward. Water and nutrients enter the root by osmosis and are transported to the seedling. A symbiotic relationship develops between the roots and the truffles. The roots give its extra sugars to the truffles, which it uses for energy, and the truffles assist the roots' uptake of water and nutrients. From excess starches and nutrients gathered by the root, a stem similar to the root but surrounded with thin, grayish bark, grows upwards. As the starch reserves are exhausted, its first needles sprout and photosynthesis begins. The tree anchors itself with a deep taproot and a web of roots begin to grow laterally. Some roots develop symbiotic relationships with near-by <b>red</b> <b>alders</b> which excel at nitrogen-fixation but lack the storage capacity that the Douglas-fir can offer. In early April of every year, a new layer grows between the bark and wood. As this new layer takes over transportation of fluids throughout the tree, last year's layer of cells die and form a ring in the wood.|$|R

40|$|Six 40 -year-old <b>red</b> <b>alders</b> (Alnus rubra Bong.) were {{harvested}} from a mixed stand of A. rubra and big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh) in the Oregon Coast Range to evaluate variation in their wood characteristics at two heights. Because the trees {{had a slight}} lean (4 to 14 Â°), we sampled along a diametric strip from the lower to upper side of the lean. For a disk from breast height and one from an upper height (5. 8 to 6. 1 m), we sampled 12 - 14 designated growth rings {{on both sides of}} the pith. For each sample we determined fiber length, vessel diameter, tissue proportion (proportion of a cross section occupied by fibers, vessels, rays, or axial parenchyma), and specific gravity. The variation of these properties between the two heights, between the lower and upper sides of the lean, and along the radius was analyzed among the within trees. Variations between the two heights and between the lower and upper sides of the lean were minor or not significant for all measured characteristics. In the radial direction, fiber length and vessel diameter increased rapidly during the first 8 to 12 years (from 0. 8 to 1. 2 mm and 47 to 60 um, respectively) and then leveled off.

50|$|Armillaria {{can remain}} viable in stumps for 50 years. Chemical {{treatments}} do not eradicate the fungus entirely, {{and they are}} not cost-effective. The most frequent and effective approach to managing root disease problems is to attempt to control them at final harvest by replanting site-suited tree species that are disease tolerant. In eastern Washington that typically means replacing Douglas-fir or true fir stands with ponderosa pine, western larch, western white pine, lodgepole pine, western <b>red</b> cedar, <b>alder,</b> or spruce.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{effect of}} logging on low summer streamflow was investigated with a data set of 36 years. Hydrologic records were analyzed {{for the period}} 1953 and 1988 from Watershed (WS) 1 (clear-cut logged and burned), WS 2 (unlogged control), and WS 3 (25 percent patch-cut logged and burned) in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, western Cascade Range, Oregon. These records spanned 9 â€“ 10 years before logging, and 21 â€“ 25 years after logging and burning. Streamfiows in August were the lowest of any month, and were unaffected by occasional heavy rain that occurred {{at the beginning of}} summer. August streamfiows increased in WS 1 compared to WS 2 by 159 percent following logging in WS 1, but this increase lasted for only eight years following the start of logging in 1962. Water yield in August for 1970 â€“ 1988 observed from WS 1 was 25 percent less than predicted from the control (WS 2, ANOVA, p= 0. 032). Water yield in August increased by 59 percent after 25 percent of the area of WS 3 was patch-cut logged and burned in 1963. In contrast to WS 1, however, water yields from WS 3 in August were consistently greater than predicted for 16 years following the start of logging, through to 1978. For the 10 years, 1979 â€“ 1988, water yield observed in August from WS 3 was not different than predicted from the control (WS 2, ANOVA, p- 0. 175). The contrasting responses of WS 1 and 3 to logging are thought {{to be the result of}} differences in riparian vegetation caused by different geomorphic conditions. A relatively wide valley floor in WS 1 allowed the development of hardwoods in the riparian zone following logging, but the narrow valley of WS 3 and limited sediment deposits prevented establishment of riparian hardwoods. Low streamflows during summer have implications for salmonid survival. Reduced streamflow reduces the amount of rearing habitat, thus increasing competition. Combined with high water temperatures, reduced streamflow can lead directly to salmonid mortality by driving salmonids from riffles and glides, and trapping them in drying pools. Low streamflow also increases oxygen depletion caused by leaves from riparian <b>red</b> <b>alders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Traditional microscope-based {{estimates}} of species richness of aquatic hyphomycetes {{depend upon the}} ability of the species in the community to sporulate. Molecular techniques which detect DNA from all stages of the life cycle could potentially circumvent the problems associated with traditional methods. Leaf disks from <b>red</b> maple, <b>alder,</b> linden, beech, and oak as well as birch wood sticks were submerged in a stream in southeastern Canada for 7, 14, and 28 days. Fungal biomass, estimated by the amount of ergosterol present, increased with time on all substrates. Alder, linden, and maple leaves were colonized earlier and accumulated the highest fungal biomass. Counts and identifications of released conidia suggested that fungal species richness increased, while community evenness decreased, with time (up to 11 species on day 28). Conidia of Articulospora tetracladia dominated. Modifications of two molecular methodsâ€”denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysisâ€”suggested that both species richness and community evenness decreased with time. The dominant ribotype matched that of A. tetracladia. Species richness estimates based on DGGE were consistently higher than those based on T-RFLP analysis and exceeded those based on spore identification on days 7 and 14. Since traditional and molecular techniques assess different aspects of the fungal organism, both are essential for a balanced view of fungal succession on leaves decaying in streams...|$|R

An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession.

Native Americans have used these three species {{for a variety}} of medicinal uses and ceremonial purposes. Currently, Kansas tribal leaders would like to plant more of these species on tribal land, but the plants have been difficult to propagate. While red elm is valued as a ceremonial tree, it is susceptible to Dutch Elm Disease caused by the fungus (Ophiostoma ulmi) and is not grown in many ornamental nurseries. This has led to declining tree populations. The objective of these studies were to evaluate methods to propagate <b>red</b> elm, grey <b>alder</b> and buffaloberry in order to find techniques that can lead to an increase in the production of these species commercially and enable tribes and landowners to increase the presence of these native plants on their lands. In the first study, the use of gibberellic acid (GA 3) was investigated to determine the optimum concentration needed for maximum seed germination. Studies were conducted with stratified (cold, moist storage) and non-stratified <b>red</b> elm, grey <b>alder,</b> and buffaloberry seeds soaked in one of four treatments: 0, 250, 500 or 1000 ppm of GA 3 in 2010, and 0, 500, 1000, 2000 ppm of GA 3 in 2011. Results indicate the use of GA 3 in high concentrations promoted germination of unstratified seeds of red elm, though low seed viability in grey alder and buffaloberry resulted in poor germination. In a second study, vegetative cuttings were treated with potassium indole- 3 -butyric acid (K-IBA) and Dip â€˜N GrowTM containing indole- 3 -butyric acid and naphthalene acetic acid (IBA + NAA). Softwood cuttings for the three species were treated with K-IBA and Dip â€˜N GrowTM (plant rooting hormones) : K-IBA at 5, 000 and 10, 000 ppm and Dip â€˜N GrowTM at 1 : 10 ratio solutions.
