We demonstrate a technique that suppresses the necessity of fringe counting: frequency sideband imaging, where {{the order of the}} sideband is considered as a marker of the amplitude. The measurement is completely local: no comparison with another reference point on the object is necessary. It involves a sharp variation of a signal, which makes it robust against perturbations.

The idea of measuring angles by the length of the arc was already in use by other mathematicians.

Another way of saying this is that the derived quantity g is more sensitive to, e.g., the measured quantity T than to L or θ.

Students of trigonometry and calculus learn to interpret sin α and cos α as the y and x coordinates of a point located by <b>radian</b> <b>measure</b> α on the unit circle. In this geometric setting, the unit circle is a natural protractor that measures angles on the x-y plane, and sine and cosine are functions that resolve angles into vertical and horizontal components. In more advanced courses, analytic reasoning is used to extend these functions to the complex domain: cos(α + βi) = cos α cosh β − i sin α sinh β (1) sin(α + βi) = sin α cosh β + i cos α sinh β. (2) (See for instance [3, p. 78].) Visual thinkers may accept this {{with a degree of}} reluc-tance. They may wonder how—or if—these equations could be understood visually. Can they be seen as arising from a complex version of the unit circle? Can an angle with imaginary or complex <b>radian</b> <b>measure</b> be visualized? This article describes how this can be done. We define the sine and cosine of a complex number through purely geometric means, and get (1) and (2) as a consequence.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{formulation}} for {{a network of}} stochastic directional units. This formulation {{is an extension of}} the Boltzmann machine in which the units are not binary, but take on values on a cyclic range, between 0 and 2 <b>radians.</b> This <b>measure</b> is appro-priate to many domains, representing cyclic or angular values, e. g., wind direction, days of the week, phases of the moon. The state of each unit in a Directional-Unit Boltzmann Machine (DUBM) is described by a complex variable, where the phase component speci-es a direction; the weights are also complex variables. We associate a quadratic energy function, and corresponding probability, with each DUBM conguration. The conditional distribution of a unit's stochastic state is a circular version of the Gaussian probability distribution, known as the von Mises distribution. In a mean-eld approximation to a stochastic dubm, the phase component of a unit's state represents its mean direction, and the magnitude component species the degree of certainty associated with this direction. This combination of a value and a certainty provides additional representational power in a unit. We present a proof that the settling dynamics for a mean-eld DUBM cause convergence to a free energy minimum. Finally, we describe a learning algorithm and simulations that demonstrate a mean-eld DUBM's ability to learn interesting mappings...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{accuracy}} of phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR) can be compromised by background phase errors. It is {{the objective of}} the present work to provide an analysis of the temperature dependence of background phase errors in PC-CMR by means of gradient mount temperature sensing and magnetic field monitoring. Methods: Background phase errors were measured for various temperatures of the gradient mount using magnetic field monitoring and validated in a static phantom. The effect of thermal changes during k-space acquisition was simulated and confirmed with measurements in a stationary phantom. Results: The temperature of the gradient mount was found to increase by 20 – 30 K during PC-CMR measurements of 6 – 12 min duration. Associated changes in background phase errors of up to 11 % or 0. 35 <b>radian</b> were <b>measured</b> at 10 cm from the magnet’s iso-center as a result of first order offsets. Zeroth order phase errors exhibited little thermal dependence. Conclusions: It is concluded that changes in gradient mount temperature significantly modify background phase errors during PC-CMR with high gradient duty cycle. Since temperature increases significantly during the first minutes of scanning the results presented are also of relevance for single-slice or multi-slice PC-CMR scans. The findings prompt for further studies to investigate advanced correction methods taking into account gradient temperature and/or the use of concurrent field-monitoring to map gradient-induced fields throughout the scan...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A novel but {{elementary}} geometric construction produces on the seven-dimensional manifold of rotated spheres in Euclidean three-space a finslerian geometry whose geodesics {{are interpreted}} as the paths of free, spinning, spherical particles moving through de Sitter’s expanding universe. A particle of nonzero inertial rest mass typically follows a helical track and exhibits behavior remindful of the phenomenon of “Zitterbewegung ” of spinning electrons first deduced by Schrödinger from Dirac’s relativistic wave equation. Its velocity vector and its spin vector precess about the axial direction of the helix, with their projections onto that direction at all times parallel or at all times antiparallel. Particles of zero rest mass follow straight tracks {{at the speed of}} light with their spin vectors parallel or antiparallel to their velocity vectors, thereby replicating behavior of spinning photons predicted by the quantum theory of light. The four-dimensional manifold whose points are the spheres of Euclidean three-space E 3 can be coordinatized by [[R,s]], this designating the sphere S of radius R with its center C at position s. If [[R + dR,s + ds]] designates a neighboring sphere S ′, and dα is the <b>radian</b> <b>measure</b> of the angle in which S and S ′ intersect, then...|$|E
