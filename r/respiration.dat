5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. In brown adipose tissue, regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple <b>respiration</b> from ATP synthesis. This rapid <b>respiration</b> produces heat, and {{is particularly important}} {{as a way of}} maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that intensive care technology may be masking the presence of Biot’s <b>Respirations.</b> This {{could be related to}} the fact that treatment for Biot’s <b>Respirations</b> typically results with intubation immediately upon diagnosis, with mechanical ventilation to regulate patients’ breathing.|$|R

5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with <b>respiration,</b> and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during <b>respiration,</b> while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} definitions exist, {{a tension}} pneumothorax {{is generally considered}} to be present when a pneumothorax (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of <b>respiration</b> and/or blood circulation. Tension pneumothorax tends to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation, resuscitation, trauma, or in patients with lung disease.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular <b>respiration</b> using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular <b>respiration</b> was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell <b>respiration</b> were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E

5|$|Metabolism {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} categories: catabolism, the {{breaking}} down of organic matter for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate, by cellular <b>respiration,</b> and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. Usually, breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular <b>respiration,</b> is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. <b>Respiration</b> is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|Sewage {{treatment}} works depend {{for their}} ability to clean up water contaminated with organic material on microorganisms that can respire dissolved substances. <b>Respiration</b> may be aerobic, with a well-oxygenated filter bed such as a slow sand filter. Anaerobic digestion by methanogens generate useful methane gas as a by-product.|$|E
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than <b>respiration)</b> by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (<b>respiration</b> exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the key biochemical mechanisms that occur within a reed bed system or constructed wetland during the treatment of landfill leachate. Soil <b>respirations,</b> dehydrogenase activities and urease activities within a horizontal subsurface flow reed bed were extensively examined to determine these mechanisms. Variations in biochemical parameters because of change in space and leachate applications were investigated. Correlations among the biochemical parameters and between biochemical parameters and pollutant removal efficiency were undertaken. No biochemical activities showed any horizontal variations across the reed bed. For both preloading and during-loading conditions, soil <b>respirations</b> and dehydrogenase activities {{did not have any}} vertical variations whereas urease activities at 5 cm depth were significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than those at 50 cm and 90 cm depth. When during-loading conditions were compared with preloading conditions, soil <b>respirations</b> showed no variation at any depth, whereas significant reductions were observed at 50 cm (P= 0. 034) for dehydrogenase activities and at 50 cm (P= 0. 018) and 90 cm (P= 0. 004) depths for urease activities.

5|$|The major {{means of}} <b>respiration</b> in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the {{transfer}} of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and <b>respiration</b> needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E

40|$|THE {{theoretical}} {{aspects of}} this problem have been dealt with by Mapleson (1960). The experiments in the laboratory and the observations in the operating theatre recorded in this paper were devised to check his conclusions and {{to lead the way}} to the clinical conclusions of Mushin and Galloon (1960). The behaviour of the two types of closed circuit as denned by Mapleson was investigated. In the first, the patient's <b>respirations</b> pass through the vaporizer (vaporizer inside the breathing circuit) : examples of this type are shown in figure 1, b-d.
