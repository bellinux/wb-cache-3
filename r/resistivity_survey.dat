5|$|The first {{investigation}} of the chapel ruins, supported by the National Trust, was conducted by the local history group {{in the winter of}} 1998–99. This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, geophysics (resistivity, and magnetometry) and molehill sampling. The area surveyed was 100m long and 40m wide (109yd by 44yd). The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but did show an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from wartime defences. The <b>resistivity</b> <b>survey</b> clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was probably less well-constructed, and possibly later in date.|$|E

25|$|A {{programme}} {{of surface}} prospecting was undertaken at once {{in an attempt}} to find a lateral extension of the vein. The hillside was covered with a thick layer of peat, and a number of Italian prisoners of war were employed to try to trace the outcrop of the vein. To help with the search, an electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>survey</b> was carried out towards the end of 1943, and trenches were dug to investigate places on Hart Side where there were promising indications. However, only small stringers of barren quartz were found there. Underground prospecting was also done, by extending both the Lucy Level and the 120Fathom Level to the north, but without success. A thorough review of the geology by the British Geological Survey in February 1944 pointed the way to some small deposits of ore but confirmed that no major extension to the reserves existed.|$|E

40|$|Past {{applications}} of electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveying</b> have particularly focused on areas of subsurface ground investigations to locate boulder, bedrock, water table, etc. Traditionally, electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> were directed by an expert geophysicist for data acquisition, processing and interpretation. The final outcome from the electrical resistivity technique was an anomaly image that helped describe and demarcate zones of challenging ground conditions. The anomalies highlighted uncertain geotechnical conditions that were often irregular and dependent on individual site condition, yielding a site-dependent electrical resistivity value (ERV) for the ground. This study therefore identifies co-relationships between ERV and some basic geotechnical properties (BGP) such as soil moisture content, grain size of geomaterial, density, porosity, void ratio, and Atterberg limit. Different soil {{samples were collected}} and tested under both field and laboratory conditions. Basic geotechnical properties of the samples were obtained immediately after the electrical resistivity measurements were made. It was shown that the electrical resistivity value was greatly influenced by the geotechnical properties, and thus the <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveying</b> technique is applicable to support and enhance the conventional stand-alone anomaly outcome that is traditionally used in ground investigation interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Apparent {{resistivity}} measurements made in proximity to a rail track {{are likely to}} be affected by preferential current channelling through the conductive rails. This report quantifies these effects using a simplified semi-analytic model to represent the rail. The results show that the commonly used measurement configurations are all affected in a similar manner, with greater distortion of the data at larger depths of investigation. The degree of distortion also depends on the contact resistance between the rail and the ground. The effect is least, however, for the Dipole-Dipole configuration, which is therefore recommended for <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> undertaken parallel to conductive rails.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{interpret}} <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys,</b> {{it is important}} to understand the basic petrophysics of rock resistivity in geothermal areas. Needing explanation are the low resistivities (<  30  Ωm) determined by DC and MT <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> at Fang. <b>Resistivity</b> values of the rocks are due to electrolyte conduction in the formation water residing in the pores and fractures, and by conduction paths through clay minerals or metallic minerals. Water produced from 130  °C wells at Fang is quite low in electrolytes. The specific conductance (EC) of the water is 550  µS cm− 1 (resistivity of 18.2  Ωm) at 25  °C. Resistivity of water decreases with temperature. The resistivity of water (Rw) occupying the pores and fractures of the 130  °C Fang geothermal reservoir has been temperature corrected with Arp’s equation of Sen and Goode (1992) to 5.6  Ωm.|$|R

Resistivity analyses were calibrated with known depths from excavation stratigraphic profiles. The information from both sources was plotted three dimensionally in ArcGIS 9, where data layers were created for different pedological and archaeological strata and features. Points that would have been on the surfaces of the ground or features at different points during the past were determined. These points were then used to recreate the past topographies and produce 3 D and 2 D map reconstructions of the site...|$|R

A <b>resistivity</b> <b>survey</b> in the 1970s identified high resistance anomalies that may represent a building, which possibly could be the church of St Ethelbert.

40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) and resistivity {{techniques have}} been widely used to map the locations of sinkholes in covered karst terrain. To determine whether a sinkhole is a likely preferential conduit for groundwater flow, however, requires higher-resolution imaging than that used in conventional sinkhole mapping surveys. Field observations combined with simulated surveys for a 15 -m diameter 3 -m deep sinkhole in west-central Florida are used to assess the resolution of GPR and <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> targeting the semiconfining unit that floors the sinkhole depression. 2 D <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> clearly show the central depression as well as resistivity contrasts between the cover sediments within and outside of the sinkhole, but are inadequate for resolving breaches in the semiconfining unit or underlying conduits. A 3 D GPR survey resolves vertical structure on the order of tens of centimeters within the semiconfining unit, as well as indicators of conduits that extend several meters beneath the central depression. 3 D GPR thus holds promise for imaging hydrologically significant features of sinkholes...|$|R
40|$|The city of Los Osos sits {{on top of}} {{a coastal}} {{groundwater}} aquifer which is the sole supplier of all its residential, agricultural, and industrial water needs. Lacking a sewer system, the upper aquifer became progressively contaminated with nitrates over several decades. Groundwater pumping eventually shifted to the lower aquifer, however seawater intrusion of the lower aquifer caused by over-pumping has further degraded water quality. The Los Osos groundwater basin provides an excellent field region to examine the utility of geophysical methods for characterizing aquifer structure. In this study shallow (< 20 m) electrical resistivity imaging methods were performed at two locations in Los Osos to assess depth to water table. The goals of the electrical <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> were to assess the depth to the water table in each area and compare with water table depths from nearby well data. If accurate and sufficient data are found, the <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> might be a plausible way to monitor the areas of contamination in a non-invasive manner...|$|R

40|$|The capacitively coupled {{resistivity}} method using line antennas (or electrodes) {{has been}} widely applied for various kinds of applications. To solve the associated inversion problem, the general practice (i. e., the indirect inversion method) for 2 D surface <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> is to approximate the line-electrode array by an equivalent point-electrode array, so that the existing direct current resistivity inversion programs can still be used. Based on the experimental evidence from this study that two resistivity arrays with a similar sensitivity (1 D) curve offers comparable measurement, we optimized the equivalent point-electrode array by minimizing the sensitivity (1 D) difference between the line- and point-electrode arrays {{in terms of the}} depth of investigation difference (DID). The dipole length of the optimal equivalent point-electrode array can be determined by considering only the array with the shortest dipole distance. For the line-electrode arrays with the dipole lengths of 2. 5, 5, and 10 m, the suggested optimal dipole lengths are 74 %, 73 %, and 73 % of the respective dipole lengths. The numerical examples carried out in this study prove the effectiveness of the indirect inversion method for 2 D surface <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> when the appropriate equivalent point-electrode array with a low DID value is chosen, and vice versa. The direct inversion of the line electrode resistivity measurements from 3 D <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> is achieved with a MATLAB-based, open-source resistivity inversion package called RESINVM 3 D incorporating line electrodes. The usefulness of this modified code was demonstrated with a numerical example that considered cross-borehole resistivity tomography using line electrode measurements.

40|$|The use of {{electrical}} <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> to locate karst conduits has shown mixed success. However, time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging combined with salt injection improves conduit detection and can yield valuable insight into solute transport behaviour. We present a {{proof of concept}} above a known karst conduit in the Kentucky Horse Park (Lexington, Kentucky). A salt tracer solution was injected into a karst window over a 45 -min interval, and repeat <b>resistivity</b> <b>surveys</b> were collected every 20 min along a 125 -m transect near a monitoring well approximately 750 m downgradient from the injection site. In situ fluid conductivity measurements in the well peaked at approximately 25 % of the initial value about 3 h after salt injection. Time-lapse electrical resistivity inversions show two broad zones at the approximate conduit depth where resistivity decreased and then recovered in general agreement with in situ measurements. Combined salt injection and electrical resistivity imaging are a promising tool for locating karst conduits. The method is also useful for gaining insight into conduit geometry and could be expanded to include multiple electrical resistivity transects...|$|R
