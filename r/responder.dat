The government was cited as the first <b>responder</b> for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that the government should be responsible for relief.

5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the bow from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon <b>Responder.</b> However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E

Probabilities were determined for maintenance of response at 12 -month and 24 -month time-points.

These rates were 14. 6 %, 19. 5 %, and 65. 9 % in the pivotal trial. The potential confound of alterations in antidepressant treatment was examined in the pivotal trial.

40|$|Background Co-occurrence {{of lower}} {{respiratory}} symptoms (LRS) and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) has been increasingly recognized among <b>responders</b> and survivors of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. Information is limited on the degree which comorbidity intensifies symptoms and compromises quality of life across exposed groups. Methods Among <b>responders</b> who completed {{the first and second}} Registry surveys, measures of respiratory illness, psychological distress, and diminished quality of life were compared between <b>responders</b> comorbid for LRS and PTSD and <b>responders</b> with only LRS or PTSD. Results Of 14, 388 <b>responders,</b> 40 % of those with LRS and 57 % of those with PTSD were comorbid. When demographic and WTC exposure-related factors were controlled, comorbid <b>responders</b> compared to those with LRS alone were twice as likely to have frequent dyspnea and to have sought care for dyspnea. Compared to <b>responders</b> with PTSD alone, comorbid <b>responders</b> were 2. 1 times more likely to report intense re-experiencing of the disaster, 2. 5 times more likely to express feelings of significant non-specific psychological distress, and 1. 4 {{times more likely to have}} received mental health care. Comorbid <b>responders</b> were approximately three times more likely to report only fair or poor general health and more than twice as likely to report being unable to perform usual activities for ≥ 14 of 30 days before interview.

40|$|Health {{care workers}} (HCWs) are {{frequently}} exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The efficacy {{and safety of}} immunization with the hepatitis B (HB) vaccine are well recognized, but the durability of immunity and need for booster doses in those with secondary vaccine response failure remains controversial. This was a retrospective cohort study performed at Osaka University Hospital, Japan. We examined antibodies against HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) titers annually after immunization for previously non-immunized HCWs. Primary <b>responders</b> were categorized by their sero-positive durations as short <b>responders</b> (those whose anti-HBs titers declined to negative range within 3 years), and long <b>responders</b> (those who retained positive anti-HBs levels for 3 years and more). We re-immunized short <b>responders</b> with either single or 3 -dose boosters, the long <b>responders</b> with a single booster when their titers dropped below protective levels, and examined their sero-protection rates over time thereafter. From 2001 to 2012, data of 264 HCWs with a median age of 25. 3 were collected. The rate of anti-HBs positivity after primary vaccination were 93. 0 % after three doses (n = 229), 54. 5 % after two doses (n = 11), and 4. 2 % after a single dose (n = 24). Of 213 primary <b>responders,</b> the anti-HBs levels of 95 participants (44. 6 %) fell below the protective levels, including 46 short <b>responders</b> and 49 long <b>responders.</b> HCWs with higher initial anti-HBs titers after primary vaccination had significantly longer durations of sero-positivity. For short <b>responders,</b> 3 -dose booster vaccination induced a longer duration of anti-HBs positivity compared to a single-dose booster, whereas for long <b>responders,</b> a single-dose booster alone could induce prolonged anti-HBs positivity. Our preliminary data suggested {{that it may be}} useful to differentiate HB vaccine <b>responders</b> based on their primary response durations to maintain protective levels of anti-HBs efficiently. A randomized, prospective, large-scale study is warranted to support our findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} protective {{and therapeutic}} effects of bST during coliform mastitis in periparturient cows were evaluated. In a first study, 19 cows, classified as moderate or severe <b>responders</b> {{based on the}} respiratory burst activity of blood neutrophils, were treated with recombinant bST or vehicle 48 h after intramammary inoculation of Escherichia coli. Clinical status and changes in milk production and composition were compared in the four groups. In a second study, 8 cows received bST or vehicle 7 d before bacterial challenge. During mastitis, losses in milk production and compositional changes were most pronounced in infected glands and in severe <b>responders.</b> Milk production of bST cows recovered better than that of placebo cows. Recovery of milk components was accelerated in severe <b>responders</b> treated with bST, but not in moderate <b>responders.</b> Pretreatment of severe <b>responders</b> with bST enhanced milk production before infection, protected the mammary glands from excessive loss of milk during the subsequently induced coliform mastitis, and accelerated normalization of milk composition. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of bST upon normalization of milk production and composition in periparturient cows suffering from coliform mastitis seem to be restricted to the severe <b>responders.</b> In severe <b>responders</b> that had been treated with bST, changes observed during mastitis resembled those in moderate <b>responders</b> treated with the placebo...|$|R
