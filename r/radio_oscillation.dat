40|$|We have {{compared}} simultaneous Ryle Telescope radio and Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer X-ray {{observations of the}} galactic microquasar GRS 1915 + 105, using the classification of the X-ray behaviour in terms of three states as previously established. We find a strong (one-to-one) relation between <b>radio</b> <b>oscillation</b> events and series of spectrally hard states in the X-ray light curves, if the hard states are longer than ~ 100 s and are "well separated" from each other. In all other cases the source either shows a low-level or a high level radio emission, but no <b>radio</b> <b>oscillation</b> events. During intervals when the source stays in the hard spectral state for periods of days to months, the radio behaviour is quite different; during some of these intervals a quasi-continuous jet is formed with an almost flat synchrotron spectrum extending to at least the near-infrared. Based on {{the similarities between the}} oscillation profiles at different wavelengths, we suggest a scenario which can explain most of the complex X-ray : radio behaviour of GRS 1915 + 105. We compare this behaviour with that of other black hole sources and challenge previous reports of a relation between spectrally soft X-ray states and the radio emission. Comment: 21 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|We report imaging {{photometry}} of the radio-jet {{black hole}} candidate source GRS 1915 + 105 {{in the infrared}} K band. The observations reveal rapid infrared flare events on timescales of less than an hour. These events are strikingly similar to those regularly observed in radio monitoring at 15 GHz. Furthermore, when dereddened, the infrared events have comparable amplitudes to the <b>radio</b> <b>oscillations,</b> and observations at 15 GHz made approx. 8 hr after our infrared observations reveal that the source was indeed displaying <b>radio</b> <b>oscillations</b> at this time. We suggest that we have observed infrared synchrotron emission from this source.

This makes LS I + 61 ^∘ 303, along with Cyg X- 1, the only TeV emitting X-ray binary exhibiting radio microflares. To further investigate these microflaring activity in LS I + 61 ^∘ 303 we observed the source with the 100 -m Effelsberg radio telescope at 4. 85, 8. 35, and 10. 45 GHz and performed timing analysis on the obtained data. <b>Radio</b> <b>oscillations</b> of 15 hours time scales are detected at all three frequencies.

40|$|We report high {{sensitivity}} dual-frequency {{observations of}} <b>radio</b> <b>oscillations</b> from GRS 1915 + 105 following {{the decay of}} a major flare event in 2000 July. The oscillations are clearly observed at both frequencies, and the time-resolved spectral index traces the events between optically thin and thick states. While previously anticipated from sparse observations and simple theory, {{this is the first}} time a quasi-periodic signal has been seen in the radio spectrum, and is a clear demonstration that flat radio spectra can arise from the combination of emission from optically thick and thin regions. In addition, we measure the linear polarisation of the oscillations, at both frequencies, at a level of about 1 – 2 %, with a flat spectrum. Cross-correlating the two light curves we find a mean delay, in the sense that the emission at 8640 MHz leads that at 4800 MHz, of around 600 seconds. Comparison with frequency-dependent time delays reported in the literature reveals that this delay is variable between epochs.

50|$|Very early radio {{transmitters}} used a {{spark gap}} to produce radio-frequency oscillations in the transmitting antenna. The signals produced by these spark-gap transmitters consisted of strings of brief pulses of sinusoidal <b>radio</b> frequency <b>oscillations</b> which died out rapidly to zero, called damped waves. The disadvantage of damped waves was that their energy was spread over an extremely wide band of frequencies; they had wide bandwidth. As a result, they produced electromagnetic interference (RFI) that {{spread over the}} transmissions of stations at other frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|This {{motivated}} {{efforts to}} produce <b>radio</b> frequency <b>oscillations</b> that decayed more slowly; had less damping. There is an inverse {{relation between the}} rate of decay (the time constant) of a damped wave and its bandwidth; the longer the damped waves take to decay toward zero, the narrower the frequency band the radio signal occupies, so the less it interferes with other transmissions. As more transmitters began crowding the radio spectrum, reducing the frequency spacing between transmissions, government regulations began to limit the maximum damping or [...] "decrement" [...] a radio transmitter could have. Manufacturers produced spark transmitters which generated long [...] "ringing" [...] waves with minimal damping.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{radio and}} X-ray observations of GRS 1915 + 105, between May 1995 and June 2006, {{focusing on the}} times characterized by radio flares and cycles of hard dips-soft spikes in the X-ray lightcurve. Assuming these flares to be discrete ejections, we applied a plasmon model to the radio data, with good agreement with the lightcurves. We fitted a total of 687 radio flares with a standard model of a plasmon. We found that the distribution of width is t_ 0 = 1160 s with an rms deviation of 360 s, while that of the amplitude is S_{max}= 59 mJy with an rms deviation of 28 mJy. The distribution of width is thus rather peaked, while that of the amplitude not. Regarding radio and X-ray links, this study confirms previous observations on smaller datasets, namely that X-ray cycles of hard dips-soft spikes are always followed by radio flares. A strong correlation is found between the length of X-ray "dips" in the X-ray lightcurves, and the amplitude and fluence of the subsequent <b>radio</b> <b>oscillations.</b> A model of an exponential rise of the form L_{ 15 GHz}(Delta t) = L_{max} (1 -exp(-(Delta t - Delta t_{min}) /tau) is in good agreement with the observations, with the maximum fluence L_{max} of the order 70 Jy. s, and the characteristic time tau of the order 200 - 500 s. We discuss possible physical interpretations of this correlation, regarding {{the nature of the}} ejected material, and the physical process responsible for the ejection.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a multi-channel stimulator delivering the following electrical siǵnals through separate outputs: (a) two brief rectangular pulses of variable duration, {{separated by a}} chosen interval; (b) repeated (tetanizing) pulses of variable frequency and train-duration; (c) a d. c. polarizing stimulus of variable duration. A built-in trigger circuit, hand-controlled or self-firing at a chosen frequency, delivers positive pulses driving the sweep of a ccthode-ray oscillograph used {{in connection with the}} stimulator. The same pulses trigger the different circuits generating stimulating signals, each through a separate delay unit introducing a measurable time lag. Thus, proper delay adjustment in each channel enables synchronisation with the oscillograph sweep of the various available electrical stimuli, delivered in any desired sequence. A versatile rectangular-wave generator has been designed, and extensively applied to the entire apparatus construction. This basic circuit assumes every stage operation (trigger stage; stimulus delay, frequency, and duration stages); with minor adjustments it is made to work, according to each function, either as a one-shot or as a free-running multivibrator. Exclusive use, in the stimulator design, of similar units greatly simplifies construction and servicing. Moreover, owing to the symmetrical operation of these circuits, the power supply has a constant load and must not be regulated. Each channel of the stimulator is linked to the physiological preparation through a radiofrequency coupling. The pulses from the output stages are the source of plate power for H. F. oscillators, and the <b>radio</b> <b>oscillations</b> produced transmitted to receiver coils. The induced voltages, demodulated and filtered, reflect the original signals from each channel but are electrically isolated. © 1955. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Our study shows {{the presence of a}} non-trivial fixed point in this angular dependence, i. e. the possibility for a temperature gradient to stabilize <b>radio</b> frequency <b>oscillations</b> without the need for an external magnetic field. This so called "wavy" behavior can already be found upon applying a voltage difference across a spin-valve but we find that this effect is much more pronounced with a temperature difference. Our semi-classical theory is parametrized with experimentally measured parameters and allows one to predict the amplitude of the torque with good precision. Although thermal spin torque is by nature less effective than its voltage counterpart, we find that in certain geometries, temperature differences as low as a few degrees should be sufficient to trigger the switching of the magnetization.

In addition, for clean interface the in-plane torkance of MnSi/Al is about twice as large as that of CoCo/Al. However, as long as the degree of interfacial disorder is sufficiently large, the CoCo/Al and MnSi/Al will show approximately the same magnitude of in-plane torkance.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the complex behavior of energy- and frequency-dependent time/phase lags in the plateau {{state and the}} radio-quiet hard (χ) state of GRS 1915 + 105. In our timing analysis, we find that when the source is faint in the <b>radio,</b> quasi-periodic <b>oscillations</b> (QPOs) are observed above 2 Hz and typically exhibit soft lags (soft photons lag hard photons), whereas QPOs in the radio-bright plateau state are found below 2. 2 Hz and consistently show hard lags. The phase lag at the QPO frequency is strongly anti-correlated with that frequency, changing sign at 2. 2 Hz. However, the phase lag at {{the frequency of the}} first harmonic is positive and nearly independent of that frequency at ~ 0. 172 rad, regardless of the radio emission. The lag energy dependence at the first harmonic is also independent of radio flux. However, the lags at the QPO frequency are negative at all energies during the radio-quiet state, but lags at the QPO frequency during the plateau state are positive at all energies and show a "reflection-type" evolution of the lag energy spectra with respect to the radio-quiet state. The lag energy dependence is roughly logarithmic, but there is some evidence for a break around 4 - 6 keV. Finally, the Fourier-frequency-dependent phase lag spectra are fairly flat during the plateau state, but increase from negative to positive during the radio-quiet state.

We analyze optical CCD images {{in search of}} isophote off-centering and large isophote twists. Combining the kinematic and isophotal information, we discuss whether each system is an interacting pair, and derive constraints on the relative orbit. The types of isophotal distortions, combined with the prograde/retrograde nature of the relative orbit, suggest {{that three of the}} objects (3 C 66 B, 3 C 75 and 0326 + 39) are unlikely to be in circular orbits. Only 3 C 449 may be in a close, moderate-ellipticity orbit. We find that the distribution of relative velocity with separation for dumbbells with distorted radio morphology from the catalogue of Parma et al. (1991) also suggests a prevalence of eccentric orbits. We discuss that dumbbells with distorted radio morphology may deviate significantly from the circular orbit model proposed by Valentijn & Casertano (1988). The genesis of radio distortions could be related to such distinct orbital behaviour. The amplitude and wavelength of jet oscillations in these objects correlates with the projected separation of the pairs, pointing at a dynamical origin for the jet oscillations. However, for three of the four systems studied in detail here, the jet oscillations cannot be easily traced to orbital displacements of the parent galaxies.

Using the wavelet technique we construct {{a new type of}} map of oscillations for selected periods in the whole domain of the radio spectrum. While the oscillation with the period of 181 seconds was recognized in the whole 25 - 2000 MHz <b>radio</b> spectrum, <b>oscillations</b> with periods of 69 and 40 seconds were confirmed only in the 250 - 870 MHz frequency range. In the 800 - 2000 MHz range we found periods of 50 and 80 seconds. Moreover, in the 250 - 870 MHz frequency range, the oscillation with the period of about 420 seconds was detected. We also made maps of phases of the 181 -second oscillations in order to analyze their frequency drift. At the beginning of the radio event, in the 2000 - 500 MHz frequency range the phase of the 181 -second oscillation drifts towards lower frequencies. On the other hand, at frequencies 25 - 500 MHz we found that the phase is nearly synchronous. While the phase drift at higher frequencies can be interpreted as being caused by the UV wave, the synchronization of the phase on lower frequencies is explained by the fast-electron beams, whose acceleration is modulated by the UV wave. Owing to this modulation, the electron beams are accelerated with the period of the UV wave (181 seconds). These beams propagate upwards through the solar corona and generate the 25 - 500 MHz radio emission with the 181 -second period. Due to high beam velocity (~c/ 3, where c is the light speed) the 25 - 500 MHz radio emission, corresponding to a large interval of heights in the solar corona, is nearly synchronous.

In 1941 Oliver (12) observed the fluorescence of an isobutane- isobutene gaseous mix flowing to a pump through a glass tube which was wrapped by a spiral antenna of a sevenmegacycle transmitter. A white deposit was noticed at a bend in the tubing on the pump side of the fluorescing section of the gas (12, p. 8). In 1957 Blacknall (3) studied the fluorescence and reaction products of propylene in the antenna region of sevenmega- cycle radiation, The oscillator employed by Blacknall was an ARC- 5 /T- 22 military surplus transmitter of range 7. 00 to 9. 10 megacycles, which he operated at 7. 00 megacycles. Blacknall observed a drop in pressure and the formation of a brown deposit in the region of the coil. Blacknall did not report an analysis of this product. In 1959 Armstrong (1) repeated Blacknall's experiments and modified Blacknall's apparatus into an improved design. He also performed an analysis on Blacknall's product. Blacknall used a vertical open-end mercurial manometer with which to measure pressure in his system and as a result introduced mercury vapor into his system.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{opportunity}} of wireless multi-gigabit per second communication at the millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies around 60 GHz by using impulse radio and nanoelectronics. Today most wireless communication {{take place in the}} microwave region, where several different systems and applications are crowding the narrow-band channels. Complicated schemes are applied in order to avoid interference and still provide good performance in terms of bit rate. Many regulatory associations have allocated a wide unlicensed frequency band around 60 GHz, which may offer the possibility to build short-range wireless systems that provide high throughput. Wireless high definition multimedia interface (HDMI) and fast synchronization of mobile devices are some of the intended applications. Furthermore, remote sensing applications such as radar, imaging and localization may be considered due to the wide bandwidth, which may offer high resolution. The impulse radio front-ends that are presented in this thesis are monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) designs in compound semiconductor materials, such as GaAs and InGaAs, compounds built from groups III-V of the periodic system. By choosing such compound materials, it is possible to design devices with high performance such as III-V metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) with mmW cut-off frequency and high transconductance. Moreover, it is possible to utilize bandgap-engineered devices with unique properties such as resonant tunneling. The presented transmitters incorporate resonant tunnel diodes (RTDs) that provide negative differential conductance, and may be used to generate substantial amount of mmW signal power by integrating the device in a resonance circuit, an oscillator. Furthermore, the addition of a third gating terminal to the RTD will present control over both the magnitude and the sign of the differential conductance. By switching the differential conductance of the RTD device between positive and negative magnitudes in a resonance circuit, it is possible to turn the oscillator on and off to generate wavelets, short pulses of <b>radio</b> frequency <b>oscillation.</b> This design offers sub-period start-up time, which is due to the kick-start action of the oscillator. Also, rapid decay is provided since the RTD device actively helps to quench the oscillations when set to positive differential conductance. The best wavelet generator operation was achieved with a MOSFET/RTD combination, where 41 ps long wavelets were generated with 7 dBm peak output power up to a rate of 15 GHz. The wavelet generator was used to investigate the properties of mmW impulse radio and studies show the possibility to obtain 4 Gbps links over short distances using low-level modulationon-off keying. The wavelet generator may also be used as a super-regenerative oscillator by modifying the control signal. Instead of switching the RTD device rapidly into negative differential conductance, it is tuned slowly. Through this action the oscillation may be started from noise or received signal energy. A 400 Msamples/ super-regenerative oscillator is presented, which may be an interesting candidate for implementation in a low-power mmW impulse radio receiver...|$|R

In this thesis we avoided the route oscillation problem by forcing data transmission on fixed routes. This can be implemented in the AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) protocol by disabling both error messages and periodic updating messages (the HELLO scheme). However, a critical factor for our approach is that ETX must determine a high quality initial route in AODV. This thesis investigates whether the ETX metric improves initial route selection in AODV compared to the HOPS metric in two representative client-server applications: the Traffic Control Network (TCN) and the Video Stream (VS) network. We evaluate the ETX and HOPS metrics in a range of scenarios which possess different link qualities and different traffic loads. We find the ETX metric greatly improves initial route selection in AODV compared to the HOPS in the network in which only single flow exists. For networks in which there are multiple simultaneous flows, ETX behaves similar to HOPS in initial route selection. Based on these results, we find the solution of route stabilization to route oscillations in the context of ETX is only useful in the single flow case. To address this problem, we propose a modified solution of repeatedly broadcasting RREQ (Route Request) packets. Simulation results show that our modified solution allows ETX to be useful in the initial route selection in both single flow and multiple simultaneous flows cases...|$|R
