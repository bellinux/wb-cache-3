5|$|In 1791, Hamilton {{submitted}} the Report on the Establishment of a Mint to the House of Representatives. Many of Hamilton's ideas {{for this report}} were from European economists, resolutions from Continental Congress meetings from 1785 and 1786, and from people such as <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris,</b> Gouverneur Morris and Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using decimals, rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris,</b> with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, for reducing {{the cost of living}} for the poor. One of his main objectives was for the general public to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E

5|$|<b>Robert</b> <b>Morris,</b> a {{representative}} from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital {{for a period of}} 10 years. In a final attempt to convince Congress to keep the capital in Philadelphia, the city began construction on a new Presidential palace and an expansion to Congress Hall. Their efforts failed, and the federal government relocated from Philadelphia for the final time on May 14, 1800.|$|E
5|$|Several Congressmen, {{including}} Hamilton, <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris</b> and Gouverneur Morris, {{attempted to}} use this Newburgh conspiracy as leverage to secure support from the states and in Congress for funding of the national government. They encouraged MacDougall to continue his aggressive approach, threatening unknown consequences if their demands were not met, and defeated proposals that would have resolved the crisis without establishing general federal taxation: that the states assume the debt to the army, or that an impost be established dedicated to {{the sole purpose of}} paying that debt.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command. All but two or three had served in colonial or state government during their careers. The vast majority (about 75%) of the delegates were or had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during the Revolution. Several had been state governors.

He {{is best known for his}} key role in Don Bradman's Invincibles side, which made an undefeated tour of England in 1948. He was the leading scorer in the Tests on the tour, with three centuries. His efforts in the Fourth Test at Headingley helped Australia to reach a world record victory target of 404 on the final day. Morris was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century in 2000 and was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Article One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the {{authority}} to create a federal district {{to serve as the}} national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act on July 9, 1790. The Act established the District of Columbia {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River between the states of Maryland and Virginia to serve as the new federal capital. However, <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris,</b> a Senator from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris</b> as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E

The 2012–13 team started the season 1010 (26) before winning five consecutive and seven out of eight Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference games. The team then lost its two final conference games to finish 99 in conference. Eventually the team finished 1915 (99).|$|E
5|$|In mid-1644, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, the Chief Commander of the Parliamentary army, {{decided to}} reclaim the West Country. He moved through Dorset, retaking Dorchester and Weymouth, and then left the coast and headed towards Chard. At the time, Taunton was held by a {{garrison}} of 800 men commanded by Colonel John Stawell, but {{the proximity of the}} Earl of Essex's army led the town to be abandoned, leaving only 80 men to defend the castle. The historian <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris,</b> in The Sieges of Taunton 1644–1645, suggests that Stawell and his men retreated to Bridgwater, but in The History of the Rebellion, the 17th-century historian Edward Hyde claims that the troops were requisitioned by Prince Maurice during his retreat from Lyme Regis to Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception of}} Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris</b> were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E

Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to wonder whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if someone else would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E
5|$|The final {{problem was}} the poor {{financial}} situation that Nicola was in. In {{a letter to the}} Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7, 1779, Nicola asked for a pay raise, saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes. Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves. On February 5, 1782, the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time. During that same month and struggling for money, Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris</b> for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps. Even that, however, failed to give the Invalid Corps its money.|$|E
5|$|In response, the Senate {{appointed}} a committee chaired by <b>Robert</b> <b>Morris</b> to draft the necessary specifications and {{legislation that would}} officially create a federal mint and coinage. The committee presented a bill before Congress on December 21, 1791, which stated in part that the new dollar coin (which was to {{form the basis of}} the United States monetary system) should contain 371 grains of silver and a total weight of 416 grains, as Hamilton had earlier recommended. The new silver coins were to be struck in an alloy containing 1,485parts out of 1,664 (about 89.24 percent) fine silver, with the remainder copper, intended to equal the silver in Spanish dollars. However, an assay of the Spanish dollars was in error—they were in fact 65/72 silver (about 90.28 percent) with the remainder copper.|$|E
