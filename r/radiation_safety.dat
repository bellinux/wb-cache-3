5|$|High {{amounts of}} {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{can increase the}} risk of AML. Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had an increased rate of AML, as did radiologists exposed to high levels of X-rays prior to the adoption of modern <b>radiation</b> <b>safety</b> practices. People treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring AML, but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after 12 years.|$|E

At Operation Crossroads, it was his job to keep the sailors safe during the cleanup, and to avoid giving them grounds to sue the Navy if health problems developed later.|$|E
5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known {{due to the}} experience of the radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for <b>radiation</b> <b>safety</b> in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E

500|$|A chance lunchtime {{meeting with}} a wartime {{colleague}} in 1958 led Arnold {{to apply for a}} position at the Ministry of Health. The Director of Establishments there asked if he might forward her details to his counterpart at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), which he knew was expanding due to the 1957 Windscale fire, there being multiple inquiries into the disaster. To her surprise, her secretariat skills in writing and coordinating reports and studies were exactly what the UKAEA was looking for, and she was hired. After a security background check, she commenced work on 2 January 1959, with the Authority Health and Safety Branch (AHSB). She worked on the Veale Committee on Training in <b>Radiation</b> <b>Safety,</b> and, after it wound up, as personal assistant to the director, Andrew MacLean.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 18,875 film badge {{dosimeters}} were issued to personnel during the operation.

The rest were issued to all of the individuals thought to be at the greatest risk for radiological contamination along with a percentage of each group who were working in less contaminated areas. Personnel were removed for one or more days from areas and activities of possible exposure if their badges showed more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day exposure. This is [...] about the same as the annual occupational dose limit in practice at many modern U.S. nuclear facilities.

2500|$|For example, in {{considering}} <b>radiation</b> <b>safety</b> , background radiation {{is defined by}} the International Atomic Energy Agency as [...] "Dose or dose rate (or an observed measure related to the dose or dose rate) attributable to all sources other than the one(s) specified. So a distinction is made between sources of dose which are incidentally in a location, which are defined here as being [...] "background", and the dose due to a specified source. This is important where radiation measurements are taken of a specified radiation source, and the incidental background may affect this measurement. An example would be detection of radioactive contamination in a gamma ray background, which could increase the total reading above that expected from the contamination alone.|$|E

2500|$|Vehicles were {{subjected}} to rigorous checks to uncover escapees. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where an escapee might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn {{there was even a}} mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. From the late 1970s, the East Germans also installed concealed gamma-ray detectors ("gamma guns") at border crossings which used radioactive caesium-137 sources to detect people concealed inside vehicles. The discovery of this practice caused a health scare after reunification. A subsequent investigation by federal authorities found that these involuntary screenings did not result in [...] "a harmful dose" [...] despite violating basic <b>radiation</b> <b>safety</b> protocols.|$|E
2500|$|The {{heat and}} {{pressure}} of the melting reactors, caused a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water producing explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.

During {{the early days of the}} accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for <b>radiation</b> <b>safety</b> reasons.

At that time, citing subscription-only Dow Jones Newswire reports, a Barrons report said the Lynas investment was $730 million, and the projected share of the global market it would fill put at [...] "about a sixth."
