40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www. wiley. comEight new [2]rotaxanes have been prepared, incorporating an -cyclodextrin as the rotor, a stilbene as the axle, and trinitrophenyl substituents as capping groups. Strategies have been devised to elaborate these by linking the rotor to the axle, to produce two new [1]rotaxanes. Rotational motion in a selection of these rotaxanes has been investigated {{through the application of}} two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy by performing TOCSY, DQF-COSY, ROESY and HMQC experiments. This has shown that a methoxyl group incorporated on the stilbene and a succinamide joining the stilbene and the cyclodextrin behave analogously to a <b>ratchet</b> <b>tooth</b> and pawl, respectively, to restrict rotation.

5000|$|Hydraulic torque {{wrenches}} {{are used for}} tightening large torques with high accuracy. They are used for aviation and heavy machinery assembly and are specialised tools. [...] Their general construction varies depending on manufacturer and torque requirement. Generally they consist {{of at least one}} hydraulic cylinder operating a drive head ratchet. The cylinder extends, pushing the drive head round via the pawls, and then retracts freely over the <b>ratcheting</b> <b>teeth.</b> The process is repeated until the desired torque is met. Smaller hydraulic {{torque wrenches}} have a reaction arm built into the tool, which rests against another fastener or part of the assembly to prevent rotation when torque is being applied. Larger models require other fixing arrangements in order to prevent rotation.|$|R
50|$|John Harrison {{invented a}} form of {{maintaining}} power around the mid-1720s. His clocks of the period used a grasshopper escapement which malfunctioned if not driven continuously—even while the clock was being wound. In essence, the maintaining power consists of a disc between the driving drum of the clock and the great wheel. Attached to the disc is a spring which tends to push the great wheel forwards. While the clock is being wound, this spring continues to drive the clock. The reaction from the spring tries to drive the disc backwards, but this is prevented by a pawl which engages with <b>ratchet</b> <b>teeth</b> cut in {{the edge of the}} disc. At the end of winding the drive weight re-winds the maintaining spring ready for its next use. In normal operation the maintaining disc turns {{in the same direction as}} the drum and the great wheel and the <b>ratchet</b> <b>teeth</b> simply slip under the pawl. Although described here as using a driving weight it is equally applicable to spring-driven clocks and watches. The whole mechanism is completely automatic in its operation and has remained one of Harrison's lasting contributions to horology.|$|E
50|$|A {{separate}} {{set of gears}} {{called the}} keyless work winds the mainspring when the crown is rotated, and when the crown is pulled out a short distance allow the hands to be turned to set the watch. The stem attached to the crown has a gear called the clutch or castle wheel, with two rings of teeth that project axially from the ends. When the stem is pushed in, the outer teeth turn the ratchet wheel {{on top of the}} mainspring barrel, which turns the shaft that the inner end of the mainspring is attached to, winding the mainspring tighter around the shaft. A spring-loaded pawl or click presses against the <b>ratchet</b> <b>teeth,</b> preventing the mainspring from unwinding. When the stem is pulled out, the inner teeth of the castle wheel engage with a gear which turns the minute wheel. When the crown is turned, the friction coupling of the cannon pinion allows the hands to be rotated.|$|E
50|$|Even if the mainsprings {{were not}} prone to breakage, too much force during winding caused another problem in early watches, called 'knocking' or 'banking'. If very little slack {{was left in}} the spring after winding ('overwinding"), the {{pressure}} of the last turn of the winding knob put the end of the spring under excessive tension, which was locked in by the last click of the ratchet. So the watch ran with excessive drive force for several hours, until the extra tension in the end of the spring was relieved. This made the balance wheel rotate too far in each direction, causing the impulse pin on the wheel to knock {{against the back of the}} fork horns. This caused the watch to gain time, and could break the impulse pin. In older watches this was prevented with 'stopwork'. In modern watches this is prevented by designing the 'click' with some 'recoil' (backlash), to allow the arbor to rotate backward after winding by about two <b>ratchet</b> <b>teeth,</b> enough to remove excess tension.|$|E
5000|$|In 1957, Luther Kilness filed patent numbers 2,554,990 and 2,981,389 [...] {{with the}} United States Patent Office. This design {{can be said}} to be the next {{evolution}} of the ratchet design of SK Hand Tools' Theodore Rueb. This ratchet was a very successful design, lasting from its introduction in 1961 to the eventual closure of New Britain in the 1980s. The ratchet was a compression engagement, using 12 teeth with a 60 <b>tooth</b> <b>ratchet</b> count. Later ratchets, from 1971 and onward, used a 9 tooth pawl making the <b>ratchet</b> a 45 <b>tooth</b> count.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{at first}} sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman {{demonstrated}} that if the entire device {{is at the same}} temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work. The reason is that the pawl, since it is at the same temperature as the paddle, will also undergo Brownian motion, [...] "bouncing" [...] up and down. It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a <b>ratchet</b> <b>tooth</b> to slip backward under the pawl while it is up. Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction. Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature [...] of the ratchet and pawl {{is the same as the}} temperature [...] of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense. A simple but rigorous proof that no net motion occurs no matter what shape the teeth are was given by Magnasco.|$|R
50|$|The {{ratchet and pawl}} {{was first}} {{discussed}} as a Second Law-violating device by Gabriel Lippmann in 1900. In 1912, Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski gave the first correct qualitative explanation of why the device fails; thermal motion of the pawl allows the <b>ratchet's</b> <b>teeth</b> to slip backwards. Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, showing that if {{the temperature of the}} paddle T1 was greater than the temperature of the ratchet T2, it would function as a heat engine, but if T1 = T2 there would be no net motion of the paddle. In 1996, Juan Parrondo and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman's conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the quasistatic approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency. Magnasco and Stolovitzky (1998) extended this analysis to consider the full ratchet device, and showed that the power output of the device is far smaller than the Carnot efficiency claimed by Feynman. A paper in 2000 by Derek Abbott, Bruce R. Davis and Juan Parrondo, reanalyzed the problem and extended it to the case of multiple ratchets, showing a link with Parrondo's paradox.|$|R
50|$|The {{tendency}} of the pallets {{to move out of}} the path of the wheel has some serious consequences. The first is that any time that the drive to the escape wheel is interrupted the pallets lose contact and when the drive is restored, the escape wheel may not be restrained and may accelerate rapidly and uncontrollably. To prevent this happening while the clock was being wound, Harrison invented one of his longest-lasting mechanisms, a maintaining power which is still widely used in clocks and watches. In its usual construction this consists of a ratchet wheel sandwiched between, and co-axial with, the first (and slowest-turning) driving gear of the movement and the barrel that the weight (or spring) is attached to. When the clock is wound, the barrel goes backwards and a ratchet on the maintaining wheel slips over teeth cut on the barrel. The first gear is still driven forward however because there is a spring between the maintaining wheel and the first gear which pushes against it. As it does so it tries to push the maintaining wheel backwards. This is prevented from happening by a pawl fixed to the frame of the clock which engages with <b>ratchet</b> <b>teeth</b> cut round the edge of the maintaining wheel. Once the clock is fully wound, pressure on the key is released and the barrel drives the maintaining wheel and the first gear in the normal way. It also rewinds the maintaining spring ready for the next time the clock is wound. During normal operation the pawl that stops the maintaining wheel from going backwards simply slips over the teeth of the maintaining wheel.|$|E

50|$|The {{parking pawl}} locks the {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear <b>teeth</b> (<b>ratchets)</b> until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached.

50|$|The {{advancement}} of a rotor {{other than the}} left-hand one was called a turnover by the British. This was achieved by a ratchet and pawl mechanism. Each rotor had a <b>ratchet</b> with 26 <b>teeth</b> and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression. For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.|$|R
50|$|If the hub has no {{freewheel}} mechanism {{built into}} it, then a front freewheel is required, which screws onto the crank. These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes {{and use the}} same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX freewheels weren't strong enough for trials use {{and for this reason}} trials specific freewheels were designed. Trials freewheels are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the freewheel must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the freewheel will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a <b>ratchet</b> with 120 <b>teeth</b> and small <b>ratchet</b> pawls to engage them, the ratchet ring has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 ratchet pawls at a time, with 9 in total in the freewheel. Each set of 3 pawls is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical pawls with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the pawls or by having the pawls in each set of 3 pawls shorter or longer than the other sets of 3.|$|R

The work presented here demonstrates the application of this principle to supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) in order to create directed motion of charged lipid components in the membrane, which was achieved through the use of "Brownian ratchets" in patterned SLBs. Both a finite element analysis model and an experimental setup have been used to investigate the role of key parameters for the operation of these ratchets: (1) the asymmetry of the <b>ratchet</b> <b>teeth</b> and (2) the relation of the ratchet height to the period of the applied electric field.

40|$|To {{control cell}} {{motility}} {{is one of}} the essential technologies for biomedical engineering. To establish a methodology of the surface design of elastic substrate to control the long-range cell movements, here we report a sophisticated cell culture hydrogel with a micro-elastically patterned surface that allows long-range durotaxis. This hydrogel has a saw-like pattern with asymmetric gradient <b>ratchet</b> <b>teeth,</b> and rectifies random cell movements. Durotaxis only occurs at boundaries in which the gradient strength of elasticity is above a threshold level. Consequently, in gels with unit teeth patterns, durotaxis should only occur at the sides of the teeth in which the gradient strength of elasticity is above this threshold level. Therefore, such gels are expected to support the long-range biased movement of cells via a mechanism similar to the Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet, i. e., rectified cell migration. The present study verifies this working hypothesis by using photolithographic microelasticity patterning of photocurable gelatin gels. Gels in which each teeth unit was 100 - 120 µm wide with a ratio of ascending:descending elasticity gradient of 1 : 2 and a peak elasticity of ca. 100 kPa supported the efficient rectified migration of 3 T 3 fibroblast cells. In addition, long-range cell migration was most efficient when soft lanes were introduced perpendicular to the saw-like patterns. This study demonstrates that asymmetric elasticity gradient patterning of cell culture gels is a versatile means of manipulating cell motility...|$|E

Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine <b>tooth</b> <b>ratchet</b> and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets.

40|$|The {{study of}} single polymer {{dynamics}} has, {{in the past}} few years, undergone a resurgence. This has been spurred on by the emergence of the fields of micro- and nanofluidics and their associated applications, especially by their ability to promise revolutionary techniques to, for example: rapidly sequence DNA, analyze proteins, carry out large-scale laboratory techniques in centimeter sized devices (lab-on-a-chip) and test and verify fundamental concepts related to the statistical physics of single molecules in fluids. In particular, the study of (typically single, isolated) polymers and the development of theoretical methods and computational tools to examine these polymers in microfluidic environments is a key challenge. In this thesis, we examine several different phenomena related to the dynamics of polymers in either microfluidic environments or related applications to DNA sequencing or separation. A recurrent theme throughout this work is the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with an explicit solvent. Explicit solvent is an important aspect of our simulations and contrasts much work in the current literature which either artificially includes solvent or neglects it all together. This explicit inclusion of solvent allows us to explore phenomena (related to hydrodynamics) that is not observable with, for example, Brownian (or Langevin) Dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations. Chapter 2 contains a primarily computational examination of the friction coefficients of uncharged polymers. We explore the effects of deforming polymer chains on their friction coefficients along with examining several fundamental concepts of polymer friction (including hydrodynamic permeability). A key result is a verification of the hydrodynamic coupling of polymer chains resulting from a net reduction in the friction of polymer chains in hairpin (or folded) conformations. We also show that polymers undergo frictional transitions as they are stretched by an external force applied {{to the middle of the}} molecules. In chapter 3 we use some of the concepts and results from chapters 1 and 2 to explore the problem of a polymer chain migrating under the influence of an external force (or fluid flow) through a molecular obstacle course. These polymers collide with either fixed obstacles (or other polymers) and can be trapped in meta-stable long-lived, pulley-like conformations. This method can be used to separate polymers by molecular weight. We use both MD simulations and a general classical theory for the collisions to explore several different collision regimes. We also show that a classic experimental result, the formation of so-called V-shaped states, can occur in single polymer collision events, contrary to the popular assumption that it was necessary for a polymer to collide with multiple polymers. In chapter 4 we build on the results and ideas from the first three chapters and examine another phenomenon related to polymer transport, that of (Brownian) ratchets. A ratchet is essentially a method to rectify the thermal noise in a system in order to perform work, for example, to generate net transport. We use our MD simulations to examine the behaviour of polymers in the presence of an asymmetric saw <b>tooth</b> <b>ratchet</b> potential. We also show that existing ratchet models, where the ratchet widths are on the order of a polymer gyration radius, neglect an important effect of chain relaxation and thus underestimate optimal operating parameters. We propose and derive equations illustrating a new operational mode for a ratchet which inherently uses the deformation of polymer chains induced by the application of a ratcheting potential. We present a simple mathematical expression to incorporate time-dependent diffusion coefficients D (t) into ratchets. The final chapter presents work done in collaboration with Annelise Barron's group at Northwestern University and examines the breaking of polymer chains in extensional flow fields as a method to systematically and predictably reduce the polydispersity (PDI) of polymer solutions. The experimental investigation, carried out by the Barron group illustrated that a dilute polymer solution, when passed through a narrow constriction at high pressure can systematically reduce the PDI of the polymer solution. My contribution to this work was to develop a statistical model which calculates polymer molecular weight distributions and which can predict the resulting degraded polymer distribution. Two key things resulted from this investigation, the first is that polymers can break multiple times during a single scission event (i. e., one pass through the experimental system). Secondly we showed that it is possible to predictably reproduce polymer distributions after multiple scission events...|$|R
