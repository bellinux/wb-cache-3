5000|$|<b>Raja</b> <b>clavata,</b> the {{thornback ray}} (or thornback skate, roker), was named by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758, in the genus Raja of the Order Rajiformes in the Family Rajidae.|$|E
50|$|A search {{about the}} growth and {{maturation}} of <b>Raja</b> <b>clavata</b> in the Solway Firth (part of the border between Cumbria, England and Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland) shows that the males and females appear to mature at 42 and 45 cm in disc width respectively. The Solway population is heavily exploited by an unrestricted commercial fishery and a considerable proportion (48.6%) of the retained catch is immature. It is suggested that fishing pressure has brought about {{a reduction in the}} size at which female fish mature.|$|E
5000|$|Sharks {{can detect}} weak {{electric}} fields {{in their environment}} using ampullary receptors in to find their prey. A study by Kalmijn et al. 1971 observed this action. [...] Kalmijn used a type of flatfish, called a plaice as a living source of food along with the electrodes and the whiting pieces. He saw that sharks could detect plaice buried under the sand, and would smoothly change direction to where the plaice lay hidden and attack it. To determine if sharks were using electric fields or smell to detect their prey, he devised an experiment. He used the shark species Scyliorhinus canicula and the ray species <b>Raja</b> <b>clavata.</b> He created an agar chamber, which would hold a plaice (small fish), and an opening tube downstream to separate any smells. The agar chamber would enclose the plaice on all sides. The agar does not allow odors to pass, but it does allow electric field to pass through it. Kalmijn would place the plaice in the agar and bury it underneath the sand to eliminate any visual cues. When sharks were in feeding mode, they would locate the agar with the plaice underneath it and attack it near the head region (where bioelectric fields are thought to originate). If chopped up bits of whiting were put in the agar chamber, the shark would try to locate the prey via smell {{coming out of the}} outlet tube. Also, if the plaice was put in an agar chamber and covered with polyethylene film, the sharks could no longer detect the plaice. The polyethylene layer inhibits the bioelectric fields and prevents the shark from using passive electrolocation to hunt its prey. One additional behavior observed in sharks is their orientation to the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth’s magnetic field acts as a uniform field, B. When the shark swim through the Earth's magnetic field with its own velocity v, the shark induces its own electric current. Sharks swimming though the Earth's magnetic field create a voltage gradient that could act as a physical basis for compass orientation.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{population}} structure and connectivity of the Mediterranean and Atlantic <b>Raja</b> <b>clavata</b> (L., 1758) were investigated {{by analyzing the}} genetic variation of six population samples (N = 144) at seven nuclear microsatellite loci. The genetic dataset was generated by selecting population samples available in the tissue databases of the GenoDREAM laboratory (University of Bologna) and of the Department of Life Sciences and Environment (University of Cagliari), all collected during past scientific surveys (MEDITS, GRUND) from different geographical locations in the Mediterranean basin and North-east Atlantic sea, as North Sea, Sardinian coasts, Tuscany coasts and Cyprus Island. This thesis deals with to estimate the genetic diversity and differentiation among 6 geographical samples, in particular, to assess the presence of any barrier (geographic, hydrogeological or biological) to gene flow evaluating both the genetic diversity (nucleotide diversity, observed and expected heterozygosity, Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium analysis) and population differentiation (Fst estimates, population structure analysis). In addition to molecular analysis, quantitative representation and statistical analysis of morphological individuals shape are performed using geometric morphometrics methods and statistical tests. Geometric coordinates call landmarks are fixed in 158 individuals belonging to two population samples of <b>Raja</b> <b>clavata</b> and in population samples of closely related species, Raja straeleni (cryptic sibling) and Raja asterias, to assess significant morphological differences at multiple taxonomic levels.

40|$|At the {{ecosystem}} level, sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources depends {{not only on}} the status of target species but also on that of bycatch species, some of which are even more sensitive to exploitation. This is the case for a number of elasmobranchs (skates, rays and sharks) species whose abundance declined during the 20 th century. Further, the biology of elamobranchs is still poorly known and traditional fisheries stock assessment methods using fisheries catches and scientific survey data for estimating abundance are expensive or even inapplicable due to the small numbers observed.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is to sustain viable populations of large-bodied less-productive vulnerable elasmobranchs that are the by-catch of fisheries that target more productive species. The North Sea population of the thornback ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>clavata)</b> is now mainly confined to the Thames Estuary and surrounding SW North Sea, which is subject to a flatfish trawl fishery. We explored the relative effectiveness of seasonal closures versus size-based landing restrictions using a four-season age-structured model. More {{than a third of}} adult thornback rays are currently removed by fishing each year, and without effective management, a further 90 % decline within 30 years is likely. A three-season closure of the Thames Estuary was the shortest closure that ensured thornback ray recovery and minimal loss of fishery yield. Minimum and maximum landing size restrictions are nearly as effective at recovering thornback rays but less so at improving yield. While long seasonal closures and full marine protected areas are more effective at ensuring the recovery of thornback rays, length restrictions may be simpler to implement under the current institutional framework and may have less impact on the multispecies trawl fisheries operating in the area...|$|E

Thornback ray is the dominant skate species taken in targeted and mixed fisheries in this area, and is taken in various trawl, line and gillnet fisheries. Five inshore vessels {{were used in the}} study, with seven trips planned in order to examine the catches and survivorship following capture by small otter trawlers, gillnetters and longline vessels. A variety of skate and ray species is marketed as ‘skate’, and commercial landings data are for all species combined. The lack of species-specific landings data has hampered assessments of the status of individual stocks and species, although species-specific landings are required for the main skate species taken in the North Sea from 2008. Some of the larger-bodied skate species, such as common skate Dipturus batis are now of conservation concern.

40|$|Prior to the 1950 s, {{thornback ray}} (<b>Raja</b> <b>clavata</b> L.) was common and widely {{distributed}} in the seas of Northwest Europe. Since then, it has decreased in abundance and geographic range due to over-fishing. The sustainability of ray populations is of concern to fisheries management because their slow growth rate, late maturity and low fecundity make them susceptible to exploitation as victims of by-catch. We investigated the population genetic structure of thornback rays from 14 locations in the southern North Sea, English Channel and Irish Sea. Adults comprised < 4 % of the total sampling despite heavy sampling effort over 47 hauls; thus our results apply mainly to sexually immature individuals. Using five microsatellite loci, weak but significant population differentiation was detected with a global FST = 0. 013 (P < 0. 001). Pairwise Fst was significant for 75 out of 171 comparisons. Although earlier tagging studies suggest restricted foraging distances from home areas, the absence of genetic differentiation between some distant populations suggests that a substantial fraction of individuals migrate over wide areas.

40|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} {{have dramatically}} impacted elasmobranch populations worldwide. With high capture and bycatch rates, {{the abundance of}} many species is rapidly declining and around {{a quarter of the}} world's sharks and rays are threatened with extinction. At a regional scale this negative trend has also been evidenced in the central Mediterranean Sea, where bottom-trawl fisheries have affected the biomass of certain rays (e. g. <b>Raja</b> <b>clavata)</b> and sharks (e. g. Mustelus spp.). Detailed knowledge of elasmobranch habitat requirements is essential for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, but this is often hampered by a poor understanding of their spatial ecology. Habitat suitability models were used to investigate the habitat preference of nine elasmobranch species and their overall diversity (number of species) in relation to five environmental predictors (i. e. depth, sea surface temperature, surface salinity, slope and rugosity) in the central Mediterranean Sea. Results showed that depth, seafloor morphology and sea surface temperature were the main drivers for elasmobranch habitat suitability. Predictive distribution maps revealed different species-specific patterns of suitable habitat while high assemblage diversity was predicted in deeper offshore waters (400 - 800 m depth). This study helps to identify priority conservation areas and diversity hot-spots for rare and endangered elasmobranchs in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E
40|$|Crypt neurons are {{olfactory}} receptor cells {{located in}} the olfactory epi- thelium of fishes. They exhibit a peculiar and well-recognizable morphol- ogy, although their odorant specificity is still unknown. Data on their appearance during development {{are few and far}} between. This study set out to identify the time at which crypt neurons appeared in the skate, <b>Raja</b> <b>clavata,</b> using histological and immunohistochemical methods. For this purpose, embryos and juveniles at different stages of development, from 13 weeks after laying (11 weeks before hatching) to 24 weeks after hatching, were examined. The crypt neurons were identified on a morpho- logical basis. An anti–a-tubulin antibody and two lectins (wheat germ agglutinin and peanut agglutinin) were used to highlight morphological details. The olfactory marker protein was detected by immunohistochem- istry, because this protein is a marker of neuronal maturity in verte- brates. The crypt neurons could be detected by their morphology at 15 weeks after laying and became strongly olfactory marker protein immu- noreactive 22 weeks after laying. Although involvement of crypt neurons in reproductive behavior has been inferred in various studies on bony fishes, their early presence in skate embryos and juveniles may suggest that they are not exclusively involved in sexual behavior...|$|E
40|$|Occurrence, {{abundance}} and size trends of 25 demersal Chondrichthyes (10 Sharks: 3 Carcharhiniformes, 2 Hexanchiformes, 5 Squaliformes; 14 Batoids: 3 Myliobatiformes, 8 Rajiformes, 3 Torpediniformes and 1 Holocephalan: 1 Chimaeriformes) collected from 22 years (1994 – 2015) of Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MEDITS) around Sardinian seas, were given. Data relative to two strata, the continental shelf (10 – 200 m), the slope (201 – 800 m), {{and the overall}} (10 – 800 m), were analyzed {{in order to identify}} the general species distribution of their habitat preference. From the gathered data it appeared that the shelf was mostly inhabited by batoids while the slope by sharks. Only the small-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula and the thornback skate <b>Raja</b> <b>clavata</b> were equally distributed with high values of occurrence and abundance both in the shelf and in the slope. All the other species showed a preferential distribution only in one stratum (shelf or slope). In general, temporal trends of abundance indexes were stable or increasing in all strata. GAM analysis also confirmed a stable trend. Almost all species displayed stable in size structure analysis, apart from R. brachyura and Dipturus oxyrinchus that showed a statistically increasing trend. Although the investigated chondrichthyan species seemed to display a not alarming status of conservation in Sardinian seas, more investigation should be done to assure a proper management of this threatened resource...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibitory}} peptides {{have been}} searched in thornback ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>clavata)</b> muscle hydrolysed with Bacillus subtilis A 26 proteases until a hydrolysis degree of 18. 35 %. The hydrolysate showed an IC 50 of 0. 83 mg mL− 1. To identify peptides {{responsible for this}} activity, the extract was eluted through size-exclusion chromatography and fractions collected. The highest ACE inhibitory activity was found for fractions F 2 and F 3 which had IC 50 of 0. 42 and 0. 51 mg mL− 1, respectively. These fractions were analysed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). A total of 131 and 108 peptide sequences mainly derived from actin, myosin heavy chain and procollagen alpha 1 chain proteins were identified in fractions F 2 and F 3, respectively. FQPSF and LKYPI showed the best results with an IC 50 of 12. 56 and 27. 07 μM, respectively. These results prove the potential of thornback ray muscle hydrolysate {{as a source of}} ACE inhibitory peptides.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} {{a new set of}} primers specifically designed for the amplification of the mitochondrial control region in skates of the Rajinae subfamily. The suitability of the amplified region as molecular marker was tested on three Mediterranean skates species of commercial interest (<b>Raja</b> <b>clavata,</b> Raja asterias and Raja miraletus). Fifty-six skate samples collected from 6 locations around the Italian peninsula were molecularly typed for 324 – 332 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region. The target sequence was polymorphic and, therefore, informative in all three species. Although the number of individuals screened for each species/location was small, our data suggest that popula-tions of R. clavata and R. miraletus in central Mediterranean are single stocks. Conversely, there may be two genetically differentiated forms of R. asterias: one in the Adriatic Sea and the other in the Ligurian/Tyrrehenian Seas which represent separate geographic units or stocks. The highest level of genetic variability was recorded for R. clavata (H = 0. 61) and the lowest for R. miraletus (H = 0. 17), with R. asterias showing an intermediate level (H = 0. 29), though no variation was found within the two (Adriatic and Ligurian/Tyrrehenian) sub-populations of the latter. These preliminary data show the potential of the described primers set to be employed in skate population genetics and phylogeny...|$|E
