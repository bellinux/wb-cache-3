This low head power plant has an intake typical of those for which the acoustic scintillation method was developed; at present, the current meter method is actually the only IEC code approved method for discharge measurement in such intakes. The measurements were performed simultaneously with the two methods. The instruments were mounted on frames, which were moved to acquire data over the entire section. The measurement section was located more than 5 m downstream of the trash racks. The results clearly show {{the wake of the}} trash <b>rack</b> <b>elements</b> in both current meter and acoustic scintillation measurements. CFD flow simulations were also performed in order to investigate possible causes of the differences observed between methods. At La Grande- 1, the measurements were performed at three different heads, effected mainly by changing the number of units in operation during the tests. Depending on the head, the adjacent units were operating or not and that changed the approach velocity and the turbulence level in the forebay. These changes allow studying the influence of different flow conditions on the results of the measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Electricité de France (EDF) {{is funding}} a 3 -year PhD work on {{acoustic}} scintillation flow metering, {{in association with}} Hydro-Québec and ASL AQFlow. The PhD project aims at improving the discharge estimation when hydraulic conditions are not ideal for acoustic scintillation measurements, {{as well as providing}} {{a better understanding of the}} effects of sources of interference which can be encountered during the measurement process and can cause inaccuracies in the velocity estimation. In order to achieve these objectives, a fast and portable data acquisition system was set up, which relies on high speed acquisition cards. Each four channel acquisition card can be connected in parallel with up to three others, thus forming a high speed multi channel data acquisition (DAQ) system. A first test of this DAQ system was performed at one of Hydro-Québec's hydroelectric plant. As the ASFM replaced the existing trash <b>rack</b> <b>elements,</b> special equipment was designed and built to create turbulence in the flow necessary for the acoustic scintillation to operate. HPP performance tests by Hydro Quebec were duplicated with the EDF measurement system which recorded the acoustic scintillation raw signals. Using the resources available at the time, the acquired time series have a lower resolution than those provided by the Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter (ASFM). However, valid velocity estimates are possible even at this lower resolution. I...|$|R
40|$|Wind load {{governs the}} design of {{supporting}} structures of solar panels and constitutes approximately {{fifty percent of the}} total cost. There are various test scale related issues while testing solar panels (small structures) in boundary layer wind tunnel laboratories meant for tall buildings (large structures). Emergence of large testing facilities, however, is enabling testing full-scale solar panels. In this thesis an extensive experimental program is conducted at WindEEE Dome using full-scale solar panels and finite element modeling. The experimental program includes: (i) high resolution pressure tests to understand the sensitivity of pressure taps density and distribution; (ii) force balance test to determine the reactions of the solar panel under wind loading accounting for aeroelastic effects and validate pressure test results; (iii) finite element modeling to assess the internal stress of the solar <b>rack</b> <b>elements</b> and improvement of the rack cross section. Study of pressure tap layout and resolution illustrated that a fairly high density resolution is required to capture all the aerodynamic features of pressure on the solar panel surfaces. It is found that the uplift force obtained from the force balance tests are larger compared to the pressure taps as result of the dynamic effects of wind loading. The finite element analysis of solar racks was performed using the experimentally established wind loading data, which includes all dynamic features of the forces obtained from the force balances. It is concluded that the solar rack cross sections can be structurally optimized and there is a possibility to save in aluminum elements up to 40 %...|$|R

40|$|Canada's Microgravity Sciences Program (MSP) is the {{smallest}} program of the ISS partners and so can participate in only a few, highly focused projects {{in order to make}} a scientific and technological impact. One focused project involves determining the effect of accelerations (g-jitter) on scientific measurements in a microgravity environment utilizing the Microgravity-vibration Isolation Mount (MIM). Many experiments share the common characteristic of having a fluid stage in their process. The quality of the experimental measurements have been expected to be affected by g-jitters which has lead the ISS program to include specifications to limit the level of acceleration allowed on a subset of experimental <b>racks.</b> From finite <b>element</b> analysis (FEM), the ISS structure will not be able to meet the acceleration specifications. Therefore, isolation systems are necessary. Fluid science results and materials science results show significant sensitivity to g-jitter. The work done to date should be viewed only as a first look at the issue of g-jitter sensitivity. The work should continue with high priority such that the international science community and the ISS program can address the requirement and settle on an agreed to overall approach as soon as possible...|$|R
40|$|As the International Space Station orbits {{around the}} earth, {{it goes through}} {{sunlight}} and {{the shadow of the}} earth. This causes temperature variations in the station as a function of time and position. The solar arrays are very sensitive to temperature variations and generate vibratory motion which can lead to accelerations in the racks where even very small accelerations are a concern. One method of computing the rack accelerations is to first determine the solar array base loads and then use transfer functions to obtain the <b>rack</b> accelerations. Finite <b>element</b> codes that allow thermal loads are meant for structures where support loads are generated from over restraint. These codes are not meant for structures, such as solar arrays, where support loads are due to inertia forces generated by thermal loading. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show a simple method of obtaining solar array base forces when there is free thermal expansion. In such a case, the boundary forces are primarily from inertia forces and drag forces are simply negligible. The inertia forces are a product of mass and acceleration. The acceleration is estimated from thermal displacements accurately computed by MSC/NASTRAN. The mode superposition approach using MSC/NASTRAN is used to includ...|$|R
40|$|Faster, more {{powerful}} and dense computing hardware generates significant heat and imposes considerable data center cooling requirements. Traditional computer room air conditioning (CRAC) cooling methods are proving increasingly cost-ineffective and inefficient. Studies show that using the volume of room air as a heat exchange medium is wasteful and allows for substantial mixing of hot and cold air. Further, it limits cabinet/frame/rack density because it cannot effectively cool high heat density equipment that is spaced closely together. A more cost-effective, efficient solution for maximizing heat transfer and enabling higher heat density equipment frames {{can be accomplished by}} utilizing properly positioned ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂphase changeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtwo-phaseÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ pumped refrigerant cooling methods. Pumping low pressure, oil-free phase changing refrigerant through microchannel heat exchangers can provide up to 90 % less energy consumption for the primary cooling loop within the room. The primary benefits of such a solution include reduced energy requirements, optimized utilization of data center space, and lower OPEX and CAPEX. Alcatel-Lucent recently developed a modular cooling technology based on a pumped two-phase refrigerant that removes heat directly at the shelf level of equipment <b>racks.</b> The key <b>elements</b> that comprise the modular cooling technology consist of the following. A pump delivers liquid refrigerant to finned microchannel heat exchangers mounted on the back of equipment racks. Fans drive air through the equipment shelf, where the air gains heat dissipated by the electronic components therein. Prior to exiting the rack, the heated air passes through the heat exchangers, where it is cooled back down to the temperature level of the air entering the frame by vaporization of the refrigerant, which is subsequently returned to a condenser where it is liquefied and recirculated by the pump. All the cooling air enters and leaves the shelves/racks at nominally the same temperature. Results of a 100 kW prototype data center installation of the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology were dramatic in terms of energy efficiency and the ability to cool high-heat-density equipment. The prototype data center installation consisted of 10 racks each loaded with 10 kW of high-heat-density IT equipment with the racks arranged in a standard hot-aisle/cold-aisle configuration with standard cabinet spacing. A typical chilled-water CRAC unit would require approximately 16 kW to cool such a heat load. In contrast, the refrigerant-based modular cooling technology required only 2. 3 kW of power for the refrigerant pump and shelf-level fans, a reduction of 85 percent. Differences in hot-aisle and cold-aisle temperature were also substantially reduced, mitigating many issues that arise in purely air-based cooling systems, such as mixing of hot and cold air streams, or from placing high-heat-density equipment in close proximity. The technology is also such that it is able to retro-fit live equipment without service interruption, which is particularly important to the large installed ICT customer base, thereby providing a means of mitigating reliability and performance concerns during the installation, training and validation phases of product integration. Moreover, the refrigerant used in our approach, R 134 a, is a widely-used, non-toxic dielectric liquid which, unlike water, is non-conducting and non-corrosive and will not damage electronics {{in the case of a}} leakÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂa triple-play win over alternative water-based liquid coolant technologies. Finally, through use of a pumped refrigerant, pressures are modest (~ 60 psi), and toxic lubricants and oils are not required, in contrast to compressorized refrigerant systemsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂanother environmental win. Project Activities - The ARCTIC project goal was to further develop and dramatically accelerate the commercialization of this game-changing, refrigerant-based, liquid-cooling technology and achieve a revolutionary increase in energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction for our nationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure. The specific objectives of the ARCTIC project focused in the following three areas: i) advanced research innovations that dramatically enhance the ability to deal with ever-increasing device heat densities and footprint reduction by bringing the liquid cooling much closer to the actual heat sources; ii) manufacturing optimization of key components; and iii) ensuring rapid market acceptance by reducing cost, thoroughly understanding system-level performance, and developing viable commercialization strategies. The project involved participants with expertise in all aspects of commercialization, including research & development, manufacturing, sales & marketing and end users. The team was lead by Alcatel-Lucent, and included subcontractors Modine and USHose...|$|R
