5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training. He was a 50-year-old <b>retired</b> <b>army</b> general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, {{from all parts of}} society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802, {{more than}} 70% of the Westover area was common land. The act, {{together}} with the Inclosure Commissioners' Award of 1805, transferred 5000 acres {{into the hands of}} five private owners, including James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury, and Sir George Ivison Tapps. In 1809 the Tapps Arms public house appeared on the heath. A few years later, in 1812, the first official residents, <b>retired</b> <b>army</b> officer Lewis Tregonwell and his wife, moved into their new home built on land purchased from Tapps. The area was well known to Tregonwell who, during the Napoleonic wars, spent much of his time searching the heath and coastline for French invaders and smugglers.|$|E

5|$|The Smith Gun was {{an ad hoc}} {{anti-tank}} artillery piece used by the British Army and Home Guard {{during the}} Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank weaponry. The Smith Gun was designed by a <b>retired</b> <b>Army</b> Major named William H. Smith as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} being sworn in, Murphy hired Todd Schulte, his {{campaign}} manager, as his new chief of staff. He also hired one of Governor Paterson's aides, Maggie McKeon, as his communications director. For his district director, Murphy turned to Rob Scholz, a Republican. Scholz {{had worked on}} Murphy's campaign and had received praise from Larry Bulman, {{the chairman of the}} Saratoga County Democratic Committee. Within a month of being elected, Murphy opened offices in Saratoga Springs and Hudson. Murphy served the remainder of his term, but lost a reelection bid on November 2, 2010, to challenger Chris Gibson, a <b>retired</b> <b>Army</b> colonel.|$|E
5|$|Congress held {{hearings}} on the two bills {{in the summer of}} 1986. Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform. By most accounts, <b>retired</b> <b>Army</b> Major General Richard Scholtes gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada, explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.|$|E
