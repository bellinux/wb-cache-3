50|$|In {{the life}} {{insurance}} segment, fin re is more usually {{used as a}} way for the reinsurer to provide financing to a life insurance company, much like a loan except that the reinsurer accepts some risk on the portfolio of business <b>reinsured</b> under the fin re contract. Repayment of the fin re is usually linked to the profit profile of the business <b>reinsured</b> and therefore typically takes a number of years. Fin re is used in preference to a plain loan because repayment is conditional on the future profitable performance of the business <b>reinsured</b> such that, in some regimes, it {{does not need to be}} recognised as a liability for published solvency reporting.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a general class of multiprocessor shop scheduling {{problems with a}} <b>reinsure</b> objective, and present approxima-tion methods based on linear programming relaxations in the operation completion times. These LP relaxations use new classes of valid inequalities for multistage jobs. We first con-sider open shop problems with total weighted job completion time objective. For the nonpreemptive problem O[[~ wj Cj, we introduce "LP-based precedence constraints " and derive a 5. 83 -approximation algorithm. For its preemptive ver-sion, O[pmtn [y~wjCj, we show that a simple job-based greedy algorithm, using directly the LP solution, yields a 3 o approximation. We then {{consider a}} general class of multipro-cessor shop scheduling problems, preemptive or nonpreemp-tive, with precedence constraints between operations, with job or operation release dates, and with a general <b>reinsure</b> objective. This class of objectives includes, among others, weighted sums of operations completion times, job comple-tion times, stage mal~espans and the overall makespan. We combine the LP relaxation with two known techniques: (i) partitioning the set of operations using time intervals with geometrically increasing lengths; and (ii) an approximation algorithm for the makespan version of these problems with-out release dates. When the latter produces a schedule with makespan no larger than p times the "trivial lower bound" consisting of the largest of all stage average loads (or "con-gestion?) and job lengths (or "dilation"), we obtain a 2 ep-approximation, where 2 e < 5. 44. This leads in particular to a polylogarithmic approximation for the <b>reinsure</b> multi-processor dag-shop problem, and a O(1) approximation for the <b>reinsure,</b> acyclic job shop problem with unit processing times. These performance guarantees also bound the gap between optimum preemptive and nonpreernptive schedules for these problems. *Research supported by a research grant from NSERC (the Natural Sciences and Research Council of Canada) to the first author...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how reinsurers {{can meet}} the rapid changes {{occurring}} in their industry, arising from primary industry consolidation, and changes in cedent (insurance firm) buyer behavior toward bundled reinsurance products and alternative sources of capital. The paper makes the following suggestions for reinsurers. <b>Reinsures</b> need to be proactive in responding to changing patterns of premium volume and develop partnerships with global clients. Smaller reinsurers, in particular, will need to look to develop competitive niches and joint-ventures {{in order to be}} significant to these large cedents. Furthermore, <b>reinsures</b> need to continue investing in analytical expertise and resources in order to address the complex needs of their clients. Finally, reinsurers will be increasingly required to engage in alternative risk transfer products, and there will be early-mover advantages in doing so meaningfull...|$|R
5000|$|The {{arrangement}} may be [...] "quota share" [...] or [...] "surplus reinsurance" [...] (also {{known as}} surplus of line or variable quota share treaty) {{or a combination}} of the two. Under a quota share arrangement, a fixed percentage (say 75%) of each insurance policy is <b>reinsured.</b> Under a surplus share arrangement, the ceding company decides on a [...] "retention limit" [...] - say $100,000. The ceding company retains the full amount of each risk, with a maximum of $100,000 per policy or per risk, and the balance of the risk is <b>reinsured.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Facultative Reinsurance, {{which is}} {{negotiated}} separately for each insurance policy that is <b>reinsured.</b> Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their reinsurance treaties, for amounts {{in excess of}} the monetary limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk <b>reinsured,</b> the reinsurer's underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the ceding company reinsuring that one policy.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a one-period optimal reinsurance design model with n reinsurers and an insurer. For very general {{preferences of the}} insurer, we obtain that there exists a very intuitive pricing formula for all reinsurers that use a distortion premium principle. The insurer determines its optimal risk that it wants to <b>reinsure</b> via this pricing formula. This risk it wants to <b>reinsure</b> is then shared by the reinsurers via tranching. The optimal ceded loss functions among multiple reinsurers are derived explicitly under the additional assumptions that the insurer’s preferences are given by an inverse-S shaped distortion risk measure and that the reinsurer’s premium principles are some functions of the Conditional Value-at-Risk. We also demonstrate that under some prescribed conditions, it is never optimal for the insurer to cede its risk to more than two reinsurers...|$|R

50|$|The {{ceding company}} may seek a quota share {{arrangement}} for several reasons. First, {{it may not}} have sufficient capital to prudently retain all of the business that it can sell.

A continuous contract has no predetermined end date, but generally either party can give 90 days notice to cancel or amend the treaty. A term agreement has a built-in expiration date. It is common for insurers and reinsurers to have long term relationships that span many years. Reinsurance treaties are typically longer documents than facultative certificates, containing many of their own terms that are distinct from {{the terms of the}} direct insurance policies that they <b>reinsure.</b> However, even most reinsurance treaties are relatively short documents considering the number and variety of risks and lines of business that the treaties <b>reinsure</b> and the dollars involved in the transactions.
