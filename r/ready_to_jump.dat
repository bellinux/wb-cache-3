5|$|Formby went to Normandy in July 1944 in {{the vanguard}} of a wave of ENSA performers. He and Beryl {{travelled}} over on a rough crossing to Arromanches giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including on the backs of farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was too close for him to perform, so he crawled into the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS Ambitious for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with General Bernard Montgomery, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work on I Didn't Do It (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain. Between January and March 1945, shortly after the release of He Snoops to Conquer, he left on an ENSA tour that took in Burma, India and Ceylon (the latter is now Sri Lanka). The concerts in the Far East were his last for ENSA, {{and by the end of}} the war it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel.|$|E

25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E
500|$|By 9 July {{the speed}} of the drift had increased, and there were signs of {{increasing}} pressure in the pack. On 21 July the ship was caught in a position that allowed the ice to squeeze her at both ends, a grip that smashed her rudder beyond repair. According to Hooke's diary: [...] "All hands were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> overboard onto the ice. It seemed certain that the ship must go." [...] The next day Stenhouse prepared to abandon ship, but new movements in the ice eased the situation and eventually brought Aurora to a safer position. Plans to abandon the vessel were cancelled; Hooke repaired his wireless aerials and resumed his attempts to contact Macquarie Island. On 6 August the sun made its first appearance {{since the start of the}} drift. Aurora, still firmly held, was now [...] north of Cape Evans, close to Cape Adare at the northern tip of Victoria Land, where the Ross Sea merges into the Southern Ocean.|$|E

5000|$|As {{part of the}} BBC's {{coverage}} of the 2010 Grand National, jockey John Buckingham described some of the extraordinary circumstances of his win in an interview. Three jockeys had turned down Foinavon prior to the race (his price {{the day before the}} National was 500/1), but Buckingham took up the opportunity to ride in the famous steeplechase. With {{a clear view of the}} mêlée at the 23rd, Foinavon was almost hampered by Honey End, whose jockey had remounted, turned around and was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> the fence. At the next obstacle, the Canal Turn, Buckingham looked back in disbelief at the clear lead he held with just six fences remaining. After passing the elbow on the run-in, he got a final burst of energy from Foinavon, and later reflected: [...] "Then there was no doubt, I knew I won it. I was absolutely over the moon." ...|$|R

2500|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that there was considerable competition within the coalition. [...] "There were many more people with aspirations than space to accommodate them, and they all seemed <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> ship when they felt they were being excluded" [...] said Janet Kelly, a Veneuelan political commentator. Columnist Patricia Poleo of the Caracas newspaper El Nuevo Pais joined several government officials when she later suggested that during Carmona's tenure, Isaac Perez Recao, {{a member of a}} family that owned a controlling stake in a firm called Venoco, a subsidiary of which Carmona ran, had allegedly been a key financier of the coup and had been pulling strings behind the scenes. [...] "He immediately surrounded himself with people who invoked fear in Venezuela" [...] complained one official about Cormona. [...] "Obviously, this coup was very poorly coordinated. It caught the democratic opposition by surprise." [...] The Miami Herald reported that [...] "moderate politicians complained that Carmona, a centrist businessman, had been 'hijacked' by rightists." ...|$|E

2500|$|Flood is {{a highly}} {{controversial}} figure in Irish musicology. He has undoubtedly inspired a lot of more recent research, but [...] "his appreciation of detail was enthusiastic rather than thorough, and {{the contents of his}} books were often distorted by his national and religious commitment". Although he is known to have had access to sources in the Public Record Office which burnt down in the Irish Civil War in 1922, [...] "he renders himself untrustworthy by the fact that, where his sources can be checked, he sometimes misquotes or misinterprets them; and he is too <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> to conclusions which are presented as if they were facts." [...] On the other hand, he wrote [...] "at a time when it [...] was either scorned or ignored, except by a few enthusiasts." [...] Flood's most adventurous claims included an [...] "Irish Ancestry of Garland, Dowland, Campion and Purcell". Therefore, his writings on Irish musical history must be treated with extreme caution.|$|E
2500|$|Author Hilary Kingsley has {{described}} Pete as [...] "rough and ready [...] Rough {{with his tongue}} and his fists, and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> to jump into an argument whether he knows anything about it or not. Act first, think later, if at all, is Pete's attitude." [...] She inferred that he was unintelligent suggesting {{that he would not}} get into Mensa and that he seems [...] "thick as a brick". It has been suggested by writer Dorothy Hobson that the character of Pete was a portrayal of a typical East End male, [...] "macho and mouthy". Author Christine Geraghty has suggested that Pete was seemingly intolerant of difference, but that his position was always undermined [...] "by his blustering espousal of an excessively masculine position. Pete's , like much else he does, are not followed through." [...] Discussing the character's other qualities, author Kate Lock has suggested that Pete was [...] "a simple, amiable sort of chap [...] left others {{to get on with the}} complicated things in life." [...] Lock added that complications were beyond Pete's grasp and that he had trouble articulating emotions. Meanwhile, author Rupert Smith has classified Pete as a [...] "soft touch" [...] character. He added that Pete started off as [...] "a cheery chappy" [...] but became [...] "hard to like", using his failure to support his wife Kathy through her rape ordeal in 1988 as a reason why he lost public sympathy.|$|E

50|$|On {{his seventh}} Grand Prix, in Detroit, Paletti was {{much closer to}} Jarier's pace and, {{although}} the gap was still over a second, he qualified right behind his teammate. However, during the warm-up session Paletti lost a wheel at the beginning. The mechanics tried to repair the car {{in time for the}} race and, while there still was the possibility of starting the race in the spare car, that option went up in smoke as well, after Jarier's fire extinguisher had gone off accidentally. Jarier took the spare car. This meant it would be a race against time for Paletti's mechanics to set up the car and they were still busy {{when the rest of the}} field progressed to the grid. But just as the work was finished, with Paletti <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> get in the car, news broke that Jarier had hit the wall, damaged his car and was on his way back to the pits.

In the practical part of the thesis I performed tandem jumps with various types of disabilities in order to verify the theoretical assumptions. I also realised the research with the tandem passengers from the group of handicapped people to get the insight into the social impact of this sport activity on their lives.

50|$|Betty Boop {{is putting}} her nephew, Junior, to bed, {{but he is}} not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> sleep. He <b>jumps</b> on the bed, then uses a tube of {{toothpaste}} to put stripes on the cat. When Betty catches him, she tells him a fairy tale about a naughty boy. The boy in the story ties a can on a tail of a puppy resembling Pudgy the Puppy, scares a hen and prematurely frees her chick, shakes apples off a tree and cuts it down, throws bricks at a greenhouse, knocks clean laundry into the mud, and shaves the hair off a barber. When he teases a lion at a nearby circus by taking its bone out of its cage, the lion escapes its cage and the boy has to be rescued by a magic fairy (Betty Boop with fairy wings, wearing a star-covered black evening dress). The fairy rescues the little boy but makes him promise to undo all his mischief. This is done rather easily by the animators reversing the sequence of scenes from {{the first part of the}} story. Junior is not certain that he believes the story, but at last he is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go to sleep and undoes his mischief with the same reversal of sequences, and hides under the covers in fear, likely because of the lion.|$|R
