5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as {{appears to be the}} case for Mars.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At the present time, Triton's <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} {{skeleton}} extraction from 3 D objects. The presented technique for skeleton extraction from incomplete points cloud {{is based on}} ROSA (<b>Rotational</b> Symmetry <b>Axis)</b> method, while the searching for <b>rotational</b> symmetry <b>axis</b> was optimized. The method is resistant to missing data and is suitable for objects made from cylindrical parts and joints of that parts (for example human and animals bodies). In experiments, both the influence of object properties (for example missing data, chill mark, shape) {{and the influence of}} method's parameters were examined...|$|R
5000|$|A spiric {{section is}} {{sometimes}} {{defined as the}} curve of intersection of a torus and a plane parallel to its <b>rotational</b> symmetry <b>axis.</b> However, this definition does not include all of the curves given by the previous definition unless imaginary planes are allowed.|$|R
5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} <b>rotational</b> <b>axis,</b> occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> is not {{perpendicular}} to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E
50|$|Above {{relationship}} {{indicates that}} even {{when there is no}} change in angular momentum (i.e. no torques are being applied), the angular acceleration can still be non-zero. In fact, this will happen whenever the angular momentum and angular velocity point in different directions (i.e. <b>rotational</b> velocity <b>axis</b> is not the axis of symmetry).|$|R
5000|$|A {{special case}} of a toric section is the spiric section, in which the {{intersecting}} plane {{is parallel to the}} <b>rotational</b> symmetry <b>axis</b> of the torus. They were discovered by the ancient Greek geometer Perseus in roughly 150 BC. [...] Well-known examples include the hippopede and the Cassini oval and their relatives, such as the lemniscate of Bernoulli.|$|R
50|$|The spiric {{sections}} {{result from}} the intersection of a torus with a plane that {{is parallel to the}} <b>rotational</b> symmetry <b>axis</b> of the torus. Consequently, spiric sections are fourth-order (quartic) plane curves, whereas the conic sections are second-order (quadratic) plane curves. Spiric sections are a special case of a toric section, and were the first toric sections to be described.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a {{magnetic}} field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets {{the magnetic field}} of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> and displaced from {{the centre of the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> of the Moon {{lies within}} Shackleton, {{only a few}} {{kilometers}} from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect the rim, and it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age of the crater is about 3.6billion years {{and it has been}} in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years.|$|E
50|$|Decahydronaphthalene {{occurs in}} cis and trans forms. The trans form is energetically more stable because of fewer steric interactions. cis-Decalin is a chiral {{molecule}} without a chiral center; {{it has a}} two-fold <b>rotational</b> symmetry <b>axis</b> going {{through the center of}} the 9-10 bond, but no reflective symmetry. However, the chirality is canceled through a chair-flipping process that turns the molecule into its mirror image.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a novel turning process is developed, namely {{simultaneous}} three axis turning, where the tool is {{moved in a}} third <b>rotational</b> (B) <b>axis</b> besides the already existing translational (X, Z) axes. By this the geometrical flexibility of turning processes can be increased and the tool consumption can be decreased significantly. To apply the technology, models and methods are developed to design simultaneous three axis turning processes systematically and stepwise for arbitrary workpieces...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis,</b> which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's <b>rotational</b> <b>axis,</b> as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{collapse}} of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000years. Every nebula begins {{with a certain amount}} of angular momentum. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelop accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar. At this stage, the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope's opacity is so high that even millimeter-wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as very bright condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radiation. They are classified as spectral Class0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows—jets—that emanate along the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see Herbig–Haro (HH) objects). The luminosity of the Class0 protostars is high— a solar-mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is gravitational collapse, as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin nuclear fusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} field strength at Saturn's equator is about 21μT (0.21G), which {{corresponds to a}} dipole magnetic moment of about 4.6 T•m3. This makes Saturn's {{magnetic field}} slightly weaker than Earth's; however, its magnetic moment is about 580times larger. Saturn's magnetic dipole is strictly aligned with its <b>rotational</b> <b>axis,</b> meaning that the field, uniquely, is highly axisymmetric. The dipole is slightly shifted (by 0.037Rs) along Saturn's <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> towards the north pole.|$|E
25|$|The mean {{inclination}} of {{the lunar}} orbit to the ecliptic plane is 5.145°. The <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> of the Moon is also not perpendicular to its orbital plane, so the lunar equator {{is not in the}} plane of its orbit, but is inclined to it by a constant value of 6.688° (this is the obliquity). This does not mean that, {{as a result of the}} precession of the Moon's orbital plane, the angle between the lunar equator and the ecliptic would vary between the sum (11.833°) and difference (1.543°) of these two angles, but, as was discovered by Jacques Cassini in 1722, the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> of the Moon precesses with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180° out of phase (see Cassini's Laws). Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543°, even though the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.|$|E
