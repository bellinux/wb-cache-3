50|$|Converse to <b>selection</b> by <b>sorting,</b> one can {{incrementally}} <b>sort</b> by <b>repeated</b> <b>selection.</b> Abstractly, selection only {{yields a}} single element, the kth element. However, practical selection algorithms frequently involve partial sorting, {{or can be}} modified to do so. Selecting by partial sorting naturally does so, sorting the elements up to k, and selecting by partitioning also sorts some elements: the pivots are sorted to the correct positions, with the kth element being the final pivot, and the elements between the pivots have values between the pivot values. The difference between partition-based <b>selection</b> and partition-based <b>sorting,</b> as in quickselect versus quicksort, is that in selection one recurses on only one side of each pivot, sorting only the pivots (an average of log(n) pivots are used), rather than recursing {{on both sides of}} the pivot.|$|R
25|$|Insertion sort is {{very similar}} to <b>selection</b> <b>sort.</b> As in <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> after k passes through the array, the first k {{elements}} are in <b>sorted</b> order. For <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> these are the k smallest elements, while in insertion sort they are whatever the first k elements were in the unsorted array. Insertion sort's advantage is that it only scans as many elements as needed to determine the correct location of the k+1st element, while <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> must scan all remaining elements to find the absolute smallest element.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One of the {{fundamental}} issues in computer science is ordering a list of items. Although {{there is a huge}} number of sorting algorithms, sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research; because efficient sorting is important to optimize the use of other algorithms. This paper presents two new <b>sorting</b> algorithms, enhanced <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> and enhanced bubble <b>Sort</b> algorithms. Enhanced <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> is an enhancement on <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> by making it slightly faster and stable sorting algorithm. Enhanced bubble sort is an enhancement on both bubble <b>sort</b> and <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> algorithms with O(nlgn) complexity instead of O(n 2) for bubble <b>sort</b> and <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> algorithms. The two new algorithms are analyzed, implemented, tested, and compared and the results were promising...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> {{is greatly}} {{outperformed}} on larger arrays by Θ(n log n) divide-and-conquer algorithms such as mergesort. However, insertion <b>sort</b> or <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> are both typically faster for small arrays (i.e. fewer than 10-20 elements). A useful optimization in {{practice for the}} recursive algorithms is to switch to insertion <b>sort</b> or <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> for [...] "small enough" [...] sublists.|$|R
25|$|Two of the {{simplest}} sorts are insertion <b>sort</b> and <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> {{both of which are}} efficient on small data, due to low overhead, but not efficient on large data. Insertion sort is generally faster than <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> in practice, due to fewer comparisons and good performance on almost-sorted data, and thus is preferred in practice, but <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> uses fewer writes, and thus is used when write performance is a limiting factor.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{example of}} <b>selection</b> by partial <b>sorting</b> {{is to use}} the partial <b>selection</b> <b>sort.</b>|$|R
2500|$|While {{insertion}} sort typically makes fewer comparisons than <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> it requires more writes because the inner loop can require shifting {{large sections of}} the sorted portion of the array. In general, {{insertion sort}} will write to the array O(n2) times, whereas <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> will write only O (...) times. For this reason <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> may be preferable in cases where writing to memory is significantly more expensive than reading, such as with EEPROM or flash memory.|$|R
25|$|<b>Selection</b> <b>sort</b> is an in-place {{comparison}} sort. It has O(n2) complexity, {{making it}} inefficient on large lists, and generally performs {{worse than the}} similar insertion <b>sort.</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>sort</b> is noted for its simplicity, and also has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations.|$|R
2500|$|Assuming the k+1st element's rank is random, {{insertion}} sort will on average require shifting {{half of the}} previous k elements, while <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> always requires scanning all unplaced elements. So for unsorted input, {{insertion sort}} will usually perform about half as many comparisons as <b>selection</b> <b>sort.</b> If the input array is reverse-sorted, insertion sort performs as many comparisons as <b>selection</b> <b>sort.</b> If the input array is already sorted, insertion sort performs as few as n-1 comparisons, thus making insertion sort more efficient when given sorted or [...] "nearly sorted" [...] arrays.|$|R

50|$|Tournament sort is a sorting algorithm. It {{improves}} {{upon the}} naive <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> {{by using a}} priority queue to find the next element in the sort. In the naive <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> it takes O(n) operations to select the next element of n elements; in a tournament sort, it takes O(log n) operations (after building the initial tournament in O(n)). Tournament sort is a variation of heapsort.|$|R
50|$|As an example, {{consider}} the <b>sorting</b> algorithms <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> and insertion sort: <b>Selection</b> <b>sort</b> repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted remainder {{and places it}} at the front, which requires access to the entire input; it is thus an offline algorithm. On the other hand, insertion sort considers one input element per iteration and produces a partial solution without considering future elements. Thus insertion sort is an online algorithm.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{well-known}} methods by which an array can be sorted, which include, {{but are not}} limited to: <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heapsort, and counting sort.

5000|$|Simple {{calculation}} {{shows that}} insertion sort will therefore usually perform {{about half as}} many comparisons as <b>selection</b> <b>sort,</b> although it can perform just as many or far fewer depending on the order the array was in prior to sorting. It {{can be seen as}} an advantage for some real-time applications that <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> will perform identically regardless of the order of the array, while insertion sort's running time can vary considerably. However, this is more often an advantage for insertion sort in that it runs much more efficiently if the array is already sorted or [...] "close to sorted." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{priority}} queue is a data structure for maintaining {{a collection of}} items with numerical priorities, having operations for finding and removing the item with the minimum priority value. Comparison-based {{priority queue}}s such as the binary heap take logarithmic time per update, but other structures such as the van Emde Boas tree or bucket queue may be faster for inputs whose priorities are small integers. These data structures {{can be used in}} the <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> algorithm, which sorts a collection of elements by repeatedly finding and removing the smallest element from the collection, and returning the elements in the order they were found. A priority queue can be used to maintain the collection of elements in this algorithm, and the time for this algorithm on a collection of [...] elements can be bounded by the time to initialize the priority queue and then to perform [...] find and remove operations. For instance, using a binary heap as a priority queue in <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> leads to the heap sort algorithm, a comparison sorting algorithm that takes [...] time. Instead, using <b>selection</b> <b>sort</b> with a bucket queue gives a form of pigeonhole sort, and using van Emde Boas trees or other integer priority queues leads to other fast integer sorting algorithms.|$|R
