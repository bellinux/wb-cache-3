As inflatable structures deflate somewhat slowly, a warning when the blower first ceases to function give plenty of time to evacuate the inflatable, or correct the blower problem.|$|R

However the downside of the constant quest for better gadgetry is the rapidly piling hazardous wastes in our landfills. Discarded electronics are generated when users or owners of the products decide {{that they no longer}} want them. E-waste encompasses ever growing range of obsolete electronic devices such as computers, servers, main frames, monitors, TVs and monitor devices, telecommunication devices such as cell phones and pagers, calculators, audio and video devices, printers, scanners, copiers and fax machines besides refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines and microwave ovens, E-waste also covers recording devices such as DVDs, CDs, floppies, tapes, printing cartridges, military electronic waste, automobile catalytic converters, electronic components such as chips, processors, mother boards, printed circuit boards, industrial electronics such as sensors, alarms, <b>sirens,</b> security <b>devices,</b> automobile electronic devices.

40|$|Results of {{research}} on the improvement of a sinusoidal pressure generator are presented. The generator is an inlet-area-modulated, gas-flow-through <b>device</b> (<b>siren</b> type) which was developed to dynamically calibrate pressure transducers and pressure probes. Tests were performed over a frequency range of 100 Hz to 20 kHz at average chamber pressures (bias pressure) between 30 and 50 psia (21 and 35 N/sq cm abs) and between 150 and 300 psia (104 and 207 N/sq cm abs). Significant improvements in oscillation pressure waveform were obtained but with reduction in available generator oscillation pressure amplitude range. Oscillation pressure amplitude, waveform, and waveform spectral content are given as functions of frequency for the two bias pressure conditions. The generator and instrumentation for frequency, amplitude, and spectrum measurements are described...|$|R
40|$|This final project aims {{to design}} a door {{security}} device using RFID technology (Radio Frequency Identification) and the keypad {{as a method of}} access into the room. The system will automatically give warning when the code is entered incorrectly or burglars entered by breaking the door. The microcontroller that is used as the central data processing is ATMega 16 microcontroller ATMEL production and security sensors are used PIR (Passive Infra Red) and magnetic switches. The design begins with a schematic device hardware and software design using CodeVisionAVR programming. Implementation phase includes the implementation of the physical tools, programs, and sensors. The testing phase is done by testing the input sensors and exit switches, <b>siren</b> output <b>devices,</b> DC motor, LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), the RFID reader, keypad, and system controller. The results of room layered security system works according to design. PIR sensors can detect human activities and turn the LED lamp indicator on. Magnetic switch sensors will provide input to the microcontroller to enable or disable the DC motor as the room locking system. Admin menu that is accessed from the keypad is to add users, remove users, see registered users and change the password. User menu which is also accessed using the keypad, work as the room access using a username and password. This study resulted in the layered security. Room access is done using RFIDTag and password. The room piercing detection is done by sensor PIR (Passive Infra Red) and magnetic switches. Alarm used as a piercing action warning. This layered room safety device produces a better security system...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{precursors}} that {{we rely on}} to forecast volcanic eruptions depend upon detection of fluid movement or its consequences. Because of the shallow source region and the low viscosity of the moving fluids, phreatic eruptions such as the 2014 eruption of Mt. Ontake can occur with little warning; fluid movement may begin only minutes in advance of eruption. However, obvious and potentially useful seismic and geodetic precursors may be detected tens of seconds to tens of minutes before eruption. In {{the case of the}} 2014 eruption of Mt. Ontake, rapid growth of tremor activity (Fig.  3 of Ogiso et al. 2015) and tilting (Fig.  7 of Takagi and Onizawa 2016) were observed about 7  min before the eruption. From the standpoint of public safety, it is therefore useful to consider options for communicating very short-term warning of phreatic eruptions. Given the short time frame, warnings may need to be generated automatically by means of an objective algorithm and communicated directly to the public by <b>devices</b> such as <b>sirens</b> or cellular <b>devices.</b>|$|R

The use of emergency lights and <b>sirens</b> as warning <b>devices</b> by ambulances is a hotly debated topic within the Emergency Medical Services. For the last few decades, research has shown that lights and sirens have only a minimal effect on time required to transport patients to the hospital, and essentially no positive effect on patient outcome. Meanwhile, thousands of ambulance crashes occur every year (usually during the operation of lights and sirens), and its possible that's tens of thousands of crashes are occurring {{as a result of a}} passing ambulance, though not directly involving the ambulance itself. This paper is meant to provide a thorough review of the science behind the use of lights and sirens, the risks they pose to EMS providers, patients, and the public, and strategies to help curb the cost they pose both in dollars and lives. The available literature on this subject all points to the use of lights and sirens being out dated, ineffective, and dangerous, and yet almost nothing has been done to solve the problems they cause. Continued research and development is needed to help make ambulances safer for their occupants, more effective driver training programs need to be offered to EMS providers, and protocols need to be adopted to limit the unnecessary use of L&S. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
