40|$|The {{field of}} {{three-dimensional}} multi-modal X-ray nanoimaging relies {{not only on}} high-brilliance X-rays but also on high-precision mechanics and position metrology. Currently available state-of-the-art linear and <b>rotary</b> <b>drives</b> can provide 3 D position accuracy within tens to hundreds of nm, which is often insufficient for high resolution imaging with nanofocused X-ray beams.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Drilling, {{the act of}} {{creating}} a hole by removing material with a drill gloss tool is also {{carried out in the}} petroleum industry, but this is done {{with the aid of a}} drilling rig for the creation of a wellbore (hole) with the sole aim of the recovery of petroleum resources(oil and gas in this case). The drilling rig which is used to carry out this drilling operation is divided into 5 (five) systems they include: •	Hoisting system: This is the part of the drilling rig the helps increment in the wellbore depth they includes the hoisting tower structure i. e. the mast and derrick, the substructure, the draw works(hoist), the derrick line and its accessories and finally the travelling and crown block. •	Circulating system: This is the path in which mud and cuttings pass through during the drilling process so as to enhance a better rate of penetration (ROP) by suspension of cuttings ensuring that bit cuts a fresh surface while rotating, they include the stand pipe, Kelly hose, the drill stem, the annulus, the mud return line, the shale shaker, the mud pit. •	Rotary system: This system aids in the rotary action which aids drilling, ensuring a better rate of penetration (ROP), they include the swivel, Kelly, <b>rotary</b> <b>drive</b> and rotary table •	Power system: This system provides all the necessary power to carry out the drilling work; this is basically the Gen set and any other power generating equipment. •	Well control and monitoring system: this system basically helps to monitor the drilling operation, drilling a well is very dangerous, because the pressure in the reservoir could be significant high, which normally about couple thousands psi. The main part of this system is the blowout preventer(BOP) Drilling operation on the rig is carried out with the aid of drilling mud, the need for drilling mud in drilling operation cannot be over emphasized, and some of the uses of drilling mud include: •	Suspension/removal of cuttings from well, •	Control formation pressure, •	Seal permeable formations, •	Maintain wellbore stability, •	Minimize formation damage, •	Cool, lubricate, and support the bit and drilling assembly, •	Transmit hydraulic energy to tools and bit, •	Ensure adequate formation evaluation, •	Prevent inflow of formation fluid thereby preventing a kick, etc But the properties of drilling mud is dependent on the formation parameters, a drilling mud with a density of 8. 5 ppg despite being the API standard can’t be used to drill a formation of 10 ppg else caving in of the wellbore would occur thereby causing destruction of equipments, waste of time, and the need for a remedial operation such as sidetracking to be done which would require more funds for the operation, therefore the drilling mud used at any depth should be dependent of formation conditions at that depth. The properties of the drilling mud can be altered via the use of drilling mud additives, depending on the property needed to be increased. The mud weight/density can be increased to meet the well depth condition with the addition of weighter, example of a weighters include Haematite, Barite, etc these additives would help increase the mud weight to the needed weight, likewise, if the PH of our drilling mud needs to be increased in a case where by we are drilling through an acidic formation, additives which increase the ph of mud (PH Enhancers) can be used, examples of PH enhancers are potassium hydroxide(KOH), Sodium Hydroxide(NAOH), etc, there are also other parameters of drilling mud that can be altered such as viscosity, filtration, Gel strength etc...|$|E
