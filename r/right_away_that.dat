5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|Passed {{out to the}} {{occasional}} friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli {{had just returned from}} Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor RÃ©gis Debray. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution {{he did not have to}} pay.|$|E
500|$|Despite an Alternative Press {{news report}} shortly after signing with Fueled by Ramen that {{the band was}} recording, they did not start the album until February 2006. Recording took place at Salad Days Studios in Beltsville, Maryland. The group made a brief list of {{producers}} they wished to work with, the first being Matt Squire. One of the band's main reasons for wanting to work with Squire was the label's rapport with him {{as a result of}} the success of Panic! at the Disco's debut, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Janick sent Squire a demo of [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)." [...] Shaant Hacikyan recalls Squire was [...] "really excited about it. I knew <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> that we could make a great record together." ...|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography she wrote, [...] "It {{was a unique}} feeling that I had for [...] I {{would have done anything}} for him." [...] Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how [...] "blindingly" [...] in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs. Meeting when she was 34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian, but Hepburn said she [...] "knew <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> I found him irresistible." [...] Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.|$|E
500|$|Santiago and Thompson {{shared a}} room {{at the start of the}} second semester. Santiago soon {{introduced}} his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time." [...] Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago.|$|E

Upon arriving on the set, you would feel <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> something special was going to happen. You would feel spiritually awakened all of a sudden."

2500|$|Hickman {{states that}} he first became [...] "suspicious" [...] when he saw Admiral Harris on CNN {{reporting}} {{that there had been}} a suicide in which three men had hanged themselves. [...] According to Hickman, since neither he nor any of the guards working under him had seen any men from Camp One transferred to the medical center he [...] "knew <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> no one hung themselves in Camp One." [...] He said that he assumed that he would be interviewed by NCIS; he was never interviewed nor were [...] "the guards that were in the towers in the area or the sally port guards that were literally 25 meters away at most from the medical clinic."

2500|$|... âUpon {{arriving}} in a camp, a prisonerâs first care {{is to get}} to know his enclosure [...] I observed <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> there was little hope in this regardâ. For prisoners, escape signified not only flight from the conditions of detention but also regaining their status as soldiers and being able once again to fight and lead their country to victory. Military honour and patriotism were powerful motivators. Most of the time, escapes occurred from work kommandos, from which it was easier to hide. Escape required great psychological and physical preparation. Going to the nearest town to take a train or walking to the border implied a considerable effort, especially considering that prisoners were underfed. Moreover, they could not use well-travelled roads lest they be found. A prisoner had to blend in, adopt local mannerisms so as not to appear suspicious, know how to speak German and have credible civilian clothing: âThe state of an escapeeâs soul? Itâs not fear. Itâs tension of the spirit, a perpetual 'who goes there?'â ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after McKnight's firing, Peligro {{introduced}} Kiedis and Flea {{to a young}} teenage guitarist named John Frusciante. Kiedis {{actually had}} met Frusciante a year earlier outside {{of one of the}} band's shows. Frusciante was originally directed to audition for the band Thelonious Monster, but Kiedis said that he knew <b>right</b> <b>away</b> <b>that</b> Frusciante would be in his band. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] knows all the shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musicianâall he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante performed his first show with the band on September 17, 1988. The new lineup immediately began writing music for the next album and went on a short tour dubbed the Turd Town Tour, although in November, Kiedis and Flea felt the need to fire drummer Peligro due to his own drug and alcohol problems. Much like McKnight, Peligro did not take the news well. Flea stayed in bed for days after making the decision. Years later, Kiedis said firing Peligro was one of the toughest things the band ever had to do, although Kiedis became a major part of Peligro's road to sobriety, which began right after he was fired.|$|E
