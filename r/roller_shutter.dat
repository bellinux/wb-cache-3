25|$|The main {{locomotive}} {{works are}} located at Bridgnorth. It is not normally {{open to the}} public but conducted tours and open days are arranged from time to time. Major features of the locomotive works include the boiler shop equipped with overhead crane, Noble and Lund wheel lathe, ex-LT lifting jacks and a Wheeldrop recovered from Leicestershire, installed in 2010. Works to enclose the southern end of Bridgnorth locomotive shed with <b>roller</b> <b>shutter</b> doors, improve natural illumination and waterproof the building more effectively were completed in early 2009. This forms the first of a number of phases to improve the Bridgnorth site both for staff and for visitors.|$|E

50|$|A <b>roller</b> <b>shutter,</b> roller door or {{sectional}} {{overhead door}} {{is a type}} of door or window shutter consisting of many horizontal slats (or sometimes bars or web systems) hinged together.

In shutter form, it is used in front of a window and protects the window from vandalism and burglary attempts.|$|E
50|$|The south {{elevation}} {{is occupied}} {{almost entirely by}} two continuous bands of windows following an identical pattern to the north elevation but without the projecting centre bay. At ground floor level two doors interrupt the pattern at the eastern end and toward the centre two window bays have been removed and in filled with fibre cement boarding and an aluminium window.

In 1908 the Brownlow Hall was added and named after Major General Brownlow, who was president of the C. of E. Institutes.

50|$|High-speed {{doors are}} door systems, mainly used in {{industrial}} applications. They are technical enhancements of the generally known sectional doors, PVC fabric doors or <b>roller</b> <b>shutters.</b> The main {{difference is that}} the durable construction provides a higher operating speed and they are able to sustain a higher number of cycles (opening and closing cycles) and require lower maintenance and repair cost. Depending on the intended field of application, horizontal or vertical operating door types are available.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper takes decorticator's {{core part}} (Illustration of <b>roller</b> and <b>shutter</b> equipment) {{as the object}} of study, through {{analyzing}} the principle of the gingko decorticator for peeling off the shell, and choosing the roller's material and its superficial shape, we calculate the action of gingko’s entrance to the gap between <b>roller</b> and <b>shutter,</b> and elaborate the two influences on the effect of peeling off the shell, the gap between <b>roller</b> and <b>shutter</b> and the speed of peeling. The decorticator which makes through this research may achieve good results that the husking yield is bigger than 85 %, percentages of damage is smaller than 10 %, the broken kernel rate is smaller than 7 %. And it provides the theory basis for the improvement design and use of the next generation installment for peeling the shell...|$|R
