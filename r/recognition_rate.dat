40|$|The {{intensity}} of asylum flows {{over the last}} 20 years represents a significant challenge to national and European policy making. This article studies the dynamic reciprocal effects between asylum applications and <b>recognition</b> <b>rates</b> in 29 European countries over 24 years. Furthermore, it explores {{the impact of the}} national economic and political context on these two aspects of asylum policy. Using a wide range of statistical models and approaches, the article reveals that asylum applications exert a negative effect on <b>recognition</b> <b>rates,</b> and <b>recognition</b> <b>rates</b> exert a positive effect on applications. However, despite their statistical significance, the effects are rather small and mostly related to between-country rather than within-country variation, which implies that they are of limited practical significance.

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the self-conscious emotions of embarrassment, shame, and pride have distinct, nonverbal expressions that can be recognized in the United States at above-chance levels. However, few studies have examined the recognition of these emotions in other cultures, and little research has been conducted in Asia. Consequently the cross-cultural generalizability of self-conscious emotions has not been firmly established. Additionally, there is no research that examines cultural variability in the recognition of the self-conscious emotions. Cultural values and exposure to Western culture have been identified as contributors to variability in <b>recognition</b> <b>rates</b> for the basic emotions; we sought to examine this for the self-conscious emotions using the University of California, Davis Set of Emotion Expressions (UCDSEE). The present research examined recognition of the self-conscious emotion expressions in South Korean college students and found that <b>recognition</b> <b>rates</b> were very high for pride, low but above chance for shame, and near zero for embarrassment. To examine what might be underlying the <b>recognition</b> <b>rates</b> we found in South Korea, recognition of self-conscious emotions and several cultural values were examined in a U.

Emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>rates</b> were generally similar between the European Americans and Asian Americans, and higher than emotion <b>recognition</b> <b>rates</b> for Asian-born individuals.
