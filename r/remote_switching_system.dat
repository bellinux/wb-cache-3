50|$|Pressing {{a single}} key of a {{traditional}} analog telephone keypad produces a telephony signaling event to the <b>remote</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system.</b> For touchtone service, the signal is a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling tone consisting of two simultaneous pure tone sinusoidal frequencies. The row in which the key appears determines the low-frequency component, and the column determines the high-frequency component. For example, pressing key 1 results in signal composed of tones with frequencies 697 hertz (Hz) and 1209 Hz.|$|E

50|$|A <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> {{operator}} {{is used to}} remotely operate {{various types}} and styles of circuit breakers and controls. When the remote racking system is {{used in conjunction with}} a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> operator, the user can also operate, trip, and release the circuit breaker from a safe distance.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to dialing instructions, the system {{also included a}} number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600 Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the frequency of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user had gone on-hook (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> also going on-hook, freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600 Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. If the tone was sent manually by the local user into the phone line, it would trigger the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> to go on-hook, but critically, the local switch knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically, not by the tone (which their local <b>switch</b> ignored). The <b>system</b> was now in an inconsistent state, leaving the local user connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the phreaks learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the <b>remote</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|R

50|$|The host switch {{provides}} connectivity between the <b>remote</b> <b>switches</b> {{and to the}} larger network, and the host may also directly handle some rare and complex call types (conference calling, for example) that the remote itself is not equipped to handle. Host switches also perform OAM&P (Operation, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning) functions, including billing, for the entire cluster of the host and its <b>remote</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Normally, long-distance {{calls were}} billed locally. Since the [...] "trick" [...] {{required}} {{a long distance}} call {{to be placed in}} order to connect to the <b>remote</b> <b>switch,</b> it would be billed as usual. However, there were some types of calls that had either no billing, like calls to directory service, or for which the billing was reversed or billed to another number, like WATS lines (area code 800 numbers). By dialing one of these [...] "toll-free" [...] numbers, the caller was connected to a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> as normal, but no billing record was made locally. The caller would then play the 2600 Hz tone into the line to return the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> to on-hook, and then use a blue box to dial the number to which they really wanted to connect. The local Bell office would have no record of the call.|$|R
50|$|A key {{capability}} of a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> {{is the ability}} to act in emergency standalone (ESA) mode, wherein local calls can still be placed even in the event that the connection between that remote and the host has been lost. In this mode, only local calling is available anyway, so the billing {{capability of}} the host switch is not required. ESA is increasingly available on digital loop carrier platforms as well as on purpose-built <b>remote</b> <b>switches</b> in order to improve the scope of their utility.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We discuss {{stability}} of a loop {{consisting of two}} asynchronous <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> in which the first <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> influences the input and the switching signal of the second <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> and the second <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> affects the first <b>switched</b> <b>system’s</b> jump map.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of components. The components do not interact with one another. Rather, they all interact with the same environment, which switches one of them on at each moment in time. In standard concurrency, a component restricts {{the environment of the}} other components, thus the concurrent system has fewer behaviors than its components. On the other hand, in a <b>switched</b> <b>system,</b> a component suggests an alternative to the other components, thus the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has richer behaviors than its components. We study finite-state <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> where each of the underlying components is a finite-state transducer. While the main challenge, namely compositionality, is similar in standard concurrent <b>systems</b> and in <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> the problems and solutions are different. In the verification front, we suggest and study an assumeguarantee paradigm for <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> and study formalisms in which satisfaction of a specification in all components imply its satisfaction in the <b>switched</b> <b>system.</b> In the synthesis front, we show that while compositional synthesis and design are undecidable, the problem of synthesizing a switching rule with which a given <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> satisfies an LTL specification is decidable. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} discuss the method of {{computing}} the viability kernel conveniently, we present some important features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> are dynamical systems that consist of {{a finite number of}} subsystems and a logical rule that orchestrates switching between these subsystems. Therefore, one of the features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> is multi-subsystem. In addition, <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> could not be guaranteed to be stable even if all subsystems are stable. Switching rule may be designed to stabilize <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> even if all subsystems are unstable. According to the discussion above, the computation of the viability kernel is affected by the switching rules and subsystems.|$|R
