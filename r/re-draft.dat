Although the film had a strong cast and production, Rossen's <b>re-draft</b> of the script may be the greatest influence on the film. While the character of Captain Larsen remained both victim and oppressed in a capitalist hierarchy, he {{became a symbol of}} fascism. He split the novel's idealist hero into an intellectual bosun and a rebellious seaman. Warner Bros. cut many political points during production.|$|E

50|$|Robert Rossen's <b>re-draft</b> of {{the script}} may be the {{greatest}} influence on the film. While the tyrannical captain remained both victim and oppressed in a capitalist hierarchy, he {{became a symbol of}} fascism.

Rossen added scenes for this pair, partly urged by Lupino. However, Warner Bros. cut many political items during production.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2008, Richmond {{applied to}} the AFL to {{transfer}} Polak to the rookie list, primarily to free up a position on their senior list that {{would enable them to}} recruit Ben Cousins as well as <b>re-draft</b> David Gourdis. The AFL rejected this request, but Richmond still managed to select both players, Cousins in the Pre-season draft and Gourdis in the rookie draft. [...] Polak returned to training during the 2009 pre-season and was selected to play in a NAB Challenge practice match against St Kilda.|$|E

50|$|Employers {{also learned}} a {{valuable}} lesson in this case by realizing how important a clear and unambiguous policy is. The decision of Stengart v. Loving Care has led many employers to <b>re-draft</b> their policies {{so as to avoid}} future misunderstandings and uncertainties. Such company electronic communication and Information Technology (IT) policies now commonly describe how information can be gathered from company computers, the storage capabilities of company computers, and ways in which monitoring of information will be conducted. This also has helped employers eliminate any questions or doubt as to what information and monitoring methods the company is entitled to and also what the employee can and cannot do.|$|E
50|$|We share a very vivid {{memory of}} Joe as editor. It {{takes the form}} of a mysterious wavy line, which he was wont to draw in the margin of this or that {{paragraph}} we had nervously proffered. This undemonstrative graphic gesture would say it all: telling us to think again, to <b>re-draft,</b> to watch the rhythms, the cadance of the words. He could communicate so sparsely because one of his many gifts was to inspire you, as a writer, by the persuasiveness, energy, and beauty of his prose; you came to live for the—rarely bestowed—small check marks that signalled approval; the wavy line could keep you awake at night.|$|E

"The {{borders are}} often {{located in the}} desert, which in case of chaos, issues such as [...] "sovereignty", {{expulsion}} of ambassadors, closure of checkpoints and demands to <b>re-draft</b> borders result in the arrival of scientists wearing khaki shorts and caps accompanied by beautiful women on top of Jeep cars. Those who drafted the borders in the past {{come from all over}} to draw them again. Each country strives to acquire a new piece of 'wilderness' and you will never understand why those are so keen to expand their area in a 'homeland' where humans cannot afford a piece of cloth to patch their robes, not even with a 'fig leaf'" ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1983, Feast {{took time}} off sick at a moment's notice, causing the Coronation Street script writers {{to have to}} <b>re-draft</b> 12 episodes (then the {{equivalent}} of six weeks of programmes.) He claimed to be depressed, had trouble remembering his lines, and suffered from bouts of uncontrollable weeping. Podmore later {{said that if he}} had come to him and explained this in the first place, his role could have been temporarily reduced; appearing as a barman in the Rovers, the focal point of Coronation Street, means that an actor tends to be in more scenes than other characters. Bill Podmore described Feast as [...] "earthy", and Fred Gee as being a toned-down screen version of Fred Feast.|$|E
50|$|Ari Handel—Aronofsky's {{collaborator}} on The Fountain, The Wrestler, and Black Swan—helped Aronofsky {{develop the}} script.

After a period of consultation and <b>re-draft,</b> the new legislation became law in April 2007 with additional aspects coming into force in August 2007 and fully in January 2008.

5000|$|In early 2016, the Niskanen Center {{published}} a {{post on the}} [...] "libertarian case" [...] for the socialist Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. As Wilkinson wrote, [...] "The libertarian case for Bernie Sanders is simply that Bernie Sanders wants to make America more like Denmark, Canada, or Sweden … and the citizens of those countries enjoy more liberty than Americans do.

[...] Taylor seconded this position, asserting {{that there is a}} [...] "case to be made that Sanders has been the most libertarian candidate in the presidential race" [...] and calling for a [...] "more thoughtful <b>re-draft</b> of the Sanders agenda." [...] Taylor further linked this case for Sanders to a broader reformulation of political libertarianism, stating: ...|$|E
50|$|Lonergan {{decided to}} {{continue}} his AFL career, after considering premature retirement, with Geelong agreeing to delist Lonergan, but then <b>re-draft</b> him via the Rookie Draft, with Geelong hoping that other clubs would avoid drafting Lonergan due {{to the extent of}} his injuries. Lonergan believed the outcome would benefit both the club and himself, with the club able to draft a new talented youngster through the National Draft, and himself able {{to continue his}} recovery at a stable rate. The club is reported to have taken this decision to help Lonergan if he wished to continue his career. Lonergan himself considered retirement following the surgery, but opted to return. Club doctor Chris Bradshaw compared Lonergan's efforts to return to professional sport with those of Jason McCartney, who was injured in the 2002 Bali Bombing before playing one final game.|$|E
