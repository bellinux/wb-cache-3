50|$|Relays and {{vacuum tubes}} (thermionic tubes) were {{commonly}} used as switching elements; a useful computer requires thousands or {{tens of thousands of}} switching devices. The overall speed of a system is dependent on the speed of the switches. Tube computers like EDVAC tended to average eight hours between failures, whereas <b>relay</b> <b>computers</b> like the (slower, but earlier) Harvard Mark I failed very rarely. In the end, tube-based CPUs became dominant because the significant speed advantages afforded generally outweighed the reliability problems. Most of these early synchronous CPUs ran at low clock rates compared to modern microelectronic designs. Clock signal frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 4 MHz were very common at this time, limited largely by the speed of the switching devices they were built with.|$|R
5000|$|At {{a meeting}} with the NRC in March 1949, the NRC turned down their request for {{additional}} funding for the license, and instead suggested that the Center invest in a fully electronic computer, upping the yearly grants to $50,000 to that end. This {{turned out to be a}} major [...] "win" [...] - [...] <b>relay</b> based <b>computers</b> quickly disappeared, and electronic systems proved themselves quickly.|$|R
50|$|Early digital {{computers}} were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays {{to perform the}} calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, {{was one of the}} earliest examples of an electromechanical <b>relay</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Z2 was a {{mechanical}} and <b>relay</b> <b>computer</b> created by Konrad Zuse in 1939.

In contrast to the Z1, the Z2 used 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic instead of 22-bit floating point.|$|E
50|$|Bauer's {{early work}} {{involved}} {{the construction of}} computing machinery (e.g. the logical <b>relay</b> <b>computer</b> STANISLAUS from 1951-1955). In this context, {{he was the first}} to propose the widely used stack method of expression evaluation. Bauer also worked in the committees that developed the imperative computer programming languages ALGOL 58 and its successor ALGOL 60, important predecessors to all modern imperative programming languages. In 1968, Bauer coined the term Software Engineering which has been in widespread use since.|$|E
5000|$|After the United States entered World War II in December, 1941, Bell Labs became {{active in}} {{developing}} fire-control devices for the U.S. military. The Labs' most famous invention was the M-9 Gun Director, an ingenious analog device that directed anti-aircraft fire with uncanny accuracy. Stibitz {{moved to the}} National Defense Research Committee, an advisory body for the government, but he kept close ties with Bell Labs. For the next several years, with his guidance, the Labs developed <b>relay</b> <b>computers</b> of ever-increasing sophistication. The first of them {{was used to test}} the M-9 Gun Director. Later models had more sophisticated capabilities. They had specialized names, but later on, Bell Labs renamed them [...] "Model II," [...] "Model III," [...] etc., and the Complex Number Computer was renamed the [...] "Model I." [...] All used telephone relays for logic, and paper tape for sequencing and control. The last of this series, the [...] "Model V", was completed in 1946 and was a fully programmable, general-purpose <b>computer,</b> although its <b>relay</b> technology made it slower than the all-electronic computers then under development.|$|R

25|$|E-mail {{was first}} invented for CTSS and similar time sharing {{systems of the}} era in the mid-1960s.

The team was initially led by Conny Palm, who died in December 1951, after which Stig Comét took over. The hardware {{was developed}} by Erik Stemme. Gösta Neovius and Olle Karlqvist were responsible for architecture and instruction set. It was closely modeled on the IAS machine for which the design team had retrieved drawings during a scholarship to Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.S.|$|E
50|$|Kathleen and Andrew Booth's team at Birkbeck were {{considered}} {{the smallest of}} the early British computer groups. From 1947 to 1953, they produced three machines: ARC (Automatic <b>Relay</b> <b>Computer),</b> SEC (Simple Electronic Computer), and APE(X)C (All-purpose Electronic (Rayon) Computer). She and Mr. Booth worked on the same team. He built the computers and she programmed them. This was considered a remarkable achievement due {{to the size of the}} group and the limited funds at its disposal. Although APE(X)C eventually led to the HEC series manufactured by the British Tabulating Machine Company, the small scale of the Birkbeck group did not place it in the front rank of British computer activity.|$|E

40|$|The witness seminar ”Tidig programmering” [Early pro-gramming] {{was held}} at Tekniska museet [The National Museum of Science and Technology] in Stockholm on 16 March 2006 and led by Lars Arosenius. Different aspects of early {{programming}} {{and the development of}} programming languages were covered at the seminar. The physical difficulties in the programming of the <b>relay</b> <b>computer</b> BARK were observed. Furthermore the problems that the restricted memory capacity of the early computers brought to their programming were discussed. The importance of the capacity to create program libraries and manage subroutines was discussed. The first operating systems were mentioned. Attention was paid to the design of the early programming language ALFAKOD used on the BESK and FACIT EDB computers. Also the founding of the early software companies Autocode AB and Nordisk ADB AB was mentioned. Moreover the development of a compiler for the ALGOL programming language at Facit AB was dealt with. This work {{led to the development of}} the ALGOL-GENIUS language at Saab AB during the first half of the 1960 s.

40|$|The {{final design}} of an {{electro-mechanical}} drill {{is very simple}} both in shape and in mechanism. It is a straight tube consisting of an antitorque section, motor and computer section, chip chamber and core barrel. Three cutters (rake angle : 30 to 40 degrees, pitch : 5 to 7 mm) are attached to cut an ice core 94 mm in diameter and bore hole 135 mm in diameter. The maximum core length is 2. 1 m long. Chips are transported between the core barrel and the outer tube by spiral rim attached to the core barrel. No motor for sucking chips up to the chip chamber is installed. The chips are separated from liquid by the filter at top of the chip chamber, and are compacted to the density of 500 kg/m^ 3. In the pressure tight electronics section, a computer, DC brushless motor (270 V, 600 W, 12000 rpm) and reduction gear (1 / 170) are installed. The antitorque section has three leaf springs. A steel cable 7. 7 mm in diameter has been chosen. The actual drilling operation is easy, for {{in response to the}} cutter load, a switching signal (go or stop) can be sent from the <b>relay</b> <b>computer</b> to the winch controller.
