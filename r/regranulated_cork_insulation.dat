5000|$|Titan 34D-7 was {{the first}} failed launch of a solid motor-equipped Titan vehicle from Vandenberg (there had been several {{failures}} from Cape Canaveral over the years) and was particularly vexing because of inadequate launch data - the Titan III's flawless West Coast launch record meant that the Air Force felt confident enough to remove several telemetry measurements from the boosters {{in the interest of}} reduced weight and complexity. There had evidently been leaks from both the fuel and oxidizer tanks and suspicion hinged on clamps that held the propellant feed lines in place. However, the clamps had not failed on any previous launches so it was not clear why they would suddenly fail now. Some members on the investigative board even proposed that the SRBs had suffered an exhaust gas leak which caused damage to the core stage.

Both buildings have been built with similarity, {{and they have the}} same geometrical characteristics and typologies such as place, volume, area site, orientation and econornical level.

40|$|Cork is {{a natural}} raw {{materials}} used in numerous traditional and innovative applications among which the most famous are <b>cork</b> stoppers, <b>insulation</b> boards, and wall and floor covering. Cork exhibits a relatively homogeneous honeycomb structure composed of polyhedron cells filled with gas, which gives its specific properties such as elasticity or hydrophobic behavior. Mechanical properties of cork have been studied from a long time. However, in many industrial applications cork is increasingly used as granulate (> 200 μm) or powder (< 200 μm) obtained by milling processes. By generating failure in the raw material, the comminution of cork could damage cells and induce modifications in the mechanical behavior of cork particles but {{the relation between the}} size of the particles and the mechanical properties of the packaging is still little known. In this study, we investigate the effect of cork particles size reduction on the mechanical properties of the packing. To this end, eighteen discrete size fractions of cork from 0 to 25 μm to 2. 5 – 3 mm, generated by impact milling were characterized in term of shape, loaded density, and elastic recovery. Experiments show that impact milling mainly affects the elastic properties of particles less than 200 μm. The mechanical behavior of cork particles was also described by model based on a mixing law taking in account the size and the shape of particles and the amount of damaged cells in the particles. The fitting of the model to the experimental data suggests that the elastic properties of the packing of cork particles have {{to be related to the}} content of damage cells more than to their size...|$|R
40|$|Envelope {{insulation}} is {{a relevant}} technical solution to cut energy consumption and reduce environmental impacts in buildings. <b>Insulation</b> <b>Cork</b> Boards (ICB) are a natural thermal insulation material whose production promotes the recycling of agricultural waste.

A “cradle-to-cradle” environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed according to International LCA standards and the European standards on the environmental evaluation of buildings.

40|$|Cork is a {{wonderful}} plant materials whose low density, hydrophobic behavior and high elastic recovery allowed its use in many traditional and innovative applications such as <b>cork</b> stoppers, <b>insulation</b> boards, rubber composites, wall and floor covering, shock absorbers, biosorbtion, etc (Pereira, 2007; Silva et al., 2005). Cork exhibits a relatively homogeneous honeycomb structure composed of polyhedron cells filled with gas. Each cell is constituted of two hexagonal bases with prismatic faces. (Pereira, 2007). The fragmentation of cork in particles by milling processes (Rives et al., 2012) may induce two extreme scenariis {{depending on how the}} fracture path propagates in the tissues which could affect cork properties and processability : (I) a maximal cell preservation case for which the fracture path passes between the cells. In this case, all the cells present at the surface of the particle are preserved in integrality. (ii) A maximal cell degradation case for which the fracture path passes through the cells. In this case the cells at the surface of the particle are degraded and leaking gas, while only the cells in the center are preserved. A better understanding of the effect of milling on particules properties would be required to improve both the process and the product, opening the way to higher quality particles. To study this, cork particles were generated by a combination of milling and sieving to produce 18 discrete particle sizes from 0 to 3000 μm. The different fractions were precisely characterized in terms of particle shape, packing density, compressibility and elasticity. Microscopic observations were also performed to estimate the average cells dimensions and the percentage of degraded cells at the surface. The results indicate that milling does not affect particle shape, which could be assimilated to a slightly elongated parallelepiped. In addition, the characterization indicates that the finest fraction exhibits a higher compressibility but a lower elasticity. A geometrical mathematical model was developped, to which the experimental data were successfully fit. The analyses showed that although the milling of cork reduces its mechanical properties, this degradation is more strongly correlated to the number of degraded cells than to the particle size reduction. Therefore, significant optimization of the cork processability could be obtained by milling technologies which preserved the cell structure...|$|R

These guidelines are skyrocketing in use due in part to two reasons: ? increased awareness of a need for reducing, reusing, and recycling in order to save resources and natural areas for future generations; and, ? increased amount of time spent indoors in work places and homes. The LEED guidelines encourage sustainable and responsible use of land, water, energy, and materials, and promote a safe and healthy environment through use of innovative designs and technology. As part of the responsible use of materials, the LEED guidelines encourage the use of rapidly renewable materials such as cotton, straw, wool, and <b>cork</b> as <b>insulation</b> products. Although these products can be produced naturally and quickly from nature, they are also cellulose or carbohydrate based products. Cellulose and carbohydrate based materials are typically optimal food sources for mold in the presence of moisture, ironically destroying facilities and creating poor living and work environments.

In addition, samples with increased amounts of moisture were examined to determine increased promotion of mold growth. The results from this study showed that all of the above mentioned materials were highly susceptible to mold growth and that the moisture amount did not increase the rate of mold growth.

The environmental balance is based on “cradle to grave” (C 2 G) Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies, and focused on the car- bon footprint and the consumption of renewable and non-renewable primary energy of these materials. The energy balance considers the main thermal insulating characteristics of these products, including the improvements on the energy performance of the buildings envelope after its installation for renovation and the corresponding energy savings. The final balance between the environmental and energy performance includes the estimation, from C 2 G, of: the carbon saved and the consumption of renewable and non-renewable primary energy. The analysis of {{the results of this study}} shows that external wall alternatives of ETICS with ICB have an environmental advantage in terms of the categories “Global Warming Potential” (GWP) and consumption of non-renewable primary energy (PE-NRe), namely due to the production stage of ICB in comparison with EPS. Assessing the energy consumption needed to fulfil the heating and cooling needs of the interior space of a building for both solutions with the same thickness, the EPS solution requires lower energy consumption, due to its lower U-Value. The lower acquisition cost of this solution always results on a lower “Cradle to Cradle” (C 2 C) cost. Comparing two solutions with similar U-values but different thicknesses (the ICB boards with a bigger thickness due to the lower U-Value), the consumption of energy needed to fulfil the heating and cooling needs is almost the same, differing in the acquisition cost of the solutions and in the energy and resources necessary in the production of the materi- als.
