40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{anthropogenic}} sources of noise (e. g. sonar, seismic surveys) on the behaviour of marine mammals is sometimes quantified as a dose-response relationship, where {{the probability of}} an animal behaviourally 2 ̆ 7 responding 2 ̆ 7 (e. g. avoiding the source) increases with 2 ̆ 7 dose 2 ̆ 7 (or <b>received</b> <b>level</b> of noise). To do this, however, requires a definition of a 2 ̆ 7 significant 2 ̆ 7 response (avoidance), which {{can be difficult to}} quantify. There is also the potential that the animal 2 ̆ 7 avoids 2 ̆ 7 not only the source of noise but also the vessel operating the source, complicating the relationship. The proximity of the source is an important variable to consider in the response, yet difficult to account for given that <b>received</b> <b>level</b> and proximity are highly correlated. This study used the behavioural response of humpback whales to noise from two different air gun arrays (20 and 140 cubic inch air gun array) to determine whether a dose-response relationship existed. To do this, a measure of avoidance of the source was developed, and the magnitude (rather than probability) of this response was tested against dose. The proximity to the source, and the vessel itself, was included within the one-analysis model. Humpback whales were more likely to avoid the air gun arrays (but not the controls) within 3 km of the source at levels over 140 re. 1 μPa s, meaning that both the proximity and the <b>received</b> <b>level</b> were important factors and the relationship between dose (<b>received</b> <b>level)</b> and response is not a simple one...|$|R

30|$|In the K-user {{deterministic}} interference channel, each active level conveys one bit. To avoid collision, {{each level}} at the receiver side should be occupied either by a signal bit or by an interference bit. Actually, this interference bit {{can be a}} modulo- 2 addition of several interference bits, since {{it is not necessary}} to decode each of these interference bits separately. In order to leave as many receive levels as possible “free” for reception of signal bits, it will be advantageous if multiple interference bits fall on one <b>receive</b> <b>level.</b> This is the principle of interference alignment in amplitude space: the alignment of interference saves amplitude levels for desired signals and thus the throughput can be increased.|$|E

At most hospitals, it takes 18 months to implement the necessary infrastructure and coordinate all of the supporting processes. However, administrators at Lankenau Medical Center, in Wynnewood, PA, had a more ambitious goal. They wanted to reach “Trauma Ready” status in just six months, and they came to Jefferson for help getting there. In partnership with Jefferson’s Division of Acute Care Surgery, the new Lankenau Medical Center Trauma Program opened on January 1, 2016.

40|$|Objetivou-se comparar o consumo, o desempenho, a eficiência alimentar e as características de carcaça de bovinos de três grupos genéticos (GG) alimentados com dois níveis de concentrado. Foram utilizados 48 bovinos castrados, sendo 16 Nelore (NE), 16 Nelore-Angus (NA) e 16 Nelore-Simental (NS). Doze animais (quatro de cada GG) foram abatidos como referência e para os 36 animais remanescentes, a mistura de concentrado da ração foi oferecida em 1 e 2 % com base no peso {{corporal}}, perfazendo um fatorial 3 × 2, em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com seis repetições. O valor de significância foi definido em 0, 05. As dietas isoproteicas foram compostas de silagem de milho e concentrado. O experimento foi composto de três períodos de 28 dias cada e todos animais abatidos ao final. O consumo de matéria seca (CMS) e demais nutrientes, exceto fibra em detergente neutro, foi maior nas dietas com alto nível de concentrado. O consumo de matéria seca dos animais mestiços foi maior que dos nelores, porém os Nelore-Angus apresentaram consumo maior quando comparado ao dos Nelore-Simental. Não foram observadas diferenças no desempenho dos animais entre os níveis de concentrado. Igualmente, os ganhos de carcaça e de corpo vazio foram maiores quando 2 % de concentrado do peso corporal foi oferecido. O desempenho dos animais mestiços foi superior ao dos nelores, embora diferenças não tenham sido identificadas entre os mestiços. Não foram encontradas diferenças no índice bionutricional dos animais entre os dois níveis de concentrado, em eficiência alimentar para carcaça e ganho de peso do corpo vazio. Animais que consomem mistura de concentrado no nível de 2 % do peso corporal apresentam maior consumo e desempenho se comparados àqueles que recebem o nível 1 %, porém não ocorre diferença na eficiência alimentar. Nelore-Simental é mais eficiente que Nelore-Angus, mas ambos os grupos genéticos de mestiços são mais eficientes que o Nelore. In {{the present}} work we aimed to compare intake, performance, feed efficiency and carcass traits of cattle from three genetic groups (GG) fed two concentrate {{levels in the}} diet. Forty-eight steers (16 Nellore, 16 Nellore-Red Angus and 16 Nellore-Simmental) were used. Twelve steers were slaughtered {{at the beginning of}} experiment as a reference group and for the remaining 36 animals, the concentrate mixture of the ration was offered as 1 and 2 % of body weight basis in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design, with six repetitions. The value of significance defined was 0. 05. Isoprotein diets were composed of corn silage and concentrate. The trial was comprised of 3 periods of 28 days each and all animals slaughtered at the end. The dry matter and nutrients intake was higher in diets with high concentrate level of steers, except for neutral detergent fiber. The dry matter intake of crossbred steers was higher than that of Nelore, however Nellore-Angus presented greater intake as compared with Nellore-Simmental. No differences were observed for animal performance among concentrate levels. Conversely carcass and empty body weight gain were higher as 2 % of body weight concentrate was offered. The crossbreds performance was higher than that of Nelore, although no differences were verified among crossbreds. No differences were found in the bionutritional index between the two concentrate levels, in feed efficiency to both carcass and empty body weight gain. Animals consuming concentrate mixtures at the level of 2 % of body weight presents greater intake and performance than those that <b>receive</b> <b>level</b> of 1 % of body weight basis, but with no differences in feed efficiency.
