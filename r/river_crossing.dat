5|$|The <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> {{remained}} secret until Hungarian envoys, {{who were}} attempting to negotiate a peace, informed the Grand Master. As soon as Ulrich von Jungingen grasped the Polish–Lithuanian intentions, he left 3,000 men at Schwetz (Świecie) under Heinrich von Plauen and marched the main force to organize a line of defense on the Drewenz River (Drwęca) near Kauernik (Kurzętnik). The <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> was fortified with stockades. On 11 July, after meeting with his eight-member war council, Władysław II Jagiełło decided against crossing the river at such a strong, defensible position. The army would instead bypass the <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> by turning east, towards its sources, where no other major rivers separated his army from Marienburg. The march continued east towards Soldau (Działdowo), although no {{attempt was made to}} capture the town. The Teutonic army followed the Drewenz River north, crossed it near Löbau (Lubawa) and then moved east in parallel with the Polish–Lithuanian army. According to the Order propaganda the latter ravaged the village of Gilgenburg (Dąbrówno). Later, in the self-serving testimonies of the survivors before the Pope the Order claimed that Von Jungingen was so enraged by the alleged atrocities that he swore to defeat the invaders in battle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> was unopposed until 08:00, {{when the}} {{defending}} force launched a mortar {{attack against the}} crossing point. Nonetheless, the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade cleared the river by 09:00 that morning and reached Stankovac.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the NK 9th Division, {{in their first}} {{offensive}} of the war, stood {{only a few miles}} short of Yongsan after a successful <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> and penetration of the American line. Division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong.|$|E

5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At the end of {{the last}} Ice Age, the glaciers left behind a uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning <b>River</b> <b>crossing</b> the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were {{eventually}} drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E
5|$|After the Allegheny <b>River</b> <b>crossing</b> {{the turnpike}} returns to four lanes, {{passing through the}} Oakmont Country Club. The highway heads {{southeast}} to Monroeville, an eastern suburb of Pittsburgh; an interchange with I-376/US22 (Penn–Lincoln Parkway) provides access to Pittsburgh. East of Monroeville, the turnpike continues through eastern Allegheny County before crossing into Westmoreland County. Here, it heads south to the exit for US30 in Irwin.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>river</b> <b>crossing,</b> {{the highway}} enters Benzie County {{and runs through}} the Pere Marquette State Forest. South of Benzonia, M-115 runs {{concurrently}} with US31 into town. The highways separate {{in the center of}} town where M-115 turns westward to run along the south shore of Crystal Lake past Frankfort Dow Memorial Field, the local airport near Frankfort. M-115 follows Forest Avenue, and the highway designation ends at the intersection in town with M-22 near Betsie Lake.|$|E

5|$|After the split, US 46 {{turns into}} a limited-access road again and passes under Main Avenue/CR 601 and former Erie Railway tracks before coming to an {{interchange}} with the northern terminus of Route 21.

5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died. The survivor was awarded a pension, {{believed to be the first}} in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{geography}} – {{the only place}} in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> and starting in the mid-19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E

5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, {{the railway}} built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was {{constructed}} south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on {{the opposite}} bank of the Thames, {{both of which were}} distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> became a major traffic bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Just {{south of}} the hamlet of Peru, the short NY442 terminates at Route22. In the hamlet itself, after the Little Au Sable <b>River</b> <b>crossing,</b> NY22's other suffixed route, NY22B, {{branches}} off further inland. NY22 continues north of Peru, {{and returns to the}} Northway's side again in a mile. After another five miles (8km), it has its first exit on the Northway near the now-closed Plattsburgh Air Force Base. It continues northeastward, crossing the Saranac River into Plattsburgh, the first city and most populous community NY22 has passed through since White Plains.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December, at {{approximately}} 07:00, the independent HV armoured-mechanised unit advanced northwest along the Kupa, towards Gračanica. During the advance, {{one of the}} tanks was captured and its crew killed after the capture. Nearly simultaneously, the JNA commenced a tank and mortar attack against Stankovac and the <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> at Šišinec. The HV armoured-mechanised unit and the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade panicked, believing the crossing point was lost, and started to fall back to Šišinec in disarray, sustaining considerable casualties. Since {{there was no way}} to transport the remaining HV armour across the Kupa River, the tanks were destroyed by one of the force's own tanks. That tank was then destroyed with explosives to prevent its capture. As there were too few boats at the <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> to allow a quick retreat, some of the troops swam across the river, causing several to drown in very cold water. The command post of the brigade fell back to Galdovo, while the troops started to retreat to Zagreb. The entire brigade was back in Zagreb by 15 December.|$|E

5|$|Taken {{together}} with the other sources above, this Hospital {{must be seen as}} a significant medieval establishment. It served a number purposes; especially the provision of a sub-monastic care home for locals. There is no clear evidence about the inclusion of women. The location of the hospital adjacent to a <b>river</b> <b>crossing</b> on the drove road indicates that it was a travellers inn. The hospital at Soutra Aisle in the Scottish Borders served a similar purpose. In addition to being a Traveller's Inn, {{it may have been a}} Chantry for the Cathedral in Old Aberdeen.|$|E
