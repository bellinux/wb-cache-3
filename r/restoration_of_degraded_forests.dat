These one-day excursions typically follow a mixed pattern of nearly-constant steps when individuals displace from their homes towards potential collecting sites and a mixed pattern of steps of different lengths when actually searching for fallen wood in the forest.

These potentials can be realized by deliberate targeting of REDD+ programs at regions that will maximize both emissions reduction and biodiversity conservation ("Harnessing carbon payments to protect biodiversity, " O.

Measures of plant richness, diversity, vegetation structure, invasive alien plants (IAPs) and ecological processes were contrasted across a chronosequence of habitats under restoration (0 -year-old, 3 -year-old and 5 -year-old) and compared with a reference forest habitat (remnant natural forest). Native tree species recruitment and vegetation structure increased with restoration age. Ecological processes, represented by the composition of pollination and seed dispersal traits in all of the habitats under restoration, were similar to the reference habitat. However, low tree density and an increase in IAP cover with an increase in restoration age were identified as threats to reforestation success. We recommend enrichment planting and an effective IAP management strategy to promote more rapid habitat restoration while reducing site maintenance costs. Enrichment planting should not only focus on increasing tree species density and richness, but also on the inclusion of species with missing pollination and seed dispersal categories.

40|$|Background <b>Restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>forest</b> {{ecosystem}} {{is crucial}} for regional sustainable development. To protect the country’s fragile and fragmented environment, the Chinese government initiated an ecological engineering project, the Natural Forest Protection Program, in seventeen provinces in China beginning in 1998. Fully hillside-closed forest protection (vegetation restoration naturally without any artificial disturbance) was one of vital measures of the Natural Forest Protection Program applied nation wide. Whether plant diversity, biomass and age structure of dominant tree species and soil nutrients in protected stands may become better with increase of protected period are still open problems. Methods We investigated community diversity, biomass of dominant tree species, age structures, and analyzed soil chemical properties of a Pinus tabulaeformis population at protected sites representing different protected ages at Huanglongshan Forest Bureau on the Loess Plateau, Shaanxi, China.

Research into forest soil characteristics before reforestation is not common practice in the Republic of Srpska, and very often is not successful because it has not been established which soil environment conditions are most appropriate for a particular tree species. Soil degradation has been attributed to improper management and the unplanned deforestation of some parts of the Javor Mountain.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the impacts of low-intensity experimental prescribed fires on four ecological processes in young commercial Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands eight years after the burning. The processes of interest were tree mortality, dead wood creation, regeneration and fire scar formation. These were inventoried in twelve study plots, which were 30 m x 30 m in size. The plots belonged to two different stand age classes: 30 - 35 years or 45 years old at the time of burning. The study was partly a follow-up of study plots researched by Sidoroff et al. (2007) one year after burning in 2003. Tree mortality increased from 183 stems ha- 1 in 2003 to 259 stems ha- 1 in 2010, corresponding to 15 % and 21 % of stem number respectively. Most mortality was experienced in the stands of the younger age class, in smaller diameter classes and among species other than Scots pine. By 2010, the average mortality of Scots pine per plot was 18 %, but varied greatly ranging from 0 % to 63 % of stem number. Delayed mortality, i. e. mortality that occurred between 2 and 8 years after fire, seemed to become more important with increasing diameter. The input of dead wood also varied greatly between plots, from none to 72 m 3 ha- 1, averaging at 12 m 3 ha- 1. The amount of fire scarred trees per plot ranged from none to 20 %. Four out of twelve plots (43 %) did not have any fire scars. Scars were on average small: 95 % of scars were less than 4 cm in width, and 75 % less than 40 cm in length. Owing to the light nature of the fire, the remaining overstorey and thick organic layer, regeneration was poor overall. The abundance of pine and other seedlings indicated a viable seed source existed, but the seedlings failed to establish under dense canopy. The number of saplings ranged from 0 to 12 333 stems ha- 1. The results of this study indicate that a low intensity fire does not necessarily initiate the ecological processes of tree mortality, dead wood creation and regeneration in the desired scale.

40|$|Tropical dry {{forests are}} one of the most {{degraded}} and threatened forest ecosystems in Central America. The thesis summarises results from four separate studies in the dry forests of Nicaragua with the aim to gain knowledge that will support future restoration endeavours. In the first study, aspects of stand dynamics in dry deciduous and gallery forests were investigated over a 7 -year period. The result shows that stem density and basal area decreased by 13 % and 8 %, respectively for the dry deciduous forest. The changes in stem density and basal area for the gallery forest were negligibly low. The mortality and recruitment rates for the deciduous forest were 4. 5 and 2. 5 % year, respectively, and the corresponding values were 4. 2 and 4. 0 % yearfor the gallery forest. The causes of mortality could be anthropogenic and natural disturbances. In the second study, the natural regeneration of three dry forest species (Lonchocarpus minimiflorus, Tabebuia ochracea and Lysiloma divaricatum) in relation to slope of the terrain and crown exposure to direct sunlight was investigated over three years. The density of recruits varied significantly among species and over time. L. minimiflorus and T. ochracea had the highest densities compared with L. divaricatum, and the net change in population density was slightly positive for T. ochracea only. - 1 - 1 Regeneration was more abundant in the gentle and steep slopes under partial exposure of the crown to sunlight, thus resulting in aggregated pattern of distribution, especially for L. minimiflorus and T. ochracea. The third study dealt with recovery of woody vegetation after 4, 9 and 14 years of abandonment of agriculture. The floristic, structural and diversity measures increased with age of abandoned fields. In the fourth study, seed germination responses of four dry forest species: Bombacopsis quinata, L. divaricatum, Cordia alliodora and Tabebuia rosea, to different constant and alternating temperature regimes under continuous light or darkness in the laboratory, and the effect of canopy cover on seedling survival of B. quinata, C. alliodora and T. rosea in the field were investigated. The optimal temperature for germination was between 20 and 25 °C for all species. The alternating temperature regimes tested in the present study did not bring beneficial effect on germination compared with the constant temperature regimes, although its effect was modulated by light condition for some of the species. Survival of C. alliodora seedlings was higher in open and partially-open sites than in the understory. B. quinata had the lowest survival, and survival of T. rosea was higher on open site.

Location: Suburban forests near Basel, northwestern Switzerland. Methods: We compared various soil characteristics and {{the performance of}} the understorey vegetation in six beech forest areas frequently disturbed by recreational activities with those in six undisturbed control areas, in spring 2003. In the same forest areas, the soil seed bank was investigated using the seedling emergence method. Samples were obtained from soil cores in January 2003. Results: We found substantial changes in soil compaction, above-ground vegetation and in the soil seed bank due to recreational activities. In frequently visited areas, soil compaction was enhanced which caused a decrease in cover, height and species richness of both herb and shrub layers. Compared with control areas, the number of trampling-tolerant species of the seed bank was significantly higher in disturbed areas, and total species richness tended to be higher in disturbed than in control areas. Furthermore, the similarity in species composition between the above-ground vegetation and seed bank was significant lower in disturbed than in control areas. Conclusions: The intensive use of suburban forests for recreational activities, mainly picnicking, affects the vegetation of natural beech forests.

40|$|Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) {{involves}} the ecological <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>forest</b> landscapes, {{with the aim}} of benefiting both biodiversity and human well-being. We first identify four fundamental principles of FLR, based on previous definitions. We then critically evaluate the application of these principles in practice, based on the experience gained during an international, collaborative research project conducted in six dry forest landscapes of Latin America. Research highlighted the potential for FLR; tree species of high socioeconomic value were identified in all study areas, and strong dependence of local communities on forest resources was widely encountered, particularly for fuelwood. We demonstrated that FLR can be achieved through both passive and active restoration approaches, and can be cost-effective if the increased provision of ecosystem services is taken into account. These results therefore highlight the potential for FLR, and the positive contribution that it could make to sustainable development. However, we also encountered a number of challenges to FLR implementation, including the difficulty of achieving strong engagement in FLR activities among local stakeholders, lack of capacity for community-led initiatives, and the lack of an appropriate institutional and regulatory environment to support restoration activities. Successful implementation of FLR will require new collaborative alliances among stakeholders, empowerment and capacity building of local communities to enable them to fully engage with restoration activities, and an enabling public policy context to enable local people to be active participants in the decision making process. © 2012 by the author(s).

40|$|Under REDD+, the {{enhancement}} of carbon stocks through reforestation and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>degraded</b> <b>forest</b> landscapes offers considerable potential benefits. In the Asia-Pacific region, however, many previous reforestation and forest restoration initiatives have exacerbated existing inequities by concentrating resources among powerful political and economic actors, often {{to the detriment of}} forest-dependent communities. Both in design and implementation, tree-planting programs have been guided by forest rent distribution practices of state forestry bureaucracies and by corporate accumulation strategies linked to increasingly globalized commodity chains. This article examines the political economy of reforestation and forest restoration programs in Asia-Pacific and highlights governance challenges these pose. In various contexts, they have: consolidated the control of state agencies and corporate actors over 'degraded' forest landscapes, often resulting in the displacement of rural communities; exacerbated economic disparities by channeling large capital subsidies and resource rents to companies with close ties to state elites; facilitated corruption and financial fraud, in some cases on a grand scale; accelerated biodiversity loss by creating perverse incentives for the conversion of 'degraded' secondary forests; and generated mixed results for rural small-holders, at times locking them in inequitable agreements with plantation companies, and in other cases, offering enhanced tenure security. To avoid the negative results of earlier reforestation schemes. REDD+ must incorporate: (1) rightsbased spatial planning; (2) equitable and accountable distribution of financial incentives: (3) improved financial governance to prevent corruption and fraud; (4) policy reform to remove perverse incentives for forest conversion; (5) strengthening of economic benefits and safeguards for small-holders...|$|R

40|$|After {{listing the}} five key {{elements}} <b>of</b> ecological <b>restoration,</b> ecology, economics, social values, cultural values, and politics, I celebrate {{the fact that}} in Brazil there is legislation on how to perform ecological <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>degraded</b> tropical <b>forests,</b> as well as an ongoing dialogue among legislators and scientists about this legislation, and also a lively debate among scientists as the best way forward, referring to articles by Brancalion et al. (2010) and Durigan et al. (2010) in this issue of Revista Árvore. Legislators elsewhere, especially megadiversity countries, should take note. I do not take sides in the debate; I think both groups of authors make very good points. Instead I call on the scientists and legislators concerned with restoration to ponder five strategic tools: A. Start with clear concepts. B. Decide {{where you want to go}} and why. C. Negotiate who should benefit & how, and who should pay, how, & why. D. Work out how an honest cost-benefit analysis <b>of</b> <b>restoration</b> would look, regardless of the biome in which you are working. Finally, figure out how to make the restoration immediately attractive for private landowners. Otherwise, they will not cooperate as fully as they could or should, and restoration efforts will not achieve its full potential...|$|R

The experimental fields were maintained for 1080 days. The growth and biomass varied depending on the plant species. All native plants responded well to the supplementation with the native PGPB. The plants such as Pongamia pinnata, Tamarindus indica, Gmelina arborea, Wrightia tinctoria, Syzygium cumini, Albizia lebbeck, Terminalia bellirica, and Azadirachta indica performed well in the native soil.

40|$|Seed bank {{dynamics}} and forest regeneration in a secondary lowland rainforest in Nigeria were studied {{with a view}} to determine the potential contribution of the soil seed bank to the regeneration of the forest. Six 25 x 25 m plots were used and in each plot, ten replicates top soil 0 - 15 cm were collected in March, June and October. The soil samples were subjected to seedling emergence for 20 months to determine density and species composition of the seed banks of the study plots. The results showed that there were more individuals in plot C (a disturbed plot) and herbaceous species dominated (more than 96 %) the seed bank of all the study plots and across the seasons. Few woody species emerged in all the plots and there was significant difference (p< 0. 05) in density both between the plots and months. Similarity between seed bank and vegetation composition, no matter the forest state, is very low. The most frequent species in the vegetation are absent in the seed bank and vice versa. The seed bank is mainly composed of early successional species and seeds of primary forests are rare in the soil. The few woody species recorded indicate that the soil seed bank may not be an important conservation tool for the regeneration <b>of</b> the <b>degraded</b> <b>forest,</b> therefore reforestation is recommended for <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>degraded</b> <b>forest...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{indicate}} native species {{to be used}} in the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>degraded</b> riparian <b>forests</b> in the subwatershed of Peixe-Boi river. All trees and shrubs with diameter at breast height (DBH) > 5 cm were inventoried in ten areas of secondary forest and six areas of igapó forest. The results were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and the silviculture of the species was assessed by literature review. In Igapó areas 66 species were found; the areas had low richness and low diversity index of Shannon, when compared with data from the secondary forests. The floristic composition was heterogeneous, and the floristic similarity is higher between areas that are closer geographically. In the secondary forests were found 175 species; the areas showed high abundance of individuals, high species richness, diversity and evenness. Secondary forests were separated according to geographic proximity and age, which is directly linked to the successional stage. The PCA analysis established the ecological importance of 29 tree species; however only ten species had enough silvicultural information. Due to a greater ecological importance and viable silvicultural techniques available in the literature, Carapa guianensis, Pachira aquatica, Spondias mombin, Tapirira guianensis and Virola guianensis are the most suitable species to restore the degraded areas, in association with Inga edulis, Jacaranda copaia, Pseudopiptadenia psilostachya, Simarouba amara and Vismia guianensis of the secondary forests, that can be planted in the borders and in the nearby areas of igapó forests...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of floristic {{and structure of}} tree communities is essential to subside the strategies <b>of</b> forest <b>restoration.</b> In this sense, a phyto-sociological survey was conducted in a forest fragment situated along a tributary of Caeté river, in Alfredo Wagner, state of Santa Catarina, in order to: i) know the structure of trees and flora in this forest, ii) classify the species found according to ecological groups and iii) compare the flora {{of the study area}} with other studies in Araucaria forest (FOM), Atlantic Rain Forest (FOD) and the transition area between FOM-FOD of Santa Catarina state. In this fragment, 10 plots of 400 m 2 were allocated, where all individual trees with the circumference at breast height (CBH, measured at 1. 30 m above the ground) {{greater than or equal to}} 15. 7 cm were measured, marked and identified. The species were classified into the following succession groups: pioneer, climax light-demanding or climax shade-tolerant. The Rectified Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used for the floristic comparison. The structure of the tree component was described by the density, frequency, dominance and importance value (VI). The results showed elevated species richness (98 species). It was found typical species of FOM, such as Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) Kuntze, and species characteristics of FOD such as Byrsonima ligustrifolia A. Juss., confirming the study fragment as an area of ​​ ecological tension between FOM and FOD. The species with most elevated VI were Psychotria vellosiana Benth., Alsophila setosa Kaulf. and Guatteria australis A. St. - Hil. The species with elevated VI, for their considerable representation in the area, are important in the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>degraded</b> riparian <b>forests</b> in the region. The species seedlings plantation should be planned observing the group successional of each species, planting pioneer and light-demanding climax species first (e. g.

Restoration could potentially mitigate the impacts of deforestation, yet knowledge on how to efficiently allocate funding for restoration is still in its infancy. We systematically prioritize investments in restoration in the tropical landscape of East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and through this application demonstrate the capacity to account for a diverse suite <b>of</b> <b>restoration</b> techniques and forests of varying condition. To achieve this we develop a map of forest degradation for the region, characterized on the basis of aboveground biomass and differentiated by broad forest types. We estimate the costs <b>of</b> <b>restoration</b> as well as the benefits in terms of carbon sequestration and improving the suitability of habitat for threatened mammals through time. When the objective is solely to enhance carbon stocks, then <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> highly <b>degraded</b> lowland <b>forest</b> is the most cost-effective activity. However, if the objective is to improve the habitat of threatened species, multiple forest types should be restored and this reduces the accumulated carbon by up to 24 %.
