It was only about 50 feet above the ground before the <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> alerted the pilot to the fact the plane's undercarriage hadn't lowered. The pilot opened up the throttle and climbed away. As this was a moment Anderson always remembered, he found it all too easy to write about aircraft when he devised stories for Thunderbirds. After completing his military service, he returned to Gainsborough, where he worked until the studio was closed in 1950. He then worked freelance on a series of feature films.|$|E

40|$|Although London Heathrow {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} {{airports}} in the world, it has only one runway for use by departing aircraft at any time. Separations are required between each pair of aircraft at take-off—depending on their routes, weights, and speeds—to ensure safety. Efficient scheduling of the aircraft for take-off can reduce the total separations and increase throughput. A <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> is responsible for take-off scheduling. This is a very intensive job with responsibility for all communication with aircraft and continuous monitoring to assure safety. The high workload limits the number of aircraft that the controller can take account of when scheduling. The geometry of the runway holding points adds physical constraints to the reordering of aircraft that are usually ignored in the academic literature. We present models for evaluating a schedule and determining the effects of the physical constraints. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic system that takes account of more aircraft than a human controller can handle, and so can aid the <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> by recommending schedules that anticipate some future problems. We present results to show the effectiveness of this system, and we evaluate those results against real-world schedules...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} building an automated decision support methodology to tackle the complex problem faced every day by runway controllers at London Heathrow Airport. Aircraft taxi from stands to holding areas {{at the end of}} the current take-off runway where they wait in queues for permission to take off. A <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> attempts to find the best order for aircraft to take off. Sequence-dependent separation rules that depend upon aircraft size, departure route and speed group ensure that this is not a simple problem to solve. Take-off time slots on some aircraft and the need to avoid excessive delay for any aircraft make this an even more complicated problem. Making this decision at the holding area helps to avoid the problems of unpredictable push-back and taxi times, but introduces a number of complex spatial constraints that would not otherwise exist. The holding area allows some flexibility for interchange of aircraft between queues, but this is limited by the physical layout of the current holding area. These physical constraints are not usually included in academic models of the departure problem However, any decision support system for the takeoff <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> must include them. We show, in this paper, that a decision support system could help the controllers to significantly improve the departure sequence at busy times of the day, by considering the taxiing aircraft in addition to those already at the holding area.

The agent-based model has been developed in a hierarchical way. At the highest level, the relevant agents including human operators and technical systems were identified. Then the interactions between these agents were captured and included deterministic and stochastic relationships, as is appropriate for the human performance or the technical systems considered. The impact on the emergent safety behavior was studied through running simulations of both nominal and off-nominal scenarios.|$|E

The sequence in which aircraft take off is very important and can have a huge effect upon the throughput of the runway and the consequent delay for aircraft awaiting take-off.

The task presented by NATS was to develop the decision-making algorithms for a decision support tool to aid a <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> to solve this complex real-world problem. A design for such a system is presented in this thesis. Although the decision support system presents only a take-off sequence to controllers, it is vitally important that the movement within the holding area that is required in order to achieve the re-sequencing is both easy to identify and acceptable to controllers. A key objective of the selected design is to ensure that this will always be the case. Both regulatory information and details of controller working methods and preferences were utilised to ensure that the presented sequences will not only be achievable but will also be acceptable to controllers. A simulation was developed to test the system and permit an evaluation of the potential benefits. Experiments showed that the decision support system found take-off sequences which significantly reduced the delay compared with those that the runway controllers actually used. These sequences had an equity of delay comparable with that in the sequences the controllers generated, and were achieved in a very similar way. Much of the benefit that was gained was a result of the decision support system having visibility of the taxiing aircraft in addition to those already queueing for the runway. The effects of uncertainty in taxi times and differing planning horizons are explicitly considered in this thesis. The limited decision time available ensures that it is not practical for a <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> to consider as many aircraft as the decision support algorithms can. The results presented in this thesis indicate that huge benefits may be possible from the development of a system to simplify the sequencing task for the controllers while simultaneously giving them greater visibility of taxiing aircraft. Even beyond these benefits, however, the system described here will also be seen to have further potential benefits, such as for evaluating the effects of constraints upon the departure system or the flexibility of holding area structures.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{recent research}} into the departure process at London Heathrow, with the primary motivation of {{reducing the amount of}} fuel used, improving both the economic and environmental cost. Two proposals are considered here. The first proposal considers the practicality and potential benefits of aiding the controller to improve the take-off sequencing. The second proposal aims to absorb some of the inevitable delay for aircraft at the stands, before the engines are started, but also involves a take-off sequencing aspect. Models for the two take-off sequencing problems are presented in this paper, the second of which includes an additional pushback time (or TSAT) allocation sub-problem which has to be solved subsequently. These models have distinctive differences from the models for the takeoff and arrival sequencing problems which are usually considered in the literature, since they take into account necessary constraints imposed due to the control problem (whether a sequence can actually be achieved, and how) in each case. As discussed in this paper, the control problem cannot be ignored by the controllers at Heathrow, so cannot be ignored by any realistic system to aid them in their tasks. Comparative take-off sequencing results are presented for the two systems and the potential benefits from providing decision support to the <b>runway</b> <b>controllers</b> or improved TSAT allocation at the stands are considered. The paper ends with some overall conclusions from the research, showing the large potential benefits of these systems. The TSAT allocation system which is discussed in this paper has been developed for implementation at London Heathrow as one element of the Collaborative Decision Making project. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem faced by runway controllers at London Heathrow Airport {{as they attempt to}} determine the best order for aircraft to take off. The order in which aircraft take off can have a large effect upon the throughput of the runway and the consequent delay for aircraft. Although two runways are available for use at Heathrow, in order to control noise for residents on the flight paths, only one is used for departures at any time. The other is used for arrivals. As {{this is one of the}} busiest international airports in the world, and the runway is the bottleneck for the departure system, it is important to attain high runway throughput. A <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> re-arranges the aircraft for take-off within holding points at the ends of the runways, currently performing this task manually.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{situation}} awareness (SA) addresses perception of {{elements in the}} environment, their interpretation, and the projection of their future status (Endsley 1995). Stroeve et al. (Stroeve et al. 2003) have captured these perception, interpretation, and project notions of SA mathematically in terms of three components namely, State SA, Mode SA, and Intent SA. The state SA represents the awareness by one agent of other agents. In {{the context of the}} active runway crossing operation, this might be the awareness of the flight crew about the state (position and speed) of their own aircraft and other aircraft, or the awareness of the controller about traffic state at the airport. The mode SA represents the awareness by one agent of the mode of other agents. This mode could be for instance the flight phase of an aircraft, or status of an ATC alert. The intent SA represents the awareness by one agent of the intent of other agents. The intent includes continuous states of agents as well as the related times at which these states are expected to be achieved. For example, intent SA may represent the expectations by a <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> of aircraft destination, and the time it will arrive at a certain waypoint. The timing of the situation awareness updates depends on the initiation and duration of related tasks (e.g. monitoring, communication, coordination).|$|E
40|$|London Heathrow {{airport is}} one of the busiest {{airports}} in the world. Moreover, it is unusual among the world's leading airports in that it only has two runways. At many airports the runway throughput is the bottleneck to the departure process and as such it is vital to schedule departures effectively and efficiently. For reasons of safety, separations need to be enforced between departing aircraft. The minimum separation between any pair of departing aircraft is determined not only by those aircraft but also by the flight paths and speeds of aircraft that have previously departed. Departures from London Heathrow are subject to physical constraints that are not usually modelled in departure runway scheduling models. There are many constraints which impact upon the orders of aircraft that are possible and we will show how these constraints either have already been included in the model we present or can be included in future. The runway controllers are responsible for the sequencing of the aircraft for the departure runway. This is currently carried out manually. In this paper we propose a metaheuristicbased solution for determining good sequences of aircraft in order to aid the <b>runway</b> <b>controller</b> in this di#cult and demanding task. Finally some results are given to show the e#ectiveness of this system and we evaluate those results against manually produced real world schedules...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} {{was that}} the MLS signals covered a very wide fan-shaped area {{off the end of}} the <b>runway,</b> allowing <b>controllers</b> to direct aircraft approaching from a variety of directions or guide aircraft along a segmented approach.

MLS allowed aircraft to approach from whatever direction they were already flying in, as opposed to flying to a parking orbit before [...] "capturing" [...] the ILS signal. This was particularly valuable at larger airports, as it could allow the aircraft to be separated horizontally much closer to the airport. Similarly in elevation, the fan shaped coverage allows for variations in descent rate, making MLS useful for aircraft with steeper approach angles such as helicopters, fighters and the space shuttle.|$|R

30|$|Similar to {{the last}} approach, the Zafar (2016) authors combine a VDM-SL and graph theory to build a formal {{specification}} of aircrafts take-off’s procedure.

On the other hand, Dominique and Neeraj (2014) introduces a formal model of an aircraft landing system. This work considered as a benchmark for techniques and tools dedicated to the verification of behavioral properties of the landing system. However, it neglects the procedure of landing which must be taken into consideration to ensure system safety and focus more on the mechanical system.|$|R
30|$|Air {{traffic control}} system studied {{in this paper}} is a complex {{adaptive}} socio-technical system that controls the traffic of all aircrafts in the airport’s radar range.

50|$|Air {{traffic control}} at Little Rock {{originally}} told Flight 1420 to expect {{an approach to}} runway 22L. However, at 23:39, a controller advised Flight 1420 of a windshear alert and a change in wind direction. As a result, Captain Buschmann requested a change to runway 4R so that the flight would have a headwind during landing, and Flight 1420 was cleared for a visual approach to runway 4R. Because they were already close to the airport, the controller had to direct Flight 1420 away from the airport in order to line them up for a landing on runway 4R. This resulted in Flight 1420 facing away from the airport for several minutes, and because the plane's weather radar had a narrow and forward-facing field of view, the flight crew could not see thunderstorms approaching the airport during their turn. As the aircraft approached runway 4R, a severe thunderstorm arrived over the airport, and at 23:44 the first officer notified the controller that they had {{lost sight of the}} <b>runway.</b> The <b>controller</b> then cleared Flight 1420 to land on runway 4R using an instrument landing system (ILS) approach.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} ensure the traffic safety in the runway, the status lights are turned ON {{whenever}} the runway is unavailable.

40|$|Tactical control {{during a}} closed-path Continuous Descent Operation stops the {{aircraft}} from following its optimized descent. To mitigate tactical control, {{air traffic controllers}} apply arbitrary large spacing buffers {{to account for the}} unpredictability of the aircraft trajectory from the controller’s point of view. A controller support tool is required for early de-confliction, spacing, and sequencing to facilitate these operations without the need to apply large buffers. The Time-Space Diagram controller support tool was developed to make the constraints and complexity of a Continuous Descent Operation perceptually evident and provide tools and information to the controller to be an active problem solver. This paper addresses the further development and validation of the interface. The concept of Visual Momentum was applied to enhance the efficiency of working the multi-display interface that consists of the Plan View Display and Time-Space Diagram. Direct Manipulation Interfaces were added to enable the controller to plan and implement actions, such as speed and altitude control. A controller-in-the-experiment was setup to validate the interface. In the experiment the subjects used either the Time-Space Diagram support tool or a stack list that provided the required spacing and time to lose or gain as a baseline. Both interfaces enabled the subjects to space the aircraft safely and efficiently. Compared to the baseline, the Time-Space Diagram interface freed time to plan traffic ahead using the Direct Manipulation Interfaces, which according to all subjects worked intuitively. The number of instructions per aircraft was decreased by 25 %. Early accurate speed control was applied and use of heading vectors was no longer necessary in most scenarios.

40|$|A new and {{innovative}} way to evaluate runway safety initiatives for airports {{is through the}} use of interactive real-time simulation. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operates an integrated suite of simulators that can give both pilots and tower controllers the ability to simultaneously "try out" ideas in the safety of virtual reality. In February of 2003, the FAA conducted a demonstration in the NASA facilities for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) of a concept to reduce runway crossings and enhance the efficiency of the airport. Currently DFW experiences about 1, 700 runway crossings per day, which contribute to arrival and departure delays and the potential for runway incursions. The proposed concept included the addition of new perimeter taxiways on the East and West sides of the airport. Through use of NASA's unique simulation capabilities, DFW controllers and commercial pilots provided expert feedback on the safety and operational implications by directly experiencing the proposed changes. Overall, the data collected from the participants and the simulators demonstrated that the concept would improve operations at DFW, if implemented. Improvements were observed in many areas including departure rates, taxi duration, <b>runway</b> crossings, and <b>controller</b> and pilot communications...|$|R
