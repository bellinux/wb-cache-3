5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz {{suggested that}} the dog could escape from a ship and go on a killing spree. In addition, Spotnitz also {{came up with the}} idea for Mulder and Berquist to develop a quasi-romance before the latter is killed at the end of the episode. Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{had in the}} {{meantime}} expanded his territories west along the Apsus and Genusus river valleys, <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the borders of Illyria. Philip's plan was, it seems, to first take the Illyrian coasts, conquer the area between the coasts and Macedon, and use the new land link to provide a rapid route for reinforcements across the narrow straits to Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Western Front {{continued}} to receive Southern Rhodesian troops <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of}} the war, including veterans of the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment's campaign in East Africa. During the conflict's latter stages, the British Army sent some of its Southern Rhodesian officers to the Western Front to promote the colony's benefits, hoping to encourage emigration there by British servicemen after the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{military}} reform, {{which had been}} extremely contentious <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the end of Leopold II's reign, continued to be important up to {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Under the influence of pro-militarist lobbying, expansion and further reform of the army was discussed in parliament, and a new system of universal military conscription was adopted in 1913.|$|E

5|$|The tower-keep had {{a modest}} entrance, which was reached by a draw-bridge that lay across the {{surrounding}} moat, which initially reached <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the base of}} the castle. A simple, 12-foot (3.6 m) high bailey wall, with minimal defensive value, surrounded the moat, which was in contrast wide, 10-foot (3 m) deep, and would have been difficult for an attacker to drain. On {{the east side of the}} castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of names for other types of feet, <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a choriamb, a four {{syllable}} metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{photographic}} societies such as Danske Kamera Piktorialister (Danish Camera Pictorialists) in the 1930s, there was increasing pressure from activists such as H.B.J. Cramer to have photography recognized as an art form. Indeed, the movement continued <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 1970s. A counter-movement to pictorialism, the 1920s' Neue Sachlichkeit was slow to reach Denmark but surfaced in 1948 when Keld Helmer-Petersen published his abstract colour studies in 122 Colour Photographs.|$|E

5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed from a series of small towns through to the first cities, and <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E
5|$|Chosen to play Quatermass was the {{distinguished}} actor John Mills, who {{had appeared in}} significant roles in many high-profile British films, including The Way to the Stars (1945), Great Expectations (1946) and Ice Cold in Alex (1958), and had won an Academy Award {{for his role in}} Ryan's Daughter (1970). Mills, whose only previous television credit at the time was The Zoo Gang (1974), was reluctant to take the part but was convinced by his wife, who liked the script. Following Quatermass he appeared in Gandhi (1982), Martin Chuzzlewit (1994) and Hamlet (1997), working <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his death in 2005.|$|E
5|$|December 1942 {{also saw}} {{the return of the}} HZL bomber {{squadron}} to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front, where they had flown more than 1,500 sorties. Upon its return the squadron was redesignated 1./(Kroat.)KG after having flown its nine Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to the NDH. The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans in Yugoslavian territory <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the end of 1944. In late 1943, a second squadron, 2./(Kroat.)KG was formed to provide operational training. It was equipped with Italian designed and built CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 medium bombers.|$|E
50|$|In February 1309 {{a dispute}} was settled between Henry de Lacy of Castle Donington and the Abbey of Chester over the fishing rights here. Unusually the dispute was settled not with either side having <b>rights</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the middle of}} the river, but with the manor of Castle Donington owning their land and the river <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the {{northern}} bank.

5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. <b>Right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the end of the Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the present day, there {{does not seem to}} have been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
50|$|African Americans {{are among}} the largest {{ethnic groups in the}} state of Tennessee, making up 17% of the state's {{population}} in 2010. African Americans arrived in the region prior to statehood. They lived both as slaves and as free citizens with restricted <b>rights</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Civil War. The state, and particularly the major cities of Memphis and Nashville have played important roles in African-American culture and the Civil Rights Movement.|$|R

5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{script was}} in use {{up to the}} arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period. In excess of 10,000 {{individual}} texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl used to produce codices. The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, {{as a result of the}} impact of the conquest on Maya society.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{resulted}} in a public outcry over the event which pressured {{all levels of the}} government <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the top ranks of the federal government to investigate into the matter. In the closing months of 1992, and also the opening months of 1993, dozens of articles mentioning misdeeds by the royal families of several states–but in particular Sultan Iskandar himself were published. A good deal of these alleged misdeeds that were mentioned included the charging of exorbitant fines–way above the prescribed legal limits–upon offenders who had obstructed the Sultan's car, amongst others. Sultan Iskandar, nevertheless bore the brunt of the backlash by the numerous references centred towards alleged acts of criminal wrongdoings even though many of the listed acts were committed by other members of the royal family.|$|E
