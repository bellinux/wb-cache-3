Taking cognisance of this, {{and the fact}} that most of the available design flood estimation methods in South Africa were developed in the 1970 s and have not been updated since, led to the development of the Standard Design Flood (SDF) method (Alexander 2002 a; 2002 b; 2003). In this study, the SDF method was evaluated by establishing the accuracy of the regionalised SDF <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients,</b> taking both the areal extent and homogeneous hydrological catchment responses into consideration.

The results showed that the original SDF method overestimated the magnitude and frequency (return period) of flood peaks in all the basins under consideration, while the verification results confirmed that the calibrated/verified SDF method, based on quaternary <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients,</b> significantly improves the accuracy in comparison with the probabilistic analysis results.

New hydrological insights for the regionWe examined the spatio-temporal variation of runoff generating mechanisms on the sub-basin level on seasonal basis. Our analysis reveals that the runoff generation in the Selke catchment is primarily dominated by shallow sub-surface flow and very rarely the contribution from Dunne overland flow exceeds sub-surface flow. Runoff generated by Hortonian mechanism is very infrequent and almost negligible.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} opinion that poorly managed {{plantation}} forests in Japan are contributing to increased storm runoff and erosion. Here we present {{evidence to the contrary}} from runoff plots at two scales (hillslope and 0. 5 × 2 m plots) for several forest conditions in the Mie and Nariki catchments. <b>Runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> from small plots in untended hinoki forests were variable but typically higher than from better managed or deciduous forests during small storms at Nariki; at Mie, runoff during small events was highly variable from all small plots but <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> were similar for hinoki plots with and without understory vegetation, while the deciduous plot had lower <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Storm <b>runoff</b> was less at the hillslope scale than the plot scale in Mie; these results were more evident at sites with better ground cover. During the largest storms at both sites, differences in runoff due to forest condition were not evident regardless of scale. Dynamic soil moisture tension measurements at Nariki indicated that during a large storm, flow in the upper organic-rich and root-permeated soil horizons was 3. 2 times higher than measured overland runoff from a small hinoki plot with poor ground cover and 8. 3 times higher than runoff from a deciduous forest plot. On the basis of field observations during storms, at least a portion of the monitored 'Hortonian overland flow' was actually occurring in this near-surface 'biomat'. Therefore our field measurements in both small and large plots potentially included biomat flow in addition to short-lived Hortonian runoff. Because overland flow decreased with increasing scale, rill erosion did not occur on hillslopes. Additionally, <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> were not significantly different among cover conditions during large storms; thus, the 'degraded' forest conditions appear not to greatly enhance peak flows or erosion potential at larger scales, especially when biomat flow is significant.

Future storm water management {{is facing the}} challenges of increased precipitation, asclimate changes, and increased areas of impervious surfaces due to the expansion anddensification of the cities.

In thisstudy, the objective was to evaluate the weighted <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> for three differenturban types; apartment buildings, townhouses and residential areas and a comparisonbetween today and the 1970 `s was made. The <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> was determined by manual mapping of the different surface typesin each area based on data in the form of orthophotos and aerial photographs. The surfacetypes that were mapped were asphalt, permeable areas, tiles, sand/gravel and roof. Tiles and sand/gravel were the most difficult surface types to map. In order to see towhat extent these categories influenced the weighted <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> a sensitivityanalysis was carried out and the <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> based on surface type was changed indifferent scenarios. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the surface types tiles and sand/gravelhad little impact on the weighted <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> which in mainly due to the fact thatthe percentage of these surfaces types of the total area is small.

Four different local geomorphologic conditions were selected for the experiments: (a) steep slope parallel or (b) perpendicular to the bedding, (c) moderate slope and (d) gravel-covered surface, both parallel to the bedding. Rainfall simulations were performed at a moderate intensity (12 – 25 mm h− 1) for 30 min on three plots in each location. Different delays between simulations offered different initial soil wetnesses. A simulation during high-intensity rainfall (90 – 150 mm h− 1) for 30 min was made on one plot of each type. One plot of each type was selected for monitoring during the following summer and autumn. In dry conditions, runoff was low or negligible. A second simulation carried out 1 day later again produced very low <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients.</b> <b>Runoff</b> increased slightly when the interval between rainfall simulations was reduced to 30 min.

Depending on available resources, there are many developmental plans and projects which seek the wise planning and management of water resources considering both low flows and floods. The seasonal streamflow variability analysis of the basin was performed with recorded meteorological and hydrological data. The four seasons of the year are considered for seasonality analysis. The rainfall variability is analysed using seasonality and variability measures of coefficient of variation, seasonal relative rainy days and seasonal rainfall intensity. The rainfall variability is more related with latitude and longitude. Spatial and temporal seasonal rainfall variation is analysed from daily rainfall data. Seasonal runoff and streamflow variations are also analysed using HEC-HMS hydrological model to generate runoffs at required and selected points to detect spatial variation. Runoff variation for catchments with gauged stations was analysed from recorded time series streamflow data. <b>Runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> is taken as a variability index for both generated and recorded streamflows. The <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> ranges from 0 to 1. The range is high in the dry seasons and less in the wet seasons. The average <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> value of the basin is 0. 28 ranging from 0. 18 to 0. 36.

The runoff coefficients and peak discharge calculations of each sub watershed, respectively, Comal Hilir of 52. 65 % with peak discharge 505. 68 m 3 /sec, Genteng of 65. 04 % with peak discharge 542. 44 m 3 /sec, Lomeneng of 64. 00 % with peak discharge 194. 23 m 3 /sec, Srengseng of 64. 10 % with peak discharge 270. 46 m 3 /sec, and Wakung Hulu of 62. 34 % with peak discharge 686. 64 m 3 / sec. The most influential <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> factors are, respectively, infiltration rate, slope, vegetation cover, and drainage density. Flood control priority in Comal watershed should be preoccupied to increase the infiltration rate through a combination of three conservation techniques of mechanical, vegetative, and biology...|$|E

To this end, the annual runoff were calculated in 18 existing hydrometery stations and another 11 auxiliary points, using digital elevation model (DEM) and 11 years available data of the stations. The performance criteria for evaluating the methods were mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and general standard deviation (GSD) along with the cross validation examination. A high regression between the <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> and watershed average slope was selected as auxiliary variable. The results showed that the <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the region changes between 3. 5 and 85 %. The findings also indicated that the universal co-krigings with spherical semi-variogram model had better performance with the values of MBE (- 0. 0014), MAE (0. 036), RMSE (0. 054) and GSD (20. 152). The universal and simple kriging with spherical model were equal in runoff estimation of the region and were ranked as the second methods to this propose...|$|E
40|$|Storm water {{management}} in Singapore {{has always been}} a challenge due to intense rainfall in a flat, low-lying and urbanised catchment. PUB’s (Singapore’s National Water Agency) recent runoff control regulation limits the <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> to 0. 55 for developments larger than or equal to 0. 2 ha. The use of Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) Waters design features are encouraged to attain peak runoff reduction. Hence the paper focuses on (i) determining the actual hydrological response regime of Singapore using the relationship between <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> (C), land use and slope; and (ii) investigating the effectiveness of ABC Waters design features in delaying and reducing peak runoff using a modelling approach. Based on a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model and using elevation, land use and soil data as inputs, the peak C-values were obtained for 50 m × 50 m grid cells. The results show that for the same land use, the one with steeper slope resulted in a higher <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Simulations were carried out in two study areas, Green Walk District and Tengah Subcatchment, where ABC Waters design features (such as porous pavements, green roofs, rain gardens) and detention tanks were incorporated to reduce C-values. Results showed that peak C-values can be reduced to less than 0. 55 after increasing the green areas and constructing detention facilities. Reduction in peak discharge (22 % to 63 %) and a delay in peak discharge by up to 30 min were also observed. Hence, it is recommended to consider the relationship between slope and land use while determining runoff coefficients; and to incorporate ABC Waters design features in urban design to reduce the peak flow and <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficient</b> (C) ...|$|E

Drainage lines are laid with sealed joints in the road easement with <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> and characteristics adequate for the land zoning and storm water system. Drainage systems must be capable of carrying the ultimate design flow from the upstream catchment with approval for the outfall from the appropriate authority to a watercourse, creek, river or the sea for drainage discharge.

For many purposes it is necessary to characterise and classify them, e. g. for regionalisation, prediction in ungauged catchments, model parameterisation. In this study, we investigate hydrological similarity of catchments with respect to their response behaviour. We analyse more than 8200 event <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> (ERCs) and flow duration curves of 53 gauged catchments in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, for the period from 1993 to 2008, covering a huge variability of weather and runoff conditions. The spatio-temporal variability of event-runoff coefficients and flow duration curves are assumed to represent how different catchments "transform" rainfall into runoff. From the <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> and flow duration curves we derive 12 signature indices describing various aspects of catchment response behaviour to characterise each catchment. Hydrological similarity of catchments is defined by high similarities of their indices. We identify, analyse and describe hydrologically similar catchments by cluster analysis using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). As a result of the cluster analysis we get five clusters of similarly behaving catchments where each cluster represents one differentiated class of catchments. As catchment response behaviour is supposed to be dependent on its physiographic and climatic characteristics, we compare groups of catchments clustered by response behaviour with clusters of catchments based on catchment properties. Results show an overlap of 67 % between these two pools of clustered catchments which can be improved using the topologic correctness of SOMs...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological {{signatures}} are indices {{that help}} to describe the behavior of catchments. These indices {{can also be used}} to transfer information from gauged to ungauged catchments. In this study, different approaches were evaluated to determine volumetric <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> in 18 small/ medium experimental gauged catchments of the Iberian Peninsula and to fit runoff calculations based on precipitation data for gauged and ungauged catchments. Using data derived from 1962 events, rainfall-runoff relationships were characterized and compared in order to evaluate the various hydrological response patterns. Volumetric <b>runoff</b> <b>coefficients</b> and cumulative <b>runoff</b> and precipitation ratios of the events that generated runoff (Rcum) minimized the root mean square error. A linear fit for the estimation of Rcum in ungauged catchments was based on mean annual precipitation, rates of infiltration, the fraction of forest-land use, and the catchment channel length. Despite high catchment heterogeneity, Rcum resulted in a suitable parameter to evaluate hydrological variability in rural gauged and ungauged catchments. In 50 % of the catchments, the precipitation accounted for less than 50 % of the runoff variation. Annual precipitation, antecedent rainfall, and base flow did not have a high significance in rainfall-runoff relationships, which illustrates the heterogeneity of hydrological responses. Our results highlight the need for signature characterizations of small/medium rural catchments because they are the sources of runoff and sediment discharge into rivers, and it is more economical and efficient to take action to mitigate runoff in rural locations...|$|R
