Seedling establishment is also used as a direct measure of habitat suitability, but transient changes in vegetation might provide windows of opportunity allowing plant species to colonize sites which otherwise appear unsuitable. We aimed to study spatio-temporal variability in the effects of resident vegetation on establishment, growth and <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>grassland</b> species in abandoned arable fields representing potentially suitable habitats. Seeds were sown in disturbed (bare of vegetation and roots) and undisturbed plots in three fields abandoned in the last 20 years. To assess the effects of temporal variation on plant establishment, we initiated our experiments in two years (2007 and 2008). Seventeen out of the 35 sown species flowered within two years after sowing, while three species completely failed to become established. The vegetation in the undisturbed plots facilitated seedling establishment only in the year with low spring precipitation, and the effect did not hold for all species. In contrast, growth and flowering rate were consistently much greater in the disturbed plots, but the effect size differed between the fields and years of sowing. We show that colonization is more successful when site opening by disturbance coincide with other suitable conditions such as weather or soil characteristics. Seasonal variability involved in our study emphasizes the necessity of temporal replication of sowing experiments. Studies assessing habitat suitability by seed sowing should either involve both vegetation removal treatments and untreated plots or follo...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The main <b>of</b> arborization <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> is {{the comfort}} {{supplied}} {{to the animals}} by {{the shadow of the}} trees, which not only increases the milk production but also improves the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> the cows.

40|$|The grasslands, {{like the}} {{majority}} of the terrestrial systems, are complex ecosystems and such complexity comes from the high number of biotic and abiotic elements which form this systems and from the interactions between the same elements, which could vary in time and space their nature and intensity. Keeping attention to this complexity and knowing that there is an equilibrium state in which the plant community has the maximum possible number of species, for a certain soil-climate context, this research work is centred on the description of the components <b>of</b> the <b>grassland</b> ecosystem, <b>of</b> the relations which exist between them and on the possible way of management, to achieve improvements in the future, in terms of productivity of phytocoenosis, of soil defending, of biodiversity conservation and also in terms of improving the life conditions of human population. In particular, the main target of this phD was to create an exhaustive knowledge structure about Apennines grasslands, because until now, all the studies made were partial, tending to characterize the herbaceous communities from a phytosociological viewpoint, but not ecological-functional. Moreover, considering the size of the study area and the complexity of the research and of the management <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> ecosystems, we thought to share the research work in the three years, the timing and the operations. In fact, the research plan was structured like a “pyramid” at the base of which there is the phytosociological research which is the support to all the other studies, while regarding on the timing we decided to concentrate each year in a bioclimatic belt, following this scheme: 1 th year: − bibliography research − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − set up a sampling method for the ecological survey 2 th year: − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belt − Ecological structure analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − sinecological analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower supratemperate belts − analysis of the vegetation for a zootechnical characterization <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and higher/lower supratemperate belts 3 th year: − phytosociological survey <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> orotemperate and criotemperate belts − ecological structure analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belts − sinecological analysis <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher supratemperate belt − zootechnical characterization <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and higher/lower supratemperate belts [ [...] . ] In the three years it was possible to finish all the phytosociological, ecological and zootechnical researches for the <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> higher mesotemperate and lower/higher supratemperate belts; then it was possible to implement phytosociological and sinecological knowledges <b>of</b> the <b>grasslands</b> <b>of</b> orotemperate belt and to realize a phytosociological placement of the herbaceous commmunities of criotemperate belt...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeographyMelinda DanielsThe Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is {{a prairie}} grouse of {{conservation}} {{concern in the}} Southern Great Plains. In response to declining population numbers and ongoing threats to its habitat, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in May 2014. In western Kansas, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken occupies the Sand Sagebrush Prairie, Mixed-grass Prairie, and Short-grass/CRP Mosaic Ecoregions. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the overall range and population has declined by 92 % and 97 % respectively. Much of this decline is attributed to the loss and fragmentation <b>of</b> native <b>grasslands</b> throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range. Whereas much of the loss and degradation <b>of</b> native <b>grassland</b> have been attributed to anthropogenic activities such as conversion <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> to cropland and energy exploration, federal legislation since the 1980 s to convert cropland on highly erodible soils to perennial grasses through the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) may curtail or reverse these trends. My objective was to document changes in the areal extent and connectivity <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> in the identified Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas from the 1950 s to 2013 using remotely sensed data. I hypothesized that the total amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> decreased between the 1950 ’s and 2013 because of an increase in agricultural practices, but predicted an increase <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> between 1985 and 2013 in response to the CRP. To document changes in grassland, land cover maps were generated through spectral classification of LANDSAT images and visual analysis of aerial photographs from the Army Map Service and USDA Farm Service Agency. Landscape composition and configuration were assessed using FRAGSTATS to compute a variety of landscape metrics measuring changes in the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> present as well as changes in the size and configuration <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> patches. Since 1985, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range in Kansas has increased by 210, 9963. 3 ha, a rise of 11. 9 %, while the mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> increased 18. 2 % and 23. 0 % respectively, indicating grassland has become more connected during this time in response to the CRP. Prior to the implementation of CRP, the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had been decreasing since 1950, as 66, 722. 0 ha <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> was converted to croplands. The loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> had a considerable effect on the patch size <b>of</b> <b>grasslands,</b> as mean patch size and area-weighted mean patch size decreased by 8. 8 % and 11. 1 % respectively. The primary driver <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> loss between 1950 and 1985 was the emergence of center pivot irrigation, which had its greatest impact in western and southwestern parts of the range in Kansas. In particular, while the amount <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> in Range 5, a region of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range found in southwest Kansas, has increased overall since the 1950 s by 4. 7 %, the area-weighted mean patch size has decreased by 53. 0 % in response to center pivot irrigation fragmenting the landscape. While the CRP has been successful in increasing and connecting grassland throughout the Lesser Prairie-Chicken range to offset the loss <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> since the 1950 s, continuation of the CRP faces an uncertain future in the face of rising commodity prices, energy development, and reduction in program scope leaving open the possibility that these areas that have created habitat for Lesser Prairie-Chickens could be lost. As time progresses, a reduction in the scope of the CRP would reduce the amount of habitat available to Lesser Prairie-Chickens, threatening the persistence of their population...|$|R

We investigated how the growth of A. terrestris populations is influenced by the landscape context of parcels used for hay production in the French Jura Mountains. Five landscape metrics (relative area <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> mean patch area <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> patch density <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> woodland patch density in grassland, grassland-woodland edge density) were computed over an increasing radius around each parcel (max. 3 km).

Landscape effects on A. terrestris populations as determined by the five metrics are scale-dependent: mean patch area <b>of</b> <b>grassland,</b> patch density <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> and woodland patch density in grassland had an impact on a grassland parcel within a neighbourhood radius of about 800 m, while relative area <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> and grassland-woodland edge density had an impact within a neighbourhood radius of about 400 m.

Observation on grassland vegetation growth and change is of critical importance to grassland resource management and environment construction. However, most <b>of</b> estimations on <b>grassland</b> degradation neglect sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> vegetation to annual climate change, and few of them considers the directive meaning <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> degradation progress to the recovery <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> environment. Therefore the results of different estimation methods are usually inconsistent and incomparable, which further leads to inconvenience in the implementation and supervision <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> environment recovery. This paper proposed a new method to estimate grassland degradation based on discriminating the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on vegetation.

The impact of non-climatic factors on vegetation could be measured by the difference between realistic and “ideal ” status of vegetation growth. And then the change degree and direction <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> degradation are estimated also.

40|$|Grassland {{ecosystem}} is {{an important}} component of the terrestrial carbon cycle system. Clear comprehension of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and potential <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> is very important for the effective management <b>of</b> <b>grassland</b> ecosystems. Grasslands in Inner Mongolia have undergone evident impacts from human activities and natural factors in recent decades. To explore the changes of carbon sequestration capacity <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> from 2000 to 2012, we carried out studies on the estimation of SOC storage and potential <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> in central and eastern Inner Mongolia, China based on field investigations and MODIS image data. First, we calculated vegetation cover using the dimidiate pixel model based on MODIS-EVI images. Following field investigations of aboveground biomass and plant height, we used a grassland quality evaluation model to get the grassland evaluation index, which is typically used to represent grassland quality. Second, a correlation regression model was established between grassland evaluation index and SOC density. Finally, by this regression model, we calculated the SOC storage and potential <b>of</b> the studied <b>grasslands.</b> Results indicated that SOC storage increased with fluctuations in the study area, and the annual changes varied among different sub-regions. The SOC storage <b>of</b> <b>grasslands</b> in 2012 increased by 0. 51 x 10 (12) kg C compared to that in 2000. The average carbon sequestration rate was 0. 04 x 10 (12) kg C/a.
