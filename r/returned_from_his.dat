5|$|During his suspension, Ramirez {{was allowed}} to work out at the Dodgers' {{facilities}} and he trained with Dodger coach Manny Mota. To get back into shape he was allowed a short rehab stint in the minor leagues. Ramirez played two games with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for the Isotopes. He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers. Ramirez <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on July 3 against the San Diego Padres. On July 7, Ramirez was ejected by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the air after being called out on strikes.

5|$|In 2000, Chen <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{studies in}} Nanjing to his village of Dongshigu {{in an effort}} to confront {{environmental}} pollution. A paper mill constructed in 1988 had been dumping toxic wastewater into the Meng river, destroying crops and harming wildlife. The chemicals also reportedly caused skin and digestive problems among villagers living downstream from the mill. Chen organized villagers in his hometown and 78 other villages to petition against the mill. The effort was successful, and resulted in the suspension of the paper mill. In addition, Chen contacted the British embassy in Beijing, informing them of the situation and requesting funding for a well to supply clean water to locals. The British government responded by providing £15,000 towards a deep water well, irrigation systems and water pipelines.|$|E

5|$|In 62 BC, Pompey {{returned}} victorious from Asia, but {{the senate}} refused to ratify the arrangements {{that he had made}} with his soldiers. Pompey, in effect, became powerless, and thus when Julius Caesar <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> governorship in Spain in 61 BC, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements in Asia were to be ratified, and his soldiers were to be given land. Caesar was to be elected Consul in 59 BC, and then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship.|$|E
5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> latest {{unsuccessful}} {{quest for}} the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|In September 1936, Bill's brother, the Catholic priest Reverend Denny, and his sister, Mary Catherine Denny, were {{involved}} in a vehicle accident in which Mary received fatal injuries. Reverend Denny suffered from an illness that resulted from the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941. Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, A Digger at Home and Abroad, which was published in 1941. He continued to practice law until his death, despite difficulties associated with rheumatoid arthritis. He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> office in Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a state funeral, and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{problems}} to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished {{on the outside looking in}} despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

5|$|The Devils {{struggled}} {{early in}} the 2005–06 season, ending the 2005 calendar year with a 16–18–5 record. Robinson resigned as head coach on December 19, and Lamoriello moved down to the bench. Once Elias <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> bout with hepatitis, the team quickly turned around, finishing 46–27–9 after a season-ending 11-game winning streak capped with a 4–3 win over the Montreal Canadiens. During that final victory, which clinched the Devils' sixth division title, Brian Gionta set a new team record for goals in a season with 48, topping Pat Verbeek's 46. The win streak to close the year was also an NHL record. The Devils won their first round Stanley Cup playoff series against the Rangers four games to none, but were eliminated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the next round.|$|E
5|$|The New Year {{started with}} a number of changes off the field. Loan signing Ndumbu-Nsungu {{returned}} to Gillingham but Heckingbottom's deal was extended to allow him to play against Accrington Stanley on New Year's Day, before a permanent deal was finalised the following week. Midfielder Lee Bullock was also signed on a loan transfer from Hartlepool United. City beat Accrington 2–0 with Matthew Clarke scoring his first for the club and Joe Colbeck adding his first since he <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> loan spell at Darlington. It was followed up with another win, when Thorne scored City's first hat-trick for two years, to defeat Notts County 3–0. Two away draws followed at Bury and Wrexham, but City returned to winning ways with a 4–2 victory over Shrewsbury Town to finish the month unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} {{football}} at the Naval Academy is debated among historians. The most accepted occurrence was in 1869, when a midshipman (a student) <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> leave with a football. While {{throwing the ball}} with a friend, it was dropped {{and a group of}} fellow midshipmen attempted to take it. A contest was eventually organized, which ended abruptly when the ball was kicked into the Severn River. However, biographer C. Douglas Kroll stated that the first evidence of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward, a theory supported by journalist Jack Clary. Regardless, the sport had been banned for several years prior to 1879.|$|E
