40|$|A habitat {{specific}} bird {{monitoring program}} was established on the Chequamegon, Chippewa, and Superior National Forests in 1991 and 1992 (Chequamegon National Forest). The program {{was designed to}} assess annual differences in bird relative abundance, and to attribute changes in numbers to habitat changes on the forest, or to natural fluctuations in bird numbers. Data collected from 1991 to 1994 or 1992 to 1994 have provided information on annual variation among guilds and individual species, and on relative densities of species within representative cover types on the Forests. A total of ten species (all Forests total) showed significant trends during the monitoring period. The White and <b>Red-breasted</b> Nuthatches, Yellow-bellied <b>Flycatcher,</b> Alder Flycatcher, and Yellow-rumped Warbler increased in abundance over all years; while Swamp and Chipping Sparrows, Brown Creeper, Eastern Wood-Pewee, and Hairy Woodpecker decreased in abundance over all years. No simple explanation can be offered for a particular trend in annual variation; however, {{it is important to}} note that the monitoring activity is beginning to reach a state of longevity where trends are can be detected. Trends or lack thereof of trends will be useful in resolving potential problems within a National Forest or to support conclusions that a problem does not exist. This information can be used to aid forest management by providing information on forest cover types. Based on power analysis, a sufficient sampling regime is in place to detect reasonable changes in abundance for many forest birds, including many neotropical migrants...|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-breasted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Ficedula parva) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the Old World flycatcher family. It breeds {{in eastern}} Europe and across central Asia and is migratory, wintering in south Asia.

50|$|The {{wildlife}} of {{the area}} corresponds to the various layers of vegetation. On and in the earth live the sand lizard and common lizard, the mole, the common shrew, the tundra vole and red fox. In the tree layer the beech marten and red squirrel may be seen. The herb and shrub layer are home to many species of songbird. The main bird species on the Streckelsberg are the robin wren, great tit, blue tit, chiffchaff, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> willow warbler, blackcap and lesser whitethroat. The somewhat larger blackbird and song thrush also live on the Streckelsberg. In the tree layer there are golden oriole, chaffinch, stock dove, tawny owl, wood pigeon, hooded crow and goshawk. Bats also have their summer homes in tree hollows and cracks. Depending on the biodiversity of the flora, many insect species live on Streckelsberg. In addition to various butterflies there are also beetles, including the capricorn beetle, sawyer and longhorn beetle, whose larvae live on dead wood.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{used to be}} a bird watcher's paradise in {{the past}} and was a {{favourite}} ground for the Rajput kings of Jaipur for royal duck shooting parties during picnics. The lake was natural habitat for more than 150 species of local and migratory birds that included large flamingo, great crested grebe, pintail, pochards, kestrel, coot, redshank, marsh sandpiper, ruff, herring gull, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> grey wagtail, but their numbers declined with the deterioration of the lake. Now, with restoration works undertaken, the birds have started visiting the lake again, though not to the same degree as in the past. In order to attract attention to the lake's condition, a private initiative of holding an annual birding fair was started in 1997. It is reported that the common moorhen, a resident species has started breeding in large numbers at the lake. The other birds seen now are the grey heron, white-browed wagtail and blue-tailed bee-eaters. The lake was also home for a large species of the aquatic ecosystem such as fish, insects, microorganisms and aquatic vegetation.|$|E
50|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of the nature reserve is very rich. In the Kaiser Mountains there are about 940 {{different}} flowering plants, 38 different species of fern and over 400 different mosses. The colonies of fungi and lichen are very rich, with 100 and 236 different species respectively being represented. The forest region comprises mainly mixed forest with beech, fir and spruce. In the submontane area there are also ash and sycamore maple, and, in sunny areas, alder. Hay meadows, poor grassland and pastures are typical of the alpine meadows. In the subalpine region we find the typical dwarf shrub types such as mountain pine and alpenrose, and the rare dwarf alpenrose. Alpine polsterrasen ("cushion grasslands") are found {{all the way up}} to the summit areas. There are various wetlands also stocked with typical plants. As a product of ice age processes the Kaiser is also home to a number of rare, partly endemic invertebrates, such as Allobobophora smaragdina (a yellow-green earthworm), a door snail, and a number of spiders and butterflies. Typical vertebrates are the alpine and fire salamanders, smooth snake, viper (unusual color variants), edible dormouse, hazel dormouse and bank vole. In higher regions there are chamois, stoat, snow vole and mountain hare. Typical birds are wood warbler, the <b>red-breasted</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (for North Tyrol endemic), alpine chough, raven, crag martin, alpine willow tit, lesser redpoll (Carduelis linaria rufescens), alpine accentor, alpine wallcreeper and black grouse - capercaillie and rock ptarmigan. Raptors occurring in the Kaiser are the northern goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, golden eagle, tawny owl, pygmy owl and Tengmalm's owl.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> Ficedula parva {{is a small}} {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds in Eastern Europe and across central Asia and winters on the Indian subcontinent. Birds from the western extreme of the breeding range migrating {{to and from the}} wintering grounds utilise a large longitudinal component en route that is not typical of the majority of European passerines. Therefore, {{it is one of the}} lesser-known species in Europe with respect to migration and biometrics. The aim of this study is to describe the numbers, phenology and biometry of the <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> in relation to age, sex and migration season at a stopover site in northern Turkey The number of individuals ringed in autumn was six times higher than in the spring passage. Furthermore, the period of the spring passage was shorter than in autumn, and in spring males migrate six days earlier than females and juveniles; no such differences were found in the autumn. Moreover, migrants carried more fuel reserves in spring than in autumn and no differences were recorded in the length of stopover duration. The study underlines the importance of further research into passerine migration across Turkey to better understand the whole migratory system of movements of the Palaearctic migratory passerine populations [Current Zoology 61 (2) : –, 2015]...|$|E
30|$|The habitat {{suitability}} {{index for}} Siberian jay was calculated with the formulas developed in Pukkala et al. (2012). The habitat area of Siberian jay {{was assumed to}} represent the suitability of the forest to several species requiring similar forests, for instance three-toed woodpecker, northern goshawk, <b>red-breasted</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> and grouses (Pukkala et al. 2012). A threshold index value of 0.5 was used to classify a forest stand as habitat or non-habitat. The total habitat area was the area of stands classified as habitat. The study of Pukkala et al. (2012) presents separate indices for the nesting and feeding habitat of Siberian jay. The variable used in DEA was the sum of nesting and feeding habitat areas.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> has a {{large and}} stable global {{population}} widespread {{through much of the}} Western Palearctic. Contrarily, however, it is a very scarce breeding bird in the forested montane habitats of Hungary. The few pairs breeding here represent a peripheral population on {{the very edge of the}} species’ geographic area. This peripheral population declined considerably (from 3 – 500 to 100 pairs) during the past decades likely due to the degradation of suitable habitat patches including the loss of appropriate nesting sites. To reverse this trend, we applied a new type of artificial nestbox developed specifically for this species. Occupancy rate was very low and breeding success was also low unless applying a protective wire mesh to reduce predation pressure...|$|E

40|$|We studied migratory stopovers of nocturnal {{passerine}} migrants migrating {{between the}} Urals and Siberia and the Near East and Africa (five species) and between European Russia and the Indian subcontinent (two species) in an oasis in the arid belt of the northwestern edge of western Central Asia. In autumn, fuel loads of Blyth’s Reed Warblers Acrocephalus dumetorum before their desert crossing were {{much greater than}} in Palaearctic–African migrants, which face a much narrower barrier, and also greater than in conspecifics captured {{during and after the}} desert crossing. However, another Indian migrant, the <b>Red-breasted</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> Ficedula parva, had low average fuel stores. In spring, Blyth’s Reed Warblers carried less fuel than in autumn, and less than African migrants such as Garden Warblers Sylvia borin in spring. This suggests that the arid belt of western Central Asia is a serious ecological barrier for Palaearctic–Indian passerine migrants in autumn, but much less of one in spring. Palaearctic–African migrants which make a detour around this barrier to the northwest and migrate north of the Caspian Sea do not need large fuel stores like those they deposit before crossing the Sahara. How birds cross ecological barriers {{is one of the most}} intriguing problems of bird migration research.
