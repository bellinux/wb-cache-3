5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One <b>room</b> <b>off</b> the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E
25|$|The House {{contained}} {{a number of}} hidden rooms that were accessed either through the diary room or through a store <b>room</b> <b>off</b> the living area. At various points in the show, {{all or part of}} these rooms were opened up for various tasks and twists.|$|E

25|$|In 1843 as the {{industrial}} revolution gathered pace and Sheffield {{was on the verge}} of becoming the steel, tool and cutlery making capital of the world, the Sheffield School of Design was founded following lobbying by artist Benjamin Haydon. The day-to-day running was controlled by the local council, whilst the Board of Trade in London appointed the head. Tuition began in a 60x40ft rented <b>room</b> <b>off</b> Glossop Road. In 1850 the School of Design was renamed Sheffield School of Art.|$|E
25|$|Serra {{has made}} a number of films {{concerning}} the manufacture and use of his favorite material, steel. Railroad Turnbridge (1976) is a series of shots taken on the Burlington and Northern bridge over the Willamette River near Portland, Oregon, as it opens to let a ship pass. In Steelmill/Stahlwerk, a 1979 documentary made in collaboration with Clara Weyergraf, Serra explores the physical construction of an art piece {{and at the same time}} examines the lives of the steelmill. These films can be viewed in a <b>room</b> <b>off</b> the Arcelor gallery in the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{center of}} the Western Palace was square and was accessed through an open courtyard on {{the northwest corner of}} the building. The courtyard was the central room of the Western Palace and directed visitors into a portico, used as a reception area for visitors. Visitors were then led to a throne <b>room.</b> <b>Off</b> the throne room was a corridor used by the king, with a private dressing room, which also had another entrance way that connected to the courtyard through the mosaic room. The mosaic room contained steps that led to a second floor with separate bedrooms for the king and queen.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Charlie Russell {{and his new}} wife, Nancy, {{were living}} in a shack in back of a house in Cascade, Montana. In 1897, the couple moved into a rented four-room home on Seventh Avenue North in Great Falls. In December 1899, Russell's father Charles Silas Russell gave the couple $500. The estate of Mary Mead Russell, Russell's mother who died in 1895, was finally probated shortly thereafter, and in the spring of 1900 the Russells began {{building}} a new home on the corner of 13th Street and 4th Avenue North. A friend and neighbor, George Calvert, was the likely architect and constructed the house for them. The two-story wood frame building had clapboard siding, gable roof, and wooden shake roofing shingles. It had little exterior ornamentation. The house faced south, with gable fronted dormers on the east and west and another project slightly from the southwest corner of the house. The front door led to a small front hall, and a parlor ran across the south face of the home. Also on the first floor were dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and a small maid's <b>room</b> <b>off</b> the kitchen. Some of the furniture on first floor (such as two seats, a china closet, a bookcase) were built into the home. A steep stairway led to three small bedrooms (under the gables) and a small bathroom on the second floor. The interior was paneled in dark wood. A small exterior porch ran around the southeast corner of the home. The architectural style was in the Arts and Crafts genre. The Russells occupied the home in the summer of 1900.|$|E
500|$|On May 6, 1963, Time {{magazine}} {{celebrated its}} 40th anniversary at the hotel. The event {{was attended by}} some 1500 celebrities, including General Douglas MacArthur, Jean Monnet, Henry Cabot Lodge, Bob Hope, Joe Louis, David O. Selznick, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Edward Kennedy, Henry Ford II, and many others. [...] In 1968, British rock band The Who checked into the hotel, where they encountered difficulties with {{the staff of the}} Waldorf Astoria. Due to the band's reputation for trashing their hotel rooms and rowdy behavior, the Waldorf demanded that they pay cash up front. However, following their gig, the band members were refused access to their hotel rooms, where their luggage was being kept. Tony Fletcher, in his biography on Keith Moon, claims that Moon challenged the staff and blew the door to their <b>room</b> <b>off</b> the hinges with his cherry bombs and retrieved their luggage, which prompted The Who to be shown the door and banned from the hotel for life. However, clearly the ban was later revoked as they performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction at Waldorf on January 17, 1990.|$|E
