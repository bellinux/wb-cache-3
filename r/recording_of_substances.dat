40|$|Background: Substance use in {{patients}} with psychiatric disorder is an every-day seen. Detection of this comorbidity can significantly affect the treatment of these disorders, as well as substance use. Objectives: This study has been conducted to determine the prevalence and pattern <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use in hospitalized psychiatric patients. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 210 hospitalized psychiatric patients were selected by simple randomization from all <b>records</b> <b>of</b> hospitalized patients. The instrument of gathering data was a demographic checklist including age, gender, marital status, education, type <b>of</b> disorder and <b>substance</b> abuse and duration of psychiatric disorder. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 16 using Fisher exact and Chi square tests. Results: The mean age of patients was 37. 9 years. Most of the patients were male, married and unemployed. The Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use was 36. 7. The most prevalent pattern <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use was opium, opioid, methamphetamines and other substances (poly <b>substance).</b> The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use {{in patients}} with mood disorders {{was more than the}} other disorders and the most prevalent substance use in these patients was opium and opioid. Poly substance use was the most prevalent pattern of use (80) in psychotic and mood disorders due to substance. Significant difference was seen between genders, marital status, occupation, duration of illness and frequency <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use (P < 0. 05), however no significant difference was seen between educational levels, age and substance use. Conclusions: The patients with mood disorders had the highest comorbidity with substance use and concurrent use <b>of</b> poly <b>substance</b> was the most prevalent pattern of use in these patients. Therefore, successful treatment of psychiatric disorders and substance use needs multimodal and more serious interventions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: An {{epidemic}} of prescription drug abuse is disproportionately impacting the mentally ill. We examined {{the utility of}} a state prescription drug monitoring database for assessing recent controlled substance prescribing to patients presenting for dual diagnosis treatment. METHOD: In a community mental health center that provides integrated dual diagnosis care, we queried the Indiana Scheduled Prescription Electronic Collection and Tracking (INSPECT) system for all cases that were open as of August 2, 2011, and had been practitioner-diagnosed (per DSM-IV criteria) by January 2, 2012. INSPECT provided a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> controlled <b>substance</b> dispensations to each patient; diagnostic evaluation was conducted blind from prescription data compilation covering the prior 12 months. Demographic data, insurance status, and DSM-IV diagnoses were compiled from the clinic's electronic medical record. RESULTS: The sample (N = 201) was 51 % female, 56 % white, and two-thirds uninsured. Over 80 % were dually diagnosed with substance use disorders and psychotic, mood, or anxiety disorders. Nicotine and alcohol disorders were identified in most, with about a third diagnosed with cannabis, cocaine, or opioid disorders. A majority of patients (n = 115) had been prescribed opioids in the prior year, with nearly 1 in 5 prescribed an opioid and benzodiazepine simultaneously. Patients were dispensed a mean of 4 opioid prescriptions and 213 opioid pills. More opioid prescriptions correlated with opioid dependence (OR = 1. 08; 95 % CI, 1. 016 - 1. 145), and more prescribers correlated with personality disorder diagnoses (OR = 1. 112; 95 % CI, 1. 001 - 1. 235). Higher rates and riskier patterns <b>of</b> controlled <b>substance</b> prescribing were identified in patients with Medicaid/Medicare insurance compared to uninsured patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription drug monitoring is {{a powerful tool for}} assessing addictions and high frequencies of patient exposures to prescribed opioids in a dual diagnosis clinic.
