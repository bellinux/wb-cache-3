An email invitation was distributed by the race organisers 10  days following the event to all registered runners who participated {{in one of three}} different distances (10  km, 21  km and 42  km). Individuals were eligible to participate if they were 18  years or older and had competed in one of the three running distances. Informed consent was confirmed when individuals clicked on the survey link, thus authorising investigators to use their de-identified data for further analysis. This study was performed in accordance with the standards of ethics outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethic Committee at Universidad del Desarrollo, no. 2017 - 105. The questionnaire included the following information: presence and topography of RRIs during competition (new), old previous injury (from month 12 th– 4 th before the race), recent previous injury (from month 3 rd– 0 before the race), SeRUN® <b>running</b> <b>profiles</b> (years of <b>running</b> experience), training factors (weekly mileage for weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 prior to the competition; hours and frequency of running training), race distance (10  km, 21  km, or 42  km) and socio-demographic characteristics. According to a previous study [7], SeRUN® <b>running</b> <b>profiles</b> were classified as follows: Beginner, Basic, Middle and Advanced. According to the weekly mileage variable, acute volume (week prior to competition), chronic volume and acute chronic workload ratio (coupled ACWR) [8] were calculated. For the ACWR calculation, only external load (weekly volume) was used; acute volume included mileage of the last week plus race distance; chronic volume was calculated as the average of weeks 1, 2, 3 and acute week (coupled). ACWR cut-off values of <[*] 0.85, between 0.85 – 1.35 and >[*] 1.35 were used to investigate the injury risk differences between them [5, 9]. A running-related injury was defined as “running-related (training or competition) musculoskeletal pain in the lower limbs that causes a restriction on or stoppage of running (distance, speed, duration, or training) for at least 7 days or 3 consecutive scheduled training sessions, or that requires the runner to consult a physician or other health professional.” [10], which was used for all types of injuries studied (old and recent previous injury and injury during competition).

40|$|An {{algorithm}} optimizing train <b>running</b> <b>profile</b> with Bellman’s Dynamic programming (DP) is {{investigated in}} this paper. Optimal train running trajectory which minimizes amount of total consumed energy has been produced under fixed origin and destination, stipulated running time, limited electric motive force and electric brake by VVVF controlled induction motor/generator blended with mechanical brake, several local speed constraints and local inclines. Many previous works on this area adopt the numerical techniques of calculus of variations, Pontryagin’s maximum principle, incremental method, and so on. But these methods often meet some difficulties accounting for complicated actual train running preconditions, e. g. complicated functions which describe electrical motive/brake torque, local constraints of state variables as speed limits, nonlinear running resistance and variable grade profile. DP can cope with such complicated conditions. It can directly {{deal with such}} difficult constraints of an optimal control problem, except for terminal boundary condition. At DP process of a former research, position and velocity of train and total running time are divided into nonuniform lattice and the numerical algorithm solves state equations partially and calculates interpolated local valuation.

Optimal run-curve can be obtained in practically acceptable computational time {{even when it is}} applied to actual complicated running conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} asperities such as found on the teeth of gears and discs, and failure mechanisms associated with rough surface Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL). The principal outcomes of the research provide a good insight into fatigue life, residual stress effects, damage prediction and surface contact failures. In particular, the study is intended to provide understanding into the residual stress distribution resulting from plastic deformation of surface asperities in the running in process. The residual stress is then added to the asperity elastic stress distribution and examined in detail to see the effects on fatigue damage and fatigue life. So, a theoretical model has been developed to assist design against the residual stress effect and surface contact fatigue, such as micropitting. The technique {{used in the study}} starts with developing an elastic plastic model of the rough surface by using the Abaqus Finite Element analysis software package. This is a nonlinear problem and ranges of applied loads have been applied to the as-manufactured surfaces causing the asperity features to experience varying degrees of plastic deformation. The pre and post <b>running</b> roughness <b>profiles</b> are studied in order to assess the level of plastic deformation actually occurring at significant surface asperity features by aligning the pre and post <b>running</b> <b>profiles.</b> This results in a new technique that has helped to identify the level of plastic deformation occurring in the practice, and also to make a comparison with FEA contact analysis for the same asperity features to identify the appropriate residual stress field. The residual stress field associated with the plastic deformation was extracted and evaluated. The extracted residual stress field was transferred to a form that facilitated IV inclusion in stress evaluation code to obtain the stress history for the material subject to loading in an EHL contact. The research carried out considers surface fatigue analysis with and without a residual stress field, so as to establish the influence of asperity plastic deformation on the fatigue properties of the surface. All the work is based on numerical simulation of surface fatigue failure in EHL situations and carried out numerically. The procedure can be applied quickly and gives the opportunity to apply several models and investigate the influence of all the model parameters on material deformation and fatigue life...|$|R

However, {{the use of}} these technologies may provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers who have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service disruptions. In this paper, we study false data injection (FDI) attacks against railways' traction power systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two types of FDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor measurements - which we call efficiency attack and safety attack [...] that (i) maximize the system's total power consumption and (ii) mislead trains' local voltages to exceed given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To counteract, we develop a global attack detection (GAD) system that serializes a bad data detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on unique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our detection system can effectively detect the FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current measurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS, attack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system features an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false positive and negative rates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive simulations driven by realistic <b>running</b> <b>profiles</b> of trains verify that a TPS setup is vulnerable to the FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected effectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false positive rate.

Sixteen players (mean (±SD) age, stature, and body mass: 22 ± 4 y, 178 ± 8 cm, and 78 ± 9 kg, respectively) competing in the national-level Australian Hockey League (AHL) and 16 players [mean (±SD) age, stature, and body mass: 27 ± 4 y, 179 ± 5 cm, and 77 ± 5 kg, respectively] competing in the international Champions Trophy (CT) tournament participated in this study. Global positioning systems assessed total distance (TD), meters per minute (m·min- 1), and high-speed running distance (HSR; > 4. 17 m·s- 1). Differences in multistage fitness test performance, movement between competition, positions, and halves were assessed using effect size and percent difference ± 90 % confidence intervals. The CT players had a 10. 1 % greater multistage fitness test, 13. 9 % and 42. 0 % more TD and HSR, respectively, than AHL. During CT, strikers performed 10. 1 ± 7. 4 % less HSR than midfielders and 26. 6 ± 8. 2 % more HSR than defenders. The AHL defenders covered less TD and HSR distance compared with strikers and midfielders (8. 1 ± 3. 6 % and 8. 4 ± 2. 6 %; 36. 1 ± 11. 1 % and 51. 5 ± 12. 1 %, respectively).

40|$|Australian Football, {{the most}} popular {{football}} code in Australia, is a contact sport played by two teams of 18 players who contest play over four 20 -minute quarters; {{the object of the}} game is to score the most points through goal kicking. Sixteen professional senior sides compete against each other in the Australian Football League (AFL) and, similar to other football codes, game demands at the elite level in the AFL have changed considerably in recent years. Early time-motion analysis studies highlighted the long periods of time players spent in low intensity activities (standing and walking). While recent studies utilizing global positioning systems (GPS) technology are somewhat in agreement with earlier findings, available evidence suggests that the game is getting faster. For example, 2 ̆ 7 playing on 2 ̆ 7 after a mark (a feature of the game where players who catch the ball on the full from a kick longer than 15 m are awarded a free kick) is now much quicker. Indeed, rule changes in recent years have increased the flow and speed of the game; there has been a reduction in the time taken for umpires to restart play, and for players to kick-in (after the opposition kicks a behind) or take a set shot at goal. Nomadic players (a broad term for midfielders and ruckmen because they follow play over the entire playing field) cover slightly greater distances (12 310 m) than both forwards (11 920 m) and backs (11 880 m) in a game. Compared with players in other positions, midfielders are consistently found to spend the most time at higher intensities (running and sprint efforts with movement velocities > 4. 44 m/sec), complete more high intensity efforts (similar to 98 per game), sustain them for longer and have shorter recovery periods between high intensity exercise bouts (similar to 90 seconds on average). 2 ̆ 7 Ruckmen 2 ̆ 7 have similar but less intense running profiles, while forwards and backs generally have less game involvement but have a more intermittent <b>running</b> <b>profile</b> (longer recovery periods with shorter duration high intensity exercise bouts and less time spent in constant pace running). Endurance fitness remains very important for players at the elite level of competition, as does upper and lower body strength and power. In addition, given the increasing speed at which Australian Football is now played, repeated sprint ability of players is arguably more important now than it was in previous years. There are no significant differences in these measures between playing position. Similarly, speed over 10 - 40 m does not appear to differ between playing position. Establishing the reliability of distance and velocity-derived GPS data in highly specific game-related activities is needed; once achieved, GPS data have the potential to accurately inform coaches of the position-specific demands on their players and to drive the development of training practices that reflect the changing demands of the game...|$|E

Finally we use the phenomenological dilaton profile to engineer holographic descriptions of theories with QCD-like phase diagrams. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Opinion polls {{suggest that}} as many as six {{independent}} parties could cross the electoral threshold and enter the Bundestag in Germany’s federal elections in September. In advance of the elections, we will be <b>running</b> a series <b>profiling</b> each of these parties. In the first article of the series, Ross Campbell writes on the German Left Party (Die Linke), which has confounded initial expectations after the unification of Germany to become a stable feature of the German party system. However, with the rise of new challengers, the 2017 elections could pose formidable challenges for the party as it seeks to build on the third place it achieved in the last federal elections in 2013...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Port {{scanning}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular reconnaissance techniques that many attackers use to <b>profile</b> <b>running</b> services on a potential target before launching an attack. Many port scanning detection mechanisms have been suggested in literature. However, very little work has been done on generating port scanning benchmarks that researchers can use to test their detection methods. In this paper, we suggest a simulation framework using OMNeT++ to generate benchmarks that resemble real-life traffic. We approach the problem by dividing it into three modules (topology creation, good traffic generation, bad traffic generation), each of which we make realistic, similar to deployed and usable networks. Hence the resultant benchmark is annotated and made public...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{vertical}} electrical sounding (CVES) {{surveys were}} carried out on KNUST campus to ascertain the electrical properties of the formations {{in the area in}} order to determine its suitability for the construction of heavy structures. Eight 2 D CVES profiles were conducted at the site in the study area with a wenner array using electrode separations of 1, 2. 5 and 4 m. The apparent resistivity data were inverted using the least square inversion technique into subsurface electrical structures. The results on the <b>profiles</b> <b>running</b> N-S indicate a well defined boundary in the electrical resistivity structure between the wet granites at the base and the dry undifferentiated granites on top of it...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates a {{possible}} architecture to a dynamically adaptable processor. In this architecture, the <b>running</b> application is <b>profiled</b> and dynamic traces of high frequently executed loops (hot paths) are detected. The proposed online profiling methodology is mainly hardware-based so that overhead {{can be reduced}} as much as possible. Studying the behavior of branch and jump instructions, gathered by the profiler, guides us to the hot paths. To improve the performance for the next iterations, hot paths are optimized using dynamic software pipelining technique, which seems a suitable method for our simplified 8 - way VLIW accelerator. To exploit the hardware accelerator, the binary code is rewritten. Some preliminary performance evaluations show speedup...|$|R
