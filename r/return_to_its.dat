A report on the {{restoration}} was published, in redacted form, on 7 March 2013. On 23 January 2015, the NRM announced that the smoke deflectors and double chimney will be retained, including a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> BR green livery, to keep it as historically accurate as possible as No. 60103.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} one of {{its worst}} decline in viewers and several key changes took place to boost the ratings. Network Ten drama executive, Dan Bennett revealed that the show would <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> focus on relationships and family dynamics. Writers created and introduced a new family, the Parkers, who already had a link to Ramsay Street {{in the form of}} Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor). The family made their first on-screen appearance in July 2007, marking the start of the show's renovation.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> normal position and 5–10 minutes to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The eyewall {{may vary}} {{over time in}} the form of eyewall {{replacement}} cycles, particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward, which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one {{at the end of the}} cycle, at which time the storm may <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original intensity.|$|E

5|$|The short {{second section}} in common {{time is a}} 12 bar {{bridging}} interlude linking {{the first and third}} sections. The key modulates from D minor to C minor, so that the surrounding first and third sections can modulate from their starting key to its dominant and thus the whole movement can <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original key at the close.|$|E
5|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} tame {{frigatebirds}} being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific. A bird {{that had come}} from one island and had been taken elsewhere could be reliably trusted to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original home, hence would {{be used as a}} speedy way to relay a message there. There is firmer evidence of this practice taking place in the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu.|$|E
5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission {{of the year was}} a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> new homeport of New York.|$|E

50|$|In 1945 the Armée de l'Air <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> {{airfield}} and it <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> prewar {{status as}} an active air base. A 2100m all-weather asphalt runway was laid down for jet aircraft operations, and {{the damage caused by}} World War II was repaired. It is undetermined when it was converted to a civilian airport.|$|R

5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaiian to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. In October 1915, landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including American, returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.|$|E
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to decommission and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive to attain a 600-ship Navy. At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> traditional, 313-ship composition. While reducing the fleet created under the 600-ship Navy program, {{the decision was made}} to deactivate the four recommissioned Iowa-class battleships and return them to the reserve fleet.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which took place while six American-Hawaiian ships {{were being held}} in various Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled {{with the fact that}} the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to the canal route.|$|E
5|$|It {{continues}} {{along the}} hillside of Black Mountain, Washington County's highest peak, as it meanders {{north on the}} narrowing isthmus between Lakes Champlain and George. Near the northern end, it crosses the Essex County line. Two miles later, it reaches the first settlement along its length within the Adirondack Park, Ticonderoga. The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of key battles in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, as NY74 comes in from the ferry to the east. This overlap lasts for almost two miles (3km) until NY74 goes straight ahead at the intersection with NY9N, while NY22 turns right to join NY9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> northbound orientation.|$|E
