Radial profi les have shown substantial axial sap fl ow in deeper layers of sapwood (that may lack direct connection to transpiring leaves), which suggests the existence of a radial pathway for water movement. Rays in tree stems include ray tracheids and/or ray parenchyma cells and may offer such a pathway for radial water transport. This study investigated relationships between radial hydraulic conductivity (k[subscript s-rad]) and ray anatomical and stem morphological characteristics in the stems of three conifer species whose distributions span a natural aridity gradient across the Cascade Mountain range in Oregon, United States. • Methods: The k [subscript s-rad] was measured with a high-pressure fl ow meter. <b>Ray</b> <b>tracheid</b> and ray parenchyma characteristics and water transport properties were visualized using autofl uorescence or confocal microscopy. • Key results: The k[subscript s-rad] did not vary predictably with sapwood depth among species and populations. Dye tracer did not infi ltrate ray tracheids, and infi ltration into ray parenchyma was limited. Regression analyses revealed inconsistent relationships between k[subscript s-rad] and selected anatomical or growth characteristics when ecotypes were analyzed individually and weak relationships between k[subscript s-rad] and these characteristics when data were pooled by tree species. • Conclusions: The lack of signifi cant relationships between k[subscript s-rad] and the ray and stem morphologies we studied, combined with the absence of dye tracer in <b>ray</b> <b>tracheid</b> and limited movement of dye into ray parenchyma suggests that rays may not facilitate radial water transport in the three conifer species studied...|$|E

40|$|The {{migration}} and deposition of hot melting wax in wax-treated wood is not {{described in detail}} in the literature, although such products {{are available on the}} market. In the present study, this topic was investigated based on pine sap-wood (Pinus sylvestris L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The behavior of three different waxes was studied by means of 2 D X-ray measurements and scanning electron microscopy observations. The three waxes did not show distinct differences in their deposition patterns. An intensive wax deposition could be observed within the vessels, tracheids, and fibers. In P. sylvestris the <b>ray</b> <b>tracheids</b> were penetrated with hot melting waxes, therefore there is a lateral wood penetration from the outer to the inner wood. In general, no wax penetration was visible within the parenchyma tissue and epithelium cells.

40|$|The middle Devonian aneurophytalean progymnosperms are {{generally}} accepted candidates as {{ancestors of the}} earliest seed plants. Their wood is composed of rather broad tracheids with crowded bordered pits on all walls and homocellular, tall and narrow rays. Suggested evolutionary trends include: 1) a decrease in diameter of tracheids (in both arborescent archaeopteridaleans progymnosperms and pityans seed plants), 2) inversely an increase in diameter of tracheids in the other early seed plants; 3) a decrease in pit seriation in archaeopteridalean, protopityans and some early seed plants; 4) a restriction of pitting to the radial wall of tracheids in early seed plants; 5) an increase in mean width of rays in archaeopterialeans and seed plants. Some characters are rare (<b>ray</b> <b>tracheids,</b> xylem parenchyma) or so variable in the ancestral group (ray height) that their polarity is difficult to establish.

40|$|Key message This study {{provides}} new data and an alternative framework {{to the debate}} of tree carbon economy {{in a context of}} increasing stress. Abstract For long-living trees, the resilience in times of stress is directly linked to the amount of accessible re-serves. Despite the simplicity of this principle, the under-standing of how carbon reserves limit growth and/or induce mortality under global change is still debated. In this study, we quantify how anatomical properties of rays—one of the main container for carbon reserves in tree stems—vary among sites, individuals, and annual rings of Larix gmelinii growing in contrasting sites in Siberia to verify if (1) the ray proportion and anatomical structure is linked to the environment, and/or (2) to changes in other wood tissues. Our observations have highlighted that ray proportion mainly varies among individuals, but little among sites and consecutive annual rings. We also observed that ray size and density scale to the wood structure with a relatively constant ratio of * 2. 5 <b>rays</b> per <b>tracheid,</b> independent of site conditions. These results suggest that the functional connection between the anatomy of <b>rays</b> and <b>tracheid</b> is unaffected by environment and highlight the importance of considering allometric relations in ecological comparisons. Comparative studies of long-term trajectory of ray pro-portion of living and dead trees might unravel observed variability among individuals validating the link between long-term depleted reserves and mortality...|$|R
30|$|Pyrolytic {{preparations}} of nanometals, such as zinc or copper, affect several elemental {{characteristics such}} as size, charge and dispersion properties {{in such a way}} that may improve their properties for wood preservation compared to similar soluble preparations [8]. Nanometals created by pyrolysis demonstrate precisely controlled particle size in the 1 – 100 -nanometer range that may improve penetrability of the chemical into wood relative to nanometals prepared by milling. Nanometer-size particles of metals have increased surface area when evenly dispersed in a layer. If the particle size was smaller than the diameter of the wood window pit (< 10, 000 nm) or the opening of the bordered pit (400 – 600 nm), complete penetration and uniform distribution would be expected [9]. Nanoparticles demonstrate high dispersion stability, but in concentrated form, they are subject to Van der Waals forces. Surfactants are typically added to increase dispersion stability thereby enabling liquid dispersion of higher concentrations of nanometals. Matsunaga et al. [10] conducted a study on microdistribution of a micronized copper wood preservative (10 – 700 nm). They observed numerous particle deposits of copper in <b>ray</b> <b>tracheids</b> and pit lumens within the wood. These deposits created a different microdistribution pattern in wood treated with the micronized copper than was observed in wood treated with other copper-based preservatives. Fixation of micronized copper is believed to occur primarily through deposition in pit chambers and on tertiary cell wall layers rather than via chemical reaction [9].|$|R
40|$|Mineralized wood {{collected}} from Late Pliocene strata near Gorbki {{village in the}} Transcarpathian region of Beregovo Kholmogor'e in southwestern Ukraine was anatomically studied and identified. The wood possesses distinctive anatomical features and has distinct growth rings with an abrupt transition from early- to late-wood. Wood consists of tracheids with 1 – 3 seriate, dominating bi-seriate, opposite pits on the radial walls and taxodioid cross-field pitting, indentures present. Rays are uni-seriate and 1 to 73 cells high. Ray parenchyma horizontal walls thin and smooth. Axial parenchyma distributed in early- and late-wood and is solitary and diffuse, with end walls nearly smooth or slightly nodular. The combination of features observed in the wood indicates {{it belongs to the}} conifer family Taxodiaceae and is most similar to modern Sequoia and assigned to the fossil genus Sequoioxylon. Comparison with species of Sequoioxylon show it is most similar to Sequoioxylon burejense, but <b>ray</b> <b>tracheids</b> were not found in our specimens.

Description of wood anatomical characteristics of each species were performed. 2. Genus Picea was divided into three groups from the wood anatomical point of view, but these three groups have no significant relation with the three sections adopted by A. REHDER. Anyhow, they may perform a significant role on the taxonomy of genus Picea. 3. Particular observation {{was performed on the}} main wood anatomical characteristics. Spiral thickenings of longitudinal and <b>ray</b> <b>tracheids,</b> and the presence of crystals. General characteristics of genus Picea which have been described by many from the wood anatomical standpoint should be rewritten. The appearance of spiral thickenings in the longitudinal tracheids of some species has rather close relation with the narrowness of growth rings and the age of the part. 4. Colouration by reduction of flavone derivatives in the wood of some species was found by few species and it could be available for identification of these species. 5. There was a somewhat close relation between the wood anatomical characteristics of the species and their native regions. A.

40|$|International audienceWe review {{progress}} {{made during the}} last 25 years {{in our understanding of}} the Protopityales, Early Carboniferous plants belonging to the extinct group of the progymnosperms. Recent studies support previous observations that the only genus of this order, Protopitys, included large arborescent plant with trunks up to 1 m in diameter. All branch orders had an oval eustele, secondary xylem with small <b>rays</b> and <b>tracheid</b> pitting ranging from circular bordered to scalariform bordered, and vascular traces to lateral appendages emitted in an alternate to subopposite distichous arrangement. Leaf morphology remains unknown. New material also confirms that fertile organs of Protopitys consist of branching systems bearing elongated sporangia terminally. Spores have a perispore and range in two size groups, which has been interpreted as a primitive stage of heterospory. The dense wood and fertile parts of Protopitys are comparable to those of the aneurophytalean progymnosperms of the Devonian, but Protopitys is distinct by its eustelic primary vascular system, and its affinities are still uncertain. The genus is now documented from at least nine localities in Europe, North America and Australia.

40|$|The Upper Lias of Yorkshire as {{represented}} {{to the north}} and west of the Peak Fault, is a phase of aeposition of argillaceous sediments under varying physical conditions. The Grey Shales are shallow water deposits which pass gradually but rapidly into the finely laminated, bituminous shales of the Jet Rock, which were laid down under 'Black Sea conditions', but in water much shallower than the Black Sea. As the basin was gradually filled up during Bituminous Shale and Hard Shale times, its floor rose into the zone of aerated water, when the poorly bedded Alum Shales were deposited. Thes sedimentational conditions were interrupted by the deposition of an argillaceous limestone at the end of Jet Rock-times and by several beds and rows of masses of siderite mudstone, at varying horizons during subsequent zone-moments. The best 'hard' jet is found only in the Jet Rock, and is entirely composed of collapsed and compressed wood structures, soaked in humic substances resulting from the decomposition of the original wood. Annual rings, medullary <b>rays,</b> <b>tracheids,</b> bordered pits, stem bases and bark are all recognised in the jet. Some specimens of jet are silicified along a central zone, and here the wood structure is well preserved in an uncrushed state. Within the jet are frequent rows of included quartz grains and other minerals, which had become wedged into cracks in the wood before sedimentation. Whitby jet is the altered ermains of coniferous wood washed from the Liassic land surface into the Yorkshire Basin, where it became waterlogged and sank. The dominating factors in the subsequent jetonisation were the conditions of reduction and stagnation in the deeper parts of the basin during Jet Rock times. These conditions caused the formation of a fine, black viscous mud which, together with the absence of oxygen due to the same reason, controlled the decomposition of the wood and limited it to a unique and prolonged breakdown of organic constituents. As a result the wood which was in the form of stems and trunks, was reduced to a pulpy condition. The constant slow deposition of muds caused the stems to be much flattened and to assume the form in which they are now found. The inferior varieties of jet are due to formation in more oxygenated conditions of sedimentation, and probably to a greater degree of aerobic decomposition before incorporation in the argillaceous sediments. The increased amount of oxygen would cause decomposition to follow a more normal course...|$|R

30|$|This is {{the first}} report to {{ascertain}} potassium location in black heartwood of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica). The objective {{of this study was}} to understand the distribution of potassium in sugi black heartwood in connection with anatomical morphology. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDXA) was used to investigate the distribution of inorganic elements, especially potassium. In black heartwood, potassium was detected in all tissues (<b>tracheids,</b> <b>ray</b> parenchyma, and axial parenchyma), but its concentrations were different in each xylem tissue. Potassium was particularly accumulated in the droplets in axial parenchyma cells. In addition, calcium was also detected in all tissues. Phosphorus sometimes existed in the granules in ray parenchyma cells. From optical microscopy, the axial parenchyma cells were observed to be arranged in a tangential direction on transverse section and the droplets in these cells were distributed in areas of high ash and green moisture content. For red heartwood, potassium detected by SEM-EDXA was far lower in all tissues than in the black heartwood, while the trend for calcium was the converse. Potassium in axial parenchyma cells was more abundant in black heartwood than in typical pale red heartwood.|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Canacomyrica (hitherto not studied) shows that it belongs in Myricaceae, {{although}} it differs from other genera in several respects (axial parenchyma grouped in bands or columns as well as diffuse; Heterogeneous Type I rays; more numerous bars per perforation plate). The latter two features are primitive for the family. The four genera (Canacomyrica. Comptonia, Morella, and Myrica s. s.) differ from each other not only by qualitative features but by quantitative features (feature means in genera mostly non- overl apping). Wood of Comptonia and Myri ca s. s. lacks chambered crystals in axial parenchyma and ray crystals. Wood of Myrica s. s. has tracheids in latewood but fiber-tracheids in earl ywood. Diagnostic generic summaries are presented. Features of Myricaceae such as scalarifom perforation plates, presence of (true) <b>tracheids,</b> <b>ray</b> types, chambered encapsulated crystals in axial parenchyma, and bark anatomy correspond with character states and expressions in Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Corylaceae, Juglandaceae (including Rhoipteleaceae), Ticodendraceae and, to a lesser extent, Fagaceae and Nothofagaceae. This grouping of families can be found as Fagales in recent DNA trees. The predominance of tracheids in basal Fagales such as Myricaceae and Ticodendraceae suggests that origin of vasicentric tracheids which occur in combination with libriform fibers in Fagaceae {{is the product of}} tracheid dimorphism. Low imperforate tracheid length to vessel element length ratios (FN ratios) in Myricaceae are a probable indication of wood primitiveness. Quantitative vessel features of Myricaceae, as combined in Mesomorphy Ratio values, characterize wood of Myricaceae as a whole, but at the species level such values correspond to respective habitats; notably high vessel density in Comptonia may represent greater conductive safety appropriate to relatively dry habitats...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBalsa wood is {{a natural}} {{cellular}} material with excellent stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios as well as superior energy absorption characteristics. These properties are derived from the microstructure, which consists of long slender cells (tracheids) with approximately hexagonal crosssections that are arranged axially. Parenchyma are a second type of cells that are radially arranged in groups that periodically penetrate the <b>tracheids</b> (<b>rays).</b> Under compression in the axial direction the material exhibits a linearly elastic regime that terminates by the initiation of failure {{in the form of}} localized kinking. Subsequently, under displacement-controlled compression, a stress plateau is traced associated with the gradual spreading of crushing of the cells through the material. The material is less stiff and weaker in the tangential and radial directions. Compression in these directions crushes the tracheids laterally but results in a monotonically increasing response typical of lateral crushing of elastic honeycombs. The elastic and inelastic properties in the three directions have been established experimentally {{as a function of the}} wood density. The microstructure and its deformation modes under compression have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy. In the axial direction it was observed that in the majority of the tests, failure initiated by kinking in the axial–tangential plane. The local misalignment of tracheids in zones penetrated by rays ranged from 4 ° to 10 ° and axial compression results in shear in these zones. Measurement of the shear response and the shear strength in the planes of interest enabled estimation of the kinking stress using the Argon–Budiansky kinking model. The material strength predicted in this manner has been found to provide a bounding estimate of the axial strength for a broad range of wood densities. The energy absorption characteristics of the wood have also been measured and the specific energy absorption was found to be comparable to that of metallic honeycombs of the same relative density...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{importance}} of wood bonding {{increased in the}} last decades due to the increased usage of wood composites whose performance depends {{to a large extent}} on the adhesive penetration and subsequent bonding of the adherends. The presented research used XMT (x-ray microtomography) to perform a non-destructive, threedimensional analysis of the adhesive bondline and wood-structure of Southern yellow pine, Douglas-fir and yellow-poplar samples. A phenol-formaldehyde adhesive was used. The sodium hydroxide catalyst was replaced with rubidium hydroxide during resin formulation. This was done to improve the image contrast. The reconstructions of the wood structure of Southern yellow pine showed <b>tracheids,</b> <b>rays,</b> fusiform rays, resin canals and pits. On the Douglas-fir sample <b>tracheids,</b> pits and <b>rays</b> were displayed clearly. The yellow-poplar images showed vessels, fibers, bordered pits, scalariform sieve plates and rays. The renderings of the adhesive-bondline of Southern yellow pine proved the dominant role of tracheids for the adhesive flow and showed rays as a secondary pathway of adhesive flow. The results revealed no adhesive flow occured through bordered pits, while simple pits permitted some adhesive flow through ray parenchyma. The results for Douglas-fir showed a similar result; the tracheids were the predominant path of adhesive penetration, while rays played a secondary role and no adhesive flow through the pit aperture was visible. The adhesive flow through the microstructure of yellow-poplar wood occured mainly through vessels and also through rays, but no adhesive flow through the pits was directly observed. The segmentation of the images in three phases: void space, cell wall substance and adhesive, enabled the calculation of the effective bondline thickness based on the adhesive, as well as the volumetric measurement of all three elements and their share on the sample volume. Subsequent experiments showed that the exposure of the Southern yellow pine and yellow-poplar bondlines to cyclic moisture did not cause delaminations or cracks. However, there were some indicators that the samples experienced some irreversible swelling. Finally, the generation of 3 -D animations of wood samples and bondlines of Southern yellow pine, Douglas-fir and yellow poplar was achieved. This animation was a way to present the results of this research in a quick and accessible way that illustrates the three-dimensional microstructure of a wood-adhesive bond...|$|R

Baker to cause selective delignification of Quercus hypoleucoides A. Camus were evaluated by standard in vitro agar block tests. Chemical and scanning electron microscopy studies of decayed wood were used {{to determine the extent of}} selective delignification or simultaneous decay caused by each fungal isolate. At 35 deg C, the percent weight loss increased from 6. 1 % after 4 weeks to a maximum of 32. 5 to 33. 0 % after 16 and 20 weeks of incubation. The average percent Klason lignin-chlorite holocellulose ratios (PKL/CHC) decreased from 0. 35 in the control wood block to 0. 22 in wood blocks incubated for 12 weeks; this indicated selective delignification. The average PKL/CHC increased for the 16 - and 20 -week incubation periods, indicating greater removal of polysaccharides during longer incubation periods. In temperature studies, the percent weight loss after 12 weeks was 26 to 27 % between 30 and 40 deg C and less than 16 % for the 25 and 45 deg C treatments. The average PKL/CHC ranged from 0. 18 to 0. 16 between 35 and 40 deg C, whereas they were 0. 23 and 0. 31 for the 25 and 45 deg C treatments, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed an optimum temperature range near 35 to 40 deg C and incubation times of 8 to 12 weeks for selective delignification. Under these conditions, <b>ray</b> parenchyma, fiber <b>tracheids,</b> and vessels were devoid of middle lamella; pit regions of cells were visible with significantly enlarged apertures; and individual cells were separated and clearly delimited. Extensive delignification of wood occurred throughout the wood blocks evaluated. Incubation times longer than 12 weeks resulted in greater degradation of wood cell walls and thus in greater removal of the polysaccharide component of the wood. For incubation times of 4 weeks or a temperature of 25 deg C, limited to no degradation of cells was observed. At 45 deg C, walls of fiber tracheids were eroded and ray parenchymal cells were extensively degraded, indicating that simultaneous degradation of cell walls occurred. Thus, the incubation temperature influenced the type of decay by G. colossum observed on oak wood blocks: extensive selective delignification at 35 to 40 deg C after more than 8 weeks of incubation or simultaneous decay at 45 deg C with 14 % weight loss after 12 weeks of incubation. Isolates of G. colossum may prove useful in studies on mechanisms of delignification and biotechnological applications (e. g., biopulping) of lignin-degrading fungi...|$|R
