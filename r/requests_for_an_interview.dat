25|$|Although Fahey's Maria Duce {{organisation}} {{was initially}} left {{to its own}} devices, Archbishop McQuaid grew less sympathetic {{to it in the}} latter half of the 1950s. He condemned the group for their heavy-handed reaction to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> from the anti-Catholic American writer Paul Blanshard (whom Bishop McQuaid felt should have been treated courteously despite disagreeing strongly with him). McQuaid went as far as to write to Fahey in 1954 stating that he opposed the latter's association of the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary with his organisation. Fahey died before any response could be made, and the group was disbanded the following year; McQuaid took on the group afterward.|$|E

5000|$|She {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the Gandhis, regularly visiting Mr and Mrs Gandhi at their Phoenix Settlement for Indians, and moved there to join the satyagraha campaign. She bought a cottage nearby at Ohlanga, as a base for her work to support several movements operating from the area, including the Gandhis, and those of early African statesmen such as John Dube. In speeches given with Gandhi at meetings in Durban she urged Indians to identify with Africa. The Gandhis came to Cape Town in 1914 and Miss Molteno worked to facilitate their meetings with the most powerful political figures in South Africa. She also facilitated their introduction to Emily Hobhouse and the Prime Minister himself, General Botha, who had long ignored Gandhi's <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> but thereafter maintained cordial communications. Gandhi was later to write about Miss Molteno's role as [...] "peacemaker", enabling him to make contact {{with some of the most}} powerful figures in the country.|$|E

Remnick wrote, [...] "In Iraq, General McCaffrey led the 24th Infantry Division in an epic [...] "left hook" [...] tank drive, designed to shut off an Iraqi retreat from Kuwait. He and his troops won extraordinary praise for a four-day march under bleak conditions. Hersh, however, {{in the course of}} conducting hundreds of interviews and reviewing thousands of pages of government and Army documents, found a number of operations by men under McCaffrey's command that are, at a minimum, unsettling. His detailed account, published here this week, describes how, on March 2, 1991 - two days after the declaration of a ceasefire, when Iraqi forces were in flight, McCaffrey attacked a line of retreating Iraqi vehicles and troops, unleashing an assault that lasted several hours and was all but uncontested. In testimony before the Senate and in written answers to questions from Hersh (whose repeated <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> were declined), McCaffrey said that his men were fired on and {{he had no choice but}} to respond in force-with the full might of his division." ...|$|E

Walters merely followed up with the question, [...] "What kind of a tree?", and Hepburn responded [...] "an oak" [...] because they are strong and pretty. According to Walters, for years Hepburn refused her <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview.</b> And when she finally agreed to one, she said she wanted to meet her first. Walters walked in all smiles and ready to please, while Hepburn {{was at the top of}} the stairs and barked, [...] "You're late. Have you brought me chocolates?" [...] Walters hadn't, but said she never showed up without them from then on. They had several other meetings since that first time, mostly in Hepburn's living room where she would give Walters her opinions. Careers and marriage did not mix. Children and careers were out of the question. Walters said Hepburn's opinions stuck with her so much, she could repeat them almost verbatim to this day.|$|E
50|$|Fahey's {{writings}} {{have been}} a source of controversy, both in his lifetime and since. Writing to Joseph MacRory in 1942, Archbishop John Charles McQuaid of Dublin stated thatDr Fahey will certainly not err in doctrine, but he is capable of making statements and suggestions that are not capable of proof by any evidence available to the censors... I have been obliged to watch carefully his remarks upon the Jews. He will frequently err in good judgement, and this error will take the shape of excerpts from newspapers as proof of serious statements, unwise generalisations and, where Jews are concerned, remarks capable of rousing the ignorant or malevolent. In his own Congregation, Fr Fahey is not regarded as a man of balanced judgement. He is a wretched Professor, obscure and laborious.Although Fahey's Maria Duce organisation was initially left to its own devices, Archbishop McQuaid grew less sympathetic to it {{in the latter half of}} the 1950s.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of House Bill 462 into law brings forth {{questions about the}} probable impact on the physical, mental, emotional and financial well-being {{of the women in}} Virginia. In particular, analysis of its effect on the minority and underserved female population is required. Understanding the origin of this new legislation and the thinking behind its proposal and subsequent adoption dictates an endeavor into the backgrounds and intended goals of its sponsors and supporters. Proponents of HB 462 were unresponsive to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> to expound on their perspective {{about the importance of the}} legislation. This precipitated the use of media clips from televised political discussions and newspaper articles to acquire direct quotes in an effort to gain insight into their position. Legislation of morality emerged as the key them from the research materials assembled. This belief is shared by many who oppose the law. The Supreme Court put forth the following as the reasoning behind its decision, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey: “Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code [...] . at the heart of liberty is the right to define one 2 ̆ 7 s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. ” Opponents of HB 462 regard the law as contrary to the decision. If, in fact, this legislation is not intended to impose the morality of its sponsors on all Virginians, as the research suggests, it is probable that it will have a disparate impact on the minority and underserved segment of the population...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presents}} some methodological experience {{obtained in}} the course of research on the function of the chapter of a labor union in art industrial plant. The basic method of research were scheduled interviews with the members of the plant's council and department’s councils. In view of the “official” subject-matter dealt with in the interviews, and to avoid stereotyped and propagandistic answers, it was decided to precede the main research by several months’ observation of the milieu studied. During' this period the author was familiarizing herself with labor union’s documents, collecting statistical data, participating in various meetings of the union. On this occasion she had an opportunity to know personally particular activists her future respondents. With time, relations between the researcher and her future respondents were becoming personal and informal; in this climate she was explaining the reason for her presence in the plant and the purpose of the research. In this phase the researcher made a number of free interviews on the functioning of the union, thus obtaining personal and private opinions. Observation furnished additional knowledge about the union’s organization and its members, as well as about the views and expectations prevailing in the community under study. Owing to the preparatory contacts, the majority of respondents knew the researcher beforehand so that her <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> did not arouse any surprise and no refusals were encountered. Interviews were running in a friendly atmosphere; respondents were trying to be helpful, their answers being sincere and comprehensive. It is believed that, without the previous preparatory contacts, it would not be possible to get sincere and trustworthy answers about certain delicate problems connected with the functioning of the union; the respondents’ awareness that the researcher was familiar with their activities has also influenced positively their attitude towards interviews. In addition, it was possible to confront some opinions of respondents with the materials gathered by the researcher...|$|E
