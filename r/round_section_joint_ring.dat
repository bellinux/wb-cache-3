40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of ration of natural rubber, synthetic rubber RSS/SBR and carbon black in preparation of compound for Rubber Seal <b>Joint</b> <b>Rings</b> for Water Supply. The ratio of RSS/SBR was 35 / 63; 25 / 75; 15 / 85 phr and Carbon black 20 phr; 30 phr and 40 phr. The vulcanized product of Rubber Seal <b>Joint</b> <b>Rings</b> for Water Supply were then tested their physical properties. Generally the test result were better than those of for Rubber Seal <b>joint</b> <b>rings</b> for Water Supply found in market and they fulfill the requirements of SNI 06 - 4828 - 1998 “Spesifikasi cincin karet sambungan air minum, air limbah dan air hujan”. The hardness of product using carbon black in constant quantity and varied quantity of RSS/SBR did not perform significant effect either for pre-ageing. The best hardness of 61 shore A and 65 shore A with 0 % change was achieved at the quantity of carbon black 30 phr and 40 phr with ratio RSS/SBR 25 / 75. The optimum tensile strength of 11. 38 MPa and 12. 63 MPa with change after ageing of - 6. 3 % and - 11. 3 % was achieved at the quantity of carbon black 20 phr and 30 phr with ratio of RSS/SBR 25 / 75. The best of elongation at break of 440 %with change after ageing 1. 35 % was achieved at the use of carbon black 20 phr with ratio of RSS/SBR 25 / 75, where as with ratio RSS/SBR 35 / 65 and carbon black 30 phr, the elongation at break was 453 % and chane after ageing was - 1. 45 %. The best compression set of 5. 39 % and 5. 68 % was achieved at the quantity of carbon black 30 phr and 40 phr with ratio RSS/SBR 15 / 85. The optimum swelling of 2. 35 % was achieved at the quatity of carbon black and ratio RSS/SBR 25 / 75 was selected representing the exact composition of vulcanized compound of for Rubber Seal <b>joint</b> <b>rings</b> for Water Supply and perfoming best physical properties fulfilling the quality requirement of SNI 06 - 4828 - 1998 “Spesifikasi cincin karet sambungan air minum, air limbah dan air hujan”...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} method that can express the local leakage of leachate from <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in steel pipe sheet pile (SPSP) cutoff walls {{is discussed in}} this study. In particular, the evaluation of environmental feasibility (containment of leachates containing toxic substances) considering a three-dimensional arrangement and hydraulic conductivity distribution of the <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in the SPSP cutoff wall is compared with an evaluation that uses the equivalent hydraulic conductivity. This equivalent hydraulic conductivity assumes that the <b>joint</b> <b>section</b> and the steel pipe are integrated; therefore, the hydraulic conductivity is substituted with a uniform permeable layer. However, in an evaluation that employs the equivalent hydraulic conductivity, {{it is difficult to}} consider the local leakage of leachate containing toxic substances from the <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in the SPSP cutoff wall. It was established that evaluations of the environmental feasibility of SPSP cutoff walls with <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> must take into account the local leakage of leachates containing toxic substances from the <b>joint</b> <b>sections.</b> Also, it was clarified that technologies that lower the hydraulic conductivities of <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> in SPSP cutoff walls and also facilitate the use of sparser joint arrangements contribute significantly to increasing the environmental feasibility of SPSP cutoff walls at landfill sites...|$|R
