40|$|Since it is {{important}} for the design of electron-positron linear colliders to estimate beam-beam radiation this paper introduces a more exact formula for calculating the ndiated energy per frequency interval for classical synchrotron radiation but also for highly-relativistic beam-beam radiation. Reference is made to formulas ocurring in other papers. 1. INTRODUCI 7 ON During the collision of highly relativistic electrons of an electron bunch with an opposite-directional positron bunch the electrons (as well as the positrons) are accelerated towards the center of the axis of the cylindrical beam and emit electromagnetic radiation as a consquence of this acceleration. As a result of the ultra-relativistic movement of the colliding charges only normal acceleration is of importance for the <b>radiation</b> <b>capacity,</b> i. e. the radiation emitted consists mainly of synchrotron radiation due to longitudinal acceleration, its percentage is the larger the higher the center of mass energy is.

40|$|Burning fuels in an O 2 /H 2 O {{atmosphere}} {{is regarded as}} the next generation of oxy-fuel combustion for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). By combining oxy-fuel combustion and biomass utilization technology, CO 2 emissions could be further reduced. Therefore, this work focuses on investigating the combustion characteristics of single particles from bituminous coal (BC) and pine sawdust (PS) in O 2 /N 2, O 2 /CO 2 and O 2 /H 2 O atmospheres at different O 2 mole fractions (21 %, 30 %, and 40 %). The experiments were carried out in a drop tube furnace (DTF), and a high-speed camera was used to record the combustion processes of fuel particles. The combustion temperatures were measured by a two-color method. The results reveal that the particles from BC and PS all ignite homogeneously. Replacing N 2 by CO 2 results in a longer ignition delay time and lower combustion temperatures. After substituting H 2 O for N 2, the ignition delay time is shortened, which is mainly caused by the steam gasification reaction (C + H 2 O → CO + H 2) and steam shift reaction (CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2). In addition, the combustion temperatures are first decreased at low O 2 mole fractions, and then increased at high O 2 mole fractions because the oxidation effect of H 2 O performs a more important role than its volumetric heat capacity and thermal <b>radiation</b> <b>capacity.</b> At the same condition, particles from PS ignite earlier because of their higher reactivity, but the combustion temperatures are lower than those of BC, which is owing to their lower calorific values...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The cancer burden in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) is substantial. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and describe country and region-specific patterns of radiotherapy (RT) facilities in LMIC. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. A search strategy was developed to include articles on <b>radiation</b> <b>capacity</b> in LMIC from the following databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Global Health and the Latin-American and Caribbean System on Health Sciences Information. Searches included all literature up to April 2013. Results: A total of 49 articles were included in the review. Studies reviewed were divided into one of four regions: Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America. The African continent has the least amount of resources for RT. Furthermore, a wide disparity exists, as 60 % of all machines on the continent are concentrated in Egypt and South Africa while 29 countries in Africa are still lacking any RT resource. A significant heterogeneity also exists across Southeast Asia despite a three-fold increase in megavoltage teletherapy machines from 1976 to 1999, which corresponds with a rise in economic status. In LMIC of the Americas, only Uruguay met the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recommendations of 4 MV/million population, whereas Bolivia and Venezuela had the most radiation oncologists (> 1 per 1000 new cancer cases). The main concern with the review of RT resources in Eastern Europe was the lack of data. Conclusions: There is a dearth of publications on RT therapy infrastructure in LMIC. However, based on limited published data, availability of RT resources reflects the economic status of the countries. The challenges to delivering radiation in the discussed regions are multidimensional and include: lack of physical resources, lack of human personnel, and lack of data.

40|$|The use of Bacillus anthracis as a {{biological}} weapon heighlightened {{awareness of the}} need for validated methods for the inactivation of B. anthracis spores. Ionizing radiation is capable of causing a variety of chemical changes and biological effects on bacteria which can be due both to direct interactions with critical cell components and to indirect actions on bacteria by molecular entities formed as a result of radiolysis of other molecules in the bacterial cell. This study determined the gamma irradiation dose for inactivating B. anthracis spores and its biological effects on the bacterial characteristics. Gamma irradiation was conducted at the IRKA irradiator at the National Nuclear Energy Agency, Jakarta and cobalt- 60 was used as the source of ionizing <b>radiation</b> (<b>capacity</b> of ca. 134, 044 Kci). Freeze dried culture of B. anthracis in glass ampoules was irradiated using variable doses of 30, 20 and 10 KGy. Viability, biochemical and protease enzyme characteristics of B. anthracis were evaluated before and after irradiation. The ability of B. anthracis to degrade gelatin, haemoglobin and bovine immunoglobulin G was also tested. The results showed that ionizing radiation was able to inactivate or kill 11, 05 x 108 cfu B. anthracis by 95. 37 %, 99. 58 % and 99. 99 at respective doses of 10, 20 and 30 KGy. Bacterial spores appear to be less susceptible to irradiation than the vegetative cells, because of their specific structure. The survive spores irradiated at 30 kGy shows some biochemical characteristic changes. The survivors failed to degrade methyl -D-glucopyranoside and arbutine. The ability of B. anthracis protease to degrade gelatin, haemoglobin and bovine immunoglobulin G was not affected by irradiation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} non-ionising {{radiation}} {{to human health}} {{has been a great}} concern. In the case of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, this apprehension is especially significant, since it concerns students and university staff who study, work and live in the university compound. This worry is further justified with the existence of several Mobile Telephone Base Stations (MTBS), television and radio broadcast towers, high-voltage electric cables and electrical substations which are known to be sources of electromagnetic fields ranging from the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) to the Radiofrequency (RF) range. This creates a serious quandary, since there are no safety guidelines focusing on limiting the non-ionizing radiation exposure dose to students and staff members. The objectives of this study are two-fold: 1) to monitor the non-ionising radiation level at various locations within the university compound to provide current data compared with exposure limits suggested by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee (INIRC) of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) and 2) to develop a non-ionising radiation policy for Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) from both the administrative and technical aspects. Six locations were chosen for monitoring based on the presence of radiation sources and/or student/staff occupancy, determined {{with the assistance of the}} Office of Occupational Safety and Health, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Three of these locations contain sources which emit radiation in the ELF range, while the remaining three emit RF radiation. Results showed that the ratio percentage between the RF and ELF exposures at these locations, in comparison to the MCMC and IRPA/INIRC exposure limits,were 0. 2 % and 2. 8 %, respectively. These results showed that for the time being, the exposures at all identified non-ionising radiation hotspots does not exceed the exposure limit suggested by both MCMC (which adopts the recommendation of ICNIRP, 1998) and IRPA/INIRC. However, a non-ionising radiation policy for UKM is still imperative, to serve as a reference and guideline for future activities that may contribute to the non-ionising <b>radiation</b> <b>capacity.</b> Subsequently, concerns were raised during the monitoring activities, especially amongst students who highlighted the necessity of a subject that introduces non-ionising radiation and its possible biological risk, as was offered by the Nuclear Science Department, before the restructuring of the Faculty of Physics and Applied Science in 2001...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{importance}} to tomato production under heat stress conditions in hot climates of Pakistan, {{the objective of}} this research work was to study the influence of temperature and application of physical and chemical mutagens on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.,) CV. “Rio grande” Seeds were treated with chemical mutagen (Ethyl Methane Sulphonate) and physical mutagen (Gamma radiation). Plants were grown in open field conditions under day/night temperatures regimes at the experimental area of Department of Horticulture, faculty of crop and food sciences, PMAS-AAUR. The experiment was set twenty treatments and four replications in Complete Randomize Block Design. It is observed that by increasing dose of mutagens shows lethal effect and morphological parameters reduced significantly. But lower doses of EMS and Gamma <b>radiation</b> improve thermotolerance <b>capacity</b> significantly. Plants were investigated for different morphological parameters i. e Plant height, no. of leaves, leaf area, relative water contents of leaves, chlorophyll contents, cell viability (TCC Assay) and pollen germination. Among gamma rays 5 Kr were the only dose which survived and bear fruits. Among EMS 4 mM, 8 mM, 16 mM performed better under heat stress conditions than other treatments...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to address the}} problem of the optimization of curved photovoltaic surfaces that may become the alternatives of the traditional flat PV surfaces in BIPV. The proposed method combines three parts: an evolutionary algorithm (Genetic Algorithm) for optimization, an adaptive simulation tool based on Hay’s anisotropic radiation model, and a comparison module for analysis. The cladding problem of curved PV modules is geometrically solved that may serve as the starting point for practical links with architectural and PV engineering considerations. A systematical approach is established for the comparisons between the curved and flat surfaces according to various surface angle-settings (tilt angle and azimuth angle) and solar condition setups (latitude and radiation mode), involving specific 3 D and 2 D radiation plots and related data recording system. Through a series of experiments, the paper presents the characteristics of curved surfaces in terms of the solar energy gain, such as the stabilization characteristic and the mean total annual solar <b>radiation,</b> etc. The <b>capacities</b> of the algorithm are confirmed and several findings are discussed and concluded so as to be used as references for BIPV projects and other practical photovoltaic appliances...|$|R
