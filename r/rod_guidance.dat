40|$|Generation IV (GEN IV) {{reactors}} promise higher safety levels {{compared to}} current generation II or III reactors, {{one of the}} most important safety aspects of any reactor is the ability to shutdown the reactor in any condition. The shutdown mechanism in current designs of liquid metal cooled Gen IV reactors is based on absorber rods. Although these rod based systems are duplicated to provide redundancy, they all have a common mode of failure as a consequence of their identical operating mechanism; possible causes being a largely deformed core or blockage of the <b>rod</b> <b>guidance</b> channel. To achieve the goal of higher safety, a complementary scram system is desirable. In this paper an overview of existing solutions of such a complementary system is given and a new concept based on absorber particles and the existing solutions is proposed. This original system, which is not rod based, is under investigation and its feasibility is verified both by experiments and simulations. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} safety aspect of any reactor {{is the ability}} to shutdown the reactor. A shutdown in an ADS can be done by stopping the accelerator or by lowering the multiplication factor of the reactor and thus by inserting negative reactivity. In current designs of liquid-metal-cooled GEN IV and ADS reactors reactivity insertion is based on absorber rods. Although these rod-based systems are duplicated to provide redundancy, they all have a common failure mode as a consequence of their identical operating mechanism, possible causes being a largely deformed core or blockage of the <b>rod</b> <b>guidance</b> channel. In this paper an overview of existing solutions for a complementary shut down system is given and a new concept is proposed. A tube is divided into two sections by means of aluminum seal. In the upper region, above the active core, spherical neutron-absorbing boron carbide particles are placed. In case of overpower and loss of coolant transients, the seal will melt. The absorber balls are then no longer supported and fall down into the active core region inserting a large negative reactivity. This system, which is not rod based, is under investigation, and its feasibility is verified both by experiments and simulations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTotal knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) {{in patients}} with knee arthritis and retained implants in the ipsilateral femur is a challenge for knee surgeons. Use of a conventional intramedullary femoral cutting guide is not practical because of the obstruction of the medullary canal by implants. Previous {{studies have shown that}} computer-assisted surgery (CAS) can help restore alignment in conventional TKA for patients with knee arthritis with retained femoral implants or extra-articular deformity, without the need for implant removal or osteotomy. However, little has been published regarding outcomes with the use of navigation in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) -TKA for patients with this complex knee arthritis. MIS has been proven to provide less postoperative pain and faster recovery than conventional TKA, but MIS-TKA {{in patients with}} retained femoral implants poses a greater risk in limb malalignment. The {{purpose of this study is}} to report the outcome of CAS-MIS-TKA in patients with knee arthritis and retained femoral implants. Between April 2006 and March 2008, eight patients with knee arthritis and retained femoral implants who underwent the CAS-MIS-TKA were retrospectively reviewed. Three of the eight patients had extra-articular deformity, including two femur bones and one tibia bone, in the preoperative examination. The anteroposterior, lateral, and long-leg weight-bearing radiographs carried out at 3 -month follow-up was used to determine the mechanical axis of lower limb and the position of components. The mean preoperative femorotibial angle in patients without extra-articular deformity was 3. 8 ° of varus and was corrected to 4. 6 ° of valgus. With the use of navigation in MIS-TKA, the two patients in this study with extra-articular femoral deformity also obtained an ideal postoperative mechanical axis within 2 ° of normal alignment. Overall, there was a good restoration of postoperative mechanical alignment in all cases, with a mean angle of 0. 4 ° of varus. No limb malalignment or component malposition was found. In clinical assessments, there were also significant improvements in knee specific scores, functional scores, and motion arc. The results of this study suggest that navigation can help achieve accurate alignment and proper prosthesis positioning in MIS-TKA for patients with retained femoral implants and for whom intramedullary <b>rod</b> <b>guidance</b> is impractical...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{this pilot}} cadaver study {{to investigate whether}} {{the use of a}} navigation system during minimally invasive unicompartmental knee arthroplasty leads to more consistent results than the conventional hand-guided technique. We describe the accuracy of implant positioning in using standard instrumentation and computer navigation. Radiographic assessment showed that accurate component placement was achieved using both methods. These results were not statistically significant. The computer navigated femoral component placement without intramedullary (IM) rod was as accurate as the conventional method with IM rod. The study showed that computer navigation can produce accurate results even without an intramedullary <b>rod.</b> Image <b>guidance</b> can maintain the accuracy of the standard instrumentation and enhance 3 D vision and the intraoperative orientation of the surgeon. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2005...|$|R

The reflecting elements are mounted on two carrier elements (2. 1, 3. 1) and are rotatable to the optical axis of the laser beam hitting on the first reflecting element. The carrier elements are connected by a guide rod (4) and the interval of the reflecting elements is changeable in longitudinal direction of the guide rod. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for laser processing of workpieces, where the focal spot of a laser beam (1) is three-dimensionally movable, comprises two reflecting elements (2, 3) by which the laser beam is directed on a workpiece surface to be processed after dual reflection. The reflecting elements are mounted on two carrier elements (2. 1, 3. 1) and are rotatable to the optical axis of the laser beam hitting on the first reflecting element. The carrier elements are connected by a guide rod (4) and the interval of the reflecting elements is changeable in longitudinal direction of the guide rod. A drive is provided for a common rotation of the reflecting elements with the respective carrier elements and for the interval change of the reflecting elements on the device. The drive for the common rotation and/or translatoric movement grips on carrier element of the second reflecting elements. The guide rod is fixed {{on one of the}} carrier elements in its longitudinal direction and is arranged on another carrier element in a longitudinal guidance (5). The carrier element of the second reflecting element is movable in longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface and reflecting elements and the guide rod and/or the longitudinal guidance are pivotably arranged vertically to longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface. On the reflecting elements, a rotation drive is arranged by which an angle is pivotable that corresponds to 0. 5 times of the angle by which the <b>guidance</b> <b>rod</b> is directed to 90 degrees to longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface. The drive is formed as gear-, frame- or friction gear, where an edge is connected with the respective carrier element and the other edge is connected with the rotation shaft of the respective reflecting elements. The drive is formed as double cross slide for a two-dimensional movement of {{the focal point of the}} laser beam, and for a three-dimensional deflection in the form of a tripod mechanic. The first carrier element is rotatable to the optical axis of the laser beam hitting on its reflecting element and is fixed for other movement. The <b>guidance</b> <b>rod</b> comprises a cross-section with a guide contour and a guidance contour complementary to the longitudinal guidance is present that forms a twist protection. USE - Device useful for laser processing of workpieces. ADVANTAGE - The device ensures rapid laser processing of workpieces with high processing speed and good quality...|$|R
