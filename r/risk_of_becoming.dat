5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> infected with HIV. Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E
5|$|Near Benton, Fishing Creek's pH {{ranges from}} around 5.6 to 7.25, while near Bloomsburg, {{a wider range}} has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Near Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the only stream in the {{watershed}} whose pH drops below 5.5; it can fall as low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least acidic streams in the watershed, with pH levels usually above 6.3 and often above 7. Typically, the creek and its tributaries are not at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> too acidic for the optimal health of fish, but in early spring during snowmelts, the levels approach the limit that brook trout can tolerate. Fishing Creek's waters are acidic because of acid rain.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

25|$|Desertification, another {{important}} environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, {{also known as}} the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are egraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid caatinga ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.|$|E
25|$|Aboriginals {{are also}} more likely to be the victims of crime.

Domestic violence and sexual abuse against children is more prevalent in the Aboriginal population with sexual abuse affecting 25–50% of Aboriginal female children versus 20–25% of female children in the general population. Children who come from homes with a history of violence are at a greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> the perpetrators of violence later in life. This is especially true of males.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} early manifestations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) increase children's later <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bullying or victimization. Method: Using a population-based, prospective cohort, our multi-informant approach comprised reports of parents, teachers, and peers. ADHD and ODD behavioral problems at ages 1. 5, 3, and 5 years were determined from parental {{reports on the}} Child Behavior Checklist. Later bullying behavior at school was reported by teachers using a questionnaire (n = 3, 192, mean age 6. 6 years), and by peer/self-reports using peer nominations (n = 1, 098, mean age 7. 6 years). We examined the following: whether problem behavior scores at age 1. 5, 3, or 5 years predicted a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bullying involvement; and whether high or increasing behavioral problems throughout ages 1. 5 to 5 years were associated with bullying involvement at school. Analyses were adjusted {{for a range of}} child and maternal covariates. Results: Behavioral problems at a young age each predicted later bullying involvement at school. For example, higher ADHD problem scores at age 3 years were associated with the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> a bully or a bully-victim (ORBULLY = 1. 20, 95 % CI = 1. 07 - 1. 35 [teacher report], ORBULLY-VICTIM = 1. 28, 95 % CI = 1. 14 - 1. 43 [teacher report], and ORBULLY-VICTIM = 1. 35, 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 78 [peer/self-report]). Children whose behavioral problem scores were high or increased over time consistently had elevated <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> a bully or a bully-victim.
