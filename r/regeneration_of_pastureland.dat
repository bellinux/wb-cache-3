40|$|Mediterranean {{mountain}} landscapes {{have high}} ecological and cultural values. However, since 1950, {{a large number}} of these landscapes have been subject to degradation as a consequence of land abandonment. Some regional administrations have enacted measures that favour the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasturelands</b> through scrubland clearing. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the consequences of clearing and the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasturelands</b> on landscape structure and the recovery of extensive livestock in La Rioja. The results indicate that between 1986 and 2011 an area of 29, 659 [*]ha was cleared in the mountains of La Rioja, although 62 · 6 % of this was cleared in the period 2000 – 2011. In 1956, the landscape was dominated by cultivated fields, but by 2001, much of the agricultural area had been abandoned and replaced by scrubland, natural woods and reforested areas. Furthermore, the landscape was more fragmented in 1956 than in 2001. The landscape structure varied following clearing, with a doubling in the number of patches and an increase in heterogeneity. The consequences of clearing have included an increase in the area <b>of</b> <b>pastureland</b> and the number of large animals. In addition, the number of farms has decreased, but their mean size has increased. Clearing is an appropriate way for spatial reorganization in marginal mountain areas. It does not require excessive investment but favours the reintegration of abandoned fields and an increase in <b>pasturelands.</b> The results <b>of</b> this study contribute to the debate about reclaiming mountain landscapes affected by human activities and subject to intense degradation processes.

40|$|Abstract: The {{articular}} disc in the temporomandibular joint {{plays an}} important role in mandibular growth. Functional appliances induce <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle even after condylectomy. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the articular disc in <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle after unilateral condylectomy with use of a functional appliance in growing rats. Fifty growing rats were subjected to unilateral condylectomy and then half of them underwent discectomy. The functional appliance was applied to half of the rats in each group to induce <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle. Four and eight weeks later, morphometric and histologic analyses of the mandible were performed. <b>Regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle was demonstrated in the two condylectomy groups. In the condylectomy+appliance group, the shape and cartilage of the condyle were equivalent to a normal condyle. However, <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the condyle was not observed in the two discectomy groups even with the use of the functional appliance. The articular disc appears to be crucial in the <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> a damaged condyle, suggesting that defects or damage to the articular disc may influence mandibular growth and <b>regeneration</b> or repair <b>of</b> the condyle.

In this paper we assess whether <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> sclerophyllous forests shows nucleated patterns {{indicative of a}} positive effect of vegetation remnants at the landscape level and compare the regeneration patterns between sites with distinctive climate conditions. We studied the spatial patterns of vegetation change during 52 years in central Chile using remotely-sensed images to test the predictions that (1) <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> sclerophyllous vegetation expands from patches of remnant vegetation; and (2) regeneration is more dependent on remnant vegetation in drier sites. Our {{results show that the}} <b>regeneration</b> <b>of</b> the sclerophyllous vegetation in central Chile is a slow process that may be possible under certain conditions.
