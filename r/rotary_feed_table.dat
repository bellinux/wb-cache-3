40|$|The {{positioning}} accuracy of <b>rotary</b> <b>feed</b> system under load greatly {{depends on the}} static stiffness of mechanical transmission system. This paper proposes a unified static stiffness model of <b>rotary</b> <b>feed</b> system with geared transmission system. Taking the torsional stiffness of transmission shaft and mesh stiffness of gear pairs into account, the motion equations of the whole transmission system are presented. Based on the static equilibrium, a unified expression {{for the relationship between}} torsional angles of two adjacent elements is derived. Then a unified static stiffness model is presented. Furthermore, analytical expressions for sensitivity analysis of the static stiffness on the individual element’s stiffness and design parameters are derived. The presented model is verified by a traditional model, and a good agreement is obtained. The influence of phase angle of meshing gear pairs on the resultant static stiffness is investigated. An example transmission system is employed to perform the sensitivity analysis and the results are analyzed. The proposed model provides an essential tool for the design of <b>rotary</b> <b>feed</b> system satisfying requirement of static stiffness. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} a noninvasive method to assess <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed (mm/s) in modern commercial computed tomography (CT) systems. The <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> (mm/rotation) was measured at selected nominal <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speeds, given as low (26. 67 mm/s), intermediate (48. 00 mm/s), and high (64. 00 mm/s), by utilizing a computed radiography (CR) cassette installed with a photostimulable phosphor plate. The cassette was placed on the examination table to travel through the isocenter longitudinally, with a total scan length of over 430 mm. The distance travelled was employed to determine the total <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> length. To calculate the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed, gantry rotation time was measured concurrently at a preselected nominal rotation time of 750 ms. Upon completion of data acquisition, the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> and gantry rotation time were analyzed and used to calculate the actual <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed (mm/s). Under the low <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed setting, the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed was found to be 26. 67 mm/s. Similarly, under the intermediate and high <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed settings, the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed was found to be 48. 10 and 64. 07 mm/s, respectively. Measurements of the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed can be accomplished with a CR system and solid-state detector, and the <b>table</b> <b>feed</b> speed results were in excellent agreement with the nominal preset values...|$|R
40|$|Vineyards {{around the}} world sustain {{significant}} economic losses due to grape loss and damage caused by frugivorous passerine birds, and while bird control methods are in place, their efficacy is limited and/or short lived. With the call for more sustainable agricultural practices globally, it would be advantageous to offer an ecologically based solution to the bird problem in vineyards, while further research and development into cheaper, more effective methods of bird control that does not create noise or disturbance to communities surrounding vineyards is required. The Australasian harrier, a native, diurnal New Zealand raptor, is the focal species of this project. With considerable numbers of harriers sited around New Zealand viticultural land, {{the aim of this}} project was to attract populations of these harriers into vineyards by providing them with an important food source – animal carcasses. The presence of harriers was expected to exploit the innate fear that pest passerine birds have towards raptors and provide an effective biological control aid that would provide an economically and environmentally sound solution to passerine bird induced grape damage as the passerines responded to the harrier rather than foraging on grapes. The Australian harrier was attracted to raised <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> in Canterbury and Wairarapa vineyards with supplementary food. Results indicated it was difficult to attain regular <b>feeding</b> from all <b>tables</b> set up. Some <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> sites saw harriers <b>feeding</b> off <b>tables</b> regularly and intermittently, while at other sites no harriers exploited the tables. When presented with a two choice food test on <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> comprising one-day-old cock chicks and rabbit pieces in the springtime, chicks (86 %) were the harriers’ clear choice over rabbit pieces (14 %). During the summer season, there was no preference, with equal amounts of both baits taken. Where <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> were present, pest bird abundance decreased by 56 %, and grape damage also decreased by 59 %; however, these results were not necessarily linked only to harrier presence. While harrier numbers increased due to <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> so did the number of other predators. A further trial without <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> where supplementary food was placed on the ground to attract all predators, showed an increase of predators in the treatment sites compared to control sites, with harriers and cats the most frequently observed. Pest passerine bird densities in the control sites were higher than the treatment sites. Raised <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> baited with animal carcasses are not necessarily a reliable method to encourage harrier feeding in vineyards. Several reasons may explain why this method may be unreliable. The best reason may be the motivation to feed off a novel object, i. e. the raised table was not sufficient because of neophobic tendencies for some harriers, and these were difficult to overcome. Alternative, easily accessible food sources were readily available in some landscapes and agonistic relationships with other species, who were frequently seen harassing harriers in study sites, may well have confounded attempts to achieve <b>feeding</b> off <b>tables</b> at all sites. Findings perhaps negate the need for any <b>feeding</b> <b>tables,</b> and supplementary <b>feeding</b> alone may be the key to attracting harriers and other predators into vineyards to achieve the fundamental goal of decreasing pest passerine bird numbers and consequent grape damage...|$|R

The concrete and plastic-coated samples were placed on a walking path {{on the floor and}} on a <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> in a cattle barn. The surfaces were characterized using colorimetric and gloss measurements and determination of topography. In most cases, the colour of the surfaces placed on the floor darkened during the one year study period, whereas the colour changes of the samples placed on the <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> did not show a similar trend. However, in both locations the plastic-coated surfaces were generally the easiest to clean, and the highest colour changes indicating soil residues were detected on the uncoated and silane-impregnated concrete surfaces. The difference between the locations was also seen in the gloss values, which increased in the samples placed on the floor during the one-year test period but varied considerably between the different materials on the surfaces placed on the <b>feeding</b> <b>table.</b> This field study confirmed the observation from earlier laboratory studies that plastic coatings improved the cleanability of concrete cattle barn surfaces. Silane impregnation was not functionally competitive with the plastic coatings. In general, the cleanability results were in accordance with the results of previous laboratory experiments but the field study provided practical information about the behaviour of the surface materials examined. ...|$|R

We provided clumped resources at <b>feeding</b> <b>tables</b> and calculated linear dominance hierarchies on the basis of observations between dyads of color-ringed individuals, and we used an experimental procedure to measure individual exploratory behavior of these birds. We show that fast-exploring territorial males had higher dominance ranks than did slow-exploring territorial males in two out of three samples, and that dominance related negatively to the distance between the site of observation and the territory. In contrast, fast-exploring nonterritorial juveniles had lower dominance ranks than did slow-exploring nonterritorial juveniles, implying that the relation between dominance and personality is context-dependent in the wild. We discuss how these patterns in dominance can explain earlier reported effects of avian personality on natal dispersal and fitness.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{preference}} of the pit row based on the current milk yield of cows of Holstein breed. Experiment took place in a particular breeding station in winter and summer. The factors included: current milk yield (kg milk), order of lactation (n) and stage of lactation (days). The object of observation was one section with 59 pits arranged in two rows. Row 1 - closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> (n = 29), row 2 - situated closer to the perimeter wall of the stable (n = 30). Dairy cows located in pits were monitored for frequency of standing and lying down. Lying dairy cows, were then monitored for the preferences of lying on the left or right side (laterality). Entry was done during a direct monitoring of dairy cows to a precise diagram of the section by group photoshots. The results demonstrated statistically high probative value that all cows most filled the row located closest to the <b>feeding</b> <b>table.</b> Furthermore, it was found that cows with the yield of 30. 1 - 40 kg of milk preferred the row that was closer to the perimeter wall of the stable (P < 0. 01). For cows with milk yield below 15 kg and over 45 kg of milk was then observed balanced preference of both rows. The order of lactation had statistically significant effect on the preference of the pit row when the row 1 was preferred by a greater extent by the cows at first, second and third lactation. On the contrary cows in 5 th lactation occupied this row the least. Dairy cows above the 90 days of lactation prefered statistically higher the row closest to the <b>feeding</b> <b>table</b> and the least a row located closer to the perimeter wall of the stable (P < 0, 01).
