2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|E

50|$|The hub axle of a {{hub gear}} (unlike {{that of a}} {{derailleur}} system) will carry torque in all gears except direct drive, and so must be securely braced against rotation. While anti-rotation washers between the dropout and axle nut have often proved adequate, wider-ranging modern systems use a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> affixed to the chain stay. Rear wheels with drum brakes (a feature on some commuter bicycles) require a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> anyway.|$|E

50|$|Since 2014 it is {{possible}} to torque tighten bolts without the use of a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm,</b> and thus without pinch point. This is a great break-through in the industry. <b>Reaction</b> <b>arm</b> free torqueing {{is possible}} due to the usage of a reaction washer. The knurled side of the washer hold on to the construction/flange and the bolt or nut turn over a smooth and through-hardened surface. The reaction washer will become a stationary object underneath the nut, eliminating the use of reaction arms.|$|E
50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} typically employ an {{epicyclic gear}} train having {{one or more}} stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied. In epicyclic gear systems, torque {{is applied to the}} input gear or ‘sun’ gear. A number of planet gears are arranged around and engaged with this sun gear, and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm,</b> causing the planet gears to orbit around the sun gear. The planet gears are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the planet gears orbit around the sun gear, the carrier and the output shaft rotate together. Without the <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque.|$|E

50|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of a}} hydraulic torque wrench is the reaction member, often called <b>reaction</b> <b>arm.</b> When torque {{is applied to the}} bolt or nut, the reaction member abuts against a stationary object to stop the wrench from turning around the fastener. This reaction force is tremendous and accidents (for example pinched fingers) have happened more than once.|$|E
50|$|The Honda RC30 had a 'Pro Squat Rear Brake Linkage' {{that linked}} the rear caliper {{to the frame}} via a linkage through the swingarm, {{reducing}} rear wheel hop under braking. The NC30 had the swingarm machined to allow a torque arm shaft and featured the cast boss on the frame but the linkage was not fitted and the caliper was instead held in place with a simple torque <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> bolted into the swingarm.|$|E
5000|$|Torque {{multiplier}} - Uses a multi-stage {{epicyclic gearing}} mechanism to multiply torque output. Torque {{is applied to}} the input gear which engages with a number of planet gears which are held in a fixed planetary gear. By using a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm,</b> the outside casing of the multiplier is prevented from rotating, causing the planet gears to rotate around the input gear. Along with the multiplication of torque, there is a decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the increase in torque. [...] Torque multipliers {{come in a variety of}} output ratios as well.|$|E
50|$|The Torshear bolting {{method was}} not a {{commercial}} success so 'North Bar' added <b>reaction</b> <b>arms</b> to their gearboxes and called them 'Pneutorque' {{in the case of}} the air driven versions and the hand operated versions were named 'Handtorque'. Evolutions of these products still form part of the company's range today. Dr. Merritt's book 'Gears' remains a reference for gearbox designers.|$|R

The engine was mated to a British-derived 4-speed manual transmission with overdrive on third and fourth gear. The chassis was, in Ferrari tradition, a steel tube frame with separate body, using front double wishbone suspension, and a rear live axle on leaf springs with <b>reaction</b> <b>arms.</b> There where disc brakes on all four corners, and Borrani wire wheels fitted with 175×14" [...] Pirelli Cinturato tyres.|$|R

50|$|The Arai {{drum brake}} is used during long {{downhill}} descents where a rim brake might overheat the tire and possibly {{cause it to}} fail. The drum of the brake screws onto {{the left side of}} the tandem hub, which must be threaded for the drum. The shoe plate slips over the axle and a small <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> from the shoe plate engages with the bicycle frame to prevent the plate from turning. The drum brake is typically controlled by a friction shift lever like a BARCON or similar. The brake is designed to be engaged continuously during a descent to maintain a steady speed. The standard brakes can be used in addition as necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic torque {{wrenches}} {{are used for}} tightening large torques with high accuracy. They are used for aviation and heavy machinery assembly and are specialised tools. [...] Their general construction varies depending on manufacturer and torque requirement. Generally they consist {{of at least one}} hydraulic cylinder operating a drive head ratchet. The cylinder extends, pushing the drive head round via the pawls, and then retracts freely over the ratcheting teeth. The process is repeated until the desired torque is met. Smaller hydraulic {{torque wrenches}} have a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> built into the tool, which rests against another fastener or part of the assembly to prevent rotation when torque is being applied. Larger models require other fixing arrangements in order to prevent rotation.|$|E

Explicit instruction resulted in earlier (p= 0. 005) and larger (p< 0. 001) medial deltoid EMG responses in comparison to no specific instructions. Compensatory <b>arm</b> <b>reactions</b> also occurred with a higher peak medio-lateral wrist velocity (p< 0. 001) and higher peak shoulder abduction angular velocity (p< 0. 001) with explicit instruction. Explicit instruction positively influenced compensatory <b>arm</b> <b>reactions</b> in individuals with and without PD.

5000|$|Built {{around an}} all-new tubular space frame, the Disco Volante used {{lightened}} components from the Alfa Romeo 1900. As on the 1900, {{the engine was}} a inline-four with double chain-driven overhead camshafts, but used an aluminium block and inserted sleeves instead of the 1900's cast iron one. While the 1900's 88 mm stroke was retained, cylinder bore had grown from 82.55 mm to 85 mm, bringing total displacement to 1,997.4 cubic centimetres; compression ratio was raised to 8.73:1. So configured, fed by two twin-choke sidedraught carburettors, the engine produced [...] at 6,500 rpm. The transmission was 4-speed gearbox with synchronised forwards speeds and a multi plate dry clutch. Suspension was, as on other Alfa Romeos of the time, by double wishbones at the front and solid axle linked to the chassis by an upper triangle and two lower longitudinal <b>reaction</b> <b>arms.</b> The brakes were drums on all four corners, and the 6.0×16" [...] tyres were fitted to wire wheels with duralumin rims.Thanks to its aerodynamic shape the car could attain {{a top speed of}} 220 km/h.|$|R

40|$|Perturbation of whole-body {{stability}} often evokes rapid <b>arm</b> <b>reactions.</b> It {{has been}} suggested that the earliest arm activation is a generic (e. g. startle-like) response to which a later stabilizing (e. g. counterweight or reach-to-grasp) or impact-protection component can be appended. To examine whether the initial part of the reaction is generic, we examined <b>arm</b> <b>reactions</b> evoked by small balance perturbations in 12 healthy young adults while varying perturbation direction (rightward or forward platform translation) and environmental conditions (handrail present or absent). The perturbation magnitude was selected to be sufficiently small to obviate the need to use the arms for stabilization. To avoid adaptation or habituation, analysis focused on each subject's very first exposure to the perturbation. Most subjects exhibited active movement of both <b>arms</b> in <b>reaction</b> to the perturbation, but there was large (non-stereotypical) inter-subject variation in muscle-onset latency and arm kinematics. Furthermore, the velocity and direction of the initial arm movement were affected by perturbation direction, {{in a manner consistent with}} functional strategies (counterweight strategy in backward falls, hybrid counterweight/protective strategy in leftward falls). Although subjects never contacted the handrail, responses were slower when it was present. These results are not consistent with a generic stereotyped response, but suggest instead that even the earliest component of first-trial <b>arm</b> <b>reactions</b> was functionally modulated...|$|R
