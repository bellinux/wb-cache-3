40|$|The {{efficient}} {{control of}} water usage {{is one of}} the core goals of the strictest water resources management system in China. Therefore, the objective and reasonable evaluation of the effects of implementing this system is crucial. Based on the natural and social water cycle theories and the mechanism of the influence of agricultural, industrial, domestic and ecological water utilization, this paper proposes an evaluation index system through the qualitative and quantitative analysis of external and internal factors affecting the efficiency of water usage. Then, a matter-element model is developed on the basis of game theory weight to evaluate the effects of the implementation of efficiency control measures for <b>regional</b> water <b>usage.</b> By calculating the comprehensive correlation, this model can directly indicate the level of regional water use efficiency control. The model is applied to water usage in Jiangxi Province for the period 2011 – 2014. The results indicate a gradual improvement in the efficiency of water usage in this province. The matter-element extension evaluation model is simple and practical, and the evaluation results are in agreement with the facts. In summary, this method can provide a new theoretical basis for controlling the efficiency of <b>regional</b> water <b>usage...</b>|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of past decades of extensive afforestation in Norway, mature forest volumes are increasing. National forestry politics call for sustainable and efficient resource usage and for increased regional processing. Regional policies seek to provide good conditions for such industries to be competitive and to improve regional value creation. We demonstrate how methods from operations research and regional macro-economics may complement each other to support decision makers in this process. The operations research perspective is concerned with finding an optimally designed wood value chain and an aggregated planning of its operations, taking a holistic perspective on strategic-tactical level. Using Input-Output analysis methods based on statistics and survey data, regional macro-economics helps to estimate each industry actor’s value creation and impact on society beyond immediate value chain activities. Combining these approaches in a common mathematical optimization model, a balance can be struck between industry/business and regional political interests. For a realistic case study from {{the northern part of}} coastal Norway, we explore this balance from several perspectives, investigating value chain profits, economic ripple effects and <b>regional</b> resource <b>usage...</b>|$|R

In addition, a study of regional jet economics, using Form 41 data, was conducted {{in order to better}} understand the observed patterns.
