5|$|The {{radiative}} {{zone and}} the convective zone {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radiative zone and the differential <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} frame methods, the lintel beams {{are assumed to}} be rigidly connected to the horizontal rigid arms such that <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beams at the joints are equal to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rigid arms. However, this would lead to incompatibility at the joints. It is found in this study that <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beams at the joints should instead be taken as <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall axis.

5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E

5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability {{because of the presence}} of star spots combined with the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E

5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction {{is in the same}} direction as the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} {{bursts of}} radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these bursts matched the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet, {{and they were}} also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
