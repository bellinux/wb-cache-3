40|$|The IBM POWER 6 TM {{microprocessor}} core {{includes two}} accelerators for increasing performance of specific workloads. The vector multimedia extension (VMX) provides a vector acceleration of graphic and scientific workloads. It provides single instructions that work on multiple data elements. The instructions separate a 128 -bit vector into different components that are operated on concurrently. The decimal floating-point unit (DFU) provides acceleration of commercial workloads, more specifically, financial transactions. It provides a new number system that performs implicit rounding to decimal <b>radix</b> <b>points,</b> a feature essential to monetary transactions. The IBM POWERe processor instruction set is substantially expanded {{with the addition}} of these two accelerators. The VMX architecture contains 176 instructions, while the DFU architecture adds 54 instructions to the base architecture.

40|$|While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) {{push the}} {{state-of-the-art}} in many machine learning applications, they often require millions of expensive floating-point operations for each input classification. This computation overhead limits {{the applicability of}} DNNs to low-power, embedded platforms and incurs high cost in data centers. This motivates recent interests in designing low-power, low-latency DNNs based on fixed-point, ternary, or even binary data precision. While recent works in this area offer promising results, they often lead to large accuracy drops {{when compared to the}} floating-point networks. We propose a novel approach to map floating-point based DNNs to 8 -bit dynamic fixed-point networks with integer power-of-two weights with no change in network architecture. Our dynamic fixed-point DNNs allow different <b>radix</b> <b>points</b> between layers. During inference, power-of-two weights allow multiplications to be replaced with arithmetic shifts, while the 8 -bit fixed-point representation simplifies both the buffer and adder design. In addition, we propose a hardware accelerator design to achieve low-power, low-latency inference with insignificant degradation in accuracy. Using our custom accelerator design with the CIFAR- 10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that our method achieves significant power and energy savings while increasing the classification accuracy.

A Digital Signal Processor with specific instruction sets and meant for a specific application is called as Application Specific Instruction set Processor (ASIP). An ASIP is widely used as a System on a Chip Component. Application Description Languages (ADLs) are nowadays becoming popular because of its quick and optimal design convergence achievement capability during the design of ASIPs. The first stage of designing a processor is Architecture Design Implementation. 	 LISA (Language For Instruction Set Architecture) is the ADL which has been used here. The platform used for design is CoWare, which allows processor architecture to be defined at an abstract level. In a similar approach to implement the processor in Hardware Description Language(here we have used VHDL), we have to make use of floating point arithmetic. This has been achieved with the help of IP cores from IP Core Generator in Xilinx ISE 10. 1. 	Discrete Fourier Transform is of much importance in fields of signal processing. A dedicated hardware for the frequency domain analysis of physical signals has become necessary in {{a large part of the}} electronics industry. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is the method of efficient calculation of DFT of a signal. It has an improved computational efficiency with respect to space and time complexity.
