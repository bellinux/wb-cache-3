40|$|In {{response}} to the growing awareness of multifaceted influences on patient safety culture, hospitals have employed a litany of tactics to reduce harmful events. The literature endorses executive <b>safety</b> <b>rounding</b> as being effective in promoting a positive patient safety culture. The influence of nurse manager <b>safety</b> <b>rounding</b> on patient <b>safety</b> culture is not well understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the influence of work systems, defined as nursing staff and organizational characteristics, on the process of nurse manager <b>safety</b> <b>rounding</b> and the outcomes of patient safety culture in the hospital setting. The complex ever changing healthcare system requires nurse managers to know what is occurring at the front-line to anticipate potential failures and design better systems and processes. This study utilized a cross-sectional design with data analysis of pre-existing survey data in nursing units within a large healthcare system in the southeastern U. S. The study participants voluntarily completed the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture, which included three additional investigator questions related to work shift, manager contact and rounding. The most significant finding showed the nursing staff gave higher patient safety grades as the frequency of nurse manager <b>safety</b> <b>rounding</b> and contact frequency increased. This study affirms there is strong evidence to support frequency of manager contact and <b>safety</b> <b>rounding</b> impacts patient <b>safety</b> culture. Furthermore, the joint effects of nurse manager contact and <b>safety</b> <b>rounding</b> proved a synergistic effect on higher reporting of patient safety culture. Nurse managers can apply in practice open communication, feedback, and discussion about preventing errors with front-line staff to improve patient safety culture...|$|R

[...] Sexting becomes a legal issue when teens (under 18) are involved, because any nude photos they may send of themselves would put the recipients in possession of child pornography.|$|R

In this paper, {{in accordance with the}} manufacturing linearis steel trussed beam bridge and steel truss beam linearis changing during building process, the calculation of temporary pier elevation was studied systematically, and practical function was deduced. Then, the method was applied to a long-span steel trussed arch bridge. The obtained result by in-situ assembly and dismantling presents that: 50 mm preserved method is considered in this paper, which can provide convenience for removing the temporary pier. At the same time, the rationality and reliability of the presented approach are verified. It also can provide reference for similar bridge construction...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to provide a venue for discussing safety concerns and to facilitate finding solutions for everyday safety issues. Methods: The multidisciplinary patient safety committee (Team Safety) at Kosair Children’s Hospital began <b>safety</b> <b>rounds</b> in January 2007. Each month, several teams walked through patient care areas and talked to staff. Responses to questions and other comments mentioned during rounds were recorded. Between <b>safety</b> <b>rounds,</b> the Team <b>Safety</b> chairperson met with the Vice President of Clinical Operations to discuss the findings, assign priorities, and develop action plans. Results: From January 2007 through August 2007, Team Safety members talked with 182 staff from at least 10 disciplines and recorded 79 different concerns; 39 percent of these have been completely or partially resolved. More staff know how to report events and near misses and can describe how the information is used. Conclusion: Frontline caregivers can conduct effective <b>safety</b> walk <b>rounds...</b>|$|R

40|$|NASA is {{building}} a high-fidelity prototype of an advanced Portable Life Support System (PLSS) {{as part of the}} Advanced Exploration Systems Program. This new PLSS, designated as PLSS 2. 5, will advance component technologies and systems knowledge to inform a future flight program. The oxygen ventilation loop of its predecessor, PLSS 2. 0, was driven by a centrifugal fan developed using specifications from the Constellation Program. PLSS technology and system parameters have matured {{to the point where the}} existing fan will not perform adequately for the new prototype. In addition, areas of potential improvement were identified with the PLSS 2. 0 fan that could be addressed in a new design. As a result, a new fan was designed and tested for the PLSS 2. 5. The PLSS 2. 5 fan is a derivative of the one used in PLSS 2. 0, and it uses the same nonmetallic, canned motor, with a larger volute and impeller to meet the higher pressure drop requirements of the PLSS 2. 5 ventilation loop. The larger impeller allows it to operate at rotational speeds that are matched to rolling element bearings, and which create reasonably low impeller tip speeds consistent with prior, oxygen-rated fans. Development of the fan also considered a shrouded impeller design that could allow larger clearances for greater oxygen <b>safety,</b> <b>assembly</b> tolerances and particle ingestion. This paper discusses the design, manufacturing and performance testing of the new fans...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this part of}} the 6 th framework Pan-European EUR-ACTIVE ROOF-er project is to improve the interaction between design participants of dynamic adaptable Active Roofs in product development and Active Roofs from an architects/ customers perspective. Improvements in Active Roof design on the basis of those technological product requirements that architects / customers deem {{to be the most important}} product / system benefits. This requires a common framework for information exchange that is scaleable with respect to the level of sophistication of each of the organisations and designers / engineers involved. Moreover, the desired information to be shared must be interpretable (language, terminology and definition) by all designers/ engineers [EURACTIVE ROOFer 2005]. Especially conditions for developing a design method for innovative roof-concepts are an essential result of the research. Part of the project is focussed on special roofs which are adaptable in function, structure or in material. Properties of these active roofs are: tensile / membrane, inflatable or retractable structures. Subscription of the several aspects of design (i. e. building physics), - sustainable energy and use (i. e. maintenance, <b>safety,</b> <b>assembly),</b> is information needed for better innovative products. The knowledge generated in this project directly benefits the Building Services research and education at Eindhoven University of Technology, Delft University of Technology and the department of innovation of renewable energy systems at TNO Building and Construction Research.
