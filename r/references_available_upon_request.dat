40|$|The Alaska Trauma Registry (ATR) {{was one of}} the Nation’s first statewide injury {{surveillance}} systems. 1 Initiated by the Southern Region Emergency Medical Services Council in 1988, it {{was adopted}} by the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) in 1990 and expanded to a statewide program in 1991. The ATR includes data from all 24 of Alaska’s acute care facilities, and ATR data have been used in at least 23 peer-reviewed articles (<b>references</b> <b>available</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request)</b> and numerous Alaska Epidemiology Bulletins. Five of the 24 reporting facilities abstract and enter their own trauma data directly into a computerized data repository. Smaller facilities either abstract the data at the facility and then send them to a registry contractor for entry into the repository, or scan records for both abstraction and entry into the repository by the contractor. The DHSS ATR manager is then responsible for cleaning the data and importing them into the ATR dataset...|$|E
40|$|<b>References</b> <b>available</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request</b> ” is a {{statement}} that {{can make or break}} your job offer. Here are 10 tips for assembling a successful reference list. 1. Ask, don’t assume. Ask your references for permission to use their names. Confirm the following: Do the people you include as references actually {{want to give you a}} reference? Does their schedule permit time to discuss your qualifications? Most importantly, what kind of reference will they be? When it comes to references, neutral is the same as negative, so ask your contacts to be honest: Can the people you ask give you a positive recommendation? 2. Let the professionals do the job. Potential supervisors are not interested in hearing friends or relatives talk about how nice you are. They want confirmation for their main objective: Are you going to deliver the duties of the job? Good reference sources include previous supervisors, co-workers, professors, or advisers. Think outside the box: If you voluntarily coordinated an organization’s fund-raising effort, the organization’s supervisor could be a great reference. It doesn’t matter that you weren’t paid. 3. Avoid name dropping. A reference’s name or job title is insignificant compared to the information he or she will provide regarding your strengths and weaknesses. CEO may be a loftier title than supervisor...|$|E

Big data customer analytics use (BD use), i. e., the extent to which customer information derived from big data analytics guides marketing decisions, helps firms better meet customer needs for competitive advantage. This study addresses three research questions: 	What are the key antecedents of big data customer analytics use? 	How, and to what extent, does big data customer analytics use influence firm performance? 	Is competitive advantage, if any, achieved through big data customer analytics use contingent upon its prevalence within an industry? Drawing primarily from market information use theory, we advance a theoretical framework to examine how informational and organizational factors act to enhance big data customer analytics use, which in turn influences customer relationship and financial performance. More specifically, we identify and show how information quality (IQ), big data analytics culture, and customer orientation act as key antecedents of big data customer analytics use, which in turn is the critical mechanism to achieve superior CRM outcomes. Finally, we investigate whether the performance implications of big data customer analytics use vary depending on the prevalence of big data customer analytics use in the firm’s industry. Empirical findings from a survey of 301 senior marketing executives, representing large US-based firms in B 2 C industries, support our conceptualization of the performance outcomes and antecedents of BD use. First, the results highlight that the characteristics of the customer information (IQ) and the characteristics of the user organization (customer orientation and big data analytics culture) strongly predict BD use. The findings also reveal the relative importance of different customer information characteristics to marketing decision-makers. Second, the results confirm BD use as a key predictor of firm performance, and more specifically, that big data customer analytics use primarily influences financial performance indirectly via customer relationship performance. Third, this study suggests that the performance impacts of BD use are highly contingent on its prevalence among industry rivals. <b>References</b> <b>Available</b> <b>Upon</b> <b>Request...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As {{computer}} technology emerges into the 21 st Century, {{the education and}} training community has found itself depending heavily upon the use of recent advances to improve training realism and reduce costs. The use of high fidelity models and simulations (M&S) is having {{a profound effect on}} our ability to train soldiers and civilians alike under nearrealistic conditions. Improved capabilities in visualization, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and distributed simulation are providing opportunities never before envisioned by our leadership. These same improved capabilities are also introducing risk- validation of the credibility of these models and simulations under conditions that are not always verifiable or testable. After more than ten years of explosive growth in the application and use of M&S in all domains, there is still no uniform approach to establishing and quantifying their creditability through standardized verification and validation (V&V) techniques. More importantly, with the increased reliance on battlefield and campaign level simulations such as ModSAF by the training community, these become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to validate using traditional techniques. This paper will address the critical needs to improve our standards in the V&V of mission critical M&S and will introduce standard validation techniques that can be applied to battlefield-level models to include: face validation, trace validation, historical validation, multi-stage validation, and internal validation. Each technique will be discussed in terms of how to determine when that method should be used, to include selection criteria, strengths and weaknesses of the method, and examples. <b>References</b> are <b>available</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request...</b>|$|R
40|$|Research Question: Our {{study is}} guided by the {{following}} research question: How can consumers contribute to place marketing strategies that promote the heritage of their local areas? We highlight the various ways that consumer involvement can support and enhance the marketing of local heritage. To do so, we use the context of "Adopt a Station" a community engagement scheme offered by First ScotRail who hold the rail franchise in Scotland, communities take part by adopting their local station. Adoptions are varied and include: bookshops, model railway clubs, community meeting rooms, art galleries, charity shops, toy libraries, small businesses and, most commonly, gardening activity. Method and Data: We used ethnographic techniques to enable a thorough appreciation of {{the uniqueness of the}} context. We conducted in depth research at a total of 19 stations across Scotland and recorded data through extensive field notes, photographic evidence, video capture of station visits and interviews with 100 participants. To support our understanding of the context, data gathering was enhanced by large-scale collection of archival material including books, press articles and newsletters. We followed a hermeneutic approach to interpretation. Data relating to each station was interpreted initially to a gain a comprehensive overview, these were then compared and common patterns identified. Summary of Findings: We focus on three themes: heritage and authenticity, consumer involvement and, individual and collective identity. Firstly, our findings reveal how heritage and authenticity are socially constructed by the local residents who play an active role in defining and informing heritage activities through their knowledge and interpretation of the past. The adoption projects are not simply about looking back but also creating future resources, fitting with Balmer’s (2011) tripartite temporal approach to heritage. Secondly, adopt a Station allows residents to contribute to a tourism agenda. Through the scheme, the railway station becomes a stage where important moments in the town’s history can be represented and heritage is brought outside the museum context to community places which residents pass through on a daily basis. Thirdly, participation in Adopt a Station supports the construction of individual and collective identity. On a personal level findings reveal a range of emotional and affective bonds that connect adopters to stations. At a collective level some of the towns and villages where station adoption is prominent have become vulnerable because of the decline of traditional industries. What Adopt a Station offers is a way to restore life to these communities and bring back a sense of pride in the local area. Key Contributions: Many place marketing strategies focus on consumption; by prioritizing heritage we offer a contrast to this dominant perspective and highlight how {{it can be used to}} retain a sense of uniqueness. Place marketing’s purpose of facilitating place identification for residents has often been overlooked with emphasis placed more on economic development. We also highlight how the link between heritage and local identity can contribute to a rediscovered sense of community. This brings attention back to the importance of geographic communities complimenting the more recent focus on brand and online communities (e. g. Kozinets, 1999; Muniz and O’Guinn, 2001). <b>References</b> are <b>available</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request...</b>|$|R
40|$|Today, {{consumers}} {{share their}} {{positive and negative}} experiences about products and services using social media sites and online platforms provided by companies. Electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) usually spreads through social networking sites (e. g., Facebook), and it affects how consumers make their decisions on what to buy or recommend within their network (Simonson and Rosen 2014). In particular, online reviews have been noted as providing useful information (Yin and Zhang 2014) not only for other customers but also for companies searching {{for new ways to}} attract their customers to visit their websites. This chapter aims to investigate the role of online reviews in social media in the services sector and offers implications for services firms. Two independent studies in a large emerging market of India were conducted to achieve the aim of this research. The first study consisted of two phases: in phase I, advantages and disadvantages of online reviews along with judgement criteria about online reviews were identified using data from a focus group with nine participants. In phase II, various factors that consumers consider before making their final decisions to book a hotel were identified through an online survey with 110 responses. The second study also utilized an online survey to collect the data from 223 respondents about the use of social media sites and online interviews on various travel aspects when planning and booking travel. The results of the first study suggest the increasing role of online reviews in India, in particular among young adults. The main advantages sought from online reviews were to search for up-to-date information and comparisons of previous customer experiences. Negative reviews did contribute to discouraging potential travelers using those sites to book their trips. The results of the second study indicate that females use social media more often than males when traveling (e. g., they might look for “things to do” while at their destination). Our study offers managerial guidelines for services companies. For instance, companies should tailor their websites to fulfill the needs of specific customer segments (e. g., female travelers). Future studies might investigate how companies can strategically respond to negative reviews and minimize their impact on consumer decision-making. <b>References</b> <b>available</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request...</b>|$|E
40|$|While {{extensive}} {{research has been}} carried out to explain the phenomenon of institutional isomorphism, less is known about the emergence of institutions across different structural fields such as the private versus the public sector. There is also limited research into examining desired outcomes of implementing certain practices within organizations, which is particularly pertinent as outcomes differ largely contingent upon the field. Our study contributes to the ongoing debate around institutional isomorphism by investigating how private sector practices can be adopted by the public sector. To be more precise, we investigate how effective Customer Relationship Management (CRM) practices from the private sector can be adopted by public sector bodies – in order to manage relationships with citizens – and how such an adoption is related to important outcomes such as citizen trust and identification, and, arguably most importantly, participation. 1. 240 citizens from a medium sized city were surveyed about their overall satisfaction, their trust and their identification with the city. We chose measures that had already been tested empirically. The main constructs included in the survey were overall citizen satisfaction with the council, satisfaction with council services, and council CRM initiatives, citizen trust, citizen identification, political participatory norms, interest in politics and perceptions of political efficacy. As expected, the results show that overall satisfaction with the council and its services predict citizens’ trust in local government. Trust itself is related to citizen identification with the city, which in turn leads to political participation. Moreover, the link between citizen identification and participation is moderated by the level of interest in politics. However, the impact of CRM practices, in this case technology enabled feedback and communication channels, on citizens’ trust in the council and identification with the city are rather inconsistent. This suggests that the implementation of such channels itself does not reinforce political participation. In the face of public and political pressure to adopt management practices from the private sector, local public sector organizations need to consider that the key to citizens’ political engagement may lie first and foremost in the creation of citizen trust and identification. This is achieved through the consistent delivery of reliable and positive public service experiences. The use of CRM practices may enhance such experiences, but is not in itself an end, but a means to an end. At the forefront of public service enhancement strategies needs to be the consideration of how to improve citizen satisfaction with the council through the content of the services provided. The question of how to deliver these services, in this case through technologically enabled channels, only comes secondary. <b>References</b> <b>available</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request...</b>|$|E
40|$|Materialism, {{which is}} the {{importance}} placed on the acquisition and possessions of material objects, is often depicted as a self-prioritizing trait rooted in an individualistic value (Belk 1985; Richins and Dawson 1992). Materialistic consumers are seen as self-centered individuals who prefer to build meaningful relationships with possessions rather than people (Burroughs and Rindfleisch 2002; Kasser and Ryan 1993). However, this theory is incongruent with the reality, as cultural studies routinely find that materialistic consumption manifests strongly among collectivistic Asian consumers (Cleveland and Chang 2009; Ger and Belk 1996). Such contradiction points to an inconsistency between the theories developed primarily in the United States and the realities surrounding non-Western consumers’ attitudes and behavior (Sharma 2010). The present research thus aims to reconcile theory and practice by reassessing the pertinence of self-centeredness as the central domain of materialism among Asian consumers. Extant literatures rarely recognize that individuals may dexterously commit to materialistic and collectivistic values. Rather, materialism is often depicted as opposite of collective values, such as religious commitment, moderation, and self-sacrifice (Bauer et al. 2012; Burroughs and Rindfleisch 2002). Hence, individuals who hold materialistic and collectivistic ideals experience value-conflict, defined as psychological tensions resulting from incongruent values that lead to diminished life satisfaction and reduced psychological welfare (Burroughs and Rindfleisch 2002; Kasser and Ryan 1993). However, cultural studies maintain that collectivist societies are more successful than their individualist counterparts in balancing personal goals and collective interests (Wong and Ahuvia 1998; Ahuvia 2002). Contrary to extant research’s prediction, materialism {{does not appear to}} have an adverse effect on well-being among Asian consumers. Instead, these consumers are catching up to those in advanced economies in terms of life satisfaction, which is fuelled largely by their satisfaction towards material well-being (Pew Research 2014). Therefore, consumers from non-Western and less developed countries may not simply emulate the principles of Western-based materialism (de Mooij and Hofstede 2002). As such, our research aims to address the following questions: 1. To what extent do consumers from collectivistic cultures experience personal conflict between material and collective values? 2. What impacts do the interaction between materialism and collective-oriented values have on Asian consumers’ consumption evaluation? We draw from optimal distinctiveness theory (Brewer 1991) to inform how Asian consumers use material consumption to fulfill social goals. This perspective provides an additional vantage point to the dominant collectivist cultural perspective that confounds Asian consumers’ prosocial attitudes towards consumption. Further, we explain how consumers with incongruent values evaluate the attractiveness of material goods to achieve socially desired goals. Our international research draws from a sample of Asian consumers from China, India, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The research design is twofold. First, we utilized Schwartz’s (1992) circumflex model of human values to examine the perceptual distances between materialism and the larger value system amongst collectivistic Asian consumers. Second, we studied the interaction effect between material and collective-oriented values on Asian consumers’ prepurchase evaluation. Our findings suggest that collectivist Asian consumers are able to balance materialistic and social pressures and as a result, evaluate the social cost of goods more favorably than other competing conspicuous attributes, such as brand and price information. <b>References</b> <b>available</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request...</b>|$|E
