25|$|According to Appian, in 60 BC Caesar {{came back}} from his {{governorship}} in Hispania (Spain and Portugal) and was awarded a triumph for his victories there. He was making preparations to celebrate this outside the city walls. He also {{wanted to be a}} candidate for the consulship for 59 BC. However, the candidates had to present themselves in the city and it was not legal for those who were preparing a triumph to enter the city and then go back out for these preparations. Since he was not <b>ready</b> <b>yet,</b> Caesar asked to be allowed to register in absentia and to have someone to act on his behalf, even though this was contrary to the law. Cato the Younger, who was against this, used up {{the last day of the}} presentation with speeches. Caesar dropped the triumph, entered the city and presented his candidacy. Pompey had failed to get the acts for his settlements he made in the east during the Third Mithridatic War ratified by the senate. Most senators opposed this because they were envious, particularly Lucius Licinius Lucullus who had been replaced in the command of this war by Pompey. Crassus had co-operated with Lucullus in this matter. An aggrieved Pompey ‘made friends with Caesar and promised under oath to support him for the consulship'. Caesar then brought Crassus into friendly relations with Pompey and ‘these three most powerful men pooled their interests.’ Appian also noted that Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a book about this alliance called Tricaranus (the three-headed monster). Appian's version and Plutarch's Life of Pompey are the only sources that have Pompey seeking an alliance with Caesar, rather than the other way round.|$|E

Seventeen seconds later, he reported that the left gun was ready. A few seconds later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's center gun room, reported to Ziegler over the turret's phone circuit that, [...] "We have a problem here. We are not <b>ready</b> <b>yet.</b> We have a problem here." [...] Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret's phone circuit, [...] "Left gun loaded, good job. Center gun is having a little trouble. We'll straighten that out." [...] Mortensen, monitoring Turret Two's phone circuit from his position in Turret One, heard Buch confirm that {{the left and right}} guns were loaded. Lawrence then called out, [...] "I'm not <b>ready</b> <b>yet!</b> I'm not ready yet!" [...] Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's leading petty officer suddenly called out, [...] "Mort! Mort! Mort!" [...] Ziegler shouted, [...] "Oh, my God! The powder is smoldering!" [...] At this time, Ziegler may have opened the door from the turret officer's booth {{in the rear of the}} turret into the center gun room and yelled at the crew to get the breech closed.

500|$|Although Beyoncé did {{not perform}} [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] in any {{televised}} appearances, the song was part of her set list on The Beyoncé Experience. On August 5, 2007, Beyoncé performed the song at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, where she directly started the song with the line: [...] "Stop, I ain’t <b>ready</b> <b>yet</b> — wait, let me fix my hair...". Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the performance, stating: [...] "Beyoncé needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes [...] ". Tonya Turner of The Courier-Mail reported that tracks like [...] "Freakum Dress", [...] "moved fans to screams of endearment". David Schmeichel of Jam! wrote that Beyoncé performed a [...] "ballsy" [...] version of the song.

500|$|The {{ensemble}} {{performances were}} frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques. Lowry cited the cast {{as one of the}} show's strongest assets, and Robert Biano in USA Today wrote that Fargo cast was [...] "with nary a false note". The Daily Telegraph critic Michael Hogan singled out Dunst, Danson and Wilson for their work on the show, as did the San Francisco Chronicle David Wiegand, whose opinion was that many of the performers' signature roles enhanced Hawley's script. Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine found Wilson to be the stand out among a pool of actors that [...] "deserve their own stand-alone appreciations". He said of the actor's performance: [...] "He's a young man, and he's in good shape, but he carries himself like an older, heavier one, as if weighed down by burdens he hasn't fully acknowledged because he's not <b>ready</b> <b>yet.</b> You get a sense of a personality, perhaps a soul, in the process of evolving." [...] Reviews from Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post singled out Donovan, Smart, Milioti, Garrett, and Offerman for their acting. Grantland, the New York Observer, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the ensemble performances.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{took more}} than two years to develop. Sierra {{officials}} said this was because it was so different from anything that had been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: [...] "It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do." [...] The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, Phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not <b>ready</b> <b>yet.</b>|$|E

This is the same term the insurance trade association, America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), is using.

2500|$|When Pu Tong Seal {{brought back}} the captive to Theizang, Pu Tong Seal's {{father-in-law}} thought that his son-in-law's action was detrimental to his people, and had great concern and fear that the Burmans would invade Theizang, which was situated nearby the Kalay valley.

2500|$|According to some Kabbalists, only a mystic, {{who is able}} {{to sense}} and elevate the reincarnated human souls and [...] "divine sparks", is {{permitted}} to consume meat, though eating the flesh of an animal might still cause spiritual damage to the soul. A number of Orthodox Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not <b>ready</b> <b>yet</b> to accept the vegetarian diet. Jewish law also commands people to ritually slaughter animals when killing them, and goes into precise detail on the rituals of both animal sacrifice and ordinary slaughter (shechita). According to medieval sage Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, author of the Torah commentary Kli Yakar, the complexity of these laws was intended to discourage the consumption of meat and make it less painful for the animals.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1974, Lunger piloted a BMW 3.0 CSL in the {{six hours}} of Watkins Glen and competed in a Trans Am race, {{sponsored}} by the Sports Car Club of America, with George Follmer. Lunger started 8th and ran as high as 4th in the Can-Am Challenge Trophy race. He developed engine problems with 4 laps to go. Lunger said, We're not <b>ready</b> <b>yet,</b> but we're getting there. Lunger won 2 heat races but crashed during the 1974 California Grand Prix at Ontario Motor Speedway. He was trying to pass a slower car {{and at the same}} time hold off eventual race winner, Mario Andretti. Lunger's Eagle Chevy collided with Mickey Rupp as they entered a turn at the end of the infield straight. Their cars spun in a cloud of dust [...] off the race track. Lunger assisted rescue workers in pulling Rupp from his car. Lunger and Follmer secured 2nd place in a turbocharged Porsche 935of Vasek Polak, in the 1977 six hours endurance race at Watkins Glen. They were more than 3.377 mile-lap behind the winning team of Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass.

2500|$|The {{cars were}} not ready until the 15th {{round of the}} IMSA GT Championship, which was the Road America 500, where two cars were entered by Zakspeed Roush; the 2.1-litre engines were not <b>ready</b> <b>yet,</b> so the team ran the 1.7-litre version of the BDA turbo instead. Tim Coconis and Klaus Ludwig drove one car, while Bobby Rahal and Geoff Brabham drove the other. The debut was a {{successful}} one; Coconis and Ludwig won the race by two laps, while Rahal and Brabham took third overall, and second in the GTP category. The Grand Prix of Pocono, however, {{would turn out to}} be very different, as Ludwig's car lasted just eight laps before retiring, and the Brabham-Ludwig car retired after 49 laps; this saw them classified 42nd and 35th overall, and eighth and tenth in class, respectively. The cracks in the program had already begun to show; Roush, annoyed that Ford had blocked their efforts to run a V8 engine in the car, pulled out of the project. As a result, there was just one Mustang GTP entered in the Daytona Finale, and that ran under the [...] "Team Zakspeed USA" [...] banner; Rahal and Ludwig retired after 53 laps, being classified in 49th overall, and 16th in the GTP category. Rahal, who had earlier raced for Holbert Racing, was classified in 14th in the GTP driver's championship, with 47 points; Ludwig was classified in 21st, while Coconis was level with David Hobbs in 31st, and Brabham was 38th.|$|E
