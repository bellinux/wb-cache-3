5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two hours, he escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan sent out a search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two chairs across a window was found in the jury <b>room</b> <b>just</b> after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought that the men had intended to hang Laura out of the window, but were deterred by an electric light burning nearby.|$|E

Lon apparently has no official title at the Gazette but occupies a <b>room</b> <b>just</b> {{two doors down}} from the publisher's corner office. Archie frequently asks Lon for background information on current or prospective clients, and returns those favors by providing Lon exclusives, and occasional photos, concerning Wolfe's cases. Lon {{is also one of}} Archie's poker-playing pals.|$|E
25|$|The disaffected Benga {{attempted}} to find relief by exploiting his employers' presentation {{of him as}} a 'savage'. He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises; when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor's wife, he pretended to misunderstand, instead hurling the chair across the <b>room,</b> <b>just</b> missing the woman's head. Meanwhile, Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum. He soon found another home for Benga.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{is remembered}} {{throughout}} the coaching realms as always being {{a student of}} football. Former Dallas Cowboys' head coach, Bill Parcells, once {{told the story of}} how Wood drove five hours each day for weeks just to watch his Texas Tech linebackers practice. Baylor's former head coach, Grant Teaff, said that Wood once spent the night in his film <b>room</b> <b>just</b> to ask how a particular play had been run. He had also been a major opponent to the “no pass, no play” laws of the early 1980s. Wood hardly lost any players after the laws had been passed.|$|E
50|$|In July 2014, Marriott Hotels {{opened a}} second two-hotel hybrid tower with 393 <b>rooms</b> <b>just</b> north across Olympic Boulevard with a Marriott Courtyard and a Residence Inn. The project was built using {{funds from the}} EB-5 visa program.|$|R

50|$|During {{all this}} time, {{the only people}} who knew that Holmes was alive were Moriarty's henchmen and Holmes's brother Mycroft. The only reason for this was that Sherlock needed some money to enable him to travel and to keep his <b>rooms</b> <b>just</b> as he had left them.|$|R
25|$|Darius Just had {{previously}} helped novice writer Giles Devore produce a breakthrough novel. Just credits himself with ruthlessly editing Devore's original drafts and forcing the young author to turn an incoherent mess into a masterwork. Having gained {{fame and fortune}} with his first book, a bestseller, Devore attends the ABA convention to promote his second book, which he wrote without Just's help. Just volunteers to run an errand for Devore – collecting a parcel for him and taking it to his hotel room – but he forgets to do so until the next day. Entering Devore's hotel <b>room,</b> <b>Just</b> discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having slipped in the shower and hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others take this to be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive tidiness and the disarray in which Just found the room. He interviews Devore's ex-wife, who tells him that the parcel contained Devore's monogrammed pens.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, May 3 around 8:50p.m. Virgil was {{relaxing}} {{in his chair}} in the sitting <b>room</b> <b>just</b> off {{of the kitchen and}} bedroom with a heating pad on his back. He was listening to his favorite radio program and reading the Friday, May 3 edition of the Texarkana Gazette when he was shot from a closed double window, which faced the highway, three feet behind him. He was shot {{in the back of the}} head by two slugs and died almost instantly. His funeral, which his recovering wife could not attend, was held the following Monday at his church at 2:30p.m. More than 500 people attended his funeral; more than 60 which were his and his wife's relatives. He was buried in Hillcrest cemetery on Highway 67 West; same cemetery as Paul Martin. He was survived by his wife, parents, sister (Mrs. Millard Boyce, Jr.), brother (Charlie), two nieces, and one nephew.|$|E
500|$|In the secondquarter, Kansas State took a 24–14 {{lead and}} Colt McCoy was injured {{and headed to}} the locker <b>room</b> <b>just</b> before halftime.

With about twominutes left in the game, McCoy again headed to the locker room early and Chiles led the Longhorns' last drive.|$|E
5000|$|By this time, {{the castle}} was desolate, and devoid of all infrastructure.

500|$|Destiny Jones was in {{the studio}} when they were {{recording}} [...] "Daughters". [...] "We were in a big studio so Destiny was doing other things", Nas later told Vibe. [...] "She {{walked into the room}} where I was recording it and heard a few words and said, ‘What’s going on?’ The whole <b>room</b> <b>just</b> started laughing and she kind of smiled and walked backwards out of the room. She didn’t know what it was about and she didn’t want to listen to it, but later on she heard the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Kirk Hammett {{commented on}} the lack of guitar solos on St. Anger, a {{departure}} from what Metallica had done in the past: [...] "We wanted to preserve the sound of all four of us in a <b>room</b> <b>just</b> jamming. We tried to put guitar solos on, but we kept on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought." [...] Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, [...] "We made a promise to ourselves that we'd only keep stuff that had integrity. We didn't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Jackson told Rabbi Shmuley: Shields was [...] "one of the loves of my life. I just {{wished she}} loved {{me as much as}} I loved her", and, they [...] "dated a lot." [...] Before meeting her, {{he said that he had}} {{pictures}} of her all over his room. He recalled his happiness when they first met in 1981. He was at the 53rd Academy Awards with Diana Ross, and Shields walked up and introduced herself; then at the after-party she asked him to dance with her. They exchanged numbers, and he [...] "was up all night, singing, spinning around my <b>room,</b> <b>just</b> so happy." [...] He also said, “We had one encounter when she got real intimate and I chickened out. And I shouldn’t have.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much obliged," [...] he said, briefly, to Ikey. [...] "The lazy Irish loafer! My own <b>room's</b> <b>just</b> above Rosy's.

6000|$|... "That is {{a capital}} idea," [...] she said. [...] "I was {{wondering}} what arrangements you could make {{for the next three}} weeks. It is ridiculous to pay three guineas a week for <b>rooms</b> <b>just</b> for you and Effie. The old gentleman only wants that for board and lodging together, for I asked him." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes it did, Miss La Creevy replied. The {{upper part}} of the house belonged to her, and as she had no {{necessity}} for the second-floor <b>rooms</b> <b>just</b> then, she was in the habit of letting them. Indeed, there was a lady from the country and her two children in them, at that present speaking.|$|R
500|$|In the 2003/2004 season, O'Sullivan reached three ranking-event finals. He {{reached the}} final of the British Open, but lost 6–9 against Stephen Hendry. He won the Welsh Open by {{defeating}} Steve Davis 9–8. He reached {{the final of}} the Masters, but lost 9–10 against Paul Hunter, despite having led 6–1 and then 9–7. In 2004, O'Sullivan's father telephoned six-time World Champion Ray Reardon, and asked if he could give O'Sullivan some advice. With Reardon's help O'Sullivan recovered his form, and won the 2004 World Championship. He defeated Hendry 17–4 in the semi–finals, the most one-sided defeat ever in a World Championship semi–final. He then defeated Graeme Dott 18–8 in the final, despite losing the first five frames. O'Sullivan blamed his poor start on [...] "mind games" [...] by Dott's coach Derek Hill, who visited O'Sullivan's dressing <b>room</b> <b>just</b> before the match. O'Sullivan was ranked number one for the next two seasons.|$|E
500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's <b>room</b> <b>just</b> so they can say that they saw me pee." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} <b>room,</b> <b>just</b> doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E
50|$|The men's and women's {{basketball}} {{offices are}} adjacent {{to their respective}} locker <b>rooms</b> <b>just</b> off the Hinkle floor, {{but they have been}} upgraded.

60|$|Mary Louise went to {{her room}} and was {{promptly}} pounced upon by Dorothy Knerr and Sue Finley, who <b>roomed</b> <b>just</b> across the hall from her and were delighted to find she was to become a regular boarder. They asked numerous questions as they helped her to unpack and settle her room, but accepted her conservative answers without comment.|$|R
60|$|The {{train was}} late getting into Chicago that Monday night. Colonel Hathaway took Mary Louise and Alora to the Blackington, but {{the hotel was}} so crowded that the girls could not get {{adjoining}} rooms. However, they secured <b>rooms</b> <b>just</b> {{across the hall from}} one another and the Colonel's room was but two doors removed from that of his granddaughter, so the three were not greatly separated.|$|R
500|$|The version {{used for}} the first test {{screening}} featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy which takes place after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon, but the test audiences disliked it. The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and featured Cal (falsely) offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] {{if he can get}} it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining <b>room.</b> <b>Just</b> as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the [...] "theft" [...] of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.|$|E
500|$|Among Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald {{dismisses the}} song as a [...] "forgettable twelve-bar", while Mark Hertsgaard terms it [...] "a slight blues boogie" [...] and {{considers}} that Harrison {{would have been}} better served on the album by the superior [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] and [...] "Let It Down". Walter Everett writes that the [...] "promise" [...] offered in Harrison's acoustic guitar introduction remains unfulfilled, such that the principal interest lies in [...] "Lennon's only lap-steel performance with the Beatles, one that seems both clumsy and polished at the same time". Ian Inglis welcomes the song's lightheartedness as evidence that, amid Harrison's usual preoccupation with spirituality and enlightenment, he was nevertheless able to produce [...] "an uncomplicated and enjoyable love song". Inglis concludes: [...] "Its directness, and his obvious enjoyment, reinforce the sincerity of his words." [...] Music journalist Kit O'Toole recognises [...] "For You Blue" [...] {{as an example of a}} Beatles B-side that was [...] "just as good, if not better" [...] than the single's lead side. While remarking on the contrast between the song's upbeat and optimistic qualities and the tense atmosphere within the band in January 1969, O'Toole likens the performance to [...] "the four sitting in a living <b>room,</b> <b>just</b> jamming for fun".|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing <b>room,</b> <b>just</b> draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
50|$|The {{second of}} seven children, {{he was the}} son of Thomas Byrne, an engineer, and Fanny Dowman.

6000|$|... "His {{account of}} himself is that he's 'only a little artist-man.' That {{seemed to me}} {{perfectly}} to describe him. But he's yet in the phase of study; this, you know, is the great art-school--to pass {{a certain number of}} years in which he came over. And he's a great friend of Chad's, and occupying Chad's <b>rooms</b> <b>just</b> now because they're so pleasant. HE'S very pleasant and curious too," [...] Strether added--"though he's not from Boston." ...|$|R
50|$|More than 75 years later, UVA {{opened its}} first {{hospital}} in March 1901 with 25 beds and three operating <b>rooms.</b> <b>Just</b> as medical {{education has been}} a part of UVA since its founding, so too has medical literature - the 8,000 books purchased by Jefferson to create the University Library included 710 books on the medical sciences. UVA’s medical literature moved to the UVA Medical School building in 1929. Its current home was dedicated in April 1976.|$|R
