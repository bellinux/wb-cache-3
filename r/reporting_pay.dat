40|$|When it {{was passed}} in 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sought to address the “evils” of underpay and {{overwork}} by establishing an hourly minimum wage and requiring premium overtime pay. However, today 2 ̆ 7 s low‐wage, hourly workers more often face underwork than overwork, as well as fluctuating, unstable schedules, neither of which is addressed by the FLSA. This paper presents and assesses the effectiveness of an alternative approach to wage and hour regulation, the “reporting pay” guarantee. We begin by examining the problem of work‐hour insecurity, particularly employers’ practice of sending workers home early from scheduled shifts. We then move to a detailed assessment of state laws that require <b>reporting</b> <b>pay,</b> as well as <b>reporting</b> <b>pay</b> guarantees in union contracts and private‐employer practices that attempt {{to address the problem}} of work‐hour insecurity. We conclude by considering paths for strengthening such protections in law...|$|E

The main idea is to show that Kazakhstan as a developing country aims to cooperate with foreign countries to reach a new level of economic development. For this cooperation {{it will be necessary to}} use the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to be transparent to other countries. To fulfil this goal it will be explored legal regulation of the accounting system, methods of using national and international financial reporting standards by companies.

40|$|Based on {{government}} survey data that were analyzed, {{this study found}} that there are several major differences in the salary trends of computing professionals. Up through 1999, every group was <b>reporting</b> <b>pay</b> increments. Since 2000, some salaries were shown to have decreased or were increasing at a nominal rate across the board. Some job categories were more resistant than others, but overall, almost every category was affected by the economic downturn. However, when the data set was segmented by gender, the findings showed that the recession effects were very different. In some areas, male salaries continued to increase at rates that were comparable to those before the recession while female salaries for the same jobs suffered a decrease. The salary gap showed some recoveries after that. However, female salaries continued to lag behind more during {{the latter part of}} the recession period. Put another way, the evidences showed that the pay gap or inequity gap had a tendency to widen during a recessionary period as well as beyond...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{estimate}} out-of-pocket {{medical expenses}} {{to women and}} families for maternity care {{at all levels of}} the health system in Burkina Faso, Kenya and Tanzania. Methods In a population-based survey in 2003, 6345 women who had given birth in the previous 24 months were interviewed about the costs incurred during childbirth. Three years later, in 2006, an additional 8302 women with recent deliveries were interviewed in the same districts to explore their maternity care-seeking experiences and associated costs. Findings The majority of women interviewed <b>reported</b> <b>paying</b> out-of-pocket costs for facility-based deliveries. Out-of-pocket costs were highest in Kenya (a mean of US$ 18. 4 for normal and complicated deliveries), where 98 % of women who delivered in a health facility had to pay some fees. In Burkina Faso, 92 % of women <b>reported</b> <b>paying</b> some fees (mean of US$ 7. 9). Costs were lowest in Tanzania, where 91 % of women <b>reported</b> <b>paying</b> some fees (mean of US$ 5. 1). In all three countries, women in the poorest wealth quintile did not pay significantly less for maternity costs than the wealthiest women.

50|$|Accepting bribes is {{a common}} form of street police {{corruption}} in Croatia. According to the International Victim Crimes Survey, 15 out of 100 respondents <b>reported</b> <b>paying</b> a bribe within the last year- 44% of which were paid to police officers. This frequency is higher than most other East-European countries, with respondents suggesting that police in Croatia are targeted more frequently for successful bribes compared to other countries in East-Europe.
