40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the classification of exchange <b>rate</b> regimes, this paper finds no support for the popular bipolar view that countries will tend over time {{to move to the}} polar extremes of free float or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of exchange <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively flexible exchange <b>rate</b> regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility.

An exchange <b>rate</b> policy is captured by the de facto exchange <b>rate</b> regime and the real exchange <b>rate</b> misalignment. The main findings are: (1) real exchange <b>rate</b> overvaluation significantly increases sovereign bond issue probability and raises bond spreads; (2) spreads {{and the likelihood of}} issuing bonds depend on the exchange <b>rate</b> regime; (3) exchange <b>rate</b> misalignment under a hard peg significantly increases bond spreads; (4) in time of debt crises, exchange <b>rate</b> policy also greatly affects the sovereign bond market, especially through exchange <b>rate</b> overvaluation.

It also considers the determinants of the REER {{in connection with the}} choice of exchange regime after unification. The study illustrates how economic policy variables and exogenous shocks affect the real exchange <b>rate</b> primarily through the fiscal balance, and consequently, the savings-investment gap. It further illustrates that the appropriate level of REER and its medium-term path depend upon the mix of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies that underpin the evolution of inflation, balance of payments, and productivity growth.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, Tunisia has {{experienced}} a strong economic performance while pursuing a constant real exchange <b>rate</b> rule (CRERR). The limitations of this rule are now beginning to emerge {{in the context of a}} more open economy, regional integration, a more market-based monetary policy, and the desire to relax capital controls. This paper explores how Tunisia avoided the pitfalls of real exchange <b>rate</b> targeting as predicted by the theoretical models.

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{creating}} a new currency union is setting the <b>rates</b> to convert national currencies into the new union currency. Planned unions in the Gulf region and Africa are seeking methods to set the conversion <b>rates</b> when their new currencies are created. We propose a forward-looking econometric methodology to determine conversion <b>rates</b> by calculating the degree of misalignment in the real exchange <b>rate,</b> {{and apply it to}} the GCC currency union. For each GCC currency, we identify the year at which the economy is the closest to its internal and external equilibrium, and then estimate the degree of misalignment in the bilateral real exchange <b>rate</b> vis-Ã -vis the U. S. dollar based on WEO forecasts until 2013. Application of the methodology to other regions is also considered.

40|$|We assess {{monetary}} regime options for Latin American countries. The {{costs of a}} common currency are likely to outweigh its benefits, as those countries face diverse economic shocks, do not trade much with each other, and are affected by common international financial shocks only {{to the same extent}} as the average pair of emerging markets. Unilateral dollarization would be desirable only for those countries where there are strong links to the U. S. economy, the credibility of the monetary authorities is irreversibly lost, and there is keen demand for dollar-denominated financial assets. Finally, some countries in the region seem to be good candidates for meaningful and useful floating.
