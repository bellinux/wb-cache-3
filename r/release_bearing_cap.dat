50|$|The first Chevrolet {{engine to}} use 4-bolt mains was the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. Chrysler and Ford {{employed}} Y-blocks, {{meaning that the}} block skirts extended below the centreline of the crankshaft. The main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> could then be fixed with an additional cross-bolt, which was a horizontal bolt going into or through the main <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R

50|$|A 4-bolt main {{refers to}} the number of bolts {{attaching}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> to the block of an internal combustion engine. Four bolt mains are considered much stronger for high performance use than a 2 bolt main. Using 4 bolts to secure the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reduces the amount of flex within the crankshaft as compared to 2 bolts.|$|R

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> from each side.|$|R
5000|$|Testing of the 406, {{with its}} higher power levels, led to cross-bolted mains [...] - [...] that is, main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> that were secured {{not only by}} bolts at each end coming up from beneath, but also by bolts {{coming in from the}} sides through the block. A custom fit spacer was used between the cap and the block face. This design {{prevented}} the main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> from [...] "walking" [...] under extreme racing conditions, and can be found today in many of the most powerful and modern engines from many manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|When {{used in the}} {{passenger}} cars both versions of the KA24 used a crankshaft girdle, as opposed to individual main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> In the Nissan Hardbody and Frontier applications a crank girdle was not used.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} can {{be inserted}} into an assembled crankcase, {{rather than the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> being assembled around it. This is usually done by rotating the crankcase end-upwards and then lowering the crankshaft vertically into it.|$|R
50|$|Franklin {{founded the}} H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company in 1893. The company {{specialized}} in machine die casting and made small parts such as gears and <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> It {{was the first}} {{company in the world}} in that enterprise.|$|R
50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as push type or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the <b>release</b> <b>bearing,</b> pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).|$|R

50|$|On 9 October 2009, the CAA {{issued a}} press release {{requesting}} the public's assistance in finding a <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> {{from one of the}} engines. The cap, which possibly separated from the engine during takeoff, could not be found at the crash site or at the airport.|$|R

50|$|Hubstacks are {{bearings}} {{added to}} the hub (the outside) of a yo-yo and covered with some form of side cap to allow the yo-yo body to be held while it spins. With the side <b>cap</b> <b>bearing,</b> the operator can hold the yo-yo in many different planes and perform different styles of tricks which are difficult (or impossible in some cases) to be performed with conventional yo-yos. These configurations may be called hubstacks, <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> synergy caps, or jimmy hats.|$|R

50|$|The DOHC {{cylinder}} head had 16 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminium.

40|$|Our study {{deals with}} the {{detection}} and the diagnosis of spalling in rolling bearings. Our idea is to show the correlation which exists between the outside temperature of the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> and the vibratory level generated by increasing appearance of the defect. We led an experimental study on the test ring which allows the creation in a progressive way, of spalling defect on the external ring of the rolling bearing. On this test rig, we measure simultaneously the mechanical vibration in radial direction (by means of a piezoelectric accelerometer) and the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> external surface temperature (by means of an infrared camera). The results exhibit a significant correlation between both measures.

50|$|Cross-bolting has two advantages: it couples the {{two sides}} of the {{crankcase}} together, making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting. Secondly it helps to hold the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> down against the downward force from the piston. This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts, as the dowel effect of a through bolt is less effective.|$|R
50|$|The blocks are all {{strongly}} {{made using}} cast iron with large interconnected main bearing cradles and two bolt main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> Forged steel crankshafts, and cast iron main bearing support girdles became standard with the 3VZ-FE. Piston and ring construction are typical parts, with rods varying between large and very large for stock V6 production engines.|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} practice, the {{crankshaft}} and {{connecting rod big end}} bearings {{in a modern}} automobile engine are made of a replaceable steel shell, keyed to the <b>bearing</b> <b>caps.</b> The inner surface of the steel shell is plated with a coating of bronze which is in turn coated with a thin layer of Babbitt metal as the bearing surface.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{utilized}} a water-cooled aluminum block. The main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> {{were made}} of cast iron and held in place with two bolts each. The cylinder block bores had interference fit cast iron liners for the piston rings to sit against. The engine block was made from 319.1 aluminum alloy and the liners were made from D5506 ductile iron.|$|R

Fatigue life analysis {{is based on}} the <b>release</b> <b>bearing</b> rings or rolling body began to appear fatigue spalling, in which this kind of phenomenon is under cyclic stress. The contact stress distribution is not uniform, the contact stress is mainly concentrated near the surface; influenced by the geometry and physical properties and lubrication of the surface significantly. Contact between the two types of fatigue crack extension methods: fatigue crack surface under expansion and surface fatigue crack propagation. The surface crack growth mainly originated from two kinds of cases: crack caused by surface pre crack and contact between the two surface asperity each other.

5000|$|Tensile {{forces are}} {{taken on the}} studs, not the {{cylinder}} block or crankcase. In particular, the force is a pure tension, rather than a twisting force owing to any offset between the <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> and cylinder wall bolt. This permits the block and crankcase to be made lighter and less stiff, whilst still {{reducing the amount of}} deflection and twist exhibited in service.|$|R
5000|$|The Crossflow {{featured}} {{a change in}} combustion chamber design, using a Heron type combustion chamber {{in the top of}} the piston rather than in the head. The head itself was flat with each engine capacity (1098 cc and 1298 cc) featuring different pistons with different sized bowls in 681F and 701M blocks. The 1599 cc 691M block had the stronger 'square' <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> later used in the 711M, and small combustion chambers in the near-flat head (the bulk of the volume being in the piston bowl). In 1970, the new A711 block for 1298 cc and A711M block for 1599 cc were introduced with thicker block wall, square main <b>bearing</b> <b>caps,</b> large diameter cam followers and wider cam lobes, with the latter block having a 7/16" [...] taller deck height, together with a return to the flat head. These changes represented a significant improvement in the reliability of the engines, and the blocks are commonly referred to as '711M' blocks.|$|R
