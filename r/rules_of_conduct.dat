5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> {{to be applied}} to particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct,</b> it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E

5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that the greater rights afforded to Muslims in the Ottoman Empire {{motivated}} Christians to convert to Islam. However, {{the extent to which}} Muslims were privileged is often overestimated. The primary discrimination faced by non-Muslims was of a legal nature, as Christians and Jews were not allowed to file lawsuits or testify against Muslims in court. There were also <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> imposed upon them, but there were many to whom these rules did not apply. Though {{much has been made of}} the fact that Christian and Jewish subjects of the sultan paid a poll tax from which Muslims were exempt, Muslims were also faced with the religious zakat tax, whereas Catholics made donations to their church only on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|More than 85 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 5,000 lynchings in the post-Civil War period occurred in the Southern states. With economic strains across the Deep South and a low price for cotton, 1892 was a peak year when 161 African Americans were lynched. The passage of Jim Crow laws, beginning in the 1890s, completed the revival of white supremacy in the South. Terror and lynching {{were believed to be}} used to enforce both these formal laws and a variety of unwritten <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> meant to assert white domination. In most years from 1889 to 1923, 50 to 100 lynchings occurred annually across the South. They were at a peak in {{the last decade of the}} 19th century, but remained high for years.|$|E

She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions.

By the time they were transferred from these detention centers to Banjica, some of the prisoners would already have displayed signs of serious mutilation. Throughout the camp's operation, guards would regularly beat and mistreat prisoners. The camp was notorious for its brutality and executions were frequent and random. Inmates were expected to follow the standard <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> that were implemented in other German camps. These rules prohibited singing, speaking loudly, having conversations on political subjects, possessing writing utensils and paper, and all other personal belongings. The infraction of any of these rules would result in execution. Despite this, imprisoned anti-fascists defied the Germans by singing Partisan songs, shouting their support for Tito and Stalin, and by holding lectures, discussions, one-act plays, recitals, and even folk-song and dance performances on the campgrounds.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{tradition}} in the law of not advertising for legal services, the Model <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Professional <b>Conduct</b> {{as well as the}} Arkansas <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Professional <b>Conduct</b> recognize that the interest in expanding public information about legal services trump that tradition. However, {{that is not the case}} in many states where, in some cases, lawyers have been advised to avoid certain types of interactive websites or risk what has been dubbed a 2 ̆ 2 one-click ethics violation. 2 ̆ 2 This article seeks to explain how attorneys can use social networking sites without violating any <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>conduct.</b> Additionally, the article proposes a modification <b>of</b> the current <b>rule</b> structure so that attorneys no longer have to choose between avoiding emerging methods of communicating or risking a violation <b>of</b> the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Professional <b>Conduct.</b> The article begins with an overview of the usage of and terminology relating to the two most popular social networking sites, Facebook and Twitter. Next, the article provides an overview <b>of</b> the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Professional <b>Conduct</b> that Relate to lawyer communication. Then, the article categorizes various types of interactions on social networking sites under the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Professional <b>Conduct,</b> and subsequently addresses various issues that can arise in the context of the use of social media for client development. Finally, the article suggests some general principles that could be considered in revising the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Professional <b>Conduct</b> to consider social networking sites. The article concludes that rules relating to advertising should be reconsidered with the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>rules,</b> assisting the public in obtaining legal services, in mind. Ultimately, the author proposes that the rules should be revised to either target specifically the communications that are deceptive, or to more broadly ban deceptive or overbearing communications...|$|R
