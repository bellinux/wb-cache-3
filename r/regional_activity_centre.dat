40|$|Which are the {{possible}} scenarios that await the Mediterranean by 2025 ? This question characterizes the Plan Bleu synthesis report {{developed in the}} framework of the Pegaso project – funded by the 7 thFramework Programme of the European Union and devoted to Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. As one of the <b>Regional</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centres</b> of the United Nations Environment Programme’s Mediterranean Action Plan (UNEP/MAP) and as an observatory of the environment and development in the Mediterranean, Plan Bleu carried out various prospective studies to identify the threats and opportunities that arise in relation to sustainable development in the region, and {{the possible}} policy responses that might be needed. Plan Bleu developed recently a transversal analysis, synthetizing several relevant prospective studies at the Mediterranean level. Starting from the “business as usual” and alternative scenarios offered by those studies, this synthesis develops a cross-cutting approach between different dimensions of change (demographic trends, climate change, globalization) and topics (water, energy, coastal development, urbanization, tourism, maritime transportation). It also takes into account recent events and changes (i. e. global economic crisis, Arab Spring, institutional reforms) whose impacts on the future political trends could not be ignored. On the one hand the synthesis gathers a critical collection of scenarios for the Mediterranean, as outlined by a range of recent prospective studies. On the other hand, taking into account seeds of change and inflections of current trends, the reflection raises the crucial perspective towards a new regional prospective study at the 2050 horizon...|$|R

40|$|Since 2000 Coastal Area Management Programmes (CAMPs) {{supported}} by UNEP Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) and the Priority Actions Programme <b>Regional</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centre</b> (PAP/RAC) have been engaging local communities in {{assessment of their}} coastal sustainability. The Methods used since 2000 have been based upon an evolving methodology which is now called Imagine. In 2010 The CAMP Levante de Almeria began. “Imagine {{the future of our}} coast” is the slogan selected for this project which is intended to turn this area of southern Spain into a sustainability laboratory. The CAMP Levante de Almeria project is a test and a practical demonstration of how to implement Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) concepts in Spain in compliance with the ICZM Protocol (the seventh protocol in the framework of the Barcelona Convention). CAMP acts technically, environmentally and socially as a means to design and implement new practices, relating these to vertical and horizontal coordination between local and regional administration and public participation in decision-making processes related to the coastal zone. The fundamental objective of the project is to achieve wide scale agreement on the sustainable development of the coast. Drawing upon the history of the various CAMP projects, this paper explores progress made so far in the application of the Imagine methodology in CAMP Levante de Almeria and, by contrasting it with summary observations emerging from earlier Imagine applications in Malta, Lebanon, Algeria, Slovenia and Cyprus draws conclusions on the value of engaging coastal communities in sustainability self-assessment. ...|$|E
40|$|National audienceThe Mediterranean Sea {{is known}} as a {{biodiversity}} hot spot in terms of species, {{as well as at the}} ecosystem level with varied and rich benthic habitats. If this high biological diversity can be mainly explained by environmental conditions (interface between tropical an temperate regions, hydrology, climate, habitat heterogeneity), the historical factors also played a major role (remnant of the Tethys Ocean, Messinian crisis, Atlantic Ocean connection, opening of the Suez Canal). The diversity of Mediterranean benthic habitats is the basis of biological diversity. Among these habitats, seagrass meadows and coralligenous assemblages appear as key habitats, and have been taken into account in two action plans of the <b>Regional</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centre</b> for Specially Protected Area and Biodiversity (UNEP, MAP, RAC/SPA). If the extension of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean basin has been estimated at 30, 000 to 40, 000 km 2, with considerable amounts of data concerning the location of main meadows, there are important gaps in knowledge concerning the composition and distribution of coralligenous assemblages and maërl beds. Data concerning coralligenous assemblages are sparse and most of the information is based on data obtained in the northwestern Mediterranean, with some data additionally available in southern Italy and the Alboran Sea. The northern Adriatic constitutes a particular biogeographical sector due to its northern location, superficial depth, and important nutrient discharges from rivers. Extensive seagrass meadows, composed of four of the five species present in the Mediterranean basin, have been observed in this region; the lack of rocky substrate and the high sedimentation, however, seem to be unable to support extensive coralligenous assemblages...|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The relentless {{increase in}} both human activities and exploitation of marine resources {{is a threat}} to marine habitats and species. 2. For marine systems, several protection initiatives have been outlined over the past decade to signiﬁcantly reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional, and national levels, and to establish representative networks of marine protected areas with the aim of protecting 10 - 30 % of marine habitats. 3. Reliable estimates of the total area occupied by each habitat are crucial to set adequate protection initiatives. Habitat mapping requires a sound habitat classiﬁcation. Many classiﬁcation schemes have been developed in different areas of the world, sometimes based on questionable criteria. 4. A critical analysis of the most recent marine habitat classiﬁcation list produced for the Mediterranean Sea from the <b>Regional</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centre</b> for Specially Protected Areas (RAC/SPA) showed that (i) 39 % of habitats and associated species considered in the list are scarcely covered by scientiﬁc knowledge from Web-based resources; (ii) 62 % of the species/genera included in the list are primary producers; (iii) quantitative information about the geographical distribution of selected habitats and associated species is scant; and (iv) when available, information is largely unbalanced and biased towards the shallow western Mediterranean Sea. 5. Improved inventories of marine habitats are needed to support accurate and consistent mapping activities. The combination of large-scale mapping and sound habitat classiﬁcations will allow better estimates of biodiversity distribution, to reverse regional/global habitat loss rates through the achievement of conservation targets and deadlines that, for the moment, are systematically not met...|$|E
40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{conservation}} biology is recognizing and {{bridging the gap}} between scientific results and specific action. We examine sea turtles—charismatic yet endangered flagship species—in the Mediterranean, a sea with historically high levels of exploitation and 22 coastal nations. We take sea turtle rescue facilities as a visible measure for implemented conservation action. Our study yielded 34 confirmed sea turtle rescue centers, 8 first-aid stations, and 7 informal rescue institutions currently in operation. Juxtaposing these facilities to known sea turtle distribution and threat hotspots reveals a clear disconnect. Only 14 of the 22 coastal countries had centers, with clear gaps in the Middle East and Africa. Moreover, the information flow between centers is apparently limited. The populations of the two species nesting in the Mediterranean, the loggerhead Caretta caretta and the green turtle Chelonia mydas, are far below historical levels and face a range of anthropogenic threats at sea and on land. Sea turtle rescue centers are acknowledged to reduce mortality in bycatch hotspots, provide a wealth of scientific data, and raise public awareness. The proposal for a Mediterranean-wide rescue network as published by the <b>Regional</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centre</b> for Specially Protected Areas a decade ago has not materialized in its envisioned scope. We discuss the efficiency, gaps, and needs for a rescue network and call for establishing additional rescue centers and an accompanying common online database to connect existing centers. This would provide better information on the number and types of rescue facilities on a Mediterranean scale, improve communication between these facilities, enhance standardization of procedures, yield large-scale data {{on the number of}} treated turtles and their injuries, and thus provide valuable input for targeted conservation measures...|$|E
40|$|More than 60 marine {{non-indigenous}} species (NIS) {{have been}} removed from previous lists and 84 species have been added, bringing the total to 986 alien species in the Mediterranean [775 in the eastern Mediterranean (EMED), 249 in the central Mediterranean (CMED), 190 in the Adriatic Sea (ADRIA) and 308 in the western Mediterranean (WMED) ]. There were 48 new entries since 2011 which can be interpreted as approximately one new entry every two weeks. The number of alien species continues to increase, by 2 - 3 species per year for macrophytes, molluscs and polychaetes, 3 - 4 species per year for crustaceans, and 6 species per year for fish. The dominant group among alien species is molluscs (with 215 species), followed by crustaceans (159) and polychaetes (132). Macrophytes are the leading group of NIS in the ADRIA and the WMED, reaching 26 - 30 % of all aliens, whereas in the EMED they barely constitute 10 % of the introductions. In the EMED, molluscs are the most species-rich group, followed by crustaceans, fish and polychaetes. More than half (54 %) of the marine alien species in the Mediterranean were probably introduced by corridors (mainly Suez). Shipping is blamed directly for the introduction of only 12 species, whereas it is assumed to be the most likely pathway of introduction (via ballasts or fouling) of another 300 species. For approximately 100 species shipping is a probable pathway along with the Suez Canal and/or aquaculture. Approximately 20 species have been introduced with certainty via aquaculture, while > 50 species (mostly macroalgae), occurring in the vicinity of oyster farms, are assumed to be introduced accidentally as contaminants of imported species. A total of 18 species are assumed to have been introduced by the aquarium trade. Lessepsian species decline westwards, while the reverse pattern is evident for ship-mediated species and for those introduced with aquaculture. There is an increasing trend in new introductions via the Suez Canal and via shipping. The research leading to these results was partly supported by funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme ([FP 7 / 2007 - 2013]) under grant agreement n° 287600 - PERSEUS project (Policy-oriented marine Environmental Research for the Southern European Seas).
