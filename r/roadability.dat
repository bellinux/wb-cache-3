25|$|Along with Nash, the new Hudsons had {{the widest}} front {{seats in the}} industry. The Weather Eye heating and {{ventilation}} with an optional air conditioning system were highly rated in terms of efficiency. The integrated placement of major air conditioning systems under the hood {{and the price of}} only $395 (about half the cost as on other cars) also won praise. Automotive journalist Floyd Clymer rated the Hudson Hornet as the safest car built in the United States because of (1) the single unit welded body, (2) high quality braking system with added mechanical backup system, (3) <b>roadability,</b> general handling, and maneuverability; as well as (4) excellent acceleration and power for emergency situations.|$|E
2500|$|The 1934 to 1936 Chrysler Imperial {{ushered in}} the 'Airflow' design, {{reflecting}} an interest in streamlining. The car was marketed with the slogan [...] "The car of tomorrow is here today." [...] It featured eight passenger seating and again an eight-cylinder engine. This was the first car to be designed in a wind tunnel. Initial tests indicated that the standard car of the 1920s worked best in the wind-tunnel when pointed backwards with the curved rear deck facing forward. This led to a rethinking of the fundamental design of Chrysler's line of cars. The Airflow was an exceptionally modern and advanced car, and an unparalleled engineering success. Both engine and passenger compartment were moved forward, giving better balance, ride and <b>roadability.</b> An early form of unibody construction was employed, making them extremely strong. This {{was one of the}} first vehicles with fender skirts.|$|E
5000|$|Road Test {{magazine}} said in 1954 that [...] "on <b>roadability</b> {{and responsive}} handling, the Met shines. It also offers easy maintenance and downright stinginess {{when it comes}} to gasoline consumption. Also, it's literally a brute for punishment. On several occasions I took familiar corners at speeds half again what I would dare to use in some cars of twice the weightproof that proper weight distribution, low center of gravity and well engineered suspension {{have more to do with}} <b>roadability</b> than massiveness, weight and long wheelbases. Admittedly, the short wheelbased Met does pitch moderately on very rough roads, but the sensitivity and ease of steering make driving a pleasure." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 1973 Chevrolets {{featured}} a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required 5 mph impact protection. New taillights were {{mounted in the}} (still) conventional rear bumper. The convertible was moved upmarket to the Caprice Classic series. Tweaks to the suspension and frame gave better <b>roadability,</b> according to Chevrolet general manager John Z. DeLorean. Steering wheels and instrument panels were color-keyed to interior colors, {{as opposed to the}} matte black used in 1971-1972. The steering wheel rim got a soft-feel grip, and replaced the [...] "Impala" [...] badge with generic [...] "Chevrolet." [...] The inline six-cylinder engine was now offered on the Bel Air 4-door sedan only, and only with the 3-speed manual transmission. Interiors had repositioned front seats for more legroom. The Impala name returned for the Kingswood station wagon. Suspension and chassis design was modified for better <b>roadability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Performance was 0 - 60 mph (0 - 96 km/h) in {{less than}} nine seconds and {{a top speed of}} 120 mph (192 km/h). <b>Roadability</b> and {{handling}} were highly praised by contemporaneous reviews, and sales were excellent despite high list prices. Its sales of 17,930 units, nearly three times the previous Eldorado high, helped give Cadillac its best year ever.|$|E
50|$|While {{retaining}} {{a conventional}} rear-wheel drive platform, the Fairmont was efficiently packaged and offered excellent passenger and cargo room for its size. Contemporary reviews uniformly praised the Fairmont {{and it was}} favorably compared with contemporary Volvo and BMW models. Rack-and-pinion steering gave the Fairmont much better handling and <b>roadability</b> than its Maverick predecessor and despite its roomier interior, lightweight components were used which gave the Fairmont better fuel economy than the Maverick.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} for the November 1985 edition of Collectible Automobile Magazine, noted {{automotive}} historian Richard Langworth stated his opinion that [...] "The Excellence is a large vehicle...better suited as a car of State rather than a daily driver." [...] How he came to this conclusion despite the unanimously positive reviews regarding the <b>roadability</b> of the Excellence from the contemporary motoring press {{as well as its}} owners, has been a matter of debate ever since.|$|E
50|$|Designer Eugene Bordinat {{envisioned a}} {{low-cost}} sports car that would combine <b>roadability,</b> performance, and appearance in a radical layout. Ford designer Philip T. Clark {{had been working}} on the low-slung Mustang design in varied forms for years. Bordinat coordinated the development of the styling and oversaw the first drawings into a clay model in three weeks. A 90 in wheelbase, 48 in front and a 49 in rear track were the working dimensions. The body skin was a one-piece unit that was riveted to a space frame. To increase rigidity, the seats were part of the body. The driver could adjust the steering column and clutch/brake/accelerator pedals.|$|E

5000|$|... 1973 Impalas {{featured}} a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required 5 mph impact protection. The chassis was tweaked for better <b>roadability,</b> and new square taillights were {{mounted in the}} carry-over rear bumper. With the convertible now moved to the top-line Caprice Classic series, (continuing through 1975) Impalas were now all closed body styles {{for the first time}} in the nameplate's history and the station wagon known as the Kingswood since 1969 rejoined the Impala series. A 145-horsepower 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 engine, Turbo Hydramatic transmission, variable ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were standard on all Impalas. Optional engines in all models included a 175-horsepower 350 Turbo Fire V8 with four-barrel carburetor and 245-horsepower 454 Turbo Jet V8; while the Impala Custom coupe, Sport Sedan and station wagons could be ordered with the 165-horsepower 400 Turbo Fire V8 that was standard on that year's Caprice Classic series. All engines were offered nationwide in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The Henry J {{had been}} its namesake's pet project, {{the result of}} both Kaiser and Frazer's desire to provide an {{affordable}} car to the average working man. It was also {{the basis for a}} $44 million loan from the federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in 1948, with the condition that the car was to go to market no later than the summer of 1950. Its chassis, at 100 in, had been sectioned from the company's 1951 sedan which, while conventional, had proved a sound design. Moreover, the 1951 sedan had a low center of gravity and, with an uncommonly good ride, rivaled the Hudson step-down models as among the best-handling cars of its class. Contemporary testers of the Henry J such as Tom McCahill of Mechanix Illustrated and Floyd Clymer of Popular Mechanics had pointed out the car's poor quality of assembly but praised the Henry J's performance. Automotive writer Aaron Severson, in his article [...] "Dressed to Kill: The 1954 Kaiser Darrin," [...] called the Henry J's <b>roadability</b> an [...] "agreeable blend of ride comfort and maneuverability" [...] and its engine [...] "sprightly, if not particularly fast." ...|$|E

Because of {{the high cost of}} providing chassis and the increasing government concerns over the safety and <b>roadability,</b> ocean carriers have provided notice to their customers that they will no longer provide chassis in the U. S. While change in the short term is difficult, a change in ownership may improve safety, supply chain productivity and equipment utilization among other operating variables.

30|$|In low-density uncongested flow, crashes at basic segment {{are found}} to be {{significantly}} associated with geometric variation (ICF and ISD), traffic density along with ambient light, speed coupled with pavement, and vertical variation h. Geometric variation is the 1 st component, as great variation may result in frequent speed reduction. Accordingly, the difficulty for drivers to control vehicle behaviors increases. At low traffic density k, driverâ€™s attention is not high, and some discretionary behaviors may be operated. Such condition combining with the poor ambient light is possible to increase crash risk. Meanwhile, due to the reduced value of tire-pavement friction, high speed v combining with wet pavement can reduce the <b>roadability.</b> In such cases, k and v are two separate components, which can further demonstrate that both variables are not highly interrelated at low flow rate. In addition, vertical variation h has a positive loading because of the increased visibility restriction and the difficulty in maintaining vehicle behaviors for drivers.|$|E
40|$|Major {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} children care little for social studies as a school subject. Therefore, a closer look was taken at social studies textbooks in order to ascertain if the reading difficulty of the texts was an import 4 nt cause behind the children's dislike. This study evaluated the reading levels of bi social studies texts adopted {{by the state of}} vlorida for grades 1 through 6. The interest level of the material, any teacher-provided motivation, and methods of instruction were ignored. At the primary level, the Spache Readability Formula and the Readability Graph were used. For the intermediate-level books, the Dale-Chall Formula for Predicting Readability, the Direct Grade Equivalent Table for the Dale-Chan Formula, the Flesch <b>Roadability</b> Formula, and the Fry Readability Graph were applied. It was found that all u 1 texts had reading levels at or above the grade level for which they were intended and that. 5 of the 128 readability levels obtained were above the designated grade level.
