In 1658 a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles {{described}} in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things, but argued that he had only been <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> asked of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E

When he informed Bittaker of this incident, they both agreed to act together on all future abductions.|$|E
500|$|... "The Truth" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} solely by Prince. The singer also provided all instrumentation for the recording, while musician HM Buff handled the track's engineering. Described as an acoustic rock and folk song, Prince provides vocals which {{are reminiscent of}} Tracy Chapman's works. Lyrically, the single portrays Prince <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> regarding [...] "responsibility and honesty", in addition to him announcing that [...] "there is no more 'truth'" [...] left. Furthermore, he expresses themes of salvation, spirituality, and sexuality, and also reveals that anyone can be in [...] "control over one's own creativity".|$|E

The show also presented Craig Reucassel from The Chaser, <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> and claiming that the comedians were [...] "hardly sorry" [...] for their actions.

500|$|Although {{the suit}} he filed was rejected, the case {{garnered}} international media attention. <b>Responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> about Chen’s allegation, {{a senior official}} with the National Population and Family Planning Commission told the Washington Post {{that the practice of}} forced abortions and sterilizations was “definitely illegal,” and indicated that the complaints were being investigated. “If the Linyi complaints are true, or even partly true, it's because local officials do not understand the new demands of the Chinese leadership regarding family planning work,” said the official. In September 2005, [...] the Commission announced that several Linyi officials had been detained. But local authorities in Linyi retaliated against Chen, placing him under house arrest in September 2005 and embarking on a campaign to undermine his reputation; the Linyi officials portrayed him as working for [...] "foreign anti-China forces", pointing out that he had received foreign funding for his advocacy on behalf of the disabled.|$|E
500|$|Forced {{to cancel}} Pink Floyd's {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, {{as well as several}} other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused {{to come out of the}} car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime [...] "See Emily Play" [...] on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued, reaching a crisis point in December, when the band responded by adding a new member to their line-up.|$|E

500|$|Filmmakers, {{crew members}} and co-stars {{tend to agree}} that Pfeiffer is {{extremely}} [...] "committed" [...] to her work, developing a [...] "reputation for competence, control, and hyper-preparation". At times Pfeiffer {{has been described as}} difficult to work with, particularly by Robert Towne, who directed her in Tequila Sunrise; Towne famously dubbed Pfeiffer [...] "the most difficult actress in Hollywood". On this designation, Pfeiffer admitted that she can seem difficult at times but it mostly [...] "depends on whom you talk to." [...] Famous for being very [...] "press-shy" [...] and private, much like the characters she portrays on-screen, Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking interviews. In a 2017 interview with Interview magazine, the actress warned her interviewer, director Darren Aronofsky, that she is [...] "the worst interviewee that ever was"; her interviews often feature discussions about how much she dislikes being interviewed because the process makes her nervous. Pfeiffer revealed that {{there was a time when}} attending interviews to promote her films would make her very agitated and uncomfortable, but she has always [...] "mastered the art" [...] of maintaining a composed, polite demeanor when performing such responsibilities. However, she maintains that [...] "I still don't believe – and I never will – that it's the actors' responsibility to sell a film." [...] The actress resembles an [...] "intense conversationalist" [...] in her interviews, tending to scrunch her face and narrow her eyes before <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>questions.</b> Pfeiffer always discards old scripts in which she has written extensive notes about her characters, nor does she retain film reviews, magazine clippings or covers about her work or performances.|$|E
