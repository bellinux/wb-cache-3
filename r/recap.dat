40|$|Background: <b>Recapping</b> laminoplasty {{has become}} the frequently-used {{approach}} to the spinal canal when bone decompression of the vertebral canal is not the goal. However, what changes will occur after surgery, and whether <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty can actually {{reduce the risk of}} delayed deformities remains unknown. Methodology: We designed an animal experiment using a caprine model, and partitioned the animals into in vitro and in vivo surgical groups. We performed <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty on one group and laminectomy on another group. These animals were sacrificed six months after operating, cervical spines removed, biomechanically tested, and these data were compared to determine whether the <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty technique leads to subsequent differences in range of motion. Image data were also obtained before the surgery and when the animals were killed. Besides, we investigated the initial differences in kinetics between <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty and laminectomy. We did this by comparing data obtained from biomechanical testing of in vitro-performed <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty and laminectomy. Finally, we investigated the effect that longitudinal distance has on cervical mechanics. This was determined by performing a two-level <b>recapping</b> laminoplasty, and then extending the laminoplasty to the next level and repeating the mechanical testing at each step. Principal Findings: There were three mainly morphological changes at the six months after laminoplasty: volume reduction and bone nonunion of the <b>recapping</b> laminae, irregular fibrosis formation around the facet joints and re-implanted lamina...|$|R

50|$|In the English dubs {{of various}} episodic anime series that suffer editing for time or {{censorship}} reasons, <b>recaps</b> are sometimes extended or introduced where they didn't exist originally, to cover any shortfalls in running time. Some examples where this occurs are Robotech, the FUNimation English dub of Dragon Ball Z, and the 4Kids English-language version of One Piece. The original Japanese version of One Piece {{did not always}} have <b>recaps,</b> though many episodes did have <b>recaps</b> as the first scene following the opening credits.|$|R

5|$|Kristin Lemmerman of CNN {{said that}} it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the {{beginning}} contained too much <b>recap</b> to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.' Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A-, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a nightmare factory for young readers.|$|E

It features 13 pieces of theme music performed by Yuria, Miyuki Hashimoto, and the respective voice actors for the five heroines of Shuffle!. It was released across seven region 2 DVD compilation volumes in Japan.|$|E

If the extended epilogue is unlocked, it is revealed that Yuuya survived being poisoned long enough to receive an antidote, and the game's closing lines imply that with Shuu's cooperation, a cure for the Charon virus has been developed.|$|E
5|$|A Very Gaga Thanksgiving {{initially}} {{aired on}} November 24, 2011 in the United States on ABC. It attained 5.749 million viewers and garnered a 1.8/5 rating in the 18–49 demographic {{in its first}} hour. Gaga's special aired simultaneously with the reruns of The Simpsons on FOX, Person of Interest on CBS, and The Secret Circle on The CW. In its second hour, total viewership and ratings slightly declined to 5.388 million viewers and a 1.6/5 ratings in the 18–49 demographic, despite airing simultaneously with a <b>recap</b> of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC and a rerun of The Mentalist on CBS. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving failed to beat other Thanksgiving specials in the ratings, including A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving had the highest rating in the 18–49 demographic in its time slot, and total viewership increased by 23% (1.3 million viewers) from its predecessor, singer Beyoncé's 2009 concert, I Am... World Tour. It subsequently gave ABC its best ratings in four years for its respective time slot on Thanksgiving Day.|$|E

5|$|On April 27, 2007, ADV Films {{co-founder and}} {{executive}} Matt Greenfield announced {{the acquisition of}} both the anime series and the film during a panel at the anime convention Anime Matsuri; it paid $145,000 for the TV series. The 12 main episodes and two Air in Summer episodes were licensed for North American distribution by ADV Films. The episodes were released on four DVD compilations between August 14 and November 27, 2007. The second DVD volume was sold in two editions, with {{the difference between the}} two being a series box all four DVDs could fit inside. In July 2008, the license for the anime series and film was transferred to Funimation, which continued to produce them in North America in English. Funimation released a three-disc series box set of the Air anime on April 21, 2009, which did not include the <b>recap</b> episode.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, NBC Sports {{held the}} {{broadcast}} rights {{to both the}} Olympics and Paralympics in 2012. NBC had been frequently criticised in past years by American athletes and IPC officials for its minimal coverage of past Paralympics, and it was speculated by critics that NBC's history of inadequate coverage may have impacted New York City's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. In 2008, it did not air any coverage while the Games were in progress (neither live or delayed), choosing to air a <b>recap</b> documentary on NBC in November 2008, followed by a week of highlights on Universal Sports. While relatively larger than its Beijing coverage, NBC produced only five-and-a-half hours of specials featuring tape delayed highlights of the Games; most of them aired on pay-TV channel NBCSN, while the last aired on NBC a week following {{the conclusion of the}} Games. No coverage of the opening and closing ceremonies, nor any live coverage, was provided. By contrast, some broadcasters (such as the host broadcasters, and broadcasters in Australia and Spain) planned to air at least 100 hours or more of coverage from London, and NBC itself had provided extensive coverage of the London Olympics, which was heavily viewed.|$|E
5|$|A 25-episode anime {{television}} {{adaptation of}} the game, produced by AIC A.S.T.A. and directed by Seiji Kishi, aired on MBS between October 6, 2011 and March 29, 2012. An additional 26th episode, featuring the story's true ending, was released in the 10th volume of Persona 4 on August 22, 2013. The series features most of the returning cast from the video game, whilst voice recordings for Igor {{were taken from the}} game as his actor, Isamu Tanonaka, died in January 2010. Aniplex released the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc between November 23, 2011 and August 22, 2012, with the first volume containing a director's cut of the first episode and a bonus CD single. Sentai Filmworks licensed the series in North America, simulcasting it on Anime Network as it aired and releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray in two collective volumes on September 18, 2012 and January 15, 2013 respectively. Like the Japanese version, the English dub retains many of the original voice actors from the English version of the game, although the Blu-ray Disc release omits the Japanese audio option. Kazé and Manga Entertainment released the series in the United Kingdom in three BD/DVD combi boxsets released between December 24, 2012 and July 22, 2013. A film <b>recap</b> of the series, titled Persona 4 The Animation -The Factor of Hope-, was released in Japanese theaters on June 9, 2012, featuring a condensed version of the story and new scenes of animation. A second anime adaptation based on Persona 4 Golden, titled Persona 4: The Golden Animation, is being produced by A-1 Pictures and began airing on MBS' Animeism block in July 2014.|$|E
