5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma <b>Risk</b> <b>Group</b> (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E

A probability matrix is also defined to specify contact rates between individuals form the same and different <b>risk</b> <b>groups.</b> The method converts the data form each scale into network forms and combines them by overlaying and computing their intersection. We apply this method to reconstruct networks of HIV infected patients in central Italy, including mixing between <b>risk</b> <b>groups.</b> Our results suggests that bisexual behavior among Italian MSM and IDU partnership are relatively important in heterosexual transmission of HIV in central Italy...|$|R

Myeloproliferative CMML (>13x109 monocytes/L) has a reduced survival compared with myelodysplastic CMML. A platelet count of <100 x109/L reduces overall survival. A haemoglobin level of <10g/dL has a reduced overall survival. Some cytogenetic abnormalities have implications on the prognosis of CMML. Normal karyotypes or the single loss of the Y chromosome have low risk prognoses.

25|$|Although {{research}} {{has suggested that}} {{it is very difficult to}} eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their target <b>risk</b> <b>group.</b> First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, there was almost no difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.|$|E
25|$|In RTOG {{clinical}} trial 0129, {{in which all}} patients with advanced disease received radiation and chemotherapy, a retrospective analysis (recursive-partitioning analysis, or RPA) at three years identified three risk groups for survival (low, intermediate, and high) based on HPV status, smoking, T stage and N stage (see Ang et al., Fig. 2). HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate <b>risk</b> <b>group,</b> with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low <b>risk</b> <b>group.</b> 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of disease progression and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with disease progression in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced disease progression (23 v. 40%), the median time to disease progression following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional. HPV+ did not reduce the rate of metastases (about 45% of patients experiencing progression), which are predominantly to the lungs (70%), although some studies have reported a lower rate. with 3-year distant recurrence rates of about 10% for patients treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation. Even if recurrence or metastases occur, HPV positivity still confers an advantage.|$|E

25|$|Sporoidiobolus salmonicolor is a yeast-like fungus in the Basidiomycota more {{commonly}} {{known by the}} name of its asexual yeast-like state, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. It is generally considered a Biosafety <b>Risk</b> <b>Group</b> 1 fungus; however isolates of S.salmonicolor have been recovered from cerebrospinal fluid, infected skin, a nasal polyp, lymphadenitis and a case of endophthalmitis. It has also been reported in AIDS-related infections. The fungus exists predominantly in the asexual state as a unicellular, haploid yeast yet this species can sometimes produce a sexual state when conjugation of compatible yeast cells occurs. The asexual form consists of a characteristic, pink, ballistosporic yeast. Ballistoconidia are borne from slender extensions of the cell known as sterigma, and are forcibly ejected into the air upon maturity. Levels of airborne yeast cells peak during the night and are abundant in areas of decaying leaves and grains. Three varieties of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor have been described; S.salmonicolor var. albus, S.salmonicolor var. fischerii, and S.salmonicolor var. salmoneus.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of another modality of treatment {{is referred to}} as adjuvant (literally helping) therapy, compared to its use as the initial (primary) therapy, also referred to as radical therapy. Consequently, many of these patients have been treated with adjuvant radiation, with or without chemotherapy. In the above series of reports of minimally invasive surgery, many (30–80%) patients received adjuvant radiation. However, functional outcomes were worse if radiation was added to surgery and worst if both radiation and chemotherapy were used. Radiation dosage has largely followed that derived for all head and neck cancers, in this setting, based on risk. Historically only one randomised clinical trial has addressed optimal dosage, allocated patients to two dosage levels, stratified by risk, but showed no difference in cancer control between the low and high doses (63 and 68.4Gy), but a higher incidence of complications at the higher doses. Consequently, the lower dose of 57.6Gy was recommended. Because the authors used a fractionation scheme of 1.8Gy per treatment, this dosage was not widely adopted, practitioners preferring a larger fraction of 2Gy to produce a shorter treatment time, and a slightly higher dose of 60Gy in 2Gy fractions (30 daily treatments). Yet 57.6Gy in 1.8Gy fractions is equivalent (iso-effective dose) to only 56Gy in 2Gy fractions. 60Gy corresponds to the 63Gy used as the low dose in the high <b>risk</b> <b>group.</b> 60Gy was also the dose used in RTOG 73-03. Subsequently, there was a tendency to intensify treatment in head and neck cancer, and a number of centres adopted a dose of 66Gy, at least for those patients with adverse tumour features. The effectiveness of PORT in HPV+OPC receives some support from a cohort study (Level 2b), although the number of patients was low, and the number of events (recurrent disease or death) only 7%. Another retrospective population-level study (Level 4) of the SEER database (1998–2011) concluded that there was an overall survival but not disease-specific survival effect of radiation in 410 patients with a single lymph node involved, but used only univariate statistical analysis and contained no information on HPV status. A subsequent much larger study on a similar population in the National Cancer Database (2004–2013) of over 9,000 patients found a survival advantage but this was only in HPV-OPC, not in 410 HPV+OPC patients.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Outcome {{prediction}} {{for patients}} with renal cell carcinoma {{is based on a}} combination of factors. In this study a previously published clinical outcome algorithm based on 1997 T stage, Fuhrman grade and performance score is validated using an international database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1, 060 patients from Nijmegen, the Netherlands (NN), MD Anderson (MDA) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) who had localized renal cell carcinoma were evaluated for outcome prediction using a clinical outcome algorithm previously shown to stratify patients into low, intermediate and high <b>risk</b> <b>groups.</b> Validation was performed by comparing the 3 <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> separately within the 3 centers as well as by comparing hazard ratios and concordance indices among the 3 centers. RESULTS: Estimated disease specific survival rates at 5 years for the low <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> were 94 % (NN), 92 % (MDA) and 93 % (UCLA). The 5 -year disease specific survival rates for the intermediate <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> were 65 % (NN), 73 % (MDA) and 78 % (UCLA), while the rates for the high <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> were 40 % (NN), 30 % (MDA) and 48 % (UCLA). The concordance indices for each of the databases were 79 % (NN), 86 % (MDA) and 84 % (UCLA). CONCLUSIONS: A clinical algorithm that uses only 3 prognostic variables (1997 T stage, Fuhrman grade and performance status) to stratify patients with localized renal cell carcinoma into 3 <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> {{has been shown to be}} applicable to external databases.
