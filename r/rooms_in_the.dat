5|$|An oratory, {{originally}} {{fitted to}} the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained glass windows. Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011. Other <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle include Lady Margaret Bute's Bedroom, the servants' hall and the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Despite the limitations, Robinett {{was able}} to {{introduce}} concepts {{that at the time}} were unfamiliar to players. He had been able to construct different <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> games (thirty in the final version), in days where most games took place only on a single screen. Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E

5|$|From 11 to 14 February 1945, the Yalta Conference {{took place}} in the neighbouring, former {{imperial}} Livadia Palace; this was between representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill and part}} of his British delegation were given temporary residence within the Vorontsov Palace. Within two weeks, construction workers had restored 22 <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main palace, 23 <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shuvalov wing, and even replanted the palace gardens. The palace's English-inspired architectural style gained praise from Churchill himself: Churchill was so taken by the garden's Medici lions that he later asked Stalin if he could take them home; Stalin declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Ilse Pröhl, {{a fellow}} student at the university, met Hess in April 1920 when they by chance rented <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same {{boarding}} house. They married on 20 December 1927 and their son Wolf Rüdiger Hess was born ten years later, in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, the Diocese of Chichester {{selected}} {{an area of}} open land on {{the west}} side of Ditchling Road as the site of their Training College for Anglican Schoolmistresses, which had outgrown its premises in Black Lion Street in the old town. Viaduct Road was built in front of the Gothic Revival building's south façade around the same time, and was built up with terraced houses by the early 1860s. In the early 20th century, the Diocese bought three of the four villas nearby and converted them into accommodation for trainee schoolteachers. Before that, the trainee teachers slept in large <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Training College.|$|E
5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state suite {{include the}} Red Room— so called because its walls {{are covered in}} red brocade— a large drawing room {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.|$|E
5|$|The Checkers, is a {{restaurant}} with rooms in Montgomery, Powys, Wales. Historically, the building {{was used as a}} coaching inn dating from the 17th century. Until the 2000s, it was used as a pub/hotel. It was converted into a French restaurant in 2012 and under chef Stephane Borie, it was awarded a Michelin star later that year. There are two main <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> restaurant, and three hotel rooms. It has received a mixed reception from critics, who have praised particular dishes but criticised the atmosphere. It serves both modern and classic French dishes, and in 2016, switched to only using set menus.|$|E

5|$|The Salvation Army has meeting <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town, whilst {{the local}} Methodists, who {{previously}} worshipped {{in their own}} Chapel in Paul Street (built in 1810; {{it is now a}} community centre), have an agreement to share the parish church with the Anglican congregation. The Baptist Chapel in Commercial Road was built in 1801 as a Congregational Church. There were previously a number of other non-conformist chapels in Shepton, the most notable of which is the Unitarian Chapel on Cowl Street which was built in 1692 and enlarged in 1758; it is now a private dwelling.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament Building {{is open to}} {{visitors}} all year round. On non-sitting days, normally Mondays, Fridays and weekends as well as during parliamentary recess periods, visitors are able to view the Main Hall {{of the building and}} can access the public galleries of the debating chamber and main committee rooms. Guided tours are also available on non-sitting days and these allow visitors access {{to the floor of the}} chamber, the Garden Lobby, Queensberry House and committee <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company of a parliamentary guide. On sitting days, members of the public must purchase tickets for the public galleries of both the chamber and committee rooms.|$|E
5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} fireplaces have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back fireplaces, but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two <b>rooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attic complete with modern fittings. The first floor and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and two bedrooms in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E
