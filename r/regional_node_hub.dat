Though the initial response was good, local recurrence and metastasis to <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> and generalised dissemination was not uncommon. Radiation therapy to <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> and concomitant chemotherapy are suggested to prevent metastasis in <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> and generalised dissemination.

40|$|International audienceAbstract—In {{this paper}} we study the {{influence}} of using <b>hub</b> <b>nodes</b> to relay messages in human-based delay tolerant networks (DTNs), by analyzing empirical traces obtained by human mobility monitoring experiments. Four traces known in literature have been considered. We exploit a measure of centrality (or betweenness) over underlying graphs associated to temporal networks, {{in order to establish}} (in probability) the ability to forward information using a restricted number of active relay <b>nodes</b> (<b>hubs).</b> The proposed analyses are carried out by introducing time-dependent networks associated to real traces. The empirical cumulative distribution of the node betweenness and the shortest paths length (or geodetic) are derived and characterized. The analysis shows that the geodetic path length follows a lognormal (skewed) distribution. It is also observed that the measures of betweenness on the nodes, if ordered decreasingly and interpreted as probability distribution, exhibit an exponential-like decay, with very high betweenness for few nodes and much lower for all the others. Based on this knowledge, we study the probability of successful delivery when a set of nodes with low betweenness are deactivated as forwarding nodes. Under these assumptions, we give the probability that a k-length path connecting an arbitrary sourcedestination pair belong to the set of the activated <b>hub</b> <b>nodes.</b> The results show how a trade-off can be found between the number of relay <b>nodes</b> (<b>hubs)</b> activated in a temporal network and the network's delivery rate, when message forwarding is allowed only for these hubs...|$|R

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{protocol for}} the management of primary cutaneous melanoma was initiated at the University of Illinois in October 1968 and continued through June 1974. Over this period 269 cases were treated: 42 {{of the head and neck}} region, 75 of the trunk, 94 of the lower extremities and 58 of the upper exremities. The levels of invasion ranged from II to V, according to Clark's classification; level I melanomas were excluded. The status of the <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> was correlated with the level of invasion. Preliminary exploratory celiotomies were performed on all patients with lower extremity melanomas and on all those with level IV or V melanoma with clinically positive <b>regional</b> <b>nodes.</b> All patients were treated with wide excision and elective <b>regional</b> <b>node</b> dissection except those in whom celiotomy showed disseminated disease. Of the 150 patients now eligible for five-year analysis, 33 had level II disease, three with positive nodes. None had local recurrence or intra-abdominal metastasis. All 33 (100 %) were cancer-free at five years. Of 56 with level III, 23 had positive <b>regional</b> <b>nodes,</b> two had local recurrence within two years, and two with melanoma of the lower extremities had intra-abdominal metastases. At five years 53 (95 %) of the 56 were cancer-free.

The finding that thoracic duct cells, which are almost exclusively lymphocytes, were just as effective as leucocytes or <b>regional</b> <b>nodes</b> in transferring sensitivity in rats formally identifies the cell type responsible for transferring sensitivity in the various tissues tested.
