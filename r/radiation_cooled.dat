40|$|AbstractAt most {{locations}} {{with sufficient}} solar resources for a viable exploitation of {{solar power plants}} water is too precious to be wasted in cooling towers. However, application of air cooling increases the levelized cost of electricity up to 16 %. An alternative for air <b>cooling</b> is <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling.</b> A new function {{is given to the}} parabolic trough mirror, which is the realization of optical contact between a radiating plane and the sky. The sky is cold, therefore the radiating plane cools down. This cooling is available day and night and can supply most of the cooling power that is needed for the condenser of the Rankine cycle. When there is wind, the radiating plane also dissipates heat. <b>Radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> and wind are sufficient for cooling the solar thermal power plant. Storage of cold in a water basin is an essential component, because wind <b>cooling</b> and <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> are more effective at night, when the air temperature is low. Pumping the cold night-air through heat exchangers in the basin is an alternative when wind speeds are generally low. An additional function is given to the water basin, namely the support of a floating parabolic mirror field. A field of floating parabolic trough mirrors that are stationary with respect to each other rotates collectively around a vertical axis in order to follow the sun. We expect that this simple concept will lead to a substantial cost reduction, in spite of the less favorable average angular orientation of the mirrors. Floating parabolic trough fields are most suited for applying <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> in solar power plants...|$|R

40|$|Among many {{physical}} {{processes involved in}} star formation, radiation transfer {{is one of the}} key processes since it dominantly controls the thermodynamics. Because metallicities control opacities, they are one of the important environmental parameters which affect star formation processes. In this work, I investigate protostellar collapse in solar-metallicity and low-metallicity (Z = 0. 1 Z_) environments using 3 D radiation hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Because <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> is more effective in the low-metallicity environments, first cores are colder and have lower entropies. As a result, first cores are smaller, less massive and have shorter lifetimes in the low-metallicity clouds. Therefore, first cores would be less likely to be found in low-metallicity star forming clouds. This also implies that first cores tend to be more gravitationally unstable and susceptible to fragmentation. The evolution and structure of protostellar cores formed after the second collapse weakly depend on metallicities in the spherical and magnetized models despite the large difference in the metallicities. Because this is due to the change of the heat capacity by dissociation and ionization of hydrogen, it is a general consequence of the second collapse as long as the effects of <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> are not very large during the second collapse. On the other hand, the effects of different metallicities are more significant in the rotating models without magnetic fields, because they evolve slower than other models and therefore more affected by <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R

40|$|Current-day {{space vehicle}} are {{equipped}} with a passive Thermal Protection System (TPS), but these systems operate {{at the edge of}} their capabilities. The research into the next generation reusable space vehicle demands the use of active TPS, these systems are not limited to the capabilities of the used material but depend on the active cooling mechanism. A system of cooled metallic TPS is developed at the TU Delft resulting in an increase in the maximum allowable thermal load for a given TPS temperature, this system is the enhanced <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> TPS. The research question is: "Can an active thermal protection system improve the flying characteristics and the flight performance of a re-entry vehicle?". The first step in answering this question is to verify the process behind the active TPS. This thesis aims to design an experiment to verify this process. To answer the research question two tools were developed: a flight simulator and a thermodynamic analyser. The flight simulator provides insight in the behaviour of the rocket and shows the consequences of implementing the enhanced <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> TPS on the rocket. The thermodynamic analyser is used to estimate the wall temperature of the system and shows the effect of the sensitivity analysis of the design of the cooling subsystem. The enhanced <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> system is designed to be mounted on the T-Minus Dart and an experiment to verify the impact of the active TPS is derived using the nominal mission of the rocket. Sensitivity analysis resulted in thin outer shell and a insulation sphere filled with the coolant. The outer shell needs to be as thin as possible in order to maximize the cooling effect. For an outer shell of 0. 5 millimetres, the maximum allowable thermal load can be doubled in comparison with an non-cooled flight. If an identical thermal loading is assumed for two return vehicles, the active cooled vehicle can be designed with a nose radius of around 30 % smaller that the non-cooled vehicle. This will result in a vehicle with a higher lift-over-drag ratio, extending the return trajectory which increases the safety of the re-entry flight. The validity of performing an enhanced <b>radiation</b> <b>cooling</b> experiment is shown by the use of the tools developed in this thesis. The incoming heat flux can be doubled while maintaining the same wall temperatures if the cooling system is applied. This opens the possibility of redesigning re-entry vehicles to achieve a high lift-to-drag ratio...|$|R
