40|$|Normally, plant {{phenolics}} are secondary metabolites {{involved in}} the defense mechanisms of plants against fungal pathogens. Therefore, {{in this study we}} attempted to quantify and characterize phenolic compounds in leaves of white and <b>red</b> horse <b>chestnut</b> with leaf miner larvae before and after Cameraria ohridella attack. A total of 17 phenolic compounds belonging to the hydroxycinnamic acid, flavan- 3 -ols and flavonol groups were identified and quantified in white and <b>red</b> horse <b>chestnut</b> leaf extracts. Significantly decreased concentrations of some phenolic compounds, especially of flavan- 3 -ols, were observed in infected leaves compared to the non-infected ones. Additionally, a higher content of polyphenolic compounds especially (−) -epicatechin and procyanidins in leaves of red-flowering than in white-flowering horse chestnut may explain their greater resistance to C. ohridella insects...|$|R

Monette rode the horse to the grocery store {{regularly}} and rode back home with both hands full of groceries. In 1939, Old Dan was exhibited at a small show in Tennessee and was seen by Colonel J. L. Haynes. Haynes soon bought the horse and at the age of twelve years, had him registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association as Haynes Peacock. Haynes Peacock, ridden by Haynes, won World Grand Championships at the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration in the years 1940 and 1941, making him the first repeat champion. He died several years later and was buried on Haynes' farm, Haynes Haven, in the horse cemetery.|$|E

50|$|In {{its final}} years, the school left its {{historical}} house system {{in favour of}} a year-based system. The house system involved students being sorted into one of five houses (all named after hills located in West Sussex; Amberley, Bignor, Chantry, Highdown and Rackham). In contrast to this, a reorganisation in 2004 saw students being sorted into one of three 'learning teams' (all named after species of trees; Larch (<b>Red),</b> <b>Chestnut</b> (Yellow) and Sycamore (Blue), (the initials subsequently spelling 'LCS')). The main difference in the latter system was the establishment of five 'Head of Year' posts. The school's uniform {{at the time of}} closure was strongly based on the learning teams system, with students wearing sweatshirts and polo shirts in their own team colour (Larch - Red; Chestnut - Yellow; Sycamore - Blue). In addition to this, all students were required to wear smart black trousers and shoes. The school made use of the 'learning teams' in the annual Athletics Morning which was held {{on the final day of}} each academic year, where the respective teams from all five years groups joined together to compete.|$|E

50|$|In 1945, she and {{her husband}} bought Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, a former {{thoroughbred}} breeding and stud farm. As her older half-sister, Isabel who owned Brookmeade Stable, Frances Dodge also became interested in horse racing and breeding. Castleton was to become a standardbred breeding farm as successful as any worldwide. Together, the Johnsons won the Hambletonian in 1948 with homebred Hoot Mon, and again with Victory Song. Their <b>red</b> <b>chestnut</b> pacing star, Ensign Hanover, won the Little Brown Jug in 1949. It is believed that Ensign Hanover is the first horse to have ever flown in an airplane, when he flew, crosstied in the aisle of a DC - 3 cargo plane from Indiana to New York where he won a stake race at Roosevelt Raceway (the idea was put forth by famed aviator Wiley Post.) On September 27, 1940 Mrs. Johnson set the record for trotting under saddle, riding Greyhound, completing a mile in 2:01.3/4 at Lexington, Kentucky's famous Red Mile. This record stood for 54 years, until broken by Moni Maker, a trotter bred by Mrs. van Lennep's daughter, Fredericka Caldwell.|$|E
50|$|Daughter of Geicha the First, {{lord of the}} Wyrmberg, {{and leader}} of the dragonriders. An archetypal fantasy barbarian woman, she has <b>red</b> <b>chestnut</b> hair, is curvaceous and wears almost nothing except for a chainmail harness. Liessa's ambitions are high: having {{poisoned}} her father, the traditional means of succession in her family, she is hindered by the fact that as a woman, she cannot become lord of the Wyrmberg and faces intense rivalry from her two brothers. There is however a loophole: by marrying a man who would then become lord of the Wyrmberg through allegiance, she could act as the real power behind the throne. When she forments this plan, Rincewind, Twoflower and Hrun the Barbarian are passing close to her mountain country. Liessa is interested in Hrun, for as a strong but slow-witted warrior, she could use him to defeat her brothers and then place him as a puppet lord. Having kidnapped Hrun and Twoflower (for whom she expresses no interest and has locked away), she tests Hrun by trying to stab him in his sleep. Hrun grabs her wrist and almost breaks it. Convinced of the fellow barbarian's agility, she tells him that he may marry her if he defeats her brothers. Hrun accepts and succeeds in carrying out her orders, but refuses to definitely kill her siblings. Liessa agrees to banishing them instead and tells Hrun tenderly (calling him by name for the first time) that she did not expect such mercy from him. It seems at that point that Liessa is developing genuine feelings for her husband-to-be. But Liessa still has one more trial in store for him: she strips till she is naked, so as to see how much passion he truly has for her. Before the couple can embark onto anything intimate however, Hrun is snatched away by Rincewind and Twoflower riding Twoflower's dragon Ninereeds. In desperation, Liessa summons her own dragon to pursue them (still naked, as Pratchett makes a point of). Ninereeds nearly outruns her but vanishes when Twoflower loses consciousness, causing everyone riding him to fall. Liessa abandons Rincewind and Twoflower to their fate and catches Hrun on her dragon, and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E
