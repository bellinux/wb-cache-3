5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pair of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, {{which was published in}} 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E

25|$|Economic input–output LCA (EIOLCA) {{involves}} use of aggregate sector-level data on {{how much}} environmental impact {{can be attributed to}} each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors. Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages {{that may or may not}} be representative of the specific subset of the sector <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated.|$|E
25|$|Research on beer-commercial content by Lance Strate yielded results <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{study of}} masculinity. In beer commercials, {{masculine}} behavior (especially risk-taking) is encouraged. Commercials often focus on {{situations in which}} a man overcomes an obstacle in a group, working or playing hard (construction or farm workers or cowboys). Those involving play have central themes of mastery (of nature or each other), risk and adventure: fishing, camping, playing sports or socializing in bars. There is usually an element of danger and a focus on movement and speed (watching fast cars or driving fast). The bar is a setting for the measurement of masculinity in skills such as billiards, strength, and drinking ability.|$|E

25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for {{electrical engineers}} are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, {{and the ability to}} understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.|$|E
25|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on the}} sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E
25|$|As was {{indicated}} in the ex parte Fewings case, considerations that are <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant considerations (that is, considerations that the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that {{must be taken into}} account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). Vasiliou v. Secretary of State for Transport (1991) {{is an example of a}} case in which a court found that a particular mandatory relevant consideration was to be implied into a statute. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the Secretary of State for Transport had failed to take into account the fact that an order to close off a particular street for redevelopment would have caused the applicant a substantial loss of business.|$|E

25|$|If, in the {{exercise}} of its discretion on a public duty, an authority takes into account considerations which the courts consider not to be proper, then {{in the eyes of the}} law it has not exercised its discretion legally. On the other hand, considerations that are <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant considerations (that is, considerations that the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that must be taken into account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). If a decision-maker has determined that a particular consideration is relevant to its decision, it is entitled to attribute to it whatever weight it thinks fit, and the courts will not interfere unless it has acted in a Wednesbury-unreasonable manner. This is consistent with the principle that the courts are generally only concerned with the legality of decisions and not their merits.|$|E
25|$|Different {{strains of}} Triticeae exist for {{different}} industrial applications; durum for pasta and food pastes, {{two types of}} barley for beer, bread wheats used in different areas with different growing conditions. Replacing these motifs is not a plausible task since a contamination of 0.02% wheat in a gluten-free diet {{is considered to be}} pathogenic and would require replacing the motifs in all known regional varieties—potentially thousands of genetic modifications. Class I and antibody responses are downstream of Class II recognition and are of little remedial value in change. The innate response peptide could be a silver bullet, assuming there is only one of these per protein and only a few genome loci with the protein. Unresolved questions <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> complete understanding of immune responses to gluten are: Why is the rate of late onset gluten sensitivity rapidly rising? Is this truly a wheat problem, or something that is being done to wheat, or to those who are eating wheat (for example, communicable diseases a trigger? Some individuals are susceptible by genetics (early onset), but many late onset cases could have different triggers because there is nothing genetically separating the 30 to 40% of people that could have Triticeae sensitivity from the ~1% that, in their lifetime, will have some level of this disease.|$|E

In Geneva, meanwhile, it soon became clear that while the Rhodesians wished to stick to the plan they had agreed with Kissinger, the nationalists had no intention of doing so, regarding those terms only as a starting point for further negotiation. They continually interrupted the lawyers' work with new demands, meaning that by 8 November practically no progress had been made.|$|E
500|$|Ron Noades, who {{purchased}} {{the club for}} £2,782 in 1976, came to see Plough Lane as a potential limitation by 1979. He surmised that it could only attract {{a relatively small number}} of fans because of its location, close to large areas of sparsely populated parkland. Noades's interest was piqued by the site the Milton Keynes Development Corporation had earmarked for a stadium next to the town's still-under-construction Central railway station. [...] "They were very keen to get a Football League club, effectively a franchise if you like, into Milton Keynes to take up that site," [...] Noades said in a 2001 interview. Planning to move Wimbledon there by amalgamating with an established Milton Keynes club, Noades purchased debt-ridden Southern League club Milton Keynes City (MK City; formerly Bletchley Town) for £1. [...] He and three other Wimbledon directors—Jimmy Rose, Bernie Coleman and Sam Hammam—were promptly voted onto MK City's board [...] "in an advisory capacity".
