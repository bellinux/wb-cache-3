40|$|Abstract. More than 40 % web {{search queries}} pivot around a single en-tity, {{which can be}} {{interpreted}} with the available knowledge bases such as DBpedia and Freebase. With the advent of these knowledge repos-itories, major search engines are interested in suggesting the <b>related</b> <b>entities</b> to the users. These <b>related</b> <b>entities</b> {{provide an opportunity to}} the users to extend their knowledge. <b>Related</b> <b>entities</b> can be obtained from knowledge bases by retrieving the directly linked entities. However, many popular entities may have more than 1, 000 directly connected enti-ties without defining any associativity weight, and these knowledge bases mainly cover some specific types of relations. For instance, “Brad Pitt” can be considered related to “Tom Cruise ” but they are not directly con-nected in DBpedia graph with any relation. Therefore, it is worth finding the <b>related</b> <b>entities</b> beyond the relations explicitly defined in knowledge graphs, and a ranking method is also required to quantify the relations between the entities. In this work, we present Entity Relatedness Graph (EnRG) that provides a ranked list of <b>related</b> <b>entities</b> to a given entity, and clusters them by their DBpedia types. Moreover, EnRG helps a user in discovering the provenance of implicit relations between two entities. With the help of EnRG, one can easily explore even the weak relations that are not explicitly included in the available knowledge bases, for instance, Why is “Brad Pitt ” related to “Backstreet Boys”?...|$|R
