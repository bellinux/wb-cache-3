50|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{car design}} was {{evolving}} rapidly {{to become more}} sleek and aerodynamic. It eliminated the need for <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> The first automobile designed without <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> was the 1936 Cord. It changed the attitude towards <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> for many years ahead.|$|R
50|$|Before the 2003 {{model year}} ended, Ford updated the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> on Expeditions {{equipped}} with the Eddie Bauer trim. Earlier in the model year, Eddie Bauer models had received standard black <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> Toward {{the end of the}} model year, Arizona beige <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> were re-introduced to complement the Arizona beige body work which came standard on Eddie Bauer. Body colored <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> had previously been offered on the first-generation Expedition from 2000 to 2002.|$|R
50|$|<b>Running</b> <b>boards</b> {{may also}} be used to stand on while the vehicle is moving. The name <b>running</b> <b>board</b> is also given to safety {{appliances}} for walking on top of rail cars.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>running</b> <b>board</b> is {{a narrow}} step fitted under the side doors {{of a car}} or truck. It aids entry, {{especially}} into high vehicles, and is typical of vintage cars, which had much higher ground clearances than today's vehicles. It is also used as a fashion statement on vehicles that would not otherwise require it. The origin of the name <b>running</b> <b>board</b> is obscure; the first <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> predate automobiles and were installed on carriages {{as early as the}} 17th century. Whether the <b>running</b> <b>board</b> was named after the inventor or in reference to function is open to debate.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1930s, {{in order}} to ease maintenance, {{modifications}} {{were made to the}} <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> and brake gear of the CFB locomotives. The former involved mounting the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> higher, thereby getting rid of the driving wheel fairings. This gave the locomotives a much more American rather than British appearance.|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} film, The Love Bug, {{the original}} racing stripes {{differ from those}} in later movies; the stripes do not cover the valances or louvers {{of the car and}} the blue is a lighter shade. Also, Herbie features color-keyed <b>running</b> <b>boards,</b> while in later films the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> are standard black.|$|R
50|$|As built, the Class 11 had a {{gap between}} the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> and the {{platform}} in front of the smokebox, with a stirrup-type step attached to the front edge of each <b>running</b> <b>board</b> and without side-steps at the locomotive's front. Many were later modified by having sloped extensions added between the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> and the front platform to replace the stirrup, and with side-steps added next to the leading wheels. Some were modified in this way while still in SAR service, while others were done in various styles by their post-SAR industrial owners, as illustrated below.|$|R

25|$|The {{fourteen}} class F6 locomotives {{were not}} delivered from their builder, the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until 1929â€“1930. In 1931, eight sister locomotives of class F6-a were delivered; these differed in few aspects {{but can be}} distinguished by the straight <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> of the F6-a, {{in contrast to the}} stepped <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> of the F6.|$|R
50|$|The ELR {{found itself}} with two unique Class 504 Units, having only {{expected}} one. One unit was refurbished {{in the late}} 1980s, with modern strip lighting, and complete <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> outside. The other unit was refurbished in the 1970s, and has incandescent bulbs and individual <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> to each door. The unit was eventually gifted to the ELRPS.|$|R

50|$|Like their {{predecessor}} condensing locomotives, these tender locomotives were {{equipped with}} sheet-metal casing {{above and below}} the <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> This was to protect the motion and bearings as well as working parts of the J. Hawthorn-Kitson valve gear above the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> from wind-blown sand. The bottom encasement was hinged to allow easy access to the motion. The engines all had copper boilers.|$|R
50|$|Visually obvious {{alterations}} {{were the}} smokebox saddle and the <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> The distinctive covered smokebox saddle of earlier 7th Class locomotives {{was replaced with}} an exposed one. The <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> were no longer straight {{all the way through}} from buffer beam to cab end, but dipped ahead of the smokebox and beneath the cab, giving it the appearance of a Hendrie-designed locomotive.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, all {{automobiles}} were equipped with <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> The necessity of using them {{was caused by}} the fact that first cars were designed with a narrow, high body bolted to the chassis. A <b>running</b> <b>board</b> served as a step to a vehicle's cabin and was wide enough to serve as a place to sit or even lie down for an adult.|$|R
50|$|Visually, the Su was {{the last}} true Russian-look design before the American {{influence}} of high <b>running</b> <b>boards,</b> bar frames and boxpok wheels became the norm. The Su retained such features as a clerestory skylight in the cab roof and handrails {{on the outside of}} the <b>running</b> <b>board.</b> These handrails were a result of the harsh Russian winters, when ice would build up on the <b>running</b> <b>boards,</b> making them highly dangerous. Enginemen had fallen to their death from moving trains and the fitting of promenade deck style handrails was a safety measure ordered by the Tsar in pre-revolutionary times. These features, combined with the high 17 ft loading gauge, combined to give the locomotives a uniquely Russian appearance.|$|R

In April 2003, Toyota made the Appearance Package, {{along with the}} previously optional fog lamps, <b>running</b> <b>boards,</b> and 16-inch aluminum wheels, standard on the SR5. The Sport Edition also added black <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> and color-keyed trim, replacing the grey cladding and silver-painted grille, door handles and liftgate trim.|$|R

50|$|Like their predecessors, the {{condensing}} and Clara Class locomotives, {{they were}} equipped with sheet-metal casing {{above and below}} their <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> This was to protect the motion and bearings, as well as working parts of the J. Hawthorn-Kitson valve gear which protruded above the <b>running</b> <b>boards,</b> from wind-blown sand. The bottom encasement was hinged to allow {{easy access to the}} motion. The picture alongside shows a Scotia Class locomotive without this casing.|$|R

50|$|In 1907, four {{of these}} {{locomotives}} were sold to the Benguela Railway (Caminho de Ferro de Benguela - CFB) in Angola. These, therefore, did not see SAR service.

The former involved mounting the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> higher, thereby getting rid of the coupled wheel fairings.
