50|$|The <b>razorback</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> attains {{a maximum}} length of 2.5 m. Its diet {{consists}} of fishes, {{such as the}} Californian anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and the North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and squid. The only known parasite of the <b>razorback</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is the copepod Avitocaligus assurgericola. Reproduction is presumably oviparous with pelagic eggs and larvae as {{with other members of}} the family, though eggs and newly hatched larvae have not been described. Flexion (the bending of the notochord as part of caudal fin formation) occurs at around a length of 14 mm. Post-flexion larvae have slender bodies and pointed heads, with the pelvic and first dorsal spines elongated. They can be distinguished by the presence of pigment on the top of the head, snout, and opercles. This species is not targeted by fisheries; it is sometimes hooked or netted, or found washed ashore.|$|E
50|$|The <b>razorback</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> Assurger anzac, is a {{rare species}} of cutlassfish, family Trichiuridae, and {{the only member of}} its genus. It has been caught from {{scattered}} locations worldwide: in the Atlantic Ocean it is known from off Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and the Walvis Ridge, in the Indian Ocean it is known from off western Australia, and in the Pacific Ocean it is known from off New Guinea, southern Japan, Midway Island, California, and the Nazca and Sala y Gomez Ridges. Adults are thought to be benthopelagic, occurring at a depth of 150 - 400 m, while juveniles are found near the surface or in midwater.|$|E
40|$|A new genus and species, Avitocaligus assurgericola gen. et sp. n., of {{the family}} Caligidae is {{established}} based on an ovigerous female collected from a <b>razorback</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> Assurger anzac (Alexander), caught off New Caledonia. This is the first record of any parasitic copepod from this fish. The new genus {{is placed in the}} Caligidae since it possesses the caligid cephalothorax incorporating the first to third pedigerous somites. It also exhibits biramous first and fourth swimming legs but lacks dorsal plates on the fourth pedigerous somite. This combination of characters serves to differentiate the new genus from existing genera. In addition, it possesses loosely coiled, uniseriate egg sacs, concealed between the middle lamellar plates on the genital complex and the ventral plates on the abdomen. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis with a restricted matrix suggests that the new genus represents the earliest offshoot from the main caligid lineage since it does not exhibit the dominant exopod on the fourth swimming leg found in all other members of the Caligidae, including the genus Euryphorus. It strongly supports the newly recognized monophyletic status of the Caligidae, incorporating the genera formerly placed in the Euryphoridae...|$|E
