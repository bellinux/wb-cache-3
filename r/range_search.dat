40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} an intimate connection between dynamic <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> {{in the group}} model and combinatorial discrepancy. Our result states that, for a broad class of <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> data structures (including all known upper bounds), it must hold that tutq = Ω(disc 2) where tu is the worst case update time, tq the worst case query time and disc is the combinatorial discrepancy of the <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> problem in question. This relation immediately implies {{a whole range of}} exceptionally high and near-tight lower bounds for all of the basic <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> problems. We list a few of them in the following: • For d-dimensional halfspace <b>range</b> <b>searching,</b> we get a lower bound of tutq = Ω(n 1 − 1 /d). This comes within a lg lg n factor of the best known upper bound. • For orthogonal <b>range</b> <b>searching,</b> we get a lower bound of tutq = Ω(lgd− 1 n). • For ball <b>range</b> <b>searching,</b> we get a lower bound of tutq = Ω(n 1 − 1 /d). We note that the previous highest lower bound for any explicit problem, due to Pǎtra¸scu [STOC’ 07], states that tq = Ω((lg n / lg(lg n + tu)) 2), which does however hold for a less restrictive class of data structures. Our result also has implications for the field of combinatorial discrepancy.

We introduce a different approximation model, called the absolute error model, in which points within distance eps of the range's boundary may or may not be included, regardless of the diameter of the range. We consider sets of ranges consisting of general convex bodies, axis-aligned rectangles, halfspaces, Euclidean balls, and simplices.

40|$|<b>Range</b> <b>searching</b> {{is among}} the most {{fundamental}} problems in computational geometry. An n-element point set in ℝ d is given along with an assignment of weights to these points from some commutative semigroup. Subject to a fixed space of possible range shapes, the problem is to preprocess the points so that the total semigroup sum of the points lying within a given query range η can be determined quickly. In the approximate version of the problem we assume that η is bounded, and we are given an approximation parameter ε > 0. We are to determine the semigroup sum of all the points contained within η and may additionally include any of the points lying within distance ε · diam(η) of ηS boundary. In this paper we contrast the complexity of <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> based on semigroup properties. A semigroup (S, +) is idempotent if x + x = x for all x ∈ S, and it is integral if for all k ≥ 2, the k-fold sum x + ⋯ + x is not equal to x. For example, (ℝ, min) and ({ 0, 1 }, V) are both idempotent, and (ℕ, +) is integral. To date, all upper and lower bounds hold irrespective of the semigroup. We show that semigroup properties do indeed make a difference for both exact and approximate <b>range</b> <b>searching,</b> {{and in the case of}} approximate <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> the differences are dramatic. First, we consider exact halfspace <b>range</b> <b>searching.</b> The assumption that the semigroup is integral allows us to improve the best lower bounds in the semigroup arithmetic model. For example, assuming O(n) storage in the plane and ignoring polylog factors, we provide an Ω* (n 2 / 5) lower bound for integral semigroups, improving upon the best lower bound of Ω* (n 1 / 3), thus closing the gap with the O(n 1 / 2) upper bound. We also consider approximate <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> for Eu clidean ball ranges. We present lower bounds and nearly matching upper bounds for idempotent semigroups. We also present lower bounds for <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> for integral semigroups, which nearly match existing upper bounds. These bounds show that the advantages afforded by idempotency can result in major improvements. In particular, assuming roughly linear space, the exponent in the ε-dependencies is smaller by a factor of nearly 1 / 2. All our results are presented in terms of space-time tradeoffs, and our lower and upper bounds match closely throughout the entire spectrum. To our knowledge, our results provide the first proof that semigroup properties affect the computational complexity of <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> in the semigroup arithmetic model. These are the first lower bound results for any approximate geometric retrieval problems. The existence of nearly matching upper bounds, throughout the range of space-time trade-offs, suggests that we are close to resolving the computational complexity of both idempotent and integral approximate spherical <b>range</b> <b>searching</b> in the semigroup arithmetic model.
