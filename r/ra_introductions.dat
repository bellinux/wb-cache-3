40|$|Introductions to {{research}} articles (RAs) {{have become an}} important site {{for the analysis of}} academic writing. However, analysts have apparently not considered whether <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> typically include statements of principal findings. In contrast, this issue is often addressed in the manuals and style guides surveyed, most advocating the desirability of announcing principal findings (APFs) in <b>RA</b> <b>introductions.</b> Therefore, a study of actual practice in two leading journals from two different fields (physics and educational psychology) was undertaken. In the Physical Review 45 % of the introductions sampled contained APFs (with some increase in percentage over the last 40 years), while in the Journal of Educational Psychology the percentage fell to under 7 %. These figures are at variance with the general trend of recommendations in primary and secondary sources. Thus preliminary evidence points to (a) a mismatch between descriptive practice and prescriptive advice and (b) diversity in this rhetorical feature between the two fields...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to search for the {{occurrence}} of communicative and subcommunicative units and to identify the linguistic features commonly used by the authors to realize the communicative and subcommunicative units. Three groups of English RAs by Indonesian speakers were chosen for this study: 10 RAs from engineering science, ten from science and ten from medical science journals. This study used genre-based method to investigate the communicative units in the text by using Swales’ CARS as a model. The results show that 1) only 11 out of 30 (36. 66 %) <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> have a ‘niche establishment’, 2) out of 11 RA introduction with a niche establishment none is of counter claiming type, and 3) the discourse markers often used in the niche establishment are of the contradictory type and the linguistic features used are of lexical negation and negation of the phrasal verb. The findings confirm those of previous relevant studies that discourse styles and linguistic features of English <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> by Indonesian speakers are different from the ones by English native speakers...|$|E
40|$|Rhetorical style {{transfer}} from ﬁ rst language {{to a foreign}} language can be serious problems in academic writing, such as research articles (RAs). This study is aimed at analyzing the rhetorical style of Indonesian <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> in multiple disciplines written by Indonesian authors and published in Indonesian research journals especially on the ways authors justify their research topic and research activity and suggesting potential problems if this style is used when writing RAs in English. Four hundred RAs written in Indonesian by Indonesian speakers were selected for this study from mostly university-based research journals. The analyses were conducted using a genre-based analysis method following a problem justifying project model by Safnil [2001. Rhetorical structure analyses of Indonesian research articles. An unpublished PhD diss., the Australian National University, Canberra Australia]. The results show that: (1) unlike English authors, Indonesian authors consider establishing shared background knowledge important in their <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> but not justifying their research project; (2) Indonesian authors justify their research topic by personal reasons and reviewing the current knowledge and practices and (3) while some use subjective and practical reasons to justify their research projects, many do not justify it at all. If Indonesian authors use this rhetorical style when writing RAs in English, this can cause the article to be rejected by international journals...|$|E

40|$|Genre-based {{studies of}} {{academic}} texts have mainly focused on research articles written by native English writers. The objectives {{of this study}} are to examine the rhetorical structure of Malaysian research article introductions and to investigate {{the ways in which the}} rhetorical structure of Malaysian research article introductions may differ from the internationally published research article introductions. This study explores the relation of texts generic structure and the context. A corpora of 30 research articles were selected. For the purpose of conducting a comparative study, 15 introductions from locally published journal ‘The English Teacher’ and 15 from internationally published ‘ELT’ Journal' were taken. This study developed a framework for the generic structure analysis based on Swales CARS and OARO model. It was found that the international research articles complied with the CARS model whereas the Malaysian research article introductions adhered to the OARO model. It must be mentioned that two of the Malaysian introductions opaquely complied with the CARS model. This may be due to the exposure that the authors may have had in writing introductions the conventional way. Overall, the findings tend to confirm Swales’s claim that the research in the nonnative speakers’ world tend to be less antagonistic and thus geared more towards establishing readership rather than establishing the research. One prominent feature o f both ELT related introductions is that they are prone to discussing theories, personal experience and personal thoughts. As a result, new terms were proposed, CARDS - Create a Research Discussion Space and OARDO - Open a Research Discussion Option. The present study has significant implication for scholars’ writing o f <b>RA</b> <b>introductions.</b> Knowledge o f formal genre structure is useful particularly for scholars to achieve full control of their academic writing process. By comparing two different corpus, this study managed to sensitize scholars to the rhetorical structure of <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> in academic texts within the discipline of ELT...|$|E

40|$|This article {{acknowledges}} the increasingly {{important role of}} research articles (RAs) written in English. To enable scholars who are not competent in English to compete with others academically, this study provides {{a detailed description of}} the English empirical <b>RA</b> <b>Introductions</b> and Methods. A dataset of 60 RAs representing top quality journals in biomedical engineering was compiled and subsequently divided into four sub-datasets representing the four major sections. The Introduction and Methods sub-datasets were analysed by genre analysis into ‘moves’ and ‘steps’. Then, the linguistic features pervasive and salient in individual move or step instances were identified. The analysis revealed that each section displayed a schematic structure, consisting of a set of moves and steps. In addition, clusters of lexico-grammatical features associated with a communicative function were identified. This two-tier genre analysis suggests that the structural patterns and linguistic features interact with each other functionally. The findings are pedagogically useful in developing genre competence for scholars to better access the content they need from RAs and to effectively disseminate their achievements in their respective fields...|$|E

40|$|Background: Ras is a membrane-associated small G-protein that funnels {{growth and}} {{differentiation}} signals into downstream signal transduction pathways by cycling between an inactive, GDP-bound and an active, GTP-bound state. Aberrant Ras activity {{as a result}} of oncogenic mutations causes de novo cell transformation and promotes tumor growth and progression. Results: Here, we describe a novel strategy to block deregulated Ras activity by means of oligomerized cognate protein modules derived from the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf (RBD), which we named MSOR for multivalent scavengers of oncogenic <b>Ras.</b> The <b>introduction</b> of well-characterized mutations into RBD was used to adjust the affinity and hence the blocking potency of MSOR towards activated Ras. MSOR inhibited several oncogenic Ras-stimulated processes including downstream activation of Erk 1 / 2, induction of matrixdegrading enzymes, cell motility and invasiveness in a graded fashion depending on the oligomerization grade {{and the nature of the}} individual RBD-modules. The amenability to accurate experimental regulation was further improved by engineering an inducible MSOR-expression system to render the reversal of oncogenic Ras effects controllable. Conclusion: MSOR represent a new tool for the experimental and possibly therapeutic selective blockade of oncogenic Ras signals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Research into English {{research}} articles (RAs) {{has largely been}} focused on articles produced by native English writers. This paper reports a study aiming to investigate the textual structure of {{research articles}} written by non-native English (i. e.

A comparison is made between RAs written by native English speakers, an Indonesian writers writing in English, all {{in the field of}} Language and Language Teaching. It explores the relation of text's generic structure. The thesis develops a framework for the generic structure analysis based on Swales' (1990) Create-AÂ­Research-Space (CARS) model of moves. The analysis focuses on two <b>RA</b> sections: <b>Introduction</b> and Discussion. The findings indicate significant differences in both forms and functions of organizing strategics between the native and non-native texts. The differences may partly be due to the influence of writing practices in the non-native writers' first language and partly to the writer's attempt to find an appropriate format in the absence of well-established research writing conventions in the first language. Consequently, non-native English texts may show organizing strategies unfamiliar to both the native English and native Indonesian texts. Findings from the research highlight two issues. First, formal and functional differences of generic structure elements and their realizations between the native and non-native English texts may disadvantage the non-native writers, particularly with regards to employment of unfamiliar organizationa...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies in recent years of written {{academic}} genres and they have highlighted the importance of genre analysis in the structure of student writing. The study utilised a content document analysis method to investigate the use of rhetorical moves in the introductions to academic exercise written by B. ed TESL students in Universiti Teknologi MARA (“UiTM”) Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. The thesis describes how genre analysis was used to analyse the academic exercise introductions of a corpus composed of 30 texts written in English by Malaysian writers. The analysis reveals that the rhetorical patterns and some moves proposed by Swales in his Open a Research Option model are found in introductions even though not in sequence orders. Another significant finding is that the Malaysian writers did not summarise their finding in the introduction sections compared to Anglo-American writers. The objectives of this analysis are to verify whether the rhetorical patterns of organisation and the moves found in introductions coincide with those proposed by Swales (1993) in his study of research articles introductions. Besides analyzing the CARS model by Swales (1993), it also identifies the alternative model of Open a Research Option (OARO) in the introductions. The finding was different from those for English <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> because Malaysian and Anglo-American writers have different backgrounds and environments due to the social-cultural aspects with also reflect the organisation of discourse and rhetoric. Malaysian writers do not like to comment on other peoples’ works compared to cultures who like to give and accept criticism. To conclude the introduction section of their writing, Malaysian writers preferred referring to the consequences of their research. In general, the rhetorical moves and steps were employed in academic exercise introduction sections were less often used in CARS compared to OARO...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{challenges}} faced by non-native researchers writing their scientific papers for publication in English. To publish in peer-reviewed international mainstream journals, researchers {{should be able to}} write in a genre-specific and persuasive manner. Academic writing requires explicit organization of texts, caution in making claims, signposting connections, and creating coherence and clarity in the text. The research article (RA) is a key genre of scientific publishing with a special communicative and rhetorical structure. The structure and language of the RA partly depend on the disciplinary knowledge-making practices and writing conventions applied in the field of research. The subjects of this study were doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in Materials Science at Tampere University of Technology (TUT), all of them non-native speakers of English. The objective of the study was twofold: first, to explore the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, challenges, and wishes for further training of the researchers writing in English; second, to examine how they employed certain linguistic devices to present the results of their research. The study applied two methods to answer the research questions: an e-mailed questionnaire and a descriptive analysis of published sample RAs written by the subjects. Swales’ Create-A-Research-Space (CARS) model for <b>RA</b> <b>introductions</b> and Hyland’s model of interactive and interactional metadiscourse were used as investigative tools to study certain rhetorical and textual features. On the whole, the TUT respondents showed a positive attitude to writing in English. Approximately half of them felt disadvantaged in writing RAs when compared to native speakers. The researchers considered “creating text flow and coherence to make my reasoning easy to understand” and “expressing my interpretation of the results with an appropriate degree of confidence” most challenging. Both skills involve the ability to write reader-friendly and professionally convincing text. Most sample RAs followed the 3 -move rhetorical pattern of the CARS model. Most of the metadiscoursal items were interactive, which is characteristic of quantitative RAs in natural sciences and engineering. Overall, the writers employed a rather limited selection of metadiscoursal devices. Since proofreaders often pay attention only to obvious lexico-grammatical mistakes in scientific papers, an interactive system with early-stage consultation between writers and proofreaders can help to create persuasive and genre-specific argumentation. Discipline-based writing instruction and materials on textual and rhetorical organization beyond the sentence level could help writers to construct coherent texts...|$|E
40|$|High {{concentrations}} of glucose induce beta cell production of IL- 1 beta, leading to impaired beta cell function and apoptosis in human pancreatic islets. IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) is a naturally occurring antagonist of IL- 1 beta and protects cultured human islets from glucotoxicity. Therefore, {{the balance of}} IL- 1 beta and IL- 1 Ra may {{play a crucial role}} in the pathogenesis of diabetes. In the present study, we observed expression of IL- 1 Ra in human pancreatic beta cells of nondiabetic individuals, which was decreased in tissue sections of type 2 diabetic patients. In vitro, chronic exposure of human islets to leptin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, decreased beta cell production of IL- 1 Ra and induced IL- 1 beta release from the islet preparation, leading to impaired beta cell function, caspase- 3 activation, and apoptosis. Exogenous addition of IL- 1 Ra protected cultured human islets from the deleterious effects of leptin. Antagonizing IL- 1 <b>Ra</b> by <b>introduction</b> of small interfering RNA to IL- 1 Ra into human islets led to caspase- 3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and impaired beta cell function.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} impact of the {{introduction}} of biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) and associated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management guidelines on the incidence of total hip (THR) and knee replacements (TKR) in Denmark. Methods: Nationwide register-based cohort and interrupted time-series analysis. Incident RA patients between 1996 - 2011 were identified in the Danish National Patient Register. RA patients were matched on age, sex and municipality with up to 10 general population comparators (GPCs). Standardised 5 -year incidence rates of THR and TKR per 1000 person-years were calculated for RA patients and GPCs in 6 -month periods. Levels and trends in the pre-bDMARD (1996 - 2001) were compared with the bDMARD era (2003 - 2016) using segmented linear regression interrupted by a 1 -year lag period (2002). Results: We identified 30, 404 incident RA patients and 297, 916 GPCs. In 1996, the incidence rate of THR and TKR was 8. 72 and 5. 87, respectively among RA patients, and 2. 89 and 0. 42 in GPCs. From 1996 - 2016, the incidence rate of THR decreased among RA patients, but increased among GPCs. Among RA patients, the incidence rate of TKR increased from 1996 - 2001, but started to decrease from 2003 and throughout the bDMARD era. The incidence of TKR increased among GPCs from 1996 - 2016. Conclusion: 	 We report that the incidence rate of THR and TKR was 3 and 14 -fold higher, respectively among RA patients compared with GPCs in 1996. In <b>RA</b> patients, <b>introduction</b> of bDMARDs was associated with a decreasing incidence rate of TKR, whereas the incidence of THR had started to decrease before bDMARD introduction...|$|R

40|$|The {{closing of}} the last century opened a wide variety of {{approaches}} for inflammation imaging and treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<b>RA).</b> The <b>introduction</b> of biological therapies for the management of RA started a revolution in the therapeutic armamentarium with the development of several novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which can be murine, chimeric, humanised and fully human antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies specifically bind to their target, which could be adhesion molecules, activation markers, antigens or receptors, to interfere with specific inflammation pathways at the molecular level, leading to immune-modulation of the underlying pathogenic process. These new generation of mAbs can also be radiolabelled by using direct or indirect method, with a variety of nuclides, depending upon the specific diagnostic application. For studying rheumatoid arthritis patients, several monoclonal antibodies and their fragments, including anti-TNF-alpha, anti-CD 20, anti-CD 3, anti-CD 4 and anti-E-selectin antibody, have been radiolabelled mainly with (99 m) Tc or (111) In. Scintigraphy with these radiolabelled antibodies may offer an exciting possibility for the study of RA patients and holds two types of information: (1) it allows better staging of the disease and diagnosis of the state of activity by early detection of inflamed joints that might be difficult to assess; (2) it might provide a possibility to perform 'evidence-based biological therapy' of arthritis with a view to assessing whether an antibody will localise in an inflamed joint before using the same unlabelled antibody therapeutically. This might prove particularly important for the selection of patients to be treated since biological therapies can be associated with severe side-effects and are considerably expensive. This article reviews the use of radiolabelled mAbs in the study of RA with particular emphasis on the use of different radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies for therapy decision-making and follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Retinoic acid (RA) {{is capable}} of {{inducing}} the differentiation of various myelomonocytic cell lines. During this differentiation process, the levels of c-myb expression decline, suggesting that the RA receptor (RAR) may act in part by down-regulating this proto-oncogene. We have now investigated whether the RAR can also inhibit the function of Myb proteins themselves. We have found that transcriptional activation of a Myb-responsive reporter gene can be inhibited by RA in a human monocytic cell line. This inhibition could not be overcome by the expression of exogenous Myb. The RAR did not interfere with DNA binding by Myb proteins in vitro, suggesting that the functional inhibition occurs {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. To determine the biological relevance of the inhibition of Myb proteins by the RAR, we have used v-myb-transformed monoblasts. These cells differentiate into macrophages in the presence of phorbol ester (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate [TPA]) but are normally unresponsive to <b>RA</b> treatment. The <b>introduction</b> of an inducible, exogenous RAR alpha into v-myb-transformed monoblasts permitted an RA-dependent differentiation into macrophage-like cells similar to those induced by TPA. These results demonstrate that transformation by v-myb is recessive to RAR alpha and imply that many types of non-RA-responsive leukemia cells may become responsive following the introduction of the RAR...|$|R
40|$|Gold sodium thiomalate (GST) {{is known}} to modify the disease process in {{patients}} with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To help understand the mechanism of action of GST, several immunological parameters were prospectively evaluated in 10 patients with active <b>RA</b> following the <b>introduction</b> of gold therapy. Before therapy, absolute numbers of peripheral blood T suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes were significantly depressed (P less than 0. 01) and a raised T helper/T suppressor cell ratio was found. After 1 g of GST, an absolute reduction in total lymphocyte numbers including HLA/DR positive mononuclear cells, was evident (P less than 0. 01). This lymphopenic effect was not selective for a single population since the proportions of T cells, T cell subsets and B cells remained unchanged. Lymphocyte function was also examined. Raised in vitro production of IgG (P less than 0. 01) and IgA (P less than 0. 05) was found before therapy. After GST, in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis was reduced and this was significant {{with respect to the}} IgM (P less than 0. 001) and IgA (P less than 0. 01) isotypes. Similarly, a parallel reduction in serum immunoglobulin levels developed. GST therapy was also associated with a reduced proliferative response to phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen in the initial phase of gold administration. The significant finding in this study suggest that the in vivo immunosuppressive effect of GST is explained not only by impaired mononuclear cell function but also by a significant reduction in T and B lymphocyte numbers...|$|R
40|$|Background Previous {{studies found}} {{increased}} case fatality after myocardial infarction and more frequent sudden death in RA patients compared to non-RA subjects. The RA associated CV risk might {{be explained by}} the combined effects of chronic systemic inflammation and increased lifestyle associated cardiovascular risk factors, and modified by the use of medication such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Trends in case fatality rate in <b>RA</b> after the <b>introduction</b> of potent anti-inflammatory biologic therapies and treat-to-target treatment strategies aiming at remission are not known. This study was performed to examine the cardiovascular fatality rate in current low disease activity RA, and to evaluate trends in RA associated CV case fatality over time. Methods Prospective study to determine the incidence of fatal and nonfatal CV events in 480 RA patients included in the ACT-CVD cohort between February 2009 and December 2011. Patients with prior CV disease were excluded. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine CV event risk and contributing risk factors over time. The results of the cohort analysis were put into the context of {{a review of the literature}} to evaluate trends in RA associated CV fatality rate over time. Results The study included 480 RA patients, 72. 3 % female with median disease duration of 4. 2 years, 72. 1 % being in clinical remission (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints). During a mean follow up of 2. 9 years 29 patients (6 %) experienced a first CV event, 2 fatal and 27 non-fatal, corresponding to a 6. 9 % case fatality rate. Comparison with previous studies in cohorts with successive enrolment periods shows a trend towards a decrease in CV case fatality in RA from 52. 9 % in 1998 to 6. 9 % in our study.
