5|$|The purest metal is {{obtained}} from nickel oxide by the Mond process, which achieves a purity of greater than 99.99%. The process was patented by Ludwig Mond {{and has been}} in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century. In this process, nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide {{in the presence of a}} sulfur catalyst at around 40–80°C to form nickel carbonyl. Iron gives iron pentacarbonyl, too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary, the nickel may be separated by distillation. Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by-product, but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> to give a non-volatile solid.|$|E

Lower temperature than ambient cannot be achieved as the coldest possible temperature is that of the cooling fluids (air and water). Seasonal factors influence the production of polymerization reactions, therefore in summer the consumption of acid is higher, especially in HFAU.|$|R

Higher levels of chlorination require higher reaction temperatures and greater dioxin production.

2500|$|Despite {{optimized}} yields {{greater than}} 95% with excellent purity, the synthesis has shortcomings.

Solvent burning {{is a significant}} economic factor in the oxidation process. In addition, product loss by decarboxylation to benzoic acid is common. The high temperature diminishes oxygen solubility in an already oxygen-starved system. Pure oxygen cannot {{be used in the}} traditional system due to hazards of flammable organic–O2 mixtures. Atmospheric air can be used in its place, but once reacted needs to be purified of toxins and ozone depleters such as methylbromide before being released. Additionally, the corrosive nature of bromides at high temperatures requires the reaction be run in expensive titanium reactors.|$|E
2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., polymerization processes is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|E
2500|$|Thorium tetraiodide (ThI4, yellow, m.p.556°C) is {{prepared}} by direct {{reaction of the}} elements in a sealed silica ampule. Water and oxygen must not be present, or else ThOI2 and ThO2 can contaminate the product. It has a different crystal structure from the other tetrahalides, being monoclinic. The lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal. (ThI is also predicted to form as an intermediate in the dissociation of ThI4 to thorium metal.) These do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as [...] and [...] respectively. Depending {{on the amount of}} time allowed for the reaction between ThI4 and thorium, two modifications of ThI3 can be produced: shorter times give thin lustrous rods of α-ThI3, while longer times give small β-ThI3 crystals with green to brass-coloured luster. Both forms are quickly oxidised by air and reduce water, quickly forming large quantities of hydrogen gas. ThI2 also has two modifications, which can be produced by varying the reaction temperature: at 600°C, α-ThI2 is formed, while a <b>reaction</b> <b>temperature</b> of 700–850°C produces β-ThI2, which has a golden luster.|$|E

2500|$|The {{metals in}} the MOF {{structure}} often act as Lewis acids. The metals in MOFs often coordinate to labile solvent molecules or counter ions {{which can be}} removed after activation of the framework. The Lewis acidic nature of such unsaturated metal centers can activate the coordinated organic substrates for subsequent organic transformations. The use of unsaturated metal centers was demonstrated in the cyanosilylation of aldehydes and imines by Fujita and coworkers in 2004. They reported MOF of composition { • (NO3)2 • 4H2O} which was obtained by treating linear bridging ligand 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) with Cd(NO3)2 [...] The Cd(II) centers in this MOF possesses a distorted octahedral geometry having four pyridines in the equatorial positions, and two water molecules in the axial positions to form a two-dimensional infinite network. On activation, two water molecules were removed leaving the metal centers unsaturated and Lewis acidic. The Lewis acidic character of metal center was tested on cyanosilylation reactions of imine where the imine gets attached to the Lewis-acidic metal centre resulting in higher electrophilicity of imines. For the cyanosilylation of imines, most of the reactions were complete within 1 h affording aminonitriles in quantitative yield.
