5|$|In November 1984, Larson {{learned about}} a local radio show {{promotion}} promising a $30,000 prize for matching a $1bill's serial number with a random number read {{out on the}} air. Over several days, he withdrew his remaining winnings in $1bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering {{that he did not}} have the winning number) re-deposited <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> of the money. Larson left about $50,000 in his house, which was stolen in a burglary while he was attending a Christmas party. The case remains unsolved to this day.|$|E
5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> of the financial responsibility for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E

5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} documentation of the demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some indications of the immediate effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, about a third, of the canons of St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances and the Industrial Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> living north of the River Tay.|$|E
5|$|As the RAF {{received}} newer aircraft {{capable of}} supersonic speeds {{to perform the}} air interceptor role, many Hunters were modified and re-equipped for undertaking ground-attack and reconnaissance missions instead. Hunters deemed surplus to the RAF's requirements were also quickly refurbished for continued service abroad. The Hunter would be procured by {{a considerable number of}} foreign nations. In addition to former RAF aircraft, <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> of the nearly 2,000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers. The Hunter would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years. As late as 1996, hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world.|$|E

Only a year later, New Norfolk was split <b>roughly</b> in <b>half</b> into Upper Norfolk County (most of which is now the present-day city of Suffolk) and Lower Norfolk County. In 1691, Lower Norfolk was split <b>roughly</b> in <b>half.</b> The western half became Norfolk County, while the eastern half became Princess Anne County. The latter was named for Anne Stuart prior to her accession to the throne in 1702.|$|R

5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the Little Ice Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
5|$|Darby Creek {{flows through}} a narrow valley in its upper reaches and a tidal flat in its lower reaches. The creek is in the Piedmont Uplands and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Major rock {{formations}} in the watershed include the Wissahickon Formation. Three small dams historically existed on the creek, but were removed in 2012. The watershed of the creek is largely developed, with <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> a million people inhabiting it. Most of the watershed is in Delaware County, but some parts are in Chester County, Philadelphia County, and Montgomery County. The watershed {{is part of the}} Lower Delaware drainage basin.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. <b>Roughly</b> <b>half</b> of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the gravity}} of this rebellion, the Illyrians went on, {{alongside}} their neighbours the Thracians, to become {{the backbone of the}} Roman army. By the 2nd century, with <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> the Roman army deployed on the Danube frontier, the auxilia and legions alike were dominated by Illyrian recruits. In the 3rd century, Illyrians largely replaced Italians in the senior officer echelons of praefecti of auxiliary regiments and tribuni militum of legions. Finally, from AD 268 to 379, virtually all emperors, including Diocletian and Constantine the Great were Romanised Illyrians from the provinces of Dalmatia, Moesia Superior and Pannonia. These were members of a military aristocracy, outstanding soldiers who saved the empire from collapse in the turbulent late 3rd century.|$|E
5|$|Home to {{approximately}} 7.68 million people, the nine-county Bay Area contains many cities, towns, airports, and associated regional, state, and national parks, {{connected by a}} complex multimodal transportation network. The larger combined statistical area of the region, which includes twelve counties, is the second-largest in California (after the Greater Los Angeles area), the fifth-largest in the United States, and the 41st-largest urban area {{in the world with}} 8.75 million people. The Bay Area's population is ethnically diverse: for example, <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> of the region's residents are Hispanic, Asian, African American, or Pacific Islander, all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is {{approximately}} 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water. Snow that persists into summer evolves into névé, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a minimum density of , which is <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> of the density of liquid water.|$|E

5|$|Scotland is <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> {{the size}} of England and Wales and has {{approximately}} {{the same amount of}} coastline, but only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land, under 60 metres above sea level, and most of this is located in the south and east. This made marginal pastoral farming and fishing the key factors in the pre-modern economy. Its north Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, which encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult.|$|E
5|$|The Bofors 40 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun was used {{on almost every}} major warship in the US and UK fleet from about 1943 to 1945. Although a descendant of German, Dutch, and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the US Navy during World War II had been heavily Americanized to bring the guns up to the standards placed on them by the Navy. This resulted in a gun system set to British standards (now known as the Standard System) with interchangeable ammunition, which simplified the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with hydraulic couple drives to reduce salt contamination and the Mark 51 director for improved accuracy, the Bofors 40mm gun became a fearsome adversary, accounting for <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|When the Iowa-class battleships were {{commissioned}} in 1943 and 1944, they carried twenty quad 40mm AA gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy guns were also {{employed in the}} protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II, and accounted for <b>roughly</b> <b>half</b> of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945. Although successful in this role, the guns were stripped from the battleships—initially from New Jersey when reactivated in 1968 and later from Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin when they were reactivated for service in the 1980s.|$|E
