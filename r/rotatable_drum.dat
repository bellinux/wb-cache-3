50|$|The rod {{and frame}} test is a psychophysical {{method of testing}} perception. It relies {{on the use of}} a rod and frame {{apparatus}} which uses a rotating rod set inside an individually <b>rotatable</b> <b>drum,</b> allowing an experimenter to vary the participant's frame of reference and thus test for their perception of vertical.|$|E
40|$|Method of {{depositing}} {{an atomic}} {{layer on a}} substrate. The method comprises supplying a precursor gas from a precursor-gas supply of a deposition head that {{may be part of}} a <b>rotatable</b> <b>drum.</b> The precursor gas is provided from the precursor-gas supply towards the substrate. The method further comprises moving the precursor-gas supply by rotating the deposition head along the substrate which in its turn is moved along the rotating drum. The method further comprises switching between supplying the precursor gas from the precursor-gas supply towards the substrate over a first part of the rotation trajectory; and interrupting supplying the precursor gas from the precursor-gas supply over a second part of the rotation trajectory...|$|E
40|$|Thomson parabolas [1] (TP) {{have become}} a {{standard}} diagnostic tool for laser-ion-acceleration experiments. A particularly compact and versatile version has been designed and was tested and calibrated using a cyclotron. The design (Fig. 1) {{is similar to the}} TPs developed at Rutherford-Appleton-Laboratory [2]. Permanent magnets create a magnetic field of up to 0. 7 T. In combination with the variable electric field applied by tilted potential plates, the energy acceptance is in the range between 0. 7 and 16 MeV per nucleon (Fig. 2). For diagnostics we use re-usable Image Plates (IPs) mounted on a <b>rotatable</b> <b>drum.</b> In this way, the device is capable of measuring four consecutive shots before the experimental chamber has to be opened to exchange the IPs. The IP mount can be replaced by a pre-aligned laser diod...|$|E
40|$|A data-rate {{converter}} is disclosed comprising a <b>rotatable</b> data-storing <b>drum</b> with {{at least}} one fixed read/record head and a rotatable read/record head. The latter is rotatable in a circular path about the drum axis of rotation. The drum is positionable in any one of a plurality of axial positions with respect to the heads, so that at least one drum track is aligned with the fixed head in one drum position and with the rotatable head in another drum position. When a track is aligned with the fixed head, data may be recorded therin or read out therefrom at a rate which is a function of drum rotation, while when aligned with the rotatable head, data may be recorded or read out at a rate which {{is a function of the}} rates and directions of rotation of both the drum and the head...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniature}} rotating transmissive {{optical scanner}} system employs a drum of small size having an interior {{defined by a}} circumferential wall <b>rotatable</b> on a <b>drum</b> axis, an optical element positioned within {{the interior of the}} drum, and a light-transmissive lens aperture provided at an angular position in the circumferential wall of the drum for scanning a light beam to or from the optical element in the drum along a beam azimuth angle as the drum is rotated. The miniature optical drum scanner configuration obtains a wide scanning field-of-view (FOV) and large effective aperture is achieved within a physically small size...|$|R
40|$|Ion beam {{sputtering}} {{has been}} used for smoothing of silicon and quartz glass substrates and for deposition of nanometer multilayers for high-end optical applications in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and in X-ray. The tool used is equipped with two linear ion beam sources, a <b>rotatable</b> <b>drum</b> of targets, movable substrate and shaper with pre-calculated velocity maps. Two ion beam sources, one directed to the target and the second to the substrate, provide reproducible and precise application of ion beam sputtering technology to etch, smoothen, or figure substrates, or to deposit high quality nanometer multilayers. Smoothing of a silicon substrate to a microroughness of 0. 11 nm rms (AFM scan length 5 Î¼m) is presented. Examples of high precision ion beam sputter deposition are shown on Mo/Si, DLC/Si, and Ni/C multilayers. The results of the x-ray reflectometry on deposited multilayers are presented...|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} has {{a holder}} (6) for rotatably mounting a wheel (3) and pivoting it into different camber angles. The tire engages the inner {{surface of a}} <b>rotatable</b> <b>drum</b> (11). Loading units (9, 10) apply a vertical or radial force and a lateral or axial loading arrangement to the holder. The loading arrangements {{are linked to the}} holder, which can be displaced so that the wheel pivots about the wheel contact point for automatic camber adjustment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - At least one ring on the drum's inner surface is arranged next to the tire and wheel edge as a run-up ring and is chamfered on the side facing the tire. USE - For testing motor vehicle wheels, tires, hubs, bearings and bolts, especially with broad tires on twinned commercial vehicle wheels. ADVANTAGE - Enables testing under substantially operational conditions with different tires...|$|E
