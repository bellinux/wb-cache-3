25|$|The ball {{lightning}} {{has the same}} rotational axis as the <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder.</b> As the vortex has a much smaller vector of energy compared to the overall energy of the reactant sonic shock wave, its vector is likely fractional to the overall reaction.

25|$|The Zippe {{centrifuge}} is {{an improvement}} {{on the standard}} gas centrifuge, the primary difference being the use of heat.

This improved centrifuge design is used commercially by Urenco to produce nuclear fuel and was used by Pakistan in their nuclear weapons program.|$|E

25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In Drum brakes, brake shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder</b> (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.|$|E
25|$|From 1908 to 1914 coil stamps {{were printed}} with Flat Plate presses in sheets of 400 {{which were then}} cut into strips for coiling. In 1915 the Bureau began {{printing}} coil stamps from continuous rolls of paper with the Rotary Press. The printing plates were curved and affixed around a <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder,</b> a process that stretched the images somewhat, making them slightly longer than similar images printed from a flat-plate. The difference in size becomes evident when the two different types are placed side by side.|$|E

It was easily manipulated by the thumb of the right hand, and upon release the cylinder could be poked out sideways with the shooter's forefinger. Empty cases were removed by simply pushing back on an ejector rod to activate a star extractor. The six-shooter could then be quickly reloaded and the cylinder clicked back into place.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of fibres make them easily manipulated by aerodynamic forces. The carding machine, used in cotton and wool processing, {{is an example}} of equipment that creates aerodynamic forces due to fast <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders</b> with rough surfaces. These forces are generally seen as an undesirable side effect in fibre processing machinery, exacerbated with modern equipment using faster rotating components. This work attempts to quantify these aerodynamic forces on carding machines used in the wool industry. A combination of boundary layer theory, experiments using hot wire anemometry and flow visualisation, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software (Fluent) was used to build up an understanding of aerodynamics in the example of wool carding machines. The theoretical and experimental work progressed along the following topics to determine each effect on carding machine aerodynamics: rough surfaces, centrifugal forces, three-dimensional edge effects, and interactions between <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Examples from each section were modelled using CFD, which was found to accurately simulate theoretical and experimental results in most cases. It could also accurately predict the complex two-dimensional airflow patterns occurring in carding machines. The CFD simulations underestimated the degree of turbulence generated by interactions between <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Three-dimensional effects were overestimated, due in part to attempting to apply the results of an oversimplified model to a full-scale carding machine. In undertaking this work, it was found the universal velocity distribution equations describing flow over flat plates (for both smooth and rough surfaces) could also be used for flow induced by <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders</b> by compensating for curvature effects...|$|R

We show that, upon varying the cylinder angular velocity ω, the system undergoes a hysteresis cycle between an intermittent and a continuous flow regimes. In the intermittent flow regime, and approaching the transition, the avalanche duration exhibits critical slowing down with a temporal power-law divergence. Upon adding a white noise term, {{and close to the}} transition, the distribution of avalanche durations is also a power-law. The hysteresis, as well as the statistics of avalanche durations, are in good qualitative agreement with recent experiments in partly filled <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Comment: 4 pages, RevTeX 3. 0, postscript figures 1, 3 and 4 appended...|$|R
500|$|Having {{some money}} saved and, still {{wanting to be}} an {{inventor}} {{as opposed to a}} [...] "medicine man", Colt made arrangements to begin building guns using proper gunsmiths from Baltimore, Maryland. He abandoned the idea of a multiple barreled revolver and opted for a single fixed barrel design with a <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The action of the hammer would align the cylinder bores with the single barrel. He sought the counsel of a friend of his father, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, who loaned him $300 and advised him to perfect his prototype before applying for a patent. Colt hired a gunsmith by the name of John Pearson to build his revolver. Over the next few years Colt and Pearson fought over money, but the design improved and in 1835 Colt was ready to apply for his U.S. patent. Ellsworth was now the superintendent of the U.S. Patent Office and advised Colt to file for foreign patents first as a prior U.S. patent would keep Colt from filing a patent in Great Britain. In August 1835, Colt left for England and France to secure his foreign patent.|$|E
500|$|ILM {{delivered}} the main Enterprise model, {{which was built}} by Magicam in 1978 for , [...] to Associates and Ferren. However, scenes which included the Enterprise in the Earth-orbiting Spacedock platform, {{as well as the}} Spacedock itself, were taken directly from ILM's previous work in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The Enterprise model had been damaged when it was loaned out for touring purposes, meaning the 30,000 panels on the model had to be repainted by hand. While production wrapped, Ferren continued work on the miniatures and other optical effects at his New Jersey studio. The opticals were completed in Manhattan before being sent west; for example, bluescreen footage of the motion controlled miniatures was filmed in Hoboken, New Jersey. In New York, the blue screen was replaced by a moving starfield— a single finished shot of a ship moving through space required as many as fifty pieces of film. The Great Barrier effects were created using chemicals, which were dropped into a large water tank to create swirls and other reactions. The [...] "God column", in which the false god appeared, was created by a rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder</b> through which light was shone; the result appeared on film as a column of light. Ferren used a beam splitter to project actor George Murdock's head into the cylinder, giving the appearance that the false god resided within the column.|$|E

Emile Berliner invented the familiar lateral-cut disc phonograph record in 1888. His design overtook the Edison phonograph in the 1920s, partly because Berliner's patent expired in 1918, leaving others free to use his invention.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the present work is to numerically analyze {{information}} complexity of the laminar chaotic mixing field produced by two parallel, <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders</b> from a viewpoint of optimization of mixing field. The new method for estimating complexity presented is based on the information theory and the nonlinear theory. A very simple flow system consisting of two parallel <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders</b> was investigated. A Poincaré section was constructed by tracing the trajectories of tracer particles in order to reveal the final mixing pattern. As a measure of spatial homogeneity of particle dispersion, information entropy was calculated. It has been found that the information entropy can suitably evaluate mixedness of laminar mixing fields. 1...|$|R

Special attention {{is given to the}} onset of various flow modes in tilted and partially filled system. The effect of the inclination angle was investigated on the different flow regimes occurring at fully and/ or partially filled space between two <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The flow behavior, the transitional phenomena and the features of various flow modes are discussed for different inclination angles, filling ratio and Taylor numbers. It is established that the different filling ratio and inclination angles of the Taylor-Couette system deeply affect the flow patterns. Furthermore, the most significant result concerns the relaminarization of the flow when the aspect ratio is decreased and inclination angle is increased for a given value of Taylor number...|$|R

Later models held 80 or 100 45 RPM records. In machines manufactured during the 1950's, the entire mechanism was visible to the user. Later machines concealed the actual player in favor of musical graphics and lights, but internally it was essentially the same mechanism.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Particle {{trajectory}} within <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{has been}} investigated in terms of radial positions by using the discrete element method (DEM). The dynamic information of particle groups has been obtained under {{a wide range of}} rotation speed by a method of particle marking and tracking. The results show a periodic way of inwards trend for particle motion within material bed. The period of particle motion {{is directly related to the}} rotation speed of the cylinder. However, the residence time of particles in the active layer shortens with periods, while that in the static zone prolongs. Moreover, the peak value of radial positions periodically decays, whereas the valley value periodically increases. This research laid a good foundation for further research on particle mixing and heat transport within the material bed in <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinders...</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} approach for explaining the globe effect {{comes from the}} technical journalist and optics specialist Walter E. Schön. He states that the observed effect is in fact not that of a rolling globe but that of a vertically <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The globe shape of the illusion seen by most observers is only because {{the field of view}} through the optical device is circular. This illusion of a <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder</b> during panning is caused by the horizontal movement of the image being (due to the angular magnification of the device) faster and more uniform (with less parallax) compared to the naked eye and also not corresponding to the felt rotational speed of the observer's head. When the brain tries to integrate these conflicting signals, it creates the perception that the image is moving slower at the left and right edges than in the middle, giving the illusion of a <b>rotating</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
