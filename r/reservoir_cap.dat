50|$|Since an engine's oil circulates at {{much higher}} {{pressures}} than its coolant, {{oil in a}} porous head {{has a tendency to}} gradually seep into the coolant galleries. A typical symptom of a porous head is usually a 'mayonnaise'-like substance forming somewhere inside the cooling system (usually, this can be found residing on the coolant <b>reservoir</b> <b>cap).</b> However, depending on the degree of porosity, symptoms of a porous head have a tendency to vary. Many C20XE operators have described the symptom as a curry-like residue or in more severe cases, a thick brown sludge which may overcome the entire cooling system. In such instances, engine oil will readily react with the sulfur in rubber components, hence quickly degrading coolant pipes and hoses to the point of failure. During the porous head debacle, GM faced bankruptcy - therefore dealers failed to recall affected models. Due in part, to the engine's immense prominence and demand, many businesses now specialize in the repair of porous GM C20XE/LET heads - by either sleeving the affected gallery or by injecting a polymer based substance into the porous region. Reportedly, a small number of total GM C20XE cylinder heads ever exhibited significant symptoms of porosity.|$|E

Surface expression of geothermal resources is provided by conduits through an impermeable <b>reservoir</b> <b>cap</b> and is therefore generally structurally controlled. Near North Bonneville the geologic formations that underlie potential drilling sites are the Eagle Creek formation and the Ohanpecosh Formation.

The Eocene-Oligiocene Ohanapecosh (Weigle) Formation in its nearest exposures to North Bonneville is composed of volcaniclastics and lava flows. The Ohanapecosh has been altered to zeolites and clays and is therefore well consolidated and impermeable.

Seismic AVOA (amplitude variation with offset and azimuth) tech-niques have been applied to map HTI anisotropy near the cap rock of the Weyburn field in southeast Saskatchewan, Canada, with the purpose of identifying potential fracture zones that may compromise seal integrity.

30|$|Uplift {{denudation}} greatly {{influences the}} hydrocarbon accumulation (damage). The burial {{depth of the}} stratum becomes shallower during uplift denudation, with changes in groundwater dynamic field conditions, the formation water nature, {{and the development of}} fracture systems. Strong hydrodynamic conditions will cause morphological changes in oil and gas reservoirs, changes in the oil (gas) interface position, and even the displacement of oil and gas in entrapments. Studies have shown that the deep formation water is generally slowly alternating and stagnation filtration water, with calcium chloride water as the main type, which gradually changes upwards to magnesium chloride and finally becomes sodium bicarbonate or sodium sulfate-type water. The groundwater is moveable, which is unfavorable for preservation. The uplift process is also accompanied by changes in the underground temperature–pressure field. The temperature is gradually lowered to the surface temperature to avoid the decomposition and breakage of oil and gas in the hydrocarbon source rock due to high temperature; the pressure is reduced and an extensive development of joint fissures of brittle rock is caused by the release of confining pressure, which can improve the transport conditions of shale gas and the porosity and permeability of reservoir. However, the trap preservation conditions of the oil and gas reservoir will be destroyed when the open fracture system is connected with the Earth’s surface. In addition, the oil and gas will dissipate upwards when the <b>reservoir</b> <b>cap</b> is eroded or the dip angle of some areas becomes larger, which is due to the weakened closure of the overlying strata.|$|E

In the northwest of the country, on the Pacific slope of the Rincon de la Vieja volcano, inside the Cañas Dulces caldera, the presence of thermal manifestations motivated the development of geoscientific studies that culminated with the drilling of 4 geothermal exploration wells to depths of 2078 – 2594 m, as part of the research that seeks to corroborate the existence of a commercially geothermal reservoir. A date has explored an area of 31 km 2 known as Borinquen where information on lithostratigraphy, mineralogy, electric resistivity and thermal gradients, {{as well as on the}} geochemical and isotopic composition of the fluids derived from the meteoric water, surface hydrothermal manifestation and exploration wells, was obtained. The distribution of the secondary mineral assemblages observed in the exploration wells suggests an increase in temperature with depth, which is confirmed by the distribution of the thermal gradient. The geoelectric structure hints at the existence of a cap rock and a geothermal reservoir, and the geochemistry and isotopic composition of the samples obtained from the exploration wells reveal the existence of neutral sodium chloride fluids with high enthalpy. This suggests exploitation could be economically viable, particularly in light of comparisons with similar reservoirs already being exploited in the neighbouring calderas of San Vicente and Guayabo.

The unique properties of these formations allows for the safe long-term storage of carbon dioxide. These intrinsic properties also give rise to numerous experiment complexities outside of the realm of traditional core characterization techniques. Samples were obtained to represent the main classes of cap rocks; shales from both a quarry in the UK and a Spanish carbon storage pilot site, anhydrite from UK extraction mines, and a evaporite sample from a reservoir located in the Middle East. An apparatus has been constructed capable of measuring the permeability and capillary threshold pressure of <b>reservoir</b> <b>cap</b> rocks. The pressure decay technique was used to measure the permeability relationship of clay-rich and evaporite samples with varying applied stresses was measured. Unique trends are observed for each geologic sample exhibiting minimums in permeability. The initial reduction of permeability as effective pressure was increased was due compaction and the subsequent increase at high stresses was due to the opening of micro-fractures. The capillary threshold pressures of each sample were determined using three different techniques. A novel technique takes advantage of the pressure decay permeability measurements technique in quantifying extremely small fluid volumes during initial sample drainage. Capillary threshold pressures were shown to also be dependant on applied system stress. The capillary threshold pressure was observed to decrease dramatically following the increase in permeability with further increasing effective pressure. Imaging capabilities were also explored, ranging from core scale to nanometre scale techniques. Computerized micro-tomography was used in plug sample evaluation, and in the observation of fractured system behaviour under varying stress. Scanning electron microscopy paired with focused ion beam milling was used to extract the 3 D pore space of the ceramic allowing for permeability estimates from numerical simulations.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} energy consumption, the progressive and fast depletion of hydrocarbon reserves, the environmental pollution, {{in addition to}} frequent political crises, have generated a global importance energy emergency. At the same time, the growth in energy production has to be ‘sustainable’, meaning a social and economic development respectful of the natural times and of {{the resources of the}} Planet. Within this general framework, {{one of the most important}} ‘renewable’ is the geothermal, being the energy originated from the heat released by the Earth. In the Country that launched the geothermal energy in the world, initiating the era of energy production from this source (Larderello 1904), the aim of this Ph. D. thesis is to investigate the less promising east side of Italy in a region with surface thermal manifestations, in order to characterize the potential geothermal system. The study area was identified in the Acquasanta anticline (Acquasanta Terme, Southern Marche Region, Central Italy), located within the foredeep Laga basin with low heat flow values and water temperatures ranging between 20 º C and 30 º C at surface. To achieve the purpose, we integrate different prospections (geochemical, seismic and structural) that allow for a comprehensive picture of the geothermal system. The model of a geothermal system characterized by water of meteoric origin flowing from south to north is proposed. Water infiltrates at altitudes ranging between 1400 m and 1700 m, identifying the recharge area with the Laga Mountains, located in the southernmost part of the anticline, about 30 km South of Acquasanta Terme. From geochemical data collected along more than one year of monitoring three “end – member” waters with different chemical features and circuits are defined. The first water type shows higher temperatures (25. 3 º C – 30. 0 º C), and salinity and chemical composition stable during time. It displays a clear contact with the Burano Anhydrites Fm and with carbonatic rocks, confirmed by Sr isotopic values. Furthermore, it has a residence time greater than sixty years (0 T. U.), indication of long circulation period, and no mixing with younger waters. Moreover, some indications (i. e. Rubidium) of a possible slight contribution from deep fluids are present. The second water end – member likely infiltrates at lower quotes than the previous one, following a shorter deep circuit within the same formations as suggested by ion concentrations. It was also recognized within the Varoni_ 1 deep well (AGIP s. p. a., 1987). The third type is inferable from samples distribution on correlation graphs and from identified mixing trends, characterized by warm temperature, but lower ions concentrations than the others. This water likely flows only within the Calcare Massiccio Fm, just interacting with anhydrites, probably following a slightly faster circuit. Except for the easternmost springs (first end – member), all the other collected springs are influenced by mixing phenomena both among the three end-members and also with surface freshwater. The lateral confinement of the easternmost springs and the peculiar mixing processes are strictly linked to the complex structural setting, in particular to N – S oriented faults. The reservoir is identified mainly within the Calcare Massiccio Fm (CM). In detail, by seismic interpretation, it is slightly N-plunging, following the anticline geometry, and laterally bounded by a N – S oriented thrust to the east, a related backthrust to the west, and by a WNW – ESE normal fault to the north. Its bottom depth ranges between 3000 m and 3800 m below the surface. A first estimation gives back a computed volume of about 66 km 3. The mentioned WNW – ESE extensional discontinuity is also considered to be the main rising conduit for the deep hot waters. In the final part of the fluid circuit, hot waters flow within the shallow reservoir of the Scaglia Rossa Fm (SR) creating relevant karst caves phenomena. Finally, all the thermal manifestations occur at the base of the low permeability Scaglia Cinerea Fm (<b>reservoir</b> <b>cap</b> rock), on the right bank of the Tronto River, as confirmed by relevant travertine deposits. Detailed quantitative structural analyses were performed both in the lower (CM) and shallower (SR) reservoirs, in order to create the DFN model and to compute their connectivity properties. In particular, for the CM buried reservoir, an analogue example has been used to perform the field analyses. The highest permeability is shown along the bottom up and the longitudinal directions, whose calculated permeability value is 0. 148 mDarcy. Moreover, fractured volume derived from these structural data allows to calculate an estimation of the total profit volume of the reservoir, resulting in 1. 32 km 3. Concerning the temperature reached by the system, K/Mg geothermometer applied on the most stable samples gives back an estimated temperature at the bottom of the reservoir (top of the Burano Anhydrites Fm) of about 90 º C, consistent with the normal geothermal gradient of the sedimentary Laga Basin...|$|E

The spatial parameters accurately recovered from each technique are applied in the adequate petrophysical equations to yield precise quantifications of gas saturations. Resulting models of gas saturations independently determined from elastic FWI and ERT techniques are in accordance {{with each other and}} with the input (true) saturation model. Moreover, the gravity technique show high sensitivity to the mass deficit resulting from the gas storage and can resolve saturations and temporal saturation changes down to ± 3 % after reducing any shallow fluctuation such as that of groundwater table.|$|R
25|$|Once Alberta's Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board began {{operating}} in 1938, the BA and Gas and Oil Products Limited plants {{had to change}} their operations significantly. Only Royalite had a market for its residue of gas stripped of liquids in the Canadian Western Natural Gas distribution system. The other two plants flared or burned off most of their residue gas until the board ruled that only wells connected to a market could be produced, stopping the practice. Since the rule applied only to wells that tapped the oil <b>reservoir's</b> overlying gas <b>cap,</b> the Hartell and Longview plants stayed in operation by processing solution gas, or gas dissolved in oil from the Valley's wells.|$|R
