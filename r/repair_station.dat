5|$|Research done in {{the early}} 1960s by Norwegian {{explorer}} Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, identified a Norse settlement located at {{the northern tip of}} Newfoundland. It has been suggested that this site, known as L'Anse aux Meadows, is Leif's settlement of Leifsbúðir. The Ingstads demonstrated that Norsemen had reached America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Later archaeological evidence suggests that Vinland may have been the areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence and that the L'Anse aux Meadows site was a ship <b>repair</b> <b>station</b> and waypoint for voyages there. That does not necessarily contradict the identification of L'Anse aux Meadows with Leifsbúðir since the two sagas appear to describe Vinland as a wider region which included several settlements. The Saga of Erik the Red mentions two other settlements in Vinland: a settlement called Straumfjǫrðr, which lay beyond Kjalarnes promontory and the Wonderstrands, and one called Hóp, which was located even farther south.|$|E

500|$|Leif Erikson or Leif Ericson ( [...] ; Icelandic: Leifur Eiríksson; Norwegian: Leiv Eiriksson [...] 970 – c. 1020) was a Norse {{explorer}} from Iceland.

According to the Sagas of Icelanders, he established a Norse settlement at Vinland, tentatively identified with the Norse L'Anse aux Meadows on {{the northern tip of}} Newfoundland in modern-day Canada.

Egnell died on June 22, 1900 from an accidental gun shot to his leg by his son, McDonald, five days earlier and was buried at the Liard Post near the mouth of the Dease River.

40|$|Given {{its role}} in {{regulating}} civil and military aviation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{is one of the}} most visible federal agencies to the general public. To fulfill its domestic and international aviation roles, the FAA must strike a balance between security and commercial interests and its own budget constraints. It is also an economic and intelligence target. While aviation security policy has evolved since 2001, policies designed to promote commerce and to facilitate overseas operations and maintenance by U. S. carriers and aerospace manufacturers have resulted in two entities that are especially vulnerable to insider activities: foreign <b>repair</b> <b>stations</b> and aircraft trusts. In particular, foreign <b>repair</b> <b>stations</b> and aircraft trusts pose tempting targets for criminal and terrorist activities (and activities of foreign government agents) because they present unique opportunities for exploitation and disruption by ill-intentioned insiders (e. g., terrorists, criminals, moles, foreign government agents, coerced accomplices, unwitting dupes, disgruntled employees/contractors). These entities are also vulnerable to actions of altruistic insiders (e. g., employees and contractors), however well-meaning. A tapestry of executive orders, presidential directives, regulations, and statutes creates the fabric of the FAA’s guidance and response to the insider threat posed by state and non-state actors. While the vulnerabilities of <b>repair</b> <b>stations</b> and trust arrangements differ widely, the common element is the role of individuals who have access by virtue of their jobs. While insiders may act for altruistic or nefarious reasons, regardless of whether they are state or non-state actors, there are effective measures which can be taken to counter the insider threat and improve security...|$|R
