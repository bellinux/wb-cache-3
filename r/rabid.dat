5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be <b>rabid.</b> The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really <b>rabid,</b> goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now <b>rabid.</b> The Master argues that the other dog was not <b>rabid</b> and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{benefited from}} a strong sports culture. On August 1, 2006, it was named Best Sports City in the US by Sporting News. Chicagoans are famous for their <b>rabid</b> support of their home teams: the Chicago Bears, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago Wolves, and more recently, Chicago Sky (WNBA), Chicago Fire, the Chicago Red Stars (the new women's soccer team), and the Chicago Machine.

5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of <b>rabid</b> animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more <b>rabid</b> fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E

5|$|The {{fan base}} went wild, and a riotous celebration {{gathered}} at Ebisu Bridge in Dōtonbori, Osaka. There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the <b>rabid</b> crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC and tossed it off the bridge as an effigy.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not <b>rabid</b> if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress {{are forced}} to muzzle Lad when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, Lad falls {{out of the car}} and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, Lad starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is <b>rabid,</b> but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Betelgeuse—envisioned by McDowell as a winged demon, who {{takes on the}} form of a short Middle Eastern man, is also intent on killing the Deetzes rather than scaring them, and wanted to rape Lydia rather than marry her. In this version of the script, Betelgeuse only needs to be exhumed from his grave to be summoned, after which he is free to wreak havoc; he cannot be summoned or controlled by saying his name three times, and wanders the world freely, appearing to torment different characters in different manifestations. McDowell's script also featured a second Deetz child, nine-year-old Cathy, the only person able to see the Maitlands and the subject of Betelgeuse's homicidal wrath in the film's climax, during which he mutilates her while in {{the form of a}} <b>rabid</b> squirrel before revealing his true form.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{historical}} records compiled by rural historian Jean-Marc Moriceau indicate {{that during the}} period 1362–1918, nearly 7,600 people were killed by wolves, of whom 4,600 were killed by non-rabid wolves. Numerous attacks occurred in Germany during the 17th century after the Thirty Years' War, though the majority probably involved <b>rabid</b> wolves. Although Italy has no records of wolf attacks after WWII and the eradication of rabies in the 1960s, historians examining church and administrative records from northern Italy's central Po Valley region (which includes a part of modern-day Switzerland) found 440 cases of wolves attacking people between the 15th and 19th centuries. The 19th century records show that between 1801-1825, there were 112 attacks, 77 of which resulted in death. Of these cases, only five were attributed to <b>rabid</b> animals. In Latvia, records of <b>rabid</b> wolf attacks go back two centuries. At least 72 people were bitten between 1992-2000. Similarly, in Lithuania, attacks by <b>rabid</b> wolves have continued to the present day, with 22 people having been bitten between 1989-2001. Around 82 people were bitten by <b>rabid</b> wolves in Estonia during the 18th to 19th centuries, with a further 136 people being killed {{in the same period}} by non-rabid wolves, though {{it is likely that the}} animals involved in the latter cases were a combination of wolf-dog hybrids and escaped captive wolves.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Disease Control and Prevention {{has warned}} about the rabies risk {{associated}} with feral cats. With 16% of people infected with rabies from exposure to <b>rabid</b> cats, cats have been the primary animals responsible for transmission of the virus to humans in the United States since the efforts to control rabies in dogs in the 1970s. In 2010, there were 303 <b>rabid</b> cats reported within the United States. Although some colony management programs involve administering rabies vaccines, the need to revaccinate every few years makes this challenging to maintain. Furthermore, lack of documentation can mean that contact with vaccinated feral cats may still require post-exposure treatment.|$|E

5000|$|The series {{takes place}} post-apocalypse, where a virus called [...] "Red Lung" [...] has wiped {{out most of}} humanity, leaving vampires to rule {{over most of the}} general populace. Those who survived the virus have either survived Red Lung or have been Turned into <b>Rabids,</b> a {{relative}} of vampires that were created during an experiment to find a cure for Red Lung. Most humans live within vampire cities, where a Wall surrounds and protects the population from <b>rabids.</b> Inside, there is another Wall to the Inner City. Inside of this Wall live the vampires and their human slaves, while outside, humans survive on their own. Under the rule of vampires, registered citizens are forced to give blood for the vampires once a month, but not all humans in the cities are Registered. Allison Sekemoto is an Unregistered, living on her own with a gang of four people. She can remain in the city and doesn't have to give blood to the vampires, but still faces starvation and violence from opposing Unregistered gangs.|$|R

25|$|Snow leopard {{attacks on}} humans are rare; only two {{instances}} are known. On July 12, 1940, in Maloalmaatinsk gorge near Almaty, a <b>rabid</b> snow leopard attacked two men {{during the day}} and inflicted serious injuries on both. In the second case, not far from Almaty, an old, toothless, emaciated snow leopard unsuccessfully attacked a passerby in winter; it was captured and carried to a local village. There are no other records of any snow leopard attacking a human being.|$|E
25|$|There were no written {{records of}} wolf attacks on humans {{prior to the}} European {{colonization}} of the Americas, though the oral history of some Indigenous American tribes confirms that wolves occasionally did kill humans. Tribes living in woodlands feared wolves more than their tundra-dwelling counterparts, as they could encounter wolves suddenly and at close quarters. Skepticism among North American scientists over the alleged ferocity of wolves began when Canadian biologist Doug Clark investigated historical wolf attacks in Europe and, based on his own experiences with the relatively timid wolves of the Canadian wilderness, concluded that all historical attacks were perpetrated by <b>rabid</b> animals, and that healthy wolves posed no threat to humans. Although his findings were later criticized for failing to distinguish between <b>rabid</b> and predatory attacks, {{and the fact that}} the historical literature contained instances of people surviving the attacks at a time when there was no rabies vaccine, his conclusions were nonetheless adopted by other North American biologists. This view subsequently gained popularity among laypeople with the publication of Farley Mowat's semi-fictional 1963 book Never Cry Wolf, with the language barrier hindering the collection of further data on wolf attacks elsewhere. Although some North American biologists were aware of wolf attacks in Eurasia, they dismissed them as irrelevant to North American wolves.|$|E
