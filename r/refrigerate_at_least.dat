40|$|I Abstract] Ethyl ether was {{detected}} {{in the blood of}} a deceased individual who had inhaled it from a mask while hanging himself. This case led to an investigation into the stability of ether in stored blood samples as described herein. Ether was spiked, at three concentrations, into batches of porcine blood. The blood was apportioned into grey-stoppered collection tubes and stored refrigerated until analysis. The concentration of ether in the blood was assessed at intervals over a two-month period. Analysis was performed by headspace gas chromatography. This study has shown, for a concentration range of 0. 1 to 5. 0 mg/mL, ether is stable in preserved, <b>refrigerated</b> blood for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two months...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{series of}} studies was {{performed}} to test the efficacy and safety of a parenteral lipid emulsion, Lipofundin S, when given {{as part of a}} complete nutritive mixture from the three-liter bag total parenteral nutrition (TPN) delivery sys-tem. In vitro stability studies with mixtures corresponding to high and low nutritional intakes showed the fat emulsion to be stable during <b>refrigerated</b> storage for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 6 days. The clinical use of Lipofundin S in 3 -liter TPN bags was studied in 39 consecutive patients requiring TPN, and there were no untoward side-effects. Nitrogen balance was maintained in patients with pancreatitis, those recovering postoperatively, and those with miscellaneous conditions. However, patients with multiple trauma remained in negative balance. The ability of sera, from patients on TPN to agglutinate Lipofundin S was compared to that from healthy controls, and acutely ill patient...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cefazolin is a semisynthetic {{penicillin}} derivative with {{a narrow}} spectrum of activity covering some gram-positive organisms and a few gram-negative aerobic bacteria. Objective: To determine the physical and chemical stability of cefazolin sodium reconstituted with sterile water for injection and stored in polypropylene syringes or diluted with either 5 % dextrose in water (D 5 W) or 0. 9 % sodium chloride (normal saline [NS]) and stored in polyvinylchloride (PVC) minibags. Methods: Reconstituted solutions of cefazolin (100 or 200 mg/mL) were packaged in polypropylene syringes. More dilute solutions (20 or 40 mg/mL) were prepared in D 5 W or NS and packaged in PVC minibags. For each concentration–diluent–container combination, 3 containers were designated for each day of analysis (days 7, 14, 21, and 30). Containers were stored under refrigeration (5 °C) with protection from light until the designated day of analysis, at which time one 5 -mL sample was collected from each the designated container. The designated containers were then stored at room temperature (21 °C to 25 °C) with exposure to light for an additional 72 h, and additional samples were drawn. The samples were assayed using a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. The colour and clarity of the solutions, {{as well as their}} pH, were also monitored on each sampling day. Results: All samples remained clear {{for the duration of the}} study; they had a slight yellow colour that darkened over time, and there was an increase in pH. Solutions diluted with sterile water for injection and stored in polypropylene syringes retained <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 94. 5 % of the initial concentration after 30 days of <b>refrigerated</b> storage and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 92. 1 % after an additional 72 h at room temperature with exposure to light.

Conclusions: Cefazolin at various concentrations stored in polypropylene syringes or PVC minibags was stable for up to 30 days with storage at 5 °C with protection from light, followed by an additional 72 h at 21 °C to 25 °C with exposure to light...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{nutritional}} and immunological {{qualities of}} human milk from Hong Kong mothers were profiled. Methods: A total of 25 colostrum (≤ 3 days postpartum) and 11 mature (30 - 45 days postpartum) milk specimens {{were collected from}} healthy Chinese women in Hong Kong. Parameters including total protein, whey, casein, triglycerides, lactose, lysozyme, secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin and antibacterial activity of human milk were quantified. Result: Breast milk of Hong Kong Chinese mothers is nutritionally {{comparable to that of}} western mothers for colostrum and mature milk, with protein (25. 0 ± 11. 3. g/l vs 10. 1 ± 1. 4. g/l) and lactose (44. 2 ± 7. 5. g/l vs 66. 6 ± 5. 5. g/l) for growth and energy supply in infants, respectively. The milk of Hong Kong mothers is however characterized by its exceptionally high levels of sIgA (806. 3 ± 792. 6. mg/dl and 1545. 9 ± 334. 6. mg/dl) and low levels of triglycerides (10. 8 ± 9. 3. mmol/l and 11. 1 ± 7. 7. mmol/l). The human milk in Hong Kong was also shown to be superior to bovine formula milk, particularly in terms of lower total protein level, the high whey to casein protein ratio, rich immunological active contents, and significant antibacterial activity against 2 common Escherichia coli strains. Conclusions: Preliminary data also indicated that mature milk could be <b>refrigerated</b> for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 3 days {{in order to maintain the}} major nutritional constituents and antibacterial activity.

40|$|We {{formulated}} PA- 824, a nitroimidazopyran with {{promise for}} the treatment of tuberculosis, for efficient aerosol delivery to the lungs in a dry powder porous particle form. The objectives of this study were to prepare and characterize a particulate form of PA- 824, assess the stability of this aerosol formulation under different environmental conditions, and determine the pharmacokinetic parameters for the powder after pulmonary administration. The drug was spray dried into porous particles containing a high drug load and possessing desirable aerosol properties for efficient deposition in the lungs. The physical, aerodynamic, and chemical properties of the dry powder were stable at room temperature for 6 months and under <b>refrigerated</b> conditions for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1 year. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in guinea pigs after the pulmonary administration of the PA- 824 powder formulation at three doses (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg of body weight) and compared to those after the intravenous (20 mg/kg) and oral (40 mg/kg) delivery of the drug. Oral and inhaled delivery of PA- 824 achieved equivalent systemic delivery at the same body dose within the first 12 h of dosing. However, animals dosed by the pulmonary route showed drug loads that remained locally in the lungs for 32 h postexposure, whereas those given the drug orally cleared the drug more rapidly. Therefore, we expect from these pharmacokinetic data that pulmonary delivery may achieve the same efficacy as oral delivery at the same body dose, with a potential improvement in efficacy related to pulmonary infection. This may translate into the ability to deliver lower body doses of this drug {{for the treatment}} of tuberculosis by aerosol...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} a variety factors on the {{survival}} of several rhizobia strains on inoculants and inoculated seeds has been evaluated. Since the rhizobia strains showed different cell-density-evolution patterns on peat-based inoculants and on inoculated seeds, several inoculant formulations with highly effective Rhizobium/ Bradyrhizobium strains (for Lupinus, Hedysarum, Phas-eolus and Glycine max.) were monitored under the following storage conditions: (a) the inoculants were kept <b>refrigerated</b> (<b>at</b> 4 C), or (b) at room temperature (25 C). The effect of water content (30 – 50 %, w/w) in the inoculants {{as well as that}} of several seed-coating adhesives were also investigated. Alternative carriers including perlite and vermiculite were tested. For all of the strains, survival on sterile peat-based inoculants was higher than on the corresponding unsterile peat formu-lation; for the latter, refrigerated storage conditions are recommended to ensure high bacterial densities. The water content of the inoculants had a differential effect on strain survival depending on the sterility of the peat, such that a high water content was more detrimental when unsterilized peat was employed. The best adherent for rhizobia survival was a gum arabic/water solution. Perlite was as effective as peat in maintaining a high population of rhizobia, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> for 6 months of storage...|$|R
