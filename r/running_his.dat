5|$|Villeneuve started {{competitive}} {{driving in}} local drag-racing events, entering his road car, a modified 1967 Ford Mustang. He was soon bored by this {{and entered the}} Jim Russell Racing School at Le Circuit Mont Tremblant to gain a racing licence. He then had a very successful season in Quebec regional Formula Ford, <b>running</b> <b>his</b> own two-year-old car and winning seven of the ten races he entered. The next year he progressed to Formula Atlantic, competing there for four years, <b>running</b> <b>his</b> own car again {{for one of those}} seasons. He won his first Atlantic race in 1975 at Gimli Motosport Park in heavy rain. In 1976, teamed with Chris Harrison's Ecurie Canada and factory March race engineer Ray Wardell, he dominated the season by winning {{all but one of the}} races and taking the US and Canadian titles. He won the Canadian championship again in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 he {{was still}} doing {{engineering}} work for his former employers, who were beset with manufacturing problems and a shortage of engine-erectors. He was also <b>running</b> <b>his</b> own business engaged in general millwrighting and was still called upon by various Manchester engine owners who preferred to use his services for their machine erection and maintenance needs than those of Boulton and Watt. He had moved to New Street, Hanover Street and in December 1799 {{was appointed to the}} position of conductor of firemen and inspector of engines by the Manchester police commissioners, positions which effectively put him in charge of the fire brigade. One source– the one considered unreliable by Chaloner– has stated that he had held the position for 20 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on <b>running</b> <b>his</b> airline company.|$|E

5|$|Junior Johnson, {{owner of}} one of the top NASCAR teams, {{approached}} Kulwicki {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 season to try to get him to replace Terry Labonte in the No. 11 Budweiser Ford. Kulwicki declined, stating that he was more interested in <b>running</b> <b>his</b> own team. He won his second Cup race at Rockingham on October 21, 1990, and finished eighth in points that year, his first finish in the top10 points in a season. In 29races, he had thirteen top10 finishes and onepole position.|$|E
5|$|McKinley's good {{standing}} with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions thought he could attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while <b>running</b> <b>his</b> own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff, defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{refused to}} turn professional, and {{continued}} running as amateur in Finland. In 1933, {{he ran his}} first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost. The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds {{in violation of the}} IAAF amateur code. With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career. In cross country <b>running,</b> <b>his</b> win streak lasted 19 years.|$|E

While working at the store he sold many supplies to the local Native Americans and learned some Chinook jargon from them.|$|E
5|$|The male wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male will enter the female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The Courtship process consists of the male bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by <b>running</b> <b>his</b> palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E

5|$|The race, {{the sixth}} of the season, began at 3:30p.m. EST, and was {{televised}} {{live in the}} United States on ABC. Scott Dixon held his lead from pole position, with Will Power behind him. Justin Wilson made light contact with a wall during the first lap of the race, and pitted shortly after due to a flat right-rear tire. The team discovered additional damage to the suspension that required lengthy repairs, but {{he was able to}} return to the race. During the fifth lap, some teams reported that parts of the track were deteriorating, but it was not felt that any action needed to be taken. Three laps later, Rubens Barrichello, who had gained four places started suffering mechanical problems, which forced him to retire from the race after eleven laps. Wilson set the fastest lap of the race during the ninth lap, completing a circuit in 1 minute 12.0651 seconds. On lap 10, Ryan Hunter-Reay blocked Ryan Briscoe from passing him, drawing a warning from race director Beaux Barfield. Sébastien Bourdais, who, along with Alex Tagliani and Oriol Servia, was <b>running</b> <b>his</b> first street race of the season without a Lotus engine, had made it to seventh before suffering mechanical problems which curtailed his race after 24 laps. James Jakes, who was suffering from problems with his brakes throughout {{the early part of the}} race eventually retired on lap 36, having spent ten laps in the pits earlier trying to resolve the issue.|$|E
