Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending scapular fracture against Wake Forest {{and missed the}} last six games. Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively. Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for the starting position during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his first <b>real</b> <b>action</b> in the bowl game. Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy was put {{out for the season}} by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.|$|E

She trained for five weeks before an open spot on the company's tour gave her the opportunity to debut. She debuted on the Northwest Territories independent circuit on February 22, 2002. She wrestled for Can-Am Wrestling in early 2002 and was awarded the Can-Am Wrestling Women's Championship upon her debut in the promotion. That July, she joined <b>Real</b> <b>Action</b> Wrestling under the ring name Sweet Sarah, in the Canadian Maritimes as a valet to Johnny Wiseguy. Soon after, she began wrestling in the promotion, teaming with Wiseguy {{in a series of}} mixed tag team matches against Duke MacIsaac and his valet, Rachel. The promotion soon folded, but Stock signed with MainStream Wrestling (MSW) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she debuted in August 2002 and continued to wrestle as Sweet Sarah. There were few female wrestlers in the area, so she worked in several matches against male wrestlers.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} whether different processes {{might be}} at play during pretence understanding by examining breakdowns of performance in participants with acquired brain damage. In Experiment 1 patients with frontal or parietal lesions and neurologically intact adults were asked to categorize videos of pretend and <b>real</b> <b>actions.</b> In Experiment 2 participants saw three types of videos: <b>real</b> intentional <b>actions,</b> <b>real</b> accidental <b>actions,</b> and pretend actions. In one session they judged whether the actions they saw were intentional or accidental, and in a second session they judged whether the <b>actions</b> were <b>real</b> or pretend. Parietal patients had particular difficulties {{in the identification of}} pretend actions, and both parietal and frontal patients were more impaired than controls in understanding the intentional nature of pretence. Analyses of individual patients' performance revealed that parietal lesions, and in particular lesions to the temporo-parietal junction, impaired the ability to discriminate pretend from <b>real</b> <b>actions.</b> However, this did not necessarily affect the discrimination of intentional from unintentional actions, which instead may be independently disrupted by damage to frontal areas. Moreover, spared ability to discriminate pretend <b>actions</b> from <b>real</b> <b>actions,</b> and intentional actions from accidental actions, did not grant a full conceptual understanding of the intentional nature of pretence. The implications for pretence understanding are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Although outnumbered and {{occasionally}} checked by the stand of some Union brigades, the three Confederate brigades in action first drove the four Union brigades, three from Ayres's division {{and one from}} Crawford's, back across Gravelly Run. Then Stansel's brigade drove back Union Brigadier General Henry Baxter's brigade and a reformed part of Colonel James Gwyn's brigade still forward of Gravelly Run. The forward Union regiments of Baxter's brigade fell back to find {{the remainder of the}} brigade had retreated. In an effort to rally Crawford's division, since {{it was too late to}} stop Ayres's division's retreat, Warren himself also came forward, grabbed a regimental flag and tried unsuccessfully to rally the retreating Union men. Warren's heroic effort was to no avail and he retreated across the creek, stopped the panic and had the scattered regiments reform behind Griffin's division. The last organized resistance across Gravelly Run was Colonel John A. Kellogg's brigade of Crawford's division which was driven back after a fighting retreat. Four Confederate brigades, only three of which saw any <b>real</b> <b>action</b> against V Corps divisions, had thrown back two Union divisions of over 5,000 men.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Campbell denounced Nazi Germany and returned to Britain. He did duty as an Air Raid Precautions warden in London. During this period he met and befriended Dylan Thomas, a fellow alcoholic, with whom he once ate a vase of daffodils in celebration of St. David's Day. Although he was over draft age and in bad physical shape, as well as having a bad hip, Campbell finally managed to get enlisted in the British Army. He was accepted by the Intelligence Corps because of his knowledge of languages and began training as a private with the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 1 April 1942. Having completed basic training, Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles. In February 1943 he was promoted to sergeant, and in March he was posted to British East Africa. On 5 May, he arrived in Nairobi and was attached to the King's African Rifles, serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor he was transferred in June to the 12th Observation Unit of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Japanese. However, any hope of seeing <b>real</b> <b>action</b> in the Far East was thwarted when Campbell during training in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle. He was sent back to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active duty.|$|E
25|$|Ulyett {{also played}} in the first-ever Test match, staged at the MCG, during that tour. His first <b>real</b> <b>action</b> in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just {{a quarter of an}} hour before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes—but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and {{effectively}} brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). This amazing effort finally came to an end when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A short delay revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from the pain in his bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion—bowled), he faced just nine deliveries.|$|E

30|$|The {{results from}} {{research}} by Barton et al. (2010) into the earnings management choices of ethical firms indicates {{a more nuanced}} view on the EM-CSR relationship. Using several proxies of CSR and EM, including abnormal levels of accruals, cash flows, inventory production, and discretionary expenses, they find that ethical firms, alike regular firms, manage earnings. However, ethical firms do so primarily through <b>real</b> <b>actions</b> rather than accounting choices, and with the objectives of meeting analysts’ earnings forecasts and reducing financing and tax costs, rather than opportunistically increasing management’s compensation or equity stakes. Barton et al.’s findings suggest that whether firms view EM as ethical depends on the manner and reasons for managing earnings. CSR-oriented firms legitimize EM through using <b>real</b> <b>actions</b> rather than accounting choices, but apparently only to increase shareholders’ rather than managers’ wealth.|$|R

500|$|Hijo de hombre builds upon {{a system}} of Christian metaphors {{as part of the}} Neobaroque concept of Magic Realism, in order to examine the pain of being Paraguayan.
