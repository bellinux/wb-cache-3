We propose to integrate the robust design concept into game theory protocols, in particular the Stackelberg leader/follower protocol. Specifically, the solution for the design parameters which involve the coupled information between multiple players (disciplines) is developed as a range of solutions rather than a single point solution. This additional flexibility provides more freedom to the discipline that takes the role of follower, while also keeping the perf [...] ...|$|E

What distinguishes cases where conflicts have been successfully resolved from the stalled deals? Are revisions of state water law a necessary or desirable means for dealing with third-party issues, or should solutions be left to local institutions? We begin with some background on the water market and the rise in local resistance to it...|$|E
40|$|The United States Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s Fifth and Sixth Amendments {{protect the}} rights of {{criminal}} defendants and witnesses. The Fifth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s privilege against self-incrimination protects witnesses from forced self-incrimination, and the Sixth Amendment provides criminal defendants with the right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses. These fundamental rights conflict when a prosecution witness invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege on cross-examination or when a defense witness invokes the privilege on direct-examination. A grant of either use or transactional immunity would remove the potential for self-incrimination, but courts are split on whether they possess the authority to grant such immunity to defense witnesses. This Note examines the judicial approaches to <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, and it analyzes the factors that favor and those that oppose a grant of immunity to defense witnesses.

40|$|Born in Columbus, Georgia, Carson McCullers was a Southerner by circumstance, but she {{maintained}} an emotional and psychological {{attachment to the}} South throughout her life. Her choice of a Southern setting with Southern characters for almost all of her works of fiction illustrates that the place off her birth commanded an unmistakable influence on her creative imagination. Therefore, the major Southern themes of place [...] the burden off the past, the antipathy toward change, the formal versus the formless existence, and the preference for objects rather than ideas-abound in her fiction. She utilizes those themes consistently to establish the significance of physical place in her fiction. Simultaneously, a second concept of place is operant in the McCullers fiction [...] the metaphysical sense of place. The duality between the physical and the metaphysical is evident throughout the McCullers canon {{from one of her}} earliest untitled stories to Clock Without Hands, her final novel. The early story of the girl who stands outside the gates of a convent and dreams of a marvelous party inside is the first manifestation of that duality. The short fiction incorporates an especially stringent duality. Like the convent gates, the boundaries of the South represent a formidable barrier against the outside world. An either/or dichotomy emerges in the short fiction which contrasts the South to non-Southern locales, particularly New York City. Mrs. McCullers' first novel, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter introduces the physical/metaphysical dichotomy of place in which several characters, especially Mick Kelly, find the physical locale undesirable and long for a more satisfying place. Reflections in a Golden Lye presents an extension of physical/metaphysical dichotomy since the rigidly defined boundaries of the army base setting {{are similar to those of}} a small Southern town. The lever/beloved dichotomy in The Ballad of the Sad Cafe is simply an embellishment on the physical/metaphysical duality. The Member of the Wedding, Carson McCullers' most realistic novel, comes close to blending the physical and the metaphysical sense of place. Frankie Addams finds an answer to her metaphysical search for place in Mary Little-John. Mrs. McCullers brings the prototype convent story to its ultimate happy ending in Clock Without Hands by <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> the physical and the metaphysical search for place. In the character of Jester Clane, the author presents a happy fusion off the two conflicting philosophies. He proves that one can open the gates of the convent, enjoy the marvelous party, and return to the physical world with new wisdom and commitment. He finds his metaphysical sense of place by conquering the burden of the past, by overcoming the antipathy toward and by rising above his formless adolescence to become formal, fully developed adult who can transcend the coercive codes of the confined community.

40|$|The 1990 s {{and early}} 2000 s {{witnessed}} {{some of the}} largest cross-border acquisitions in business history. This thesis studies how key management control actors experienced the integration processes following two cross-border acquisitions. The overall purpose is to study a particular management control model following an acquisition of two foreign multinationals and following an acquisition by a foreign multinational. A subset of three research questions is developed for these purposes: 1) to examine the actors’ experiences regarding possible contradictions and their consequences; 2) to unravel actors’ responses to conformity pressures; and 3) to illustrate the major elements and forces that thwart or enable integration. The large size of the organizations, the two-fold direction of the acquisitions, the assumed significant cultural differences, and the length of the examined process (over six years in Case 1 and seven years in Case 2) contribute to new findings. The study is based on a pragmatic (re-) constructivist research approach where key actors’ narratives and their sense-making are the core elements. The fieldwork is based on 22 interviews with key actors in Case 1 and 28 interviews in Case 2. The findings from the study illustrate that management control problems are behavioral problems that are most obvious in cross-cultural settings when organizations are growing through acquisitions. Management control is described by actors as models that consist of a collection of ideas, assumptions and frameworks rather than as physical elements. As a result, the work following such acquisitions is often something other than real integration. Rational integration frameworks then rarely help; nor can integration be forced upon the acquired entity by means of coercive power. Real legitimacy is needed in order to achieve most changes. The primary factors that makes the difference are the power of the rhetoric used to support the management control models and the skill of the finance actors (advocates) who wish to persuade and convince other actors (guardians) of the strengths and advantages of a given model. Hence, an acquirer’s management control model and its advocates cannot defeat an acquired entity’s model and its guardians if the acquirer’s model and its rhetorical/persuasive powers are weaker. Moreover, management control knowledge in organizations is often tacit knowledge. Therefore, as long as actors do not recognize the same management control models and do not apply the same worldview and logic, all tacit knowledge has to be made clear and ‘visible’ before it can be communicated to new members of the new entity. Otherwise, new members will not understand the new model and will not accept it. Interpretation and translation of management control models are therefore major drivers in creating a common management control language of clarified images and shared meaning and understanding. This in turn requires direct contact between actor groups: direct interaction and direct communication. Management control is not a ‘technical rational’ area where there is universal agreement on its benefits. Additionally, the conflicts resulting from two competing management control models can probably never be totally resolved in a rational way because the resulting problems and situations, following cross-border acquisitions, are often complex and interwoven. From a purely financial perspective, it is difficult to weigh the pros and cons involved with making management control system changes. Therefore, in most cases, the subjective judgments and common sense of actors are crucial in this process of deciding if, how, and why one choice is better than another. The actors’ socio-economic ‘inherent’ logic and their personal and company values must play a major role during such post-acquisition work. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} the best solution to <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> competing management control models is to make gradual changes, using negotiation strategies and applying strong rhetorical/persuasive methods in an environment that recognizes the importance of the participation of the actors involved. institutionalization, contradiction...|$|E
