40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{organisms are}} {{attacked}} by multiple natural enemies, {{the evolution of}} a resistance mechanism to one natural enemy will be influenced by the degree of cross-resistance to another natural enemy. Cross-resistance can be positive, when a <b>resistance</b> mechanism <b>against</b> one natural enemy also offers resistance to another; or negative, {{in the form of a}} trade-off, when an increase in <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> one natural enemy results in a decrease in <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> another. Using Drosophila melanogaster, an important model system for the evolution of invertebrate immunity, we test for the existence of cross-resistance against parasites and pathogens, at both a phenotypic and evolutionary level. METHODS: We used a field strain of D. melanogaster to test whether surviving parasitism by the parasitoid Asobara tabida has an effect on the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> Beauveria bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus; and whether infection with the microsporidian Tubulinosema kingi has an effect on the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> A. tabida. We used lines selected for increased resistance to A. tabida to test whether increased parasitoid resistance has an effect on <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> B. bassiana and T. kingi. We used lines selected for increased tolerance against B. bassiana to test whether increased fungal resistance has an effect on <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> A. tabida. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: We found no positive cross-resistance or trade-offs in the resistance to parasites and pathogens. This is an important finding, given the use of D. melanogaster as a model system for the evolution of invertebrate immunity. The lack of any cross-resistance to parasites and pathogens, at both the phenotypic and the evolutionary level, suggests that evolution of <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> one class of natural enemies is largely independent of evolution of <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> the other...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the composition of}} protocols that share a common secret. This situation arises when users employ the same password on different services. More precisely we study whether <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> guessing attacks composes when the same password is used. We model guessing attacks using a common definition based on static equivalence in a cryptographic process calculus close to the applied pi calculus. We show that <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> guessing attacks composes {{in the presence of}} a passive attacker. However, composition does not preserve <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> guessing attacks for an active attacker. We therefore propose a simple syntactic criterion under which we show this composition to hold. Finally, we present a protocol transformation that ensures this syntactic criterion and preserves <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> guessing attacks. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this work, model {{structures}} coextruded from polyolefin {{materials with}} different <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> elastic and plastic deforma- tion (tensile modulus {{and work of}} deformation up to the yield point) as well as different <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> stable crack initiation and propagation were experimentally analyzed using the multiple-specimen crack resistance (R) curve approach under quasistatic loading conditions. Additionally, numerical calculations were done using the finite element method. R curve ratios were calculated where the R curve of material 1 in the bilayer {{was related to the}} R curve of material 1 in the single-layer and so on. Depending on the mechanical performance of both layers, the additional layer highly affects the crack propagation kinetics inside the first layer when the crack propagates across the bilayered structure. Because the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> stable crack propagation is related to {{the size and shape of}} the plastic zone and the energy dissipated inside, the mismatch of the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> stable crack propagation (R curve ratios) is highly correlated to the mismatch of the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> plastic deformation...|$|R
