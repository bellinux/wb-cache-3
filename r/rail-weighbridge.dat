Compared with the static rail-weighbridge,it is more convenient to complete the weighing task,because the vehicles are always moving in the process and need not to stop for weighing. This article brings up a new set of dynamic <b>rail-weighbridge</b> system,which could conduct data-acquiring of the trains ’ dynamic data first,then process the information and at last auquire the trains’weight,the speed and other functional parameters,when the trains passed through the the weighing platform. During the later processing of the data,the algorithm makes use of the mechanics and figures out the weight of the trains,considering the swing or vibration from different orientations of each carriage and the deformation of the steel rails when the rails passes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{weighing}} {{plays an}} important part in many fields of applications: Large quantities of commodities and raw materials are handled in trading centres using automatic belt weighers or totalizing hopper weighers for bulk-to-bulk weighing, smaller quantities of commodities being meant for end users are automatically filled and weighed by gravimetric filling instruments, by catchweighers or checkweighers. Commodities transported on vehicles or by rail are often weighed automatically by in-motion road vehicle weighing instruments or automatic <b>rail-weighbridges,</b> respectively. New developments and measurement techniques are especially observed in the field of waste disposal, weighing of container wagons in cross-border traffic, shovel dozers for weighing building materials, and automation of processes in the food and non-food industry. This paper is intended to give a survey {{on the state of the}} art in automatic weighing and on international efforts (eg. OIML) towards harmonization of specifications and test procedures for automatic weighing instruments...|$|R
