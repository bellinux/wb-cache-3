5|$|Nebraska widened {{its lead}} with a 33-yard {{touchdown}} run six {{minutes into the}} second half, but Tech answered <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score was the closest they would get to a lead as Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} onslaught {{continued in}} the second half, though it was California that took the advantage at first. Bolstered by an improved defensive effort that held the Hokies scoreless throughout the third quarter, California, behind quarterback Aaron Rodgers, scored 21 unanswered points to take a 42–28 lead into the fourth quarter. But in that quarter, the Hokies clawed back into competition. Tech scored a touchdown to begin the quarter, but Cal answered <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> one of its own, making the score 49–35. The Hokies then evened the score at 49–49 after an 80-yard drive that took {{less than two minutes}} and a punt return by DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. With time running out, Cal still had a chance to drive for a game-winning score. The post-score Tech kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Bears possession at their 35-yard line. Cal needed just sevenplays to march 47yards to set up the game-winning field goal. As time expired, kicker Tyler Frederickson kicked a 35-yard field goal try to give California the 52–49 win.|$|E
5|$|UCF got {{the ball}} to start the game at their nine-yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return, and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an {{efficient}} drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6/7 passing for 65 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson. Penn State took over and got two first downs, the latter of which as a fourth down conversion, before a 44-yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6-yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game. Penn State moved the ball on their next drive, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position, with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58-yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14–7 UCF. Penn State's special teams responded with a 44-yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis, but their offense went three-and-out, and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory, the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21–7. On Penn State's ensuing drive, Sam Ficken kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal. UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive, but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27, 2012 with 1:17 in the half, but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season, a 57-yard try as time expired. At the half, UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards, compared to 220 total yards for Penn State with only 89 rushing yards. Penn State {{got the ball}} to start the second half, but punted on their first drive. UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25-yard pass. Penn State came <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a touchdown of their own. UCF's ensuing drive {{brought them to the}} one yard line, but Penn State held them to a field goal, making the score 31–17. Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State's next drive, and Shawn Moffitt kicked his second field goal of the game. Penn State drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5:43 remaining in the game. UCF went three-and-out, and on their punt, the snap went over the punter's head, and Penn State got the ball at the UCF 25. Penn State took advantage, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left. Penn State needed to regain possession of the ball after the score, and failed to do so, so ultimately UCF held on to win by three.|$|E

25|$|Coming {{off their}} home {{win over the}} Lions, the Seahawks flew to the University of Phoenix Stadium for a Week 10 NFC West rematch with the Arizona Cardinals. Seattle took flight {{in the first quarter}} as running back Justin Forsett got an 11-yard {{touchdown}} run. The Seahawks would add onto their lead in the second quarter with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Carlson. The Cardinals would answer with quarterback Kurt Warner completing a 28-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Breaston, yet Seattle came <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 32-yard field goal from kicker Olindo Mare.

25|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their divisional home {{loss to the}} Cardinals, the Seahawks flew to Cowboys Stadium for a Week 8 {{showdown}} with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Seattle struck first as kicker Olindo Mare got a 43-yard field goal. However, the Cowboys answered with quarterback Tony Romo's 36-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sam Hurd. Dallas would increase their lead {{in the second quarter}} with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Marion Barber. The Seahawks would reply with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completing a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Deion Branch, but Dallas came <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> Romo finding wide receiver Roy Williams on a 7-yard touchdown pass.|$|E
25|$|Both teams {{started off}} with drives that would {{set the tone for}} the rest of the game. New York got the ball first and drove to midfield before losing it when Glenn Blackwood intercepted Todd's pass. On the first play after the turnover, Miami gave the ball <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a pass that was picked off by Jets safety Ken Schroy. In the second quarter, Dolphins quarterback David Woodley broke free for a 17-yard run to his 39-yard line, which turned out to be the longest run of the day for either team. However, running back Tony Nathan lost a fumble on the next play, though the Jets still failed to get any points with a {{possession}} starting at the Miami 41.|$|E

25|$|Jacksonville {{was forced}} to punt on their opening drive, and Russell Copeland {{returned}} the ball 16 yards to the Jags 43-yard line, setting up Kelly's 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Thurman Thomas. But later in the quarter, Jacksonville defensive end Clyde Simmons intercepted a shovel pass intended for Thomas and returned it 20 {{yards for a touchdown}} to tie the game. Buffalo stormed <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 10-play, 68-yard drive that ended with Thomas' 2-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–7. However, Jacksonville running back Natrone Means' 62-yard carry on their next drive moved the ball to the Bills 5-yard line. The drive stalled there, but Mike Hollis kicked a 27-yard field goal to make the score 14–10 {{at the end of the}} first quarter.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{opened the}} second half with a score on a 21-yard pass from Locker to Devin Aguilar. Cal responded on the ensuing {{possession}} for their only score of {{the second half}} on a 22-yard touchdown pass from Riley to Nyan Boateng. The Huskies came <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a scoring drive on their own on a 13-yard pass from Locker to Aguilar. The Bears were unable to capitalize on a 65-yard kickoff return by Isi Sofele and a fourth down conversion attempt was halted at the Washington 13-yard line with six and a half minutes left in the third quarter. The Huskies shut down the Bear offense {{for the rest of the}} game, recovering two fumbles by Riley in the fourth quarter and scoring late in the game on a 10-yard run by Chris Polk.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, the Kenya Cricket Association was disbanded and {{replaced}} by Cricket Kenya. The rebuilding process {{was in full swing}} as Kenya began playing ODI cricket again.

This was followed by a four match ODI series against Bangladesh, with Kenya losing all four matches in that series. Their 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup campaign got off to a poor start with a draw against the Netherlands and a defeat to Canada, but they bounced <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> two ODI wins over Canada at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club. Bangladesh toured Kenya in August, winning all three ODIs, before an Intercontinental Cup draw against Bermuda and three ODI wins over Bermuda.|$|E

25|$|The Steelers {{jumped to}} an early 3–0 lead with a 32-yard field goal by Gary Anderson. On the first play of the second quarter, Hoge ripped off a 45-yard run, the longest of his career. He ended up rushing for 60 yards on the Steelers drive, {{including}} a 7-yard touchdown carry to increase the Steelers lead to 10-0. Denver responded with a 12-play, 75-yard drive to score on Bratton's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the lead to 10-7. But the Steelers stormed <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> Bubby Brister completing a 25-yard pass to tight end Mike Mularkey and rookie running back Tim Worley contributing a 19-yard carry {{on the way to}} a 9-yard scoring reception by Louis Lipps. Shortly before the end of the half, Broncos kicker David Treadwell made a 43-yard field goal, putting the score at 17-10 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, the Bills {{advanced}} 69 yards in five plays, starting with Ferguson's 15-yard pass to Frank Lewis and ending with a 44-yard touchdown run by Cribbs to tie the game. Cincinnati's David Verser returned the ensuing kickoff 40 yards to their 35-yard line, and the team responded with a 7-play 65-yard drive, including a 13-yard scramble by Anderson, to retake the lead with a 20-yard touchdown run by Alexander. Buffalo struck <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 79-yard scoring drive. Cribbs was injured and knocked {{out of the game}} on the first play, but his replacement Roland Hooks rushed five times for 24 yards and caught a pass for 6, while Ferguson finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Butler, tying the game back up at 21 on the first play of the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} drive {{of the second}} half, Green Bay moved the ball 73 yards in 11 plays and scored with another Jacke field goal. The Panthers managed to respond with an 11-play, 73-yard drive {{of their own and}} score with Kasay's second field goal, which cut their deficit to seven points. But Green Bay stormed <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 74-yard {{touchdown}} drive, featuring a 66-yard reception by Levens. On the next play, Bennett's 4-yard touchdown run gave the Packers a 27–13 lead with two minutes left in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Packers defensive tackle Gilbert Brown slapped the ball {{out of the hands of}} running back Anthony Johnson and safety LeRoy Butler recovered the fumble, leading to Jacke's third field goal that made the score 30-13 with 10:02 left in the game.|$|E

25|$|Raiders {{receiver}} Raghib Ismail {{returned the}} ensuing kickoff 33 yards to his 43-yard line, sparking an 8-play, 57-yard drive {{that ended with}} a 1-yard touchdown run by Napoleon McCallum. Then on the first play after the kickoff, safety Eddie Anderson forced a fumble from Pete Metzelaars, and cornerback Terry McDaniel recovered {{the ball on the}} Bills 40-yard line, setting up McCallum's second 1-yard touchdown run (this one on a fourth down) to increase their lead to 17–6. But Buffalo, who had gained just 44 total yards at this point, struck <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 4-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. After three consecutive Kelly completions, a 37-yard pass interference penalty on defensive back Torin Dorn moved the ball to the Raiders 8-yard line, and Thurman Thomas ran it into the end zone from there, cutting the score to 17–13 with 50 seconds left in the half.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, Everett was intercepted {{in the end zone}} by Giants {{defensive}} back Mark Collins. Later on, New York put together an 82-yard, 14-play drive to take the lead. Simms completed passes to Dave Meggett for 11 yards and Zeke Mowatt for 23, while running back Ottis Anderson rushed six times for 28 yards, including a 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 13–7 with two minutes remaining in the quarter. But LA stormed <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> Everett completing two passes to Henry Ellard for gains of 23 and 16 yards, along with a 16-yard run by Greg Bell, {{on the way to a}} 31-yard field goal by Mike Lansford. Later in the quarter, Everett completed six of seven passes for 44 yards and rushed for 12 yards on a 75-yard drive that ended with Lansford's 21-yard field goal with 3:01 left, tying the score and sending the game into overtime.|$|E
25|$|The Badgers first road game of {{the season}} was a hot one as the game time {{temperature}} was 98 degrees. Arizona State's opening drive took them down to the Wisconsin 3-yard line but on fourth and two the Sun Devils went for it but failed. Both offenses struggled for most of the first quarter until the Sun Devils kicked a 34-yard field goal with 4:08 left in the first quarter. The Badgers then put a 10-play 73-yard drive together that took 5:22 and into the second quarter. The Badgers capped that nice drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass from QB Joel Stave to TE Jacob Pedersen. On the next drive, the Sun Devils had a three-and-out. Arizona State attempted to punt the ball but because of a bad snap, Wisconsin's DT Beau Allen recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown giving the Badgers a 14–3 lead. Arizona State answered <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 10-play 75-yard scoring drive capped by a 2-yard touchdown run by RB Marion Grice. The Sun Devils added a 19-yard field goal before the half cutting the Wisconsin lead to 14–13.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Walker muffed the opening kickoff and Dallas cornerback Dave Thomas {{recovered}} {{it on the}} 49ers 25. Aided by a personal foul penalty against linebacker Rickey Jackson, Dallas drove 25 yards in seven plays to score on Smith's 1-yard touchdown run. However, the 49ers stormed <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 10-play, 70-yard drive that ended with Young's 3-yard rushing touchdown. Then 49ers defensive back Deion Sanders ended the Cowboys next drive with an interception. San Francisco ended up punting, but Klaus Wilmsmeyer's kick pinned Dallas back at their 11. In the final quarter, Dallas finished an 89-yard, 14-play drive with Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin, cutting the score to 38-28, {{but they could not}} score again. Smith, who compiled 74 yards and two touchdowns, departed during that drive with an injured hamstring, which he had already injured before this game, it got enough wear and tear to the point he couldn't play anymore. The Cowboys had two more drives, both of which resulted in turnovers on downs. At one point, Dallas coach Barry Switzer, furious that Sanders was not called for pass interference, stormed onto the field and bumped an official while arguing, which resulted in a 15-yard penalty against the Cowboys, and Aikman was sacked by defensive end Tim Harris on fourth down on the next play. Although Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, ultimately the first-quarter turnovers were too much to overcome.|$|E
25|$|Rams {{defensive}} back Aeneas Williams {{opened up the}} scoring by returning an interception from Favre 29 yards for a touchdown. The next time Green Bay had the ball, they turned it over again when safety Kim Herring stripped the ball from Ahman Green and rookie Adam Archuleta recovered it. However, the Rams were unable {{to take advantage of}} this turnover. A few plays later, Warner's pass was intercepted by Darren Sharper on the Packers 35-yard line. Favre then completed a pair of passes to Corey Bradford and Donald Driver for gains of 27 and 16 yards, before tying the game with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Freeman. But the Rams stormed <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 15-yard completion to Az-Zahir Hakim and a 38-yard burst from running back Marshall Faulk advancing the ball to the Packers 11-yard line. Two plays later, Warner completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt to put the Rams back in the lead. Then on Green Bay's next drive, Herring intercepted a pass from Favre and returned it 45 yards to the Packers 4-yard line, setting up a 4-yard touchdown catch by fullback James Hodgins early in the second quarter. Allen Rossum returned the ensuing kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, but a holding penalty on Torrance Marshall eliminated the score. Green Bay still managed to score with a Ryan Longwell field goal, but Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins responded with a field goal of his own to give the Rams a 24–10 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|In the 1958–59 Scottish League Cup group stage Hearts {{eliminated}} Rangers. That October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final was {{won with}} a heavy 5–1 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5–0 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a poor run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2–1 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers' penultimate game of the season, Rangers {{would still have to}} drop two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay's last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of £32,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy spells out injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin was brought in to bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4–2 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a knee injury, Rankin's ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1–0 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic's Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic's winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at the Tynecastle to wonder {{what would have happened if}} Mackay hadn't been sold when he was.|$|E
