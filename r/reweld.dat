Welded metal cans are used to store many components in the Y- 12 Plant. The current process for opening these cans is {{to cut off the}} weld with hand operated nippers or shears. This causes excessive lid destruction and it also produces a rough and uneven edge that is difficult to <b>reweld.</b> (See Sketch 1) QEO personnel expressed a need for a better solution to these problems.

40|$|A {{friction}} stir weld (FSW) repair {{method has}} been developed and successfully implemented on Al 2195 plate material for the Space Shuttle External Fuel Tank (ET). The method includes restarting the friction stir weld in the termination hole of the original weld followed by two <b>reweld</b> passes. Room temperature and cryogenic temperature mechanical properties exceeded minimum FSW design strength and compared well with the development data. Simulated service test results also compared closely to historical data for initial FSW, confirming no change to the critical flaw size or inspection requirements for the repaired weld. Testing of VPPA fusion/FSW intersection weld specimens exhibited acceptable strength and exceeded the minimum design value. Porosity, when present at the intersection was on the root side toe of the fusion weld, the "worst case" being 0. 7 inch long. While such porosity may be removed by sanding, this "worst case" porosity condition was tested "as is" and demonstrated that porosity did not negatively affect {{the strength of the}} intersection weld. Large, 15 -inch "wide panels" FSW repair welds were tested to demonstrate strength and evaluate residual stresses using photo stress analysis. All results exceeded design minimums, and photo stress analysis showed no significant stress gradients due to the presence of the restart and multi-pass FSW repair weld...|$|E

50|$|Already in May 1938, after cracks {{had been}} {{discovered}} in the conventional armour of the M36 vehicles, the ministry of defence had asked DAF whether their type, using untried welding techniques, could also be prone to cracking; {{in the summer of}} 1938 the commander of the 1e Eskadron Pantserwagens while testing the demonstrator vehicle had also expressed his concerns on this matter. Despite the warnings by Addink, Van Doorne pretended that he was unconcerned. Nevertheless the May 1939 contract had contained a warranty clause, instructing DAF to weld all connections tension-free and making DAF liable for all defects of this nature. Late March 1940 during cleaning it was discovered that on three of the six vehicles the welds of the machine gun mounts were cracking. One vehicle was sent to DAF that <b>rewelded</b> the crack and reinforced the glacis by riveting a steel plate behind it. Soon however, it transpired that next to the reinforcing plate a new crack had appeared. In April the number of cars showing cracks had risen to five and on some of these the welds between the glacis and bottom plates were starting to crack also. According to DAF the defects had been caused by attaching the mounts after the vehicles had been largely finished. The Comissie Pantserautomobielen concluded that, as war was imminent, DAF should be allowed to quickly repair the cracks by <b>rewelding</b> and fitting reinforcement plates but that ultimately the armour plates had to be completely replaced.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} {{of water at}} volcanic vents can have dramatic effects on fragmentation and eruption dynamics, but {{little is known about}} how the {{presence of}} particulate matter in external water will further alter eruptions. Volcanic edifices are inherently "dirty" places, where particulate matter of multiple origins and grainsizes typically abounds. We present the results of experiments designed to simulate non-explosive interactions between molten basalt and various "coolants," ranging from homogeneous suspensions of 0 to 30 mass% bentonite clay in pure water, to heterogeneous and/or stratified suspensions including bentonite, sand, synthetic glass beads and/or naturally-sorted pumice. Four types of data are used to characterise the interactions: (1) visual/video observations; (2) grainsize and morphology of resulting particles; (3) heat-transfer data from a network of eight thermocouples; and (4) acoustic data from three force sensors. In homogeneous coolants with ~ 20 % sediment, heat transfer is by forced convection and conduction, and thermal granulation is less efficient, resulting in fewer blocky particles, larger grainsizes, and weaker acoustic signals. Many particles are droplet-shaped or/and "vesicular," containing bubbles filled with coolant. Both of these particle types indicate significant hydrodynamic magma-coolant mingling, {{and many of them are}} <b>rewelded</b> into compound particles. The addition of coarse material to heterogeneous suspensions further slows heat transfer thus reducing thermal granulation, and variable interlocking of large particles prevents efficient hydrodynamic mingling. This results primarily in <b>rewelded</b> melt piles and inefficient distribution of melt and heat throughout the coolant volume. Our results indicate that even modest concentrations of sediment in water will significantly limit heat transfer during non-explosive magma-water interactions. At high concentrations, the dramatic reduction in cooling efficiency and increase in mingling help to explain globular peperite, and provide information relevant to analyses of premixing associated with highly-explosive molten fuel-coolant interactions in debris-filled volcanic vents...|$|R

Use of a split casing, common in industry, would permit assembly of the rotor outside the case. A team was formed to perform the study; however, {{the work of the}} team was severely restricted by conflict with higher priority tasks.

In April 1977, as the Humphrey Building neared completion, one of the welds connecting the hanging interior walls to the roof truss cracked. The roof sagged 19 in, and 200 workers were evacuated from the fifth, sixth, and seventh floors. The beam was pulled back into position and <b>rewelded</b> into place.

Ni 3 Al intermetallic compound was formed successfully after 10 h of milling, which was the shortest formation period that ever reported for this intermetallic compound. The nanocrystalline Ni 3 Al with the lowest crystallite size of 12. 6 nm was synthesized. Refinement of crystallite size with increasing internal strain was significant as milling duration was increased gradually.

40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} rate tests have been {{performed}} on Nimonic AP 1, a powder formed Ni-base superalloy, in air and vacuum at room temperature. These show that threshold values are higher, and near-threshold (faceted) {{crack growth rate}}s are lower, in vacuum than in air, although at high growth rates, in the “structure-insensitive” regime, R-ratio and a dilute environment have little effect. Changing the R-ratio from 0. 1 to 0. 5 in vacuum does not alter near-threshold crack growth rates very much, despite more extensive secondary cracking being noticeable at R= 0. 5. In vacuum, <b>rewelding</b> occurs at contact points across the crack as ΔK falls.

50|$|During high-energy milling {{the powder}} {{particles}} are repeatedly flattened, cold welded, fractured and <b>rewelded.</b> Whenever two steel balls collide, some amount of powder is trapped in between them. Typically, around 1000 particles with an aggregate weight of about 0.2 mg are trapped during each collision. The {{force of the}} impact plastically deforms the powder particles leading to work hardening and fracture. The new surfaces created enable the particles to weld together and this leads {{to an increase in}} particle size. Since {{in the early stages of}} milling, the particles are soft (if we are using either ductile-ductile or ductile-brittle material combination), their tendency to weld together and form large particles is high. A broad range of particle sizes develops, with some as large as three times bigger than the starting particles. The composite particles at this stage have a characteristic layered structure consisting of various combinations of the starting constituents. With continued deformation, the particles get work hardened and fracture by a fatigue failure mechanism and/or by the fragmentation of fragile flakes.|$|R
