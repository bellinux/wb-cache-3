40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) regulatory <b>protein,</b> <b>Rev,</b> mediates the nuclear export of unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNAs by bridging viral RNA and export receptor human CRM 1 (hCRM 1). Ribonucleoprotein complex formation, including the oligomerization of <b>Rev</b> <b>proteins</b> on viral RNA, must occur to allow export. We show here that Rev-Rev interactions, which are a basis of complex formation, can be initiated without cellular factors and are subsequently enhanced by hCRM 1 -Ran-GTP. Furthermore, we reveal functions for the Rev carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) region, which is well conserved among many HIV- 1 strains, and for which no function has been reported.

Consistent with these results, a HIV- 1 proviral plasmid that expresses a C-terminally truncated <b>Rev</b> mutant <b>protein</b> produces smaller amounts of the p 24 antigen than does a plasmid that possesses an intact rev gene.

The enzymatic characteristics and protein-protein interactions of these polymerases have been intensively characterized; however, how these proteins are regulated during the cell cycle remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the cell cycle oscillation of translesion polymerases.

The structure indicates that the interaction between REV 7 and REV 3 creates a structural interface for REV 1 binding. Furthermore, we show that the REV 7 -mediated interactions are responsible for DNA damage tolerance. Our results highlight the function of REV 7 as an adapter protein to recruit Polζ to a lesion site.

Three TLS polymerases (Pols) function to bypass DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Rev 1, Pol ζ, a heterodimer of the Rev 3 and <b>Rev</b> 7 <b>proteins,</b> and Pol η (Rad 30). Our lab has shown that S. cerevisiae <b>Rev</b> 1 <b>protein</b> levels are under striking cell cycle regulation, being ~ 50 -fold higher during G 2 /M than during G 1 and much of S phase (Waters and Walker, 2006). REV 1 transcript levels only vary ~ 3 -fold in a similar cell cycle pattern, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism controls protein levels. Here, we show that the S. cerevisiae <b>Rev</b> 1 <b>protein</b> is unstable during both the G 1 and the G 2 /M phases of the cell cycle, however, the protein's half-life is shorter in G 1 arrested cells than in G 2 /M arrested cells, indicating {{that the rate of}} proteolysis strongly contributes to Rev 1 's cell cycle regulation. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG 132, the steady-state levels and half-life of Rev 1 increase during G 1 and G 2 /M.

40|$|As {{a logical}} {{pharmaceutical}} target for antiviral drugs, HIV- 1 Rev is a regulatory protein essential for viral infection (Hope, 1999). The development of antiviral drugs that target Rev has been hindered {{by the lack}} of high-resolution structural information due to the protein 2 ̆ 7 s tendency to aggregate in solution. While searching for solution conditions rendering Rev amenable to crystallographic analyses, Watts et al., (2000) discovered a novel in vitro interaction between Rev and microtubules (MTs) whereby addition of equimolar Rev and tubulin forms bilayered rings called Rev-tubulin toroidal complexes (RTTs). RTTs are similar to those seen when MTs are mixed with certain anti-MT drugs and KinI kinesins (Watts et al., 2000). Coupled with the sequence homology that exists between KinI kinesins and Rev, I hypothesize that Rev and KinI 2 ̆ 7 s are depolymerizing MTs by a shared mechanism. This mechanism may include the binding of the Rev/KinI {{to the end of the}} MT inducing a curved confirmation in the MT thereby destabilizing it to promote depolymerization. I propose to test this hypothesis through measuring Rev-MT interactions by adapting biochemical and microscopy-based assays used to measure MT depolymerization by KinI proteins. These assays require microgram amounts of highly purified wild-type and mutant <b>Rev</b> <b>proteins</b> as well as purified tubulin from which MTs can be polymerized in vitro. To this end, I have purified wild type Rev with no visible contaminants on coomasie stained gels. Rev mutants R 42 A and E 57 A can also be purified with limited visible contaminants. However, the appropriate controls can be generated from non-expressing cells to address this issue. Rev mutants A 37 D and R 39 A can also be partially purified. Using purified <b>Rev</b> <b>proteins,</b> I then applied sedimentation assays to measure Rev-stimulated MT depolymerization. There was a statistically significant time dependence for wild type Rev to depolymerize MTs although there was no evidence for concentration dependence. Visual assays demonstrate no significant difference in the length of MTs treated with Rev although Rev decreased the number of MTs on the coverslip over time. This could contribute to the finding that MT depolymerization by Rev is time dependent. These results demonstrate that it is possible to measure Rev-MT interactions in vitro although it is clear that these assays are deficient in certain ways, including the ability of MTs to depolymerize on their own and RTTs potentially pelleting during the depolymerization assay. However, it is likely that cycling tubulin and/or using taxol to further stabilize the MTs can remedy the deficiency of MT depolymerization on their own. EM could also be used to determine if RTTs are pelleting during the depolymerization assay. After using mutant <b>Rev</b> <b>proteins</b> in the depolymerization and visual assays, it is the long-term goal that mechanistic information about Rev will lend valuable evidence to the study of KinI kinesins. Generating structural Rev information may also be helpful in the drug design of anti-mitotic peptides...|$|R

The S 4 -S 5 linker peptide (L 45) is believed to be responsible for the anesthetic/alcohol response of voltage-gated K+ channels. We investigated this region to define the structural basis of 1 -alkanol binding site in dShaw 2 K+ channel. L 45 peptides derived from dShaw 2 and hKv 3. 4 K+ channel, which, if part of the complete channel, demonstrate different sensitivity to 1 -alcohols. Specifically, dShaw 2 is alcohol sensitive and hKv 3. 4 is alcohol resistant. Structural analysis of L 45 with NMR and CD suggested a direct correlation between alpha-helicity and the inhibition of dShaw 2 channel by 1 -butanol. We used CD and NMR to determine the structure of L 45 peptides in micelles and vesicles. We measured spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) and determined the location and surface accessibility of L 45 in micelles. These experiments confirm that L 45 of dShaw 2 adopts an α-helical conformation, partially buried in the membrane and parallel to the surface. The binding and accumulation of <b>rev</b> <b>proteins</b> to an internal loop of RRE (rev responsive element) of unspliced mRNA precursors is a key step of propagation of human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus.
