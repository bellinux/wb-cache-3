5|$|In 2017, Sheindlin {{created a}} game show called IWitness that debuted on July 10th and ran for 6 weeks. The game show puts the contestant's {{observational}} skills to the test, requiring them to view video clips and <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> they have witnessed faster than their competitors. On September 17, 2017, Sheindlin appeared on the series premiere of Fox News Channel's Objectified hosted by Harvey Levin. The program's first episode took {{an inside look at}} Sheindlin's life.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
25|$|Jake Esterline {{claimed that}} {{a box of}} cigars, which was treated with chemicals, was also {{considered}} in the plot to assassinate Castro. The scheme was that the chemical would produce temporary personality disorientation, and having Castro smoke one before a speech would result in Castro making a “public spectacle of himself”. Esterline later admitted that even though he couldn't exactly <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> the cigars were intended to do, he didn’t believe they were lethal.|$|E

25|$|His {{tenure at}} Harvard almost ended before it began, {{when he was}} injured in an {{automobile}} accident. Boring fractured his skull and {{had to stay in}} the hospital for six weeks. Also, the accident resulted in temporary retroactive and progressive amnesia. The experience caused Boring to question {{what it means to be}} conscious. If a person could not <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> the person had said moments afterward, could he really be considered conscious? Such questions become a lifelong endeavor for Boring to try to answer.|$|E
25|$|Norma Restarick seeks {{help from}} Poirot, believing {{she may have}} {{committed}} murder. When she sees him in person, she flees, saying he is too old. He pursues the case finding that Ariadne Oliver sent Norma to him. He believes there is a murder that prompted Norma’s fears. Poirot and Mrs. Oliver gather information, visiting her parents’ home and her apartment building. Norma does not return home after a weekend visit to her father and stepmother. Mrs. Oliver finds her in a café by chance with her boyfriend David. Poirot meets Norma at the café, where she mentions the death again. After describing the odd times where she cannot <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> has happened she leaves in fear again. Mrs Oliver trails David, ending {{up in the hospital}} after being coshed on the head upon leaving his art studio. Poirot arranges for Dr Stillingfleet to follow Norma; he pulls her to safety from a close call with speeding traffic and brings her to his place for treatment and for safety.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E

500|$|Olivia, {{having been}} taken to William Bell's office in the {{parallel}} universe, is returned to the prime universe but with short term amnesia, unable to recall her experience there. Massive Dynamic's Nina Sharp directs her to Sam Weiss, a bowling alley manager, who gives her cryptic but helpful advice to overcome her amnesia. Meanwhile, the Fringe division has discovered several shapeshifters - a human/machine hybrid that bleed mercury - have crossed over, but unbeknownst to them, one {{takes the form of}} Olivia's partner, Charlie. When Sam's advice allows Olivia to <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> Bell told her, she unwittingly gives this information to the shapeshifter, who calls its agents to use the information to recover the body of Thomas Jerome Newton, an agent for some entity operating from the parallel universe. Nina provides Olivia with cautionary advice, alerting her to a [...] "great war" [...] that Bell postulated would occur between the two universes. During this time, Peter has come to forgive Walter for his past, and Walter has grown accustomed to normal life outside of the institution, but is still troubled by a secret.|$|E

2500|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature is how {{males and females}} process information and then <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> was presented to them. Females tend to remember nonverbal cues and associate {{the meaning of a}} discussion with gestures. Since males follow verbal cues they react more to the facts and actual words within a discussion to <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> was said, but fluctuations in the speaker's voice helps them maintain the memories. Another difference that sets males and females apart is recalling someone's voice. [...] They tend to recall information they have read, for instance, lists of objects are better recalled for men than women. The only similarity they have is that when emotional words are used or an emotional tone is produced, males and females tend to recall those changes.|$|E

2500|$|While [...] "the South" [...] {{exists as}} a {{geographical}} {{region of the}} United States, it is also said to exist as [...] "a place of the imagination" [...] of writers. An image of [...] "the South" [...] was fixed in Mitchell's imagination when at six years old her mother took her on a buggy tour through ruined plantations and [...] "Sherman's sentinels", the brick and stone chimneys that remained after William Tecumseh Sherman's [...] "March and torch" [...] through Georgia.

2500|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} information one has conveyed to others. Telling a story multiple times, unaware that listeners have heard the story before, is an example of destination memory failure. Destination memory is important for conversations because it allows people to <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> was already talked about. Deficiency in destination memory is more common among older adults, but has been reported by university students as well. Destination memory is notoriously poor due to ineffective integration of components of episodic memory. [...] However, there appear to be few, if any, negative social implications for poor destination memory.|$|E
2500|$|Moses {{told the}} Israelites not to fear these nations {{because they were}} numerous, for the Israelites had but to <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> God did to Pharaoh and the Egyptians and the wonders by which God liberated them. God {{would do the same}} to the peoples whom they feared, and would send a plague against them, too. God would {{dislodge}} those peoples little by little, so that the wild beasts would not take over the land. Moses directed the Israelites to burn the images of their gods, not to covet nor keep the silver and gold on them, nor to bring an abhorrent thing into their houses. The first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

5|$|Written by Moris Farhi, this four-part {{story was}} officially {{commissioned}} by producer Graham Williams on 8 November 1977. The script was not produced and Farhi no longer <b>recalls</b> <b>what</b> it was about; the script itself is lost.|$|R
2500|$|With 76 {{still needed}} {{and only three}} wickets remaining, the odds seemed once more to have shifted against England. Lockwood scored only two, but he helped Hirst add another 27 before being dismissed: 214/8. Lilley helped Hirst to add a further 34 before he was Trumble's fourth victim of the innings and twelfth of the match: 248/9. (Darling had {{entrusted}} almost all the bowling to Saunders and Trumble; they sent down all but nine overs of the 66.5 that the innings lasted.) So Rhodes joined Hirst with 15 still needed. Legend has it that Hirst said to Rhodes, [...] "We'll get them in singles, Wilfred." [...] However Rhodes denied the story, Hirst {{said he could not}} <b>recall</b> <b>what</b> his words had been, and not every run was a single. But get the runs they did, Hirst finishing with 58 not out. He had top-scored with 43 in just 45 minutes in the first innings, as well as taking 5 wickets in Australia's first innings, so this was his match almost as much as it was Jessop's.|$|E
