5|$|The book {{is noted}} for its practicality, departing from earlier {{practice}} in avoiding plagiarism, consisting instead almost entirely of direct instructions based on Raffald's experience. It introduced the first known <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> a wedding cake covered in marzipan and royal icing, and is an early use of barbecue. The book remains a reference for cookery writers.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|Robert May's The Accomplisht Cook was {{published}} in 1660 when he was 72 years old.

5|$|Other {{arts and}} leisure {{activities}} {{described in the}} fifth sub-book include activities such as garland making and perfumery, wherein the flowers are arranged in patterns of pleasing colors and ones that delight the senses. The text lists types of aromatic woods, such as sandalwood and their qualities. The text describes the art of painting as three types — Viddha (representational), Aviddha (sketch, outline) and Bhava (narrative). The text includes a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> making various types of paints, as well as crayons for drawing, and then recommends the steps in making a drawing.|$|E
5|$|The {{instructions}} in Compendium ferculorum are succinct and often vague, lacking such elements of modern culinary recipes as lists of ingredients used, measurements or proportions, and cooking times. The underlying {{assumption is that}} they are to be used by a professional chef rather than a person with little cooking experience. The <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> stewed meat in saffron sauce, cited below, is typical is this regard.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{was first}} {{created in the}} early twentieth century after marshmallow creme, a sweet marshmallow-like spread, was invented in Massachusetts. During World War I, a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> a peanut butter and marshmallow creme sandwich, the earliest known example of the sandwich, was published. The term “fluffernutter” was created by an advertising agency in 1960 as a more effective way to market the sandwich.|$|E

5000|$|Englishman Adam Hodgson {{noted in}} 1819 that he [...] "did not {{recollect}} to have dined {{a single day}} without a turkey on the table." [...] <b>Recipes</b> <b>for</b> turkey became an early divergence from British cuisine, with the first American cookbook, Amelia Simmons's American Cookery (1796), containing five <b>recipes</b> <b>for</b> turkey.|$|R

5|$|By tradition, {{like other}} Brahmin {{communities}} of Southern India, Deshastha Brahmins are lacto vegetarian. Typical Deshastha cuisine {{consists of the}} simple varan made from tuvar dal. Metkut, a powdered mixture of several dals and a few spices is {{also a part of}} traditional Deshastha cuisine. Deshastha use black spice mix or kala, literally black, masala, in cooking. Traditionally, each family had their own <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> the spice mix. However, this tradition is dying out as modern households buy pre-packaged mixed spice directly from supermarkets. Puran poli for festivals and {{on the first day of}} the two-day marriage is another Marathi Brahmin special dish.|$|E
5|$|Food {{selection}} at {{the restaurant}} comes from the traditional cuisine of the United States. Popcorn is served as a free hors d'oeuvre. Other food items include milkshakes, hot fudge sundaes, seafood salad, turkey sloppy joes, fried pickles, St. Louis-style barbecue ribs, beef-and-blue-cheese salads, sautéed shrimp with farfalle, French fries, cucumber salads, Buffalo wings, Boca Burgers, Tofutti, and steaks. Drinks include souvenir phosphorescent ice cubes. The desserts are served in larger portions than are customary elsewhere. There are vegetarian options. The chefs at the Sci-Fi Dine-In sometimes cater for special requests in advance. The cookbook Delicious Disney Just for Kids contains a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> the BLT soup served at the Sci-Fi Dine-In.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s in the United States, the first {{televised}} <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> clam dip {{appeared on the}} Kraft Music Hall show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, canned clams in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were minced canned clams, cream cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As salsa became more popular among American consumers, the popularity of clam dip declined.|$|E

5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and free play. Story mode {{involves}} a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> simple chocolate bars, the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E
