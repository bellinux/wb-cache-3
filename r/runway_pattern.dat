40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the flight management work being conducted using NASA Langley's oculometer system. Tests have been conducted in a Boeing 737 simulator to investigate pilot scan behavior during approach and landing for simulated IFR, VFR, motion versus no motion, standard versus advanced displays, and as a function of various <b>runway</b> <b>patterns</b> and symbology. Results of each of these studies are discussed. For example, results indicate that for the IFR approaches a difference in pilot scan strategy was noted for the manual versus coupled (autopilot) conditions. Also, during the final part of the approach when the pilot looks out-of-the-window he fixates on his aim or impact point on the runway and holds this point until flare initiation...|$|R
50|$|RCAF Detachment Gananoque was {{a relief}} landing field for the Royal Air Force's No. 31 Service Flying Training School (SFTS) located at Kingston during the Second World War. The {{airfield}} was located north of Gananoque, Ontario, Canada. Gananoque consisted of a triangle-shaped <b>runway</b> <b>pattern,</b> one hangar, and a control tower. Gananoque officially became a British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) facility in 1942 when RAF training schools {{became part of the}} BCATP. The station opened in 1940 and closed in 1945.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} partially wooded {{and some of}} this remained to the northeast of the runways throughout the military period but after closure, the Forestry Commission planted most of the airfield with oak (Quercus robur) and conifers. Part of {{it is now a}} reserve for butterflies and the concrete is slowly being broken up and removed. Ghostly outlines of large numbers of loop dispersal hardstands can be seen in aerial photography, with the perimeter track being reduced to a single lane road. The <b>runway</b> <b>pattern</b> can clearly be seen, some still remaining at full width, other parts being now at half width or less. All of the remaining runway sections are in a very deteriorated condition.|$|E
50|$|Hōfu Airfield's origins {{appear to}} begin as a World War II airfield, as its <b>runway</b> <b>pattern</b> is {{indicative}} of wartime fields built in that era. It was the main Royal Australian Air Force base during {{the early part of}} the occupation of Japan and was repaired by No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF. From September 1947 the United States Air Force's 347th Fighter Wing (All Weather) based F-61 Black Widow night fighters at the airfield as part of the air defense of Japan, but moved shortly afterwards to Ashiya Airfield. The 347th later stationed new F-82 Twin Mustangs at the airfield in October 1948, moving them to Ashiya in May 1949. It was apparently placed in reserve status afterwards, the 6134th Air Base Squadron being a housekeeping unit until 31 August 1951.|$|E

At {{each end of the}} main 10,000-foot runway are a dozen {{hardened}} aircraft shelters known as [...] "Trapezoids" [...] or [...] "Yugos" [...] which were built by Yugoslavian contractors some time prior to 1985 with multiple <b>runways</b> and taxiways, <b>patterned</b> after their Russian counterparts.|$|R
40|$|The 1. 22 x 1. 37 m mat runway in the {{standard}} brick pattern with transverse hinged joints is more stable and less susceptible to a buckling failure than the 0. 60 x 2. 74 m mat runway. Use of tension anchors {{appears to be a}} feasible means of controlling longitudinal displacement of the runway and potential runway buckling. Anchors appear to be a practical means to reduce maintenance on mat runways. The 1. 22 x 1. 37 m mat in the alternate brick pattern or the 90 deg rotated standard brick pattern forms a dynamically more stable runway with a high resistance to buckling failure. The <b>runway</b> in these <b>patterns</b> is much stiffer and longitudinal movement was less than for {{the standard}} brick pattern. The model 1. 22 x 1. 37 m alternate brick <b>pattern</b> <b>runway</b> was difficult to assemble and extremely difficult to take apart...|$|R
40|$|Runway incursions and {{conflicts}} present a persistent problem in airport ground operations. Numerous critical conflicts and several fatal accidents have occurred {{as a result}} ofunauthorized or otherwise inappropriate entry ofaircraft or surface vehicles onto an active runway. This article describes a detailed survey ofrunway-conflict accidents and high-hazard incidents res,ulting from inappropriate entry onto or movement on an active <b>runway.</b> The <b>patterns</b> that emerge allow us to determine the role that three different safety systems {{can be expected to}} play in reducing the incidence or consequences ofrunway incursions {{and conflicts}}. The three systems are a surface-surveillance system (such as a surface radar), a tower-cab alerting system, and runway-status lights. Judging from the history ofrunway conflicts, it appears that runway-status lights, operating automatically with inputs from a surface radar, can prevent over half ofthese conflicts. A surface radar alone or comb~nedwith tower-cab alerts promises to be effective in preventing another one-third. The three systems in combination can offer protection in an estimated 90 % ofhigh-hazard conflicts...|$|R
5000|$|At first a sod {{surface was}} used, but in 1930 {{construction}} of three cinder runways was initiated. The largest of these had {{a length of}} 4,000 feet, and after the entry of the United States into World War II they were further lengthened to 6,000 feet, a distance sufficient for most types of aircraft used in that war. However, because in wet weather or when the river was high the ground was often too sodden to be satisfactory for use by heavy aircraft, cement aprons were laid down late in 1944 {{at the ends of}} the main runways. Intersecting at one end and joined by a short cross-strip, the <b>runways</b> made a <b>pattern</b> like the letter [...] "A." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAircraft noise, air quality, {{and climate}} change damages are {{spatially}} and temporally heterogeneous. While policymakers often focus on aggregate cost-benefit analysis to examine tradeoffs in aviation environmental policy, these analyses do not always indicate who bears the costs or who gains the benefits of aviation. We model both the net cost and distribution of environmental damages from one year of aviation operations across the three environmental domains. We find that populations living at airport boundaries face damages of $ 100 – 400 per person per year from aircraft noise and between $ 5 – 16 per person per year from climate damages (in 2006 dollars). Expected damages from air quality are dependent {{on the number of}} operations at the airport and range from $ 20 to over $ 400 per person per year with air quality damages approaching those of noise at high volume airports. Mean expected noise and air quality damages decay with distance from the airport, but for noise, the range of expected damages at a given distance can be high and depends on orientation with respect to <b>runways</b> and flight <b>patterns.</b> Damages from aviation-induced climate change dominate those from local air quality degradation and noise pollution further away from the airport. However, air quality damages may exceed those from climate when considering the impact of cruise emissions on air quality...|$|R
40|$|With {{the pursuit}} of more {{advanced}} and environmentally-friendly technologies of today’s society, the airline industry has been pushed further to investigate solutions that will reduce airport noise and congestion, cut down on emissions, and improve the overall performance of aircraft. These items directly influence airport size (<b>runway</b> length), flight <b>patterns</b> in the community surrounding the airport, cruise speed, and many other aircraft design considerations which are setting the requirements for next generation aircraft. Leading the research in this movement is NASA, which has set specific goals {{for the next generation}} regional airliners and has categorized the designs that meet the criteria as Cruise Efficient Short Takeoff and Land (CESTOL) aircraft. With circulation control (CC) technology addressing most of the next generation requirements listed above, it has recently been gaining more interest, thus the basis of this research. CC is an active flow control method that uses a thin sheet of high momentum jet flow ejected over a curved trailing edge surface and in turn utilizes Coanda effect to increase the airfoil’s circulation, augmenting lift, drag, and pitching moment. The technology has been around for more than 75 years, but is now gaining more momentum for further development due to its significant payoffs in both performance and system complexity. The goal of this research was to explore the design of the CC flap shape and how it influences the local flow field of the system, in attempt to improve the performance of existing CC flap configurations and provide insight into the aerodynamic characteristics of the geometric parameters that make up the CC flap. Multiple dual radius flaps and alternative flap geometry, prescribed radius, flaps were developed by varying specific flap parameters from a baseline dual radius flap configuration that had been previously developed and researched. The aerodynamics of the various flap geometries were analyzed at three different flight conditions using two-dimensional CFD. The flight conditions examined include two low airspeed cases with blown flaps at 60 ° and 90 ° of deflection, and a transonic cruise case with no blowing and 0 ° of flap deflection. Results showed that the shorter flaps of both flap configurations augmented greater lift for the low airspeed cases, with the dual radius flaps producing more lift than the corresponding length prescribed radius. The large lift generation of these flaps was accompanied by significant drag and negative pitching moments. The incremental lift per drag and moment produced was best achieved by the longer flap lengths, with the prescribed radius flaps out-performing each corresponding dual radius. Longer flap configurations also upheld the better cruise performance with the least amount of low airspeed flow, drag, and required angle of attack for a given cruise lift coefficient. The prescribed radius flaps also presented a favorable trait of keeping a more continuous skin friction distribution over the flap when the flaps were deflected, where all dual radius configurations experienced a distinct fluctuation at the location where the surface curvature changes between its two radii. The prescribed radius flaps displayed a similar behavior when the flaps were not deflected, during the cruise conditions analyzed. Performance trends for the different flap configurations, at all three flight conditions, are presented {{at the end of each}} respective section to provide guidance into the design of CC geometry. The results of the presented research show promise in modifying geometric surface parameters to yield improved aerodynamics and performance...|$|R
