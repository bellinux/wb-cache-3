5|$|Although downtrodden by 1986's playoff defeat, Cleveland {{continued}} {{to win the}} following season. Minnifield and Dixon excelled defending the pass, while Matthews and defensive tackle Bob Golic kept <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> check. The Browns finished with a 10–5 record in 1987 and won the AFC Central {{for the third year}} in a row. In the divisional playoff round, the Browns faced the Indianapolis Colts and won 38–21.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Pitt back Tom Davies was injured. Buck Flowers made the only {{points of the}} half with a 20-yard drop-kick.

5|$|The {{lightness}} and rigidity of {{the blade}} compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled <b>runners.</b> <b>In</b> comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and {{function}} primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> short-yardage situations and are seldom used in passing situations.|$|E

5|$|As {{a senior}} at Arizona State, he played left halfback and was {{recognized}} as one of the roughest and hardest <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> the country, and as one of the top defensive players as a safety. He also excelled as a punt returner, and had a two-game stretch in which he returned four punts for touchdowns. Johnson's running abilities made him a standout pro football prospect as a black athlete at a primarily white college.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Light {{began his}} three-year-old season {{with his first}} Group race win in the Sandown Classic Trial. Ridden by Daryll Holland, he took the lead a furlong out and was eased in the closing stages to win by a short head. Speculation that he might develop into a Derby {{contender}} ended in his next race, when he was stepped up to {{one and a half}} miles {{for the first time and}} finished fourth of the five <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> the Lingfield Derby Trial.|$|E
5|$|In the fourth, the Crimson Tide scored touchdowns on both {{of their}} {{offensive}} possessions and made the final score 48–7. The first came on a 20-yard AJ McCarron pass to Kevin Norwood and the second on a seven-yard Altee Tenpenny run. Offensively, McCarron threw for 359 yards and Drake and Yeldon ran for 106 yards and 124 respectively. This {{marked the first time}} in team history that Alabama had a 300-yard passer and two 100-yard <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> a single game. For his performance, right guard Anthony Steen was recognized as SEC Offensive Linemen of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Wildcats to 36–2–1.|$|E

5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay's first {{road race}} of 2010 was the Lisbon Half Marathon. The organisers had {{modified}} {{the course and}} assembled a field of fast <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> order to facilitate a quick race. Despite the top five athletes all running personal best times, Zersenay was alone at the very front from 10km onwards. He fell four seconds short of the 15km world record, but significantly revised Haile Gebrselassie's four-year-old 20km world mark to 55:21, beating it by almost half a minute. Samuel Wanjiru's half marathon world record was next to fall as Zersenay crossed the line at 58:23 minutes, a clear ten seconds ahead of the previous mark.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E

5|$|In the women's event, Germany's Silke Kraushaar {{leads the}} medal count with three, {{one of each}} color. Steffi Martin and Sylke Otto—at 36, the oldest female {{individual}} gold medalist at the Winter Games—are the only lugers with two gold medals in their career. Ortrun Enderlein, representing the Unified Team of Germany, {{was the first woman}} to win the singles event in 1964. She {{was on the verge of}} defending her title at the 1968 Grenoble Games, having the best overall time after all the runs, but was disqualified together with fellow countrywomen Anna-Maria Müller (2nd) and Angela Knösel (4th) when it was discovered that the <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> their sleds had been illegally heated before the runs. Müller made up for this by taking the gold medal at the following Games, in Sapporo, Japan.|$|E
5|$|Next, the Dodgers came to Citizens Bank Park for {{a three-game}} series. After the Phillies lost game one (2–0) in a pitchers' duel between Hernandez and Clayton Kershaw, {{when they were}} zero-for-nine with <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> scoring position, David Buchanan made his major-league debut on May 24. The Phillies won 5–3, with Buchanan getting the win after a five-inning start and Papelbon earning his 13th save. The next day, Josh Beckett pitched a no-hitter for a 6–0 Dodger victory. The next day (Memorial Day), Kendrick had his first win since August 6, 2013; Howard's five RBIs gave the Phillies a 9–0 win over the Colorado Rockies. The team lost game two of the series, 6–2, despite Ben Revere's first major-league home run; Hamels allowed four runs in seven innings, and Jeff Manship gave up two more in the eighth.|$|E
5|$|Nine outfielders have posted errorless Gold Glove-winning seasons: {{seven in}} the American League and two in the National League. The only player to {{accomplish}} the feat twice was Mickey Stanley, who posted a 1.000 fielding percentage in 1968 and 1970. Other outfielders who have played complete seasons without an error include Flood (1966), Clemente (1972), Yastrzemski (1977), Hunter (2008), Ken Berry (1972), Bernie Williams (2000), Vernon Wells (2005), and Joe Rudi, who played only 44 games in the outfield in 1975 while appearing in 91 games at first base. Murphy leads all outfield winners with 507 putouts in 1980, and Jones leads National Leaguers with 493 (1999). Clemente leads all winners in assists; he had 27 in 1961, and American League leader Kaline had 23 in 1958. Jesse Barfield doubled off eight <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> consecutive seasons (1986 and 1987) for the Toronto Blue Jays, while Dave Parker leads all winners with nine double plays in 1977 for the Pirates.|$|E

5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was a strategy that altered the pace of the sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at the peak of his career.|$|E
5|$|USS Milwaukee (CL-5) was an Omaha-class light cruiser {{built for}} the United States Navy during the 1920s. The ship {{spent most of her}} early career {{assigned}} to the Asiatic and Battle Fleets. In 1941 she was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol until she was refitted in New York in late 1941. She escorted a troop convoy to the Pacific in early 1942 before returning to the South Atlantic where she patrolled for German commerce raiders and blockade <b>runners.</b> <b>In</b> November, she intercepted one of the latter, but it scuttled itself before it could be captured. In 1944 she was temporarily transferred to the Soviet Navy and commissioned as Murmansk. The ship was returned by the Soviets in 1949 and sold for scrap in December.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade <b>runners</b> <b>in</b> Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E
