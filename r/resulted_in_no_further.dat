40|$|AbstractPerceptual {{learning}} of orientation discrimination {{is reported to}} be precisely specific to the trained retinal location. This specificity is often taken as evidence for localizing the site of orientation learning to retinotopic cortical areas V 1 /V 2. However, the extant physiological evidence for training improved orientation turning in V 1 /V 2 neurons is controversial and weak. Here we demonstrate substantial transfer of orientation learning across retinal locations, either from the fovea to the periphery or amongst peripheral locations. Most importantly, we found that a brief pretest at a peripheral location before foveal training enabled complete transfer of learning, so that additional practice at that peripheral location <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>further</b> improvement. These results indicate that location specificity in orientation learning depends on the particular training procedures, and is not necessarily a genuine property of orientation learning.

A supplement of urea-molasses (UM) (30 g urea, 70 g molasses) was given to control goats (0 % browse), and both these goats and those given browse supplements consumed BS ad libitum. The basal diet of barley straw plus UM was consumed in limited amounts (41 g/kg(0. 75) day) and was of low DM digestibility (47 - 53 %). At the lowest level of Tipuana supplementation (0. 83 % LW, 27 % DM intake), voluntary consumption of BS was significantly increased above basal, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> a 50 % increase in total intake, and 73 % in digestible DM intake.

We reviewed individual medical records of patients who underwent HSCT or were on follow-up post-HSCT between May and September 2009. Thirteen patients with H 1 N 109 infection were identified: 2 100 days post-HSCT, and 4 just prior to HSCT. Five (38. 7 %) had lower respiratory tract involvement (LRTI), whereas the remainder had upper respiratory tract involvement (URTI). LRTI occurred in patients who were profoundly neutropenic post-HSCT or on potent immunosuppression for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). At 100 days post-H 1 N 109 infection, only 1 patient with LRTI survived, whereas all with URTI are alive. Four patients successfully treated for H 1 N 109 infection prior to HSCT underwent the procedure after 4 to 6 weeks without any complications.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} method {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the degradation of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6) in non-heat-treated wheat (NHW), heat-treated wheat (HW), soybean meal (SBM) or rapeseed cake (RSC) soaked separately or in combination. The feedstuffs were soaked in water (20 Â°C) and samples were collected after 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) phytase addition to soaked NHW or HW improves InsP 6 degradation, (2) phytase and xylanase addition to soaked NHW or HW improves InsP 6 degradation further compared solely with phytase, (3) phytase addition to SBM or RSC improves InsP 6 degradation, and (4) soaking of SBM or RSM together with NHW (ratio 1 : 1) stimulates InsP 6 degradation from SBM or RSC due to the activity of wheat phytases, whereby phytase addition <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>further</b> InsP 6 degradation. Additionally, degradation of lower inositol phosphates (myo-inositol pentakisphosphate-myo-inositol bisphosphate or InsP 5 -InsP 2) was studied to verify if InsP 6 degradation leads to an accumulation of InsP 5 -InsP 2. In NHW or HW addition of phytase alone or with xylanase had no significant effect on InsP 6 degradation. However, InsP 6 degradation was influenced by the interaction between heat-treatment and soaking time (Pâ¤ 0. 001). This was mainly due to a smaller proportion of non-degraded InsP 6 -P at 24 h in HW compared with NHW (0. 13 vs. 0. 47) (Pâ¤ 0. 001) possibly caused by structural changes imposed by the heat-treatment. In SBM, RSC, SBM/NHW or RSC/NHW, the InsP 6 degradation was affected by the interaction between phytase addition and soaking time (Pâ¤ 0. 001) as phytase reduced the proportion of non-degraded InsP 6 -P at 2, 4, 8 or 24 h. Soaking of NHW, SBM or RSC (without phytase) separately <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a limited InsP 6 degradation, whereas a pronounced InsP 6 degradation occurred when RSC or SBM were soaked together with NHW (without phytase) because wheat phytases degraded InsP 6 in SBM or RSC. However, addition of phytase to SBM/NHW or RSC/NHW increased further the degradation of InsP 6 indicating that endogenous wheat phytases were not sufficient. The formation of InsP 5 -InsP 2 -P was very small (40 - 180 Î¼g/kg DM) during the degradation of InsP 6 indicating a rapid and almost complete degradation of these compounds. In conclusion, the effect of phytase on InsP 6 degradation during soaking depends on the feedstuff and processing of the feedstuff. InsP 6 degradation <b>results</b> <b>in</b> a negligible accumulation of InsP 5 -InsP 2. Soaking of plant feedstuffs prior to feeding of pigs may improve P digestibility compared with dry feeding, but studies with pigs are required to clarify this...|$|R
