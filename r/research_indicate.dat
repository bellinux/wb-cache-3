Most of the {{difficulty}} {{for all of the}} various family branches, as highlighted by authors of books on the topic of noble genealogies, results from this person, who, would have been born between 1500 and 1525, but by some accounts was still alive in 1639. Facts resulting from 21st-century <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that this is not one person, but instead two, a father and son with the same name.|$|E
500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{have small}} undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally. Unlike most fishes, American paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination. Electroreception {{appears to have}} largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality, which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey. [...] However, the rostrum is not their only means of food detection. [...] Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health, but laboratory experiments and field <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> otherwise. [...] As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum, American paddlefish have sensory pores covering {{nearly half of the}} skin surface extending from the rostrum {{to the top of the}} head down to the tips of the operculum flaps. Studies have indicated that American paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health.|$|E
2500|$|World {{stocks of}} large predatory fish and large ground fish such as sole and {{flounder}} were estimated in 2003 {{to be only}} about 10% of pre-industrial levels, largely due to overfishing.

[...] Current <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that the flounder population could be as low as 15 million due to heavy overfishing and industrial pollution along the Gulf of Mexico surrounding the coast of Texas.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the seventh}} millenniumBC, {{people of a}} Neolithic culture had settled into a {{sedentary}} way of life there in fortified mud-brick villages, where they supplemented hunting and fishing on the Nile with grain gathering and cattle herding. During the fifth millennium BC migrations from the drying Sahara brought neolithic people into the Nile Valley along with agriculture. The population that resulted from this cultural and genetic mixing developed social hierarchy over the next centuries become the Kingdom of Kush (with the capital at Kerma) at 1700 BC. Anthropological and archaeological <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that during the predynastic period Nubia and Nagadan Upper Egypt were ethnically, and culturally nearly identical, and thus, simultaneously evolved systems of pharaonic kingship by 3300 BC. Together with other countries on Red Sea, Sudan is considered the most likely location of the land known to the ancient Egyptians as Punt (or [...] "Ta Netjeru", meaning [...] "God's Land"), whose first mention dates to the 25th century BC.|$|E
2500|$|Fluoroquinolone {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} noted by Heather Ashton and other authors as increasing the incidence of a CNS toxicity from 1 to 4% in the general population, for benzodiazepine-dependent population or in those undergoing withdrawal from them. This is probably the result of their GABA antagonistic effects {{as they have been}} found to competitively displace benzodiazepines from benzodiazepine receptor sites. This antagonism can precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms, that can persist for weeks or months before subsiding. [...] The symptoms include depression, anxiety, psychosis, paranoia, severe insomnia, parathesia, tinnitus, hypersensitivity to light and sound, tremors, status epilepticus, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics should be contraindicated in patients who are dependent on or in benzodiazepine withdrawal. NSAIDs have some mild GABA antagonistic properties and animal <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that some may even displace benzodiazepines from their binding site. However, NSAIDs taken in combination with fluoroquinolones cause a very significant increase in GABA antagonism, GABA toxicity, seizures, and other severe adverse effects.|$|E
2500|$|Seismic {{tomography}} is {{a technique}} that uses seismic waves produced by earthquakes to gather information on {{the composition of the}} crust and mantle below a volcanic system. Different layers and structures in the Earth have different propagation speeds of seismic waves and attenuate them differently, resulting in different arrival times and strengths of waves travelling in a certain direction. From various measurements 3D models of the geological structures can be inferred. Results of such <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that a highly hydrated slab derived from the Nazca Plate – a major source of melts in a collisional volcanism system – underlies the Western Cordillera. Below the Altiplano, low-velocity zones indicate the presence of large amounts of partial melts that correlate with volcanic zones south of 21° S, whereas north of 21° S thicker lithospheric layers may prevent the formation of melts. Next to the Eastern Cordillera, low-velocity zones extend farther north to 18.5° S. A thermally weakened zone, evidenced by strong attenuation, in the crust is associated with the APVC. This indicates the presence of melts in the crust. A layer of low velocity (shear speed of [...] ) [...] thick is assumed to host the APVC magma body. This body has a volume of about [...] Other seismological data indicate a partial delamination of the crust under the Puna, resulting in increased volcanic activity and terrain height.|$|E

A male leopard radio-collared at 2-3 years of age by WCS scientists in 1994 was photographed during camera trapping surveys in 2003, proving that leopards can live more than 10 years in their natural habitat. However, results of WCS camera-trapping <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that mortality rates in the wild may be very high.|$|E
50|$|Fredrickson {{and others}} hypothesize that {{positive}} emotions undo the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. When people experience stress, they show increased heart rate, higher blood sugar, immunosuppression, and other adaptations optimized for immediate action. If individuals do not regulate these changes once the stress is past, they {{can lead to}} illness, such as coronary disease, and heightened mortality. Both lab research and survey <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that positive emotions help people who were previously under stress relax back to their physiological baseline.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{situations}} in which autonomy is encroached upon (for example, if the individual must always control his/her actions to abide by rules imposed by the task) are thought to inhibit flow.

Additionally, several areas of <b>research</b> <b>indicate</b> that during a state of flow an otherwise-controlled process becomes automatic allowing it to behave dominant over all other automatic processes.|$|E
