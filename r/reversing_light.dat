25|$|These are {{required}} to produce white light by U.S. and international UN Regulations. However, some countries have at various times permitted amber reversing lights. In Australia and New Zealand, for example, vehicle manufacturers were faced {{with the task of}} localising American cars originally equipped with combination red brake/turn signal lamps and white reversing lights. Those countries' regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to burn steadily as reversing lights, so automakers and importers were able to combine the (mandatorily amber) rear turn signal and (optionally amber) <b>reversing</b> <b>light</b> function, and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting devices. Both countries presently require white reversing lights, so the combination amber turn/reverse light is no longer permitted on new vehicles. The U.S. state of Washington presently permits reversing lamps to emit white or amber light.|$|E

50|$|The XT {{received}} a minor update in 1987 {{for the second}} half of the 1987 model year, roughly corresponding to the 1988 launch of the XT6. Early XTs are easily distinguished from later models by inspecting the taillight and <b>reverse</b> <b>light</b> configuration - early models had <b>reverse</b> <b>lights</b> in the rear bumper, while 1987-up models had the <b>reverse</b> <b>lights</b> in the center taillight panel. All wheel drive turbo and six-cylinder models can be distinguished by the shape of the headrests; base models had solid headrests, whereas the turbo AWD and six-cylinder models had a large rectangular hole through the center.|$|R

Inside had cloth upholstery and a new dashboard. There were no doors on compartments or drawers.|$|E
50|$|The {{last of the}} Austin {{range to}} be given Dick Burzi's new body shape it was {{announced}} twelve months after the entry into production of Austin's update of their Sixteen into their stubby-nosed Eighteen, a 50% more powerful engine in a longer-nosed (by 18 inches) body. The new body which only shared its general appearance with the smaller Eighteen was described as notable for its roominess and luxurious comfort. Generous seating with a flat unobstructed floor together with draught-free ventilation by sliding quarter windows, sound insulation for all the steel body panels and generous luggage accommodation were further new features. Equipment includes a <b>reversing</b> <b>light.</b> The price of the new Twenty-Eight was £700.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were other}} improvements: {{the engine was}} tweaked once more to provide , cutting the 0-60 mph time to just over 11 seconds and {{providing}} a top speed over 100 mi/h km/h. The main changes were to the valve timing, to give earlier opening and later closing of the inlet valves compared with the earlier 2-litre engine. (38/78 btdc/atdc for the Mk2 vs 30/60 for the 2 litre). Design changes to the cylinder head allowed for increased inlet valve diameters and better porting. The exterior featured a new grille, Rostyle wheeltrims and silver painted steel rear panel, (described by Triumph as [...] "ceramic"), and the interior was upgraded once more in order to share parts with the new Herald 13/60. A new colour range was offered for the Mark 2 models. The aluminium cowling above the <b>reversing</b> <b>light</b> gained an oblong chromed VITESSE badge, and the separate chromed mezak TRIUMPH letters on the bonnet and the boot lid were also deleted. The badges on the bonnet sides were changed to read Mk2 instead of 2 litre.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1966 Triumph {{upgraded}} {{the engine}} to 1998 cc, {{in line with the}} new Triumph GT6 coupé, and relaunched the car as the Vitesse 2-Litre. Power was increased to , endowing the new car with a 0-60 mph time of just over 12 s, and lifting top speed to almost 100 mph. (The 2-Litre was advertised by Triumph as [...] "The Two Seater Beater"). The performance increase was welcome, but it highlighted the deficiencies of the rear suspension. Other detail modifications for the 2-litre, included a stronger clutch, all synchromesh gearbox, larger front brakes (still without a servo), and a stronger differential with a slightly higher 3.89:1 ratio. Wider & stronger 4.5-inch wheel rims were fitted, but radial-ply tyres were still optional, at extra cost. There was a satin silver anodised aluminium-alloy cowling above the new <b>reversing</b> <b>light,</b> and badges {{on the side of the}} bonnet and in the centre of the grille read 2 litre.Inside the car, the seats were greatly improved, with softer (more plush) covering and a better back-rest shape which slightly improved rear-seat knee-room. A new leather-covered three-spoke steering wheel was also added.|$|E
40|$|Light {{scattering}} poses significant {{challenges for}} biomedical optical imaging techniques. Diffuse scattering scrambles wavefront information, confounding easy analysis of signals reflected from or transmitted through biological tissues. For optical imaging techniques that employ only unscattered light components, the penetration depth is severely limited. In this thesis, we develop and discuss two general methods {{for dealing with}} large levels of light scattering in tissue. The first involves optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of coherence domain optical tomography techniques. The majority of the signal measured in these techniques is singly scattered. Thus, an improvement in SNR will improve the penetration depth of the system by picking out the weak signal contribution from increasing depths {{that would otherwise be}} buried in noise. We show that the SNR can be optimized in terms of image reconstruction algorithms, and in terms of detection parameters. An important detection parameter, the integration time, determines the dominant noise source of the measurement, and can be varied to obtain the maximal SNR. A second general method that will be discussed involves the time-reversal of scattered light components in tissues through the process of optical phase conjugation (OPC). OPC has long been used to remove optical aberrations and distortions, but has never before been applied to light scattering in tissues. We show that we are capable of time <b>reversing</b> <b>light</b> scattering in both chicken tissue sections and tissue phantoms, and characterize both the amplitude and resolution trends of the process. Finally, we provide the first successful results of OPC in living tissues...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{fragments}} encoding a red light-inducible phycocyanin {{gene and}} a green light-inducible phycoerythrin gene {{have been used to}} investigate the effect of red and green pulses on the accumulation of phycocyanin and phycoerythrin mRNA in subsequent darkness. A red pulse promotes phycocyanin and suppresses phycoerythrin mRNA accumulation while a green pulse has an opposite effect on both transcript levels. The effect of a saturating light pulse is canceled by a subsequently given pulse of the other light quality. For a given mRNA, the positive and negative effects require the same fluence for saturation, whereas to saturate the phycoerythrin mRNA response requires at least twice as much light as to saturate the phycocyanin mRNA response. Calculations of the apparent extinction coefficients for the pigments mediating the light-regulated mRNA increase and decrease are of the order of 2 × 104 for phycocyanin mRNA and less than 104 for phycoerythrin mRNA. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the light-induced increase and decrease of a particular phycobiliprotein mRNA is controlled by a single red/green photoreversible photosystem, but that phycoerythrin and phycocyanin mRNA levels are either controlled by two distinct photoreversible systems or that marked differences occur in the chain of events leading from photoperception to gene activation. These system(s) differ from most phytochrome systems in several ways: First, they remain fully on or off depending upon the light quality of the terminal irradiation. Second, they can be completely reversed by light of the appropriate wavelength after several hours of darkness without diminution of the effectiveness of the <b>reversing</b> <b>light</b> pulse. These two features argue against the existence of dark reversion or dark destruction of the biologically active moiety. Third, signal transduction is rapid—measurable mRNA changes occur even during a 10 minute irradiation...|$|E
