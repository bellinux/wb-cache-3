MethodIn this study, 238 normal-weight adults (82 % women; Mean age = 36. 6, SD = 15. 0) participated in an online survey containing measures of Restraint Scale, Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, and Body Dissatisfaction and Drive for Thinness scales. ResultsExploratory factor analyses corroborated the two-factors structure found in previous studies, in particular when three items without clear factorial assignment and low correlation were excluded. A final two-factors version of the RS containing seven items presented a very good fit to the measurement model and good internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis of the 7 -items RS in relation to a three-factor model of overeating, dieting and body dissatisfaction measures revealed that the RS was the only <b>restraint</b> <b>measure</b> loading in all three factors.

40|$|Eating {{disorders}} and borderline personality disorder involve several overlapping features, such as impulsivity, negative affectivity, and dissociation. However, {{few studies have}} specifically assessed how eating pathology and borderline personality may be related. The present study sought to evaluate this relationship by focusing on one particular area of overlap, negative affectivity. A pilot study assessed {{the psychometric properties of}} a dietary <b>restraint</b> <b>measure</b> among undergraduate women (N = 149). In the main study, undergraduate women (N = 307) completed a baseline mood assessment, then viewed a 39 -minute sad film either with or without concurrent food presentation. Participants then completed a second mood assessment, and those who received food completed a third mood assessment following a 10 -minute post-reflection delay. Results suggest that women reporting more borderline features exhibited greater negative affect across three different time points (baseline, post-movie/food, and post-reflection period), and were more reactive to the sad film. Food presentation appeared to have a small tempering effect on sadness, such that individuals who received food reported relatively less sadness after viewing the film when compared to those who did not receive food. However, actual quantity of food consumption was associated with improvements in mood only for women reporting higher levels of borderline features. Finally, highscorers on dietary restraint measures consumed greater quantities of food than their lowscoring counterparts. In sum, these data suggest that women with borderline personality features may be at elevated risk for developing problems with binge-eating, as consuming larger quantities of food appeared to have a tempering effect on their negative mood and specific feelings of sadness. Further, results are consistent with earlier findings in that reported efforts to restrain dietary intake were associated with greater food consumption in response to negative affect, and this relationship may need to be addressed in treating individuals with problematic eating behaviors...|$|E

40|$|Title: The {{association}} between the prevalence and attitude regarding physical restraint use in a Dutch acute hospital. Background: Factors that influence physical restraint use need to be identified to reduce this questionable practice. However, due to limitations of previous studies, it is unknown whether an association exists between the prevalence and attitude regarding restraint use. Aim and research questions: To explore the {{association between}} the prevalence of physical restraint use and attitude of physicians and nurses towards restraint use in a Dutch acute hospital. The research questions were: what is the prevalence of restraint use, what is the attitude of physicians and nurses towards restraint use, and is there an {{association between the}} prevalence and attitude regarding restraint use? Method: A cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted. Unannounced, one researcher observed patients on 17 units on restraint use to determine the prevalence. Then, physicians and nurses working in these units {{were asked to complete}} the Maastricht Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ) to determine their attitude towards restraint use. Subsequently, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the association between the prevalence rates and mean MAQ scores at the unit level. Units with a response lower than 40 % and/or a prevalence based on less than five patients were excluded from this analysis to increase the usability of the results. Results: A moderate to strong positive significant association (rs= 0 ∙ 608, p= 0 ∙ 027) was found, indicating that units with a positive attitude tended to use more restraint than units with a negative attitude. Physicians and nurses had a relatively neutral to slightly positive attitude regarding restraint use, but they considered the use of restraint as appropriate clinical practice. Physicians and nurses considered the mostly used <b>restraint</b> <b>measure</b> (bilateral bedrails) as moderately restrictive. Conclusion: Attitude may be an influencing factor of physical restraint use. Recommendations: Information programs for units with positive attitudes and high prevalence rates should be aimed at changing attitudes against restraint use {{in order to reduce the}} use of restraint...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionTodays {{healthcare}} {{systems are}} characterized by rapid change, a high tech environment, cost efficiency and limited care capacities. These developments contribute to increasingly complicated situations and a more complex role for nurses in a stressful work environment. This evolution requires that nurses have a good ethical awareness {{as well as the}} creativity to search for care solutions that contribute to the well-being of the patient. Unfortunately, nurses working in this complex environment often give priority to technical care interventions which may jeopardize the development of a personalized caring relationship. Research shows that nurses experience difficulties in the ethical reasoning process as well as in implementing decisions in the clinical environment. As a result, nurses tend to conform expectations and requirements of the context, rather than undertake a critical ethical search for a particular tailored care solution. The importance of reasoning and acting in the patients best interest is all the more important in acute care for older people. Particularly in acute elderly care, where most of the patients have impaired physical and mental abilities and limited capacities to express their personal needs and wishes, the vulnerability of the patients increases. To deal appropriately with this vulnerability, nurses {{need to be able to}} critically observe and interpret patients signals in order to provide ethical care in order to respect the older patients individuality, dignity and autonomy. The difficulties nurses experience in their ethical practice are mostly related to ethically laden nursing practices such as the case of physical restraint in daily care for older people. Ethically oriented literature with regard to physical restraint stresses the importance of an ethical evaluation of the situation by means of balancing and weighing the different ethical values involved. Empirical research concerning nurses ethical reasoning and behaviour in cases of physical restraint is limited. Despite the growing evidence concerning the negative consequences of restraint use on patients, it remains a common and widespread measure in acute and residential health care facilities in many countries. Protecting the physical integrity of the patient and his environment is often mentioned as the reason for this common practice. The overall objective of this dissertation is to explore, understand and describe nurses ethical practice (reasoning and behaviour), specifically in the case of physical restraint in acute care for older people. Literature reviews A review of the literature including 39 empirical studies (13 quantitative, 19 qualitative and 7 mixed method design) published between January 1988 and September 2008 has led to a more nuanced understanding of nurses ethical practice. Nurses ethical reasoning starts from their ethical awareness with the intention of doing good. The caring relationship forms the context for the ethical assessment, wherein a decision is taken. Nurses take the patients life history, feelings, wishes, intentions, and integrity into account. Here, given the important contextual embedded of nurses ethical reasoning and decision making, it cannot be reduced to its cognitive dimension. To justify their decisions, they rely on medical knowledge, personal values and experiences. Their reasoning process is also influenced by the vision of other colleagues of the team, the wishes of the family members as well as the culture and traditions of the ward. In many cases nurses forsake their values and principles in order to adapt to the opinions and expectations of others. Nurses decision-making is often the result of a difficult process whereby nurses experience tension between their personal values, professional ideals, and the expectations of others. Literature describes how nurses have difficulties in implementing their decisions in practice. Being ignored and not being respected in their ethical practices can hinder nurses from acting as they would like and are the most important cause of moral distress and burn-out. A synthesis of qualitative evidence including twelve empirical studies published between January 1990 and January 2010, concerning nurses decision-making process in cases of physical restraint was carried out. Nurses decision-making in cases of physical restraint varies from case to case but is influenced by patient- nurse and context related factors. The patients behaviour forms an important argument of the decision-making. The complexity of the decision-making depends also on nurses willingness to take risks and the view of the others involved. Nurses are strongly committed to ensuring the safety of patients, of staff and of the environment in which they work. A thoughtful decision requires the balancing of other values involved like psychological integrity, freedom of movement and respecting autonomy. This process of balancing values can be experienced as a dilemma. Where the majority of the included studies focus on elements supporting the complexity of decision-making, only two studies described the entirety of the decision-making process. The phases of initiation, evaluation and adaptation of the decision-making characterizes the trajectory of the decision-making. The qualitative empirical studyIn the original empirical study-with a qualitative research design-by means of semi structured interviews we explored nurses reasoning and decision-making processes. Next to the exploration of the process of decision-making, we also explored the values involved and balanced in nurses decision-making. Also the context as well as the influencing role of the context was studied and described in a nuanced way. Based on the interviews, decision-making in situations of physical restraint are- mostly- the result of an intensive process of observing, analyzing the situation. In the first time nurses try to wait and give chances before physical restraint is applied. In most of the cases, nurses adapt a <b>restraint</b> <b>measure</b> when alternative solutions are insufficient. Physical restraint is often applied in order to guarantee the physical integrity of the patient and his environment. The interviewed nurses describe the application of physical restraint as a last resort and experience this measure as a necessary evil. Most of the taken decisions are ones or more evaluated, adapted and stopped. As a result decisions related to the application of physical restraint are characterized as temporal and reversible. A decision-making that supports the well-being of the patient is based on a correct and complete picture of the patient that is underpinned with rational arguments. Nurses decision-making in cases of physical restraint is characterized as an ethical deliberation process, whereby the goal of doing good is the central idea Whereby a minority of the interviewed nurses explicitly articulate the goal of doing good the majority of the nurses realize this goal by their processes of reasoning and behaviour. The identification of the different ethical values and the process of balancing these values form the essence of ethical deliberation. As the main values all interviewed nurses want to protect for their patientsboth restrained and other patientsare physical integrity followed by psychological integrity. Nurses protect these values by undertaking many actions in order to avoid physical and psychological adverse effects of restraints. Driven by the overwhelming goal of protecting physical integrity, nurses took into account the values of dignity and justice more implicitly and less dominantly. Decision-making implies that nurses have to choose which values receive priority in the process, which in turn implies that not all values can be respected to the same degree. Depending on the situation, circumstances, and nurse involved, decision making can be experienced as difficult, even as a dilemma. According to the interviewees, decision-making in cases of physical restraint is a complex process. This complexity is largely due to the interplay of diverse contextual factors that influence decision-making. Relationships with nursing colleagues, other care providers such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists and physicians, and the patients family form the inter-personal network. The inter-personal network is the central forum wherein consultation, verification and decision-making takes place. Nurses also point the importance of the procedural-legal context as expressed in an institutional ethics policy and procedures, or through legal requirements concerning physical restraint. Further, the architectural structure of a ward, the availability of materials and alternatives for restraint use (the material-physical context), can be decisive in nurses decision-making. All interviewed nurses highlighted the unquestionable role of the practical context of care, specifically time of day and staff-related factors that contribute to the experienced work pressures. Also, the interviewed nurses reported that their decisions may vary according to the time of day (morning, noon, evening, night) and the presence or absence of nursing colleagues, other care providers and family. The work pressure experienced by nurses is often decisive in their decision-making. status: publishe...|$|E

Following this, the paper proceeds to a further step in the design of such measures by introducing a set of environmental parameters in the whole planning process – the latter determine and affect the environmental quality of urban roads. These parameters are tested in practice for a representative network of roads in the urban complex of Maroussi forming an inner ring road, along which bicycle lanes are introduced and thermal comfort measures are taken. It is proposed these environmental parameters can be involved in the planning process and that can be used as potential tools of an advanced transport policy, which adds the environmental quality of roads to the targets of the whole traffic restraint process...|$|R
40|$|Urban traffic {{problems}} {{are now a}} key political issue in most European countries; in terms of congestion, road safety, and the environment. The response to date in many cities has been to rely on parking controls, better traffic management, and congestion itself to contain traffic, but increasingly there is a recognition that in the larger cities some form of direct restraint on traffic levels will become necessary as car ownership continues to rise. The paper first assesses a number of nonpricing <b>restraint</b> <b>measures,</b> including restrictions on traffic speed and network capacity, and regulatory controls on access. It then considers what role road pricing might play. Here three objectives are identified, {{and a number of}} key factors affecting implementation are discussed, including technology, privacy, equity, and the allocation of revenues. One aspect where there is little empirical evidence concerns likely response of drivers to road charges, {{and the size of the}} elasticities. Drawing on experience from a number of toll schemes in Norway, some new evidence on driver response is presented. This paper concludes by summarizing current developments regarding road pricing in different European countries, and assesses the potential of the measure as a demand management tool in the future. ...|$|R
