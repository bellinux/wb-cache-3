25|$|On May 2008, it was {{announced}} that the team would resume play for the 2008-09 season, and that the Atenienses de Manatí would be moved back to Santurce, and again become the Cangrejeros. As part of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico's <b>restructuration</b> program, Major League Baseball offered to work with its publicity. On July 15, 2008, personnel from the league and Major League Baseball participated in a reunion, where details about the league's merchandising were discussed. The team was still owned by Valentín. Participating in the now-renamed Puerto Rico Baseball League, the Santurce made the playoffs in their first season back after a four-year absence, but were eliminated in the first round. In November 2009, a dispense suggested by Valentín was accepted by the league's board of directors, and the team recessed for the following season. This was due to the franchise's difficulty to secure a home stadium due to the opposition of San Juan's municipal government. In August 2010, the league announced the return of the Cangrejeros, as well as the Senadores, to Hiram Bithorn Stadium. However, the following month, the municipality of San Juan once again opposed the participation of the two teams in the venue. League officials immediately held a reunion with municipal government personnel, pursuing a solution. They were not listed on the 2010-11 LBPPR schedule.|$|E

40|$|A {{crucial point}} in program {{analysis}} is the computation of loop invariants. Accurate invariants {{are required to}} prove properties on a program but they are difficult to compute. Extensive research {{has been carried out}} but, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no benchmark has ever been developed to compare algorithms and tools. We present ALICe, a toolset to compare automatic computation techniques of affine loop scalar invariants. It comes with a benchmark that we built using 102 test cases which we found in the loop invariant bibliography, and interfaces with three analysis programs, that rely on different techniques: Aspic, ISL and PIPS. Conversion tools are provided to handle format heterogeneity of these programs. Experimental results show the importance of model coding and the poor performances of PIPS on concurrent loops. To tackle these issues, we use two model <b>restructurations</b> techniques whose correctness is proved in Coq, and discuss the improvements realized. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{humanitarian}} {{work has}} always implied {{a certain level}} of risk, {{in the last two decades}} there has been a growing concern that humanitarian and peacekeeping agents are exposed to unprecedented levels of insecurity. To determine whether or not such claims and perceptions are substantiated, researchers have developed quantitative datasets aimed at measuring and tracking threats to humanitarians and peacekeepers at the global level. In contrast to humanitarian practitioners which use such quantitative expertise to suggest aid work is becoming increasingly dangerous, the producers of quantitative representations of humanitarian security suggest instead that attack rates have remained for the most part fairly stable despite increases in absolute numbers. In order to make sense of this paradox, this article draws on neo-Bourdieusian approaches, the sociology of professions and organizations, as well as global governance literature on quantification to suggest that such inconsistencies relate to the use of quantitative data to legitimate organizational change and bureaucratic <b>restructurations</b> in relation to the institutionalization of security expertise. By understanding the dynamics of organizational change, this article sheds light on one of the ways through which international humanitarianism and peacekeeping is shifting from a paradigm of proximity to a paradigm of distance and remoteness...|$|R

Roughly 1 / 3 of all 913 participants of the therapy from 1984 to July 1990 {{have responded to the}} survey. Of these 1 / 3, more than a quarter did not smoke any more one year after the therapy. An antismoking program with a 1 -year smoking cessation rate of 20 to 30 % is considered successful in professional circles.

Also the more precise inquiry in the first 7 therapies of 1990 confirms these findings. There the rate of success is barely 15 % after 1 to 1 1 / 2 year.

40|$|This paper {{frames and}} summarises the main {{contributions}} of a book-length project {{that aims to}} explain the recent rise of Spain’s firms in complex service sectors, and the parallel fall in skill- and capital-intensive manufacturing sectors, through {{an analysis of the}} institutional structure that enabled it. The paper argues that a form of strategic coordination called peer coordination (PC) was responsible for the Spanish pattern of upgrading. PC was a non-hierarchical variant of strategic coordination based on the presence of structural public-private interdependencies and direct statebusiness interactions. PC enabled large, well-established Spanish firms in complex service sectors like banking and telecommunications to maintain control of the home market and undertake costly <b>restructurations</b> but imposed few constraints on these firms, facilitating upgrading. The lack of effective intermediary agents hindered the development of PC in capital- and skill-intensive manufacturing sectors dominated by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, PC in banking and telecommunications imposed additional constraints in manufacturing sectors like professional electronics, making it difficult for firms to access the patient capital and stable demand they needed to develop new, complex products. In exceptional cases, the central state and some regional governments were able to circumvent the limitations derived from PC and to create institutional structures that supported modest upgrades in some manufacturing sectors. industrial upgrading, Spain, institutions, business and government relations, public polic...|$|R
40|$|Les systèmes sociosanitaire et de santé mentale au Québec ont été substantiellement transformés dans les dernières années. Au coeur des <b>restructurations,</b> les réformes ont visé la {{consolidation}} des soins primaires et une meilleure intégration du dispositif de soins, tendances centrales des réformes sur le plan international. Cet article résume les principaux axes de transformation des réformes du système sociosanitaire et de la santé mentale au Québec. Il présente aussi le rôle clé des omnipraticiens dans la prise {{en charge}} des troubles mentaux et les stratégies de coordination déployées. Les réformes visent principalement l’intensification du travail en réseau des omnipraticiens avec les intervenants psychosociaux et les psychiatres. L’article conclut sur l’importance d’optimiser le déploiement de réseaux intégrés de soins et de bonnes pratiques en santé mentale. Par ailleurs, les réformes devraient toujours être accompagnées de mesures et de stratégies d’implantation à juste titre aussi ambitieuses que les changements planifiés !Objectives: The {{health and mental}} health systems in Quebec have recently been substantially transformed. At the heart of this restructuring, reforms aimed to strengthen primary care and to better integrate services, which are central trends internationally. This article summarizes Quebec’s primary {{health and mental health}} reforms. It also presents the key role of general practitioners in the treatment of mental health disorders and their coordination strategies with the mental health care resources in the province. Methods: Numerous documents on the Quebec health and mental health reforms and the international literature on primary mental health care were consulted for this study. Information on general practitioner roles in mental health were based on administrative data from the Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) for all medical procedures performed in 2006. The data was compared with the results of a survey realized in the same year with 398 general practitioners in Quebec. Complementary qualitative data was collected through one hour interviews on a subsample of 60 of those general practitioners. Results: The central aim of the Quebec healthcare reform was to improve services integration by implementing local healthcare networks. A population health approach and a hierarchical service provision were promoted. For a better access and continuity of care, family medicine groups and network clinics were also developed. The mental health reform (Action Plan in Mental Health, 2005 - 2010) was launched in this general context. It prioritized the consolidation of primary care and shared-care (i. e. increased networking between general practitioners and psychosocial workers and psychiatrists) by reinforcing the role of general practitioners in mental health, developing mental health interdisciplinary teams in primary care and adding a psychiatrist-respondent function in each Quebec local healthcare network. In mental health, general practitioners played a central role as the primary source of care and networking to other resources either primary or specialized health care services. Between 20 - 25 % of visits to general practitioners are related to mental health problems. Nearly all general practitioners manage common mental disorders and believed themselves competent to do so; however, the reverse is true for the management of serious mental disorders. Mainly general practitioners practiced in silo without much relation with the mental health care resources. Numerous factors were found to influence the management of mental health problems: patients’ profiles (e. g. the complexity of mental health problems, concomitant disorders), individual characteristics of the general practitioners (e. g. informal network, training); professional culture (e. g. formal clinical mechanisms), the institutional setting (e. g. multidisciplinary or not) and organizations of services (e. g. policies). Conclusion: Unfortunately, the Quebec health and mental health care reforms have not been fully implemented yet. Family medicine groups and networks clinics, primary mental health teams and psychiatrists-respondent are not optimally operational and therefore, are not having a significant outcome. Support mechanisms to help implement the reforms were not prioritized. Hindering factors should be identified and minimized to increase positive changes in the health and mental health systems. This article concludes on the importance of implementing continuums of care, especially local healthcare networks and best practices in mental health. Furthermore, strong strategies to support the implementation of changes should always accompany sweeping reforms...|$|R
