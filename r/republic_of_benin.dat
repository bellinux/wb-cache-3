Wizkid {{moved out of}} the E.M.E mansion in Lagos and acquired his own home in the Lekki Phase 1 area. Prior to Wizkid's subliminal tweets, Banky W pacified fans by assuring them that nothing was amiss. Furthermore, it was reported that troubles within E.M.E started as early as the 2012 E.M.E all stars concert. It was also reported that money was at the centre of the controversy. On 20 February 2013, Information Nigeria reported that Wizkid was getting 25 percent from every performance, while Banky W and Segun Demuren were getting 50 percent. Osagie, Wizkid's former manager, was getting the remaining 25 percent. After firing Osagie and hiring Godwin Tom (whom he parted ways with in April 2014), Wizkid wanted a 50–50 share with Banky W. The source revealed that Banky W refused to accept Wizkid's proposal. Moreover, it was reported that Banky W wanted to find a manager for Wizkid who would accept 25 percent. It was also reported that things started getting sour as a result of both parties disagreement. Information Nigeria went on to report that Wizkid was doing three shows weekly and bringing in close to ₦24 million monthly.
