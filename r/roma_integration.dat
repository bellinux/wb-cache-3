It argues that Hungary has initiated policies in all three integration components but each has fallen short of the mark in terms of addressing the specific needs and interests of <b>Roma.</b> State <b>integration</b> efforts {{are focused on the}} protection of national minorities whose interests are overwhelmingly cultural in nature such as linguistic and educational provisions, and the interests of Roma, which are primarily socio-economic and political in nature, are sidelined.

40|$|A {{kindergarten}} {{is becoming}} a place where children, parents and kindergarten teachers from various cultural backgrounds are often united. The differences outside the kindergarten {{as well as in}} it are caused by various rejections, second thoughts, even stereotypes and prejudices. To experience differences as something positive it is important that children are acquainted with them in a pre-school era. A role of a kindergarten teacher in this respect is therefore very important. The thesis is based on a carried out project “Intercultural Collaboration between the Kindergarten Ringa raja and Roma Kindergarten Romano. ” Within the project certain activities and gatherings were carried out which enabled children to identify the similarities and the differences in various fields and to experience them as something positive. In {{the first part of the}} thesis I focused on the following topic namely from multicultural to the intercultural education, intercultural education in the nursery and <b>Roma’s</b> <b>integration</b> in the education process. Through concise descriptions and reflections I presented the course of the objective of the project and its evaluation that I wrote based on interviews with educators who were directly involved in the project, as well as from my own perspective. Throughout the project, I found that preschool offers conditions for a quality intercultural education. The guidelines can already be found in the kindergarten Curriculum; however I noticed that in practice they have not yet fully come to life. Nevertheless, some teachers still have doubts, concerns of intercultural education and this is passed on to the children. Those differences are not as much sensed by the children as much they are by adults, children feel rather the same. I found out, that it is upon us adults whether our children live intercultural or not, for our prejudices are carried on to the children, children have no prejudices. ...|$|R

In this study, I draw on interviews with Roma in Transylvania to suggest three barriers to mass support of Roma mobilization in Romania: first, a lack of identification with the Roma ethnonym and the unity it imposes on Gypsy social organization; second, a fear on the local level that the Roma movement is potentially a corrupt, elite movement; and third, a lack of communication between national and local efforts which exacerbates that fear...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus in}} this study is on the {{situation}} of Roma in Sweden. The purpose is to see the integration strategies that are reflected in Swedish politics, considering the inclusion of Roma. Idea analysis has been used as method, and I have analysed the text to find expressions of four different ideal types that represent four different types of integrations processes. The material consists of the government’s strategy plan for the Roma’s inclusion in Sweden between 2012 - 2032. Depending on what is being said in the government’s strategy plan about the inclusion of Roma, I will be able to categorize different parts of the text and place it under a certain ideal type, and consequently see the integration strategies that are reflected in Swedish politics. The essay’s results shows that the strategy for the Roma’s inclusion consist of two different ideas of integration processes. It also shows that the other two ideal types for integration processes do not occur in the strategy plan. The four ideal types are: ethnic assimilation, ethnic segregation, civic integration and multiculturalism. The results show that expressions of the last two ideal types are consistent throughout the government’s strategy plan for the Roma’s inclusion. Which one of the two integrations strategies that is the most dominant in the strategy plan has been hard to identify. Keywords: <b>Roma,</b> Inclusion, <b>Integration</b> strategie...|$|R

The author arrives at a conclusion that today one can note several factors and conditions in European countries which still nurture and further reinforce especially anti-Roma stereotypes. According to him, the specific and carefully elaborated stereotypes-oriented policies and strategies which favour mutual education, knowledge and understanding as well as ongoing contact and dialogue between the two different ethnic, social and cultural identities at both EU and member states levels are conditio sine qua non for the enhanced and overall <b>Roma</b> inclusion and <b>integration...</b>|$|R

Amnesty International reports continued instances of Antizigan discrimination during the 20th Century, particularly in Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Kosovo. The European Union has recognized that discrimination against Romani must be addressed, and with the national <b>Roma</b> <b>integration</b> strategy they encourage member states to work towards greater Romani inclusion and upholding the rights of the Romani in the European union.|$|E

40|$|After {{the opening}} of the EU borders in 2004 and 2007, many Central-and Eastern European Roma have left their home {{countries}} permanently or for up to three months periods of the time, to search for better possibilities to support their families. According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), some 80 % of European Roma live below their country’s at-risk-of-poverty threshold; every third Roma lives in housing without tap water and 50 % of Roma between the ages of six and 24 do not attend school (FRA 2016, p. 3). The European public discourses about Roma are polarising. A statement that seems to permeate the discussions, is the declaration that Roma does not want to integrate, but rather sustain parallel societies and live “in freedom and without rules, without laws and without jobs. " (Vermes 2017) In collaboration with the Manchester based project Supporting Roma Voice by University of Salford’s Sustainable Housing and Urban Studies Unit, I have conducted three months of field work in several locations in England with Roma from Central- and Eastern European countries who have migrated to the UK. The main research issue {{of this study is to}} explore how Roma react and feel about the declaration that they do not want to integrate, to provide Roma voices a platform to share their narratives and thoughts around the ongoing debate concerning them and what Roma would like social workers to understand, from their perspective. Werner Obrecht’s (2009) theory of bio-psycho-social human needs is used as the main theoretical perspective in order to shed light on the complexity of <b>Roma</b> and <b>integration.</b> The <b>Roma</b> participants disagree with the statement that they don’t want to be integrated. They strongly express that they want to be respected and be acknowledged as human beings with aspirations for the future as everyone else. They emphasise the elimination of an institutionalised stigmatisation of Roma as the main key to access to education, decent housing, employment, equal opportunities and an inclusive society...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of this Submission Pavee Point is a voluntary, or non-governmental, {{organisation}} {{committed to}} the attainment of human rights for Irish Travellers since 1985. The group is comprised of Travellers {{and members of the}} majority population working together in partnership {{to address the needs of}} Travellers as a minority group experiencing exclusion and marginalisation. Pavee Point has also had a Roma Support Group since 2000. As such, Pavee Point welcomes the initiative of the European Commission to introduce National <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategies and is keen to use its expertise in working with, and for, Travellers and Roma to contribute to the development of Ireland‟s National Traveller and <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategy. Traveller and Roma people and their representative organisations have a key role to play in this national strategy, as identified by the European Commission in their communication: “[National Strategies should] Be designed, implemented and monitored in close cooperation and continuous dialogue with Roma civil society, regional and local authorities. ” From: An EU Framework for National <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategies up to 2020, p. 9 The Commission also asked that national strategies be in line with the Common Basic Principles on Roma Inclusion, which also provide for the involvement of civil society and the active participation of Roma: constructive, pragmatic and non-discriminatory policies; explicit but not exclusive targeting; inter-cultural approach; aiming for the mainstream; awareness of the gender dimension; transfer of evidence-based policies; use of EU instruments; involvement of regional and local authorities; involvement of civil society; and active participation of Roma. This submission outlines Pavee Point‟s position in relation to the key areas identified for inclusion in the strategies by the European Commission – education, employment, health and housing. It also makes general recommendations in relation to the development, implementation and monitoring of Ireland‟s National Traveller and <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategy.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to present {{exemplary}} figures found in Roma cul - ture. The author distinguishes two main types: Roma exemplary figures arising from official knowledge and from informal knowledge.

One of the main conclusions {{of the study is}} that the Romas either have only superficial knowledge of the Roma exemplary figures existing in official knowledge (e. g. historical heroes, artists), or they project a ste - reotypical image of Romas (e. g. celebs), that make them unsuited to promoting <b>Roma</b> <b>integration.</b> Then, through the example of the community-shaping influ - ence of the Cursillo chorus of the Gypsies in Szendrőlád who have converted to Catholicism, he shows how everyday heroes can provide the identity-shaping influence that is present only superficially in the cult of historical heroes, and as a consequence how they can become foundation stones of <b>Roma</b> <b>integration...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present {{civil society}} {{monitoring}} report aims to provide thorough information and explanations about major challenges and obstacles {{with regard to}} the Decade of Roma Inclusion and the National <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategy in Bulgaria, as implemented by the Bulgarian government, along with recommendations. A specially designed research project was conducted in the period November [...] December 2012, in all neighbourhoods with predominantly Roma populations in Bulgaria. The sample for the study comprised 1000 households, equal to 100 clusters with 10 respondents in each cluster. The data-base was used for simple random sampling of segregated neighbourhoods, weighted by population size. The quantitative study was complemented by the work of eight focus groups consisting of Roma end beneficiaries in the following localities: Petrich, Sofia, Hayredin, Kuklen, Stara Zagora, Razgrad and Veliko Tarnovo. Bulgaria's achievements in implementing its commitment of the Decade of Roma Inclusion and the recently adopted National <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategy have been widely debated; however there has been no significant progress in the relevant priority areas related to <b>Roma</b> <b>integration</b> into mainstream society in Bulgaria. The main conclusion of the present report is that the NRIS lacks synergy, coherence and equal distribution in its envisaged activities, measures and financial allocations. It overlooks major areas such as housing conditions, health care and educational integration. In order to accomplish the measures outlined in the NRIS, the Bulgarian government should provide adequate structural provisions by combining consistent political will with a suitable legislative framework, expertise, knowledge, sensibility, flexibility and appropriate financial resources. Furthermore, these provisions should be based on the principles of transparency, inclusiveness, partnership, efficiency and effectiveness, all aimed at achieving measurable, long term impact...|$|E

40|$|The {{situation}} of the Roma minority {{is one of the}} Czech Republic's most urgent social and human rights problems. The Czech Republic seeks to address this complex problem {{with a wide range of}} activities. The overall direction of the Czech Republic's integration policy is defined in two strategic documents: the Concept for <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> 2010 - 2013 and the Strategy for Combating Social Exclusion 2011 - 2015. The former document has at the same time the status of the Czech Republic's National Strategy for Roma Inclusion (NSRI), as it was translated and sent to Brussels in response to the European Commission's request to all member states to develop national strategies for Roma inclusion. Initiated by the Decade of Roma Inclusion Secretariat Foundation and written by a coalition of Czech non-governmental organisations (NGOs), this report is intended to provide an independent assessment of the Czech Republic's progress in achieving the goal of Roma inclusion as defined in the Concept for Roma Integration/Czech NSRI. Focussing on six topics: education, employment, health, housing, anti discrimination, and structural requirements, the European Commission provided the member states with feedback on their strategies and made recommendations as to how the strategies could be improved. With a view to providing additional feedback from the perspective of civic society organisations, the Decade Secretariat decided that the independent civic society reports would focus on the same topics. Due to this decision, this report does not cover all the dimensions of <b>Roma</b> <b>integration</b> that are covered by the Czech Concept for <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration,</b> which also includes chapters on the support of Roma identity and culture. However, the decision to limit this report to the social, economic and legal aspects of <b>Roma</b> <b>integration</b> should in no way be interpreted as a disregard for questions related to Roma identity and empowerment. On the contrary, the authors demonstrate throughout the report how the hitherto applied integration strategies fail to give the Roma communities a chance to participate actively in the process of integration. One of the most important challenges for the coming years will be to develop funding mechanisms that will be more accessible for Roma and to introduce better mechanisms for the participation of Roma in decision-making. The first part of this summary follows the report's thematic structure. In the case of each of the six thematic chapters a few key messages will be highlighted. The full text of this report provides more comprehensive information on particular policies and programmes. The second part of this summary has been used to draw attention to three particular cross-sectoral challenges which have surfaced in many of the thematic chapters...|$|E
40|$|The {{expulsion}} {{of large numbers}} of Roma individuals from France since 2009 has raised considerable debate in the context of EU law and policy. This was, however, accompanied by other discriminatory practices and forms of hostility, exclusion and violence against the Roma, such as finger-printing in Italy and educational segregation in the Czech Republic. A comprehensive approach and strong action by the EU against these practices was defended, which led to the Commission communication on the EU Framework on National <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategies (2011), a non-binding Parliament resolution (2013) and the Council recommendation on effective <b>Roma</b> <b>integration</b> measures in the member states (2013). Such comprehensive approach may be in many respects appropriate, but the danger is to neglect the true relevance of concrete, enforceable and ‘hard law’ measures. This chapter thus explores the legal adequacy of EU action with regard to the Roma minority, particularly from free movement and EU citizenship perspectives. The scope for derogations from free movement and from the rights associated with EU citizenship are the centre pieces of this analysis, which critically analyses specific EU Member States’ restrictions on the free movement of the Roma minority and the EU response in this and other relevant aspects...|$|E

40|$|The Roma (Gypsies) are a {{semi-nomadic}} {{people of}} Indian origins and are Europe’s largest minority {{group with a}} population of 10 - 12 million. Despite the EU Directive on Racial Equality and the adoption of National <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategies by member states, discrimination and marginalisation means that they are the poorest and most socially excluded group in Europe and have been frequent targets of racist attacks by neo-fascist groups as well as forced deportations which are in violation of the fundamental principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens. From the late 1990 s an estimated 12 - 15, 000 Roma filed asylum claims and began to leave Eastern Europe. Large-scale westward migration of the Roma followed A 8 accession to the EU in 2004 and more recently following the accession of Romani and Bulgaria. The UK now has one of the largest Roma populations in the EU with an estimated population of 200, 000 (in addition to 200 - 300, 000 indigenous Gypsies and Travellers). This paper examines the political and policy response to the arrival of significant numbers of Roma migrants to the UK from mainland Europe in recent years in the context of growing anti-EU sentiment on one hand and a parallel critique of multicultural approaches to managing migration on the other. Roma migration symbolises all that is 'wrong' with the EU, crystallising increasing fears over large scale immigration and contributing to the rise of the anti-EU political party the UK Independence Party (UKIP). In particular the paper explores how the media and politically inspired moral panic surrounding the Roma – dominated by discourses of criminality and welfare dependency – and a 'mainstreaming' approach to <b>Roma</b> <b>integration</b> paradoxically inhibits integration strategies at a local level, limiting the inclusionary potential of such policies and the assimilation of Roma populations...|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates how the {{economic}} crisis and austerity politics affect the strategies of pro-Roma non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and movements that fight for Roma access to housing in Rome. In the last 20  years, the main social housing policy for the Roma adopted by the City of Rome consisted of the so-called ‘equipped villages’, that is, equipped areas with Portakabins and basic facilities. Designed as a temporary housing solution to accommodate the Roma population living in the slums of the Italian capital, these villages nonetheless persist, hosting {{an increasing number of}} Roma evicted from informal settlements. As a result, these villages are now harshly criticised for being highly segregating, for being overcrowded with worsening sanitary conditions and for not enabling integration. Furthermore, the recent economic recession and austerity politics are putting a strain on <b>Roma</b> <b>integration</b> policies. The increase of social tensions and unrest, the rise of populist parties and of anti-immigration (and anti-Roma) attitudes do not facilitate the inclusion of the Roma minority, in Italy as in other European countries. What effects are these dynamics having on the capacity of pro-Roma associations arguing against the segregation of the equipped villages and for the development of alternative social housing for the Roma? Although it may seem that the crisis has mainly negative effects on the possibility of insisting on <b>Roma</b> <b>integration,</b> the pro-Roma NGOs and movements considered in this paper show how post-crisis austerity can be mobilised as a new resource for action. The paper focuses on two strategies using the crisis as a frame and base for contesting the segregation of the Roma: the first is to highlight the costs of segregation and the second is to mobilise a new form of solidarity based on the housing crisis...|$|E

In this context, the European Union`s (EU) Framework for National <b>Roma</b> <b>Integration</b> Strategies (NRIS) needs to be critically assessed to identify the fault lines in the extant models and suggest a way forward.
