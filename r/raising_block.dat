My main example for the thesis is South Africa and how water is distributed there. I present three different levels of society and how these interact {{when it comes to}} social justice: the international level, the national level (South Africa) and the local level (Cape Town). These three levels are chosen to display how laws and policies from one level are dependent on what happen at other levels. I look especially at how international legislation and polices have impact on national legislation and polices, and how it is necessary for especially developing countries to give away some control over own policies to international institutions and developing agencies. The topic for the thesis is justice in basic water distribution so much focus is on legislation and policies that concern provision of basic water in Cape Town, South Africa and in the UN system. The South African Free Basic Water Policy with <b>raising</b> <b>block</b> tariffs is questioned, and so are the international cost-recovery policies. I also present extracts from the debate between those that believe that water is mainly a human right and those that believe that water is mainly a commodity. In South Africa I am concerned with how South Africa has developed since 1994 and the social conditions in the country. It is especially development in health, poverty, employment and people’s financial situation that is of my concern. In this context I try {{to see if there is}} social justice in South Africa as described by Miller and Rawls...|$|E

50|$|Several {{movements}} of the earth's crust that lead to mountains are associated with faults. These movements actually are amenable to analysis that can predict, for example, {{the height of a}} <b>raised</b> <b>block</b> and the width of an intervening rift between blocks using the rheology of the layers and the forces of isostasy. Early bent plate models predicting fractures and fault movements have evolved into today's kinematic and flexural models.|$|R

50|$|Manda Hararo is a {{group of}} basaltic shield volcanoes in east Africa whose last {{eruption}} was in 2009. The group is very large, spreading over 105 km2. At its northern end is a small example. South of this volcano is the Gumatmali-Gablaytu fissure system, an area dominated by fissure-fed lava flows. At the centre of the complex rise two volcanoes. Manda Hararo's large size is because it is a <b>raised</b> <b>block</b> from the end of a mid-ocean ridge spreading center. It is known for its rare basalts.|$|R

50|$|Because most {{stresses}} {{relate to}} the tectonic activity of moving plates, most motion between blocks is horizontal, that {{is parallel to the}} Earth's crust by strike-slip faults. However vertical movement of blocks produces much more dramatic results. Landforms (mountains, hills, ridges, lakes, valleys, etc.) are sometimes formed when the faults have a large vertical displacement. Adjacent <b>raised</b> <b>blocks</b> (horsts) and down-dropped blocks (grabens) can form high escarpments. Often the movement of these blocks is accompanied by tilting, due to compaction or stretching of the crust at that point.|$|R

In optical grid networks, files replicated at multiple sites are downloaded in parallel to reduce downloading time. Furthermore, each replica is downloaded with multiple wavelengths. Although parallel and multi-wavelength downloading can reduce downloading time, they <b>raise</b> <b>blocking</b> probability of file downloading. To resolve this problem, the proposed scheme selects replicas and establishes lightpaths based on wavelength availability. Through simulation experiments, {{we show that}} the proposed scheme efficiently improves blocking probability without increasing average downloading time...|$|R
5|$|The {{size of the}} ice houses made it {{difficult}} to load ice into them; in 1827 Wyeth invented a lever and horse-drawn pulley system to <b>raise</b> <b>blocks</b> of ice through the roofs of the warehouses. Later improvements to loading included the use of lift systems to <b>raise</b> the <b>blocks</b> of ice {{to the top of the}} building, first using horse power, then steam power; the largest warehouses later introduced conveyor belt systems to bring the ice into storage. Power houses containing the equipment to support these were built alongside the ice houses, and care was taken to avoid the risk of fire from this machinery. Warehouses were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect the sun during the summer. A typical Hudson River warehouse might be 400 feet (120 m) long, 100 feet (30 m) deep and three stories high, able to hold 50,000 tons (four million kg) of ice. The later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) apiece.|$|R

50|$|More than 50 {{million years}} ago the Táchira {{depression}} was a strait that connected Lake Maracaibo with the Orinoco basin. Today it separates the Tamá Massif, a prolongation of the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes, from the Cordillera de Mérida in the Venezuelan Andes.This gap between the Colombian and Venezuelan Andes {{is a product of}} orogenic movements in the Paleogene period that created major faults, <b>raised</b> <b>blocks</b> and formed rifts including the Táchira Depression.There are four faults with northwest-southeast trends aligned in echelon across the Tachira depression between Córdoba in Colombia to the west and Torondoy in Venezuela to the east.This pattern indicates that the region to the south of the depression must have moved westward relative to the region to the north.|$|R

40|$|In $lambda$-grid networks, {{data files}} for job {{execution}} are stored on file servers as replicas, and computing servers, which execute jobs, download these replicas in parallel to reduce downloading time. However, parallel downloading <b>raises</b> <b>blocking</b> probability of lightpath establishments because it uses many links and thus wavelength resources are wasted. To resolve this problem, we propose a dynamic parallel downloading scheme with network coding which encodes data at intermediate nodes. The proposed scheme performs network coding by regarding file servers as intermediate nodes. In this scheme, a file {{is divided into}} multiple blocks.   A file server creates an encoded block from those blocks and stores it as a replica. Computing servers download encoded blocks from multiple file servers in parallel. Through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed scheme can improve the blocking probability and the downloading time efficiently...|$|R

Through e-learning facility, some abuse it by involving {{into the business of}} pornography. This paper tries to explore the application of platforms, whether can prevent child pornography over the capturing end user technique, dilemma international child pornography law, imposing severe punishment, education and public awareness raising with respect to the Theory of Planned Behavioral (TPB). The survey shows that in the behavioral belief's factor scored low correlations. However, the education and public awareness <b>raising,</b> <b>blocking</b> and filtering platforms and harmonization of the dilemma international child pornography law showed a slight high scored value. This indicates that, not only blocking, filtering platforms, education, public awareness raising, and harmonization of the dilemma international child pornography law can prevent child pornography but also imposing severe punishment and capturing end user technique can prevent child pornography with the make use of Theory of Planned Behavioral (TPB) ...|$|R

60|$|Unfortunately, in practice, {{this step}} must be soon made. It is alike {{difficult}} to obtain, transport, and <b>raise,</b> <b>block</b> shafts {{more than ten}} or twelve feet long, except in remarkable positions, and as pieces of singular magnificence. Large pillars are therefore always composed {{of more than one}} block of stone. Such pillars are either jointed like basalt columns, and composed of solid pieces of stone set one above another; or they are filled up towers, built of small stones cemented into a mass, with more or less of regularity: Keep this distinction carefully in mind, it is of great importance; for the jointed column, every stone composing which, however thin, is (so to speak) a complete slice of the shaft, is just as strong as the block pillar of one stone, so long as no forces are brought into action upon it which would have a tendency to cause horizontal dislocation. But the pillar which is built as a filled-up tower is of course liable to fissure in any direction, if its cement give way.|$|R
