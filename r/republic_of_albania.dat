5|$|The postwar {{communist}} regime developed {{the city as}} an industrial and commercial centre. It was elevated {{to the status of}} a museum town, as it was the birthplace of the leader of the People's Socialist <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania,</b> Enver Hoxha, who had been born there in 1908. His house was converted into a museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the Kosovar Albanian {{population}} {{was able to}} use the Albanian flag as its national flag. However, the flag had to be charged with a red star, since this was a common symbol of the Yugoslav nation. Even without this requirement, the flag of the People's Socialist <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania</b> at the time had a red star, outlined in gold, above the double headed eagle. Later on, different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation.|$|E
5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} the couch for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean his room and while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania,</b> named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E

25|$|Corfu was liberated by British troops, {{specifically}} the 40th Royal Marine Commando, which landed in Corfu on 14 October 1944, as the Germans were evacuating Greece.

A large minefield was laid there shortly afterwards by the newly communist Albania and gave rise to the Corfu Channel Incident.

This is the second demolition of the church, the first having taken place during {{the era of the}} People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania,</b> but at the time the church was rebuilt by the local Orthodox Church after the restoration of Democracy in the country (1991).

25|$|In the People's Socialist <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania,</b> Enver Hoxha, who led Albania {{for four}} decades, died on 11 April 1985. His successor, Ramiz Alia, began to {{gradually}} {{open up the}} regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in Shkodra and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition {{led to the formation}} of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists. Albania's former Communists were routed in elections held in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest.|$|E
25|$|Between 1912 and 1914, it {{was under}} the control of the Albanian {{provisional}} government, and controlled by the Principality of Albania between 1914 and 1915. It was occupied by the Allies in 1915 during the First World War, despite Albania's neutrality, before falling to Austro-Hungarian forces in 1916. Austria-Hungary sustained the occupation until 1918, after which it was occupied by Italy. Italy had plans to create an autonomous province over Albania, including the area of Berat. However, following the defeat of Italy in the Vlora War, Albania retook control of Berat. Italy again occupied Berat in 1939 during the Italian invasion of Albania. Following Italy's capitulation, Germany occupied Albania between 1943 and 1944. In November 1944, the communist-controlled Anti-Fascist National Liberation Council of Albania declared in Berat that it was the provisional government of the country, signalling the beginning of the Enver Hoxha dictatorship. Communist Albania retained control over Albania for many decades, until finally falling in 1992. Berat has since then been part of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albania.</b>|$|E
