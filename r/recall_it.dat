5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|Then, a {{rainstorm}} strikes the city, threatening {{to cancel the}} game for which Juror 7 has tickets. Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at the movies, {{because he could not}} <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> in much detail. Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous days, which he does, with difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the boy, who was more than half a foot shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound found in the body. Next, Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment to see whether a shorter person could stab downwards on a taller person. The experiment proves the possibility, but Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would be, would always stab underhanded at an upwards angle against an opponent who was taller than they, as the grip of stabbing downwards would be too awkward and the act of changing hands too time-consuming.|$|E
500|$|There {{was little}} {{immediate}} {{attention to this}} announcement of the theory; {{the president of the}} Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries. Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> later; Professor Samuel Haughton of Dublin claimed that [...] "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old". Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his [...] "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by John Murray.|$|E

500|$|The {{anonymously}} authored {{work was}} repeated almost verbatim {{in a range}} of other publications in the coming decades, giving its description far wider exposure. The first printed reference to the hooden horse having a wooden head appeared in Mackenzie E. C. Walcott's Guide to the Coast of Kent, where he referred to a [...] "curious custom [...] used to prevail" [...] in Ramsgate. Maylam later suggested that the Ramsgate hooden horse tradition died out between 1807 and 1838, for he had interviewed a number of elderly town residents {{in the early twentieth century}} and while several were aware that it had once taken place in the town, none could <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> happening in their own lifetime.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Prince Henry in 1612 {{at the age}} of eighteen, {{probably}} from typhoid, and the departure for Heidelberg of the sixteen-year-old Princess Elizabeth in April 1613, after marrying Elector Frederick V of the Palatine, further weakened the family ties binding Anne and James. Henry's death hit Anne particularly hard; the Venetian ambassador was advised not to offer condolences to her [...] "because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor does she ever <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> without abundant tears and sighs". From this time forward, Anne's health deteriorated, and she withdrew from the centre of cultural and political activities, staging her last known masque in 1614 and no longer maintaining a noble court. Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, McCracken and Dunphy both {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} {{roles in the}} dance ensemble of the new Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Away We Go. Agnes de Mille, who had just staged Aaron Copland's Rodeo for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staging the production. The show went into rehearsals in early 1943. Like her husband, McCracken was cast in an anonymous dance role in the chorus. Early in out-of-town tryouts, she began to distinguish herself, and her dancing was noticed by reviewers. By {{the time of the}} Broadway opening of the show, now named Oklahoma!, [...] de Mille a she had developed her comic performance in the role of Sylvie, with McCracken taking a comic pratfall in the [...] "Many a New Day" [...] dance number. She became known as [...] "The Girl Who Fell Down". Sources differ as to whether the role's distinctive fall was devised by McCracken or de Mille. McCracken has said the ideas was hers, while de Mille and others <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> as being the choreographer's. Celeste Holm, a member of the original cast, attributed the idea to composer Richard Rodgers.|$|E

500|$|The time loop {{continues}} ad nauseam, {{though each}} time Pam speaks to Mulder, he comes closer {{to being able}} to remember her. She is finally able to convince him that events are repeating themselves, and before he is killed by the blast, Mulder begins repeating [...] "he's got a bomb" [...] to himself, in an attempt to <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> the next time around. In the following iteration of the day Mulder finds himself repeating the phrase in the bank, and acting on his hunch, calls Scully and then confronts Bernard before he begins the holdup, changing events on a fundamental level. Scully, acting on Mulder's phone call, brings Pam into the Bank. Mulder and Pam convince Bernard to give up and walk out with Pam. The sirens of the approaching Police response become audible and Bernard becomes agitated and attempts to shoot Mulder, but Pam throws herself in front of Mulder as he fires. As she lies dying, she admits, [...] "This never happened before." [...] Bernard collapses to his knees, horrified by what he has done, and is peacefully arrested. The bomb blast averted, time continues as normal.|$|E
500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I <b>recall</b> <b>it),</b> I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

50|$|Transience {{refers to}} the general {{deterioration}} of a specific memory over time. Much more can be remembered of recent events than those further in one's past. This is especially true with episodic memory, because every time an episodic memory is <b>recalled,</b> <b>it</b> is re-encoded within the hippocampus, altering the memory each time one <b>recalls</b> <b>it.</b> Transience is caused because of interference. There {{are two types of}} interference: proactive interference (old information inhibits the ability to remember new information), and retroactive interference (new information inhibits the ability to remember old information).|$|R

500|$|About 300,000 {{people came}} out in Atlanta for the film's premiere at the Loew's Grand Theatre on December 15, 1939. It was the climax of three days of festivities hosted by Mayor William B. Hartsfield, which {{included}} a parade of limousines featuring stars from the film, receptions, thousands of Confederate flags and a costume ball. Eurith D. Rivers, the governor of Georgia, declared December 15 a state holiday. An estimated three hundred thousand residents and visitors to Atlanta lined the streets for up to seven miles to watch a procession of limousines bring the stars from the airport. Only Leslie Howard and Victor Fleming chose not to attend: Howard had returned to England due to the outbreak of World War II, and Fleming had fallen out with Selznick and declined to attend any of the premieres. Hattie McDaniel was also absent, as she and the other black cast members [...] were prevented from attending the premiere due to Georgia's Jim Crow laws, which would have kept them from sitting with their white colleagues. Upon learning that McDaniel had been barred from the premiere, Clark Gable threatened to boycott the event, but McDaniel convinced him to attend. President Jimmy Carter would later <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "the biggest event {{to happen in the}} South in my lifetime." [...] Premieres in New York and Los Angeles followed, the latter attended by some of the actresses that had been considered for the part of Scarlett, among them Paulette Goddard, Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Venice's old possessions, {{but above}} all in the Ionian islands, {{the memory of the}} Republic is deeply rooted in the population, who <b>recall</b> <b>it</b> with a shade of nostalgia even after so much time and so many events. Because of the long Venetian period, the manners and traditions of the {{inhabitants}} of the Ionian Islands are a mixture of Greek and Italian. The Venetian influence is illustrated in all aspects of culture and everyday life. In 1800 the Septinsular Republic was established; its flag design was based on the flag of the Republic of Venice. In addition, Italian was the co-official language of both the Septinsular Republic and the United States of the Ionian Islands. Because of its status, Italian was also taught at schools along with Greek and English (Ionian Islands were a protectorate of the United Kingdom from 1815 until 1864). In the First Year of the secondary education, for instance, Greek was taught four times a week, Italian three times and English twice. In the Greek Census of 1907, 4,675 people from the Ionian Islands stated Catholicism as their denomination, about 1.8% of the total population (254,494), while 2,541 (1%) Ionians stated Italian as their mother tongue, making it the second language by number of speakers. The Italian language remains popular on the islands. The Hellenic Union of Eptanisians, a civil non-profit company working for the promotion of the Heptanesian Culture, objected to the decision of the Ministry to abolish the teaching of Italian in schools, saying that [...] "especially for the Ionian Islands the selection of the Italian language has become a tradition for their schools, but also a necessary language because of the many tourists from Italy and other relations e.g. cultural, commercial, etc., of the islands with the country" [...] and they propose [...] "respect for the choice of the children and recognition of their right to learn the language they want and especially the Italian as it's the language with the greatest preference on the Ionian Islands".|$|E

50|$|One {{major problem}} about this {{theory is that}} in real-life situation, the time between {{encoding}} a piece of information and <b>recalling</b> <b>it,</b> {{is going to be}} filled with all different kinds of events that might happen to the individual. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that forgetting is a result of only the time duration. It is also important to consider the effectiveness of this theory. Although it seems very plausible, it is about impossible to test. It is difficult to create a situation where there is a blank period of time between presenting the material and <b>recalling</b> <b>it</b> later.|$|R
