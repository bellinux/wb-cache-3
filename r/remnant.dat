5|$|Despite {{moving over}} warm waters, Elida began to weaken because it began an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. When the cycle ended, the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened. Elida fell to {{a tropical storm}} on July 27, then degenerated into a <b>remnant</b> low {{and turned to the}} northeast.

5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a <b>remnant</b> low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The <b>remnant</b> low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The <b>remnant</b> low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E

5|$|On June 8, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather that}} had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two-E. It became a tropical storm the next day.

40|$|Binding and {{internalization}} of chylomicron <b>remnants</b> from rat mesenteric lymph by HepG 2 cells was inhibited by both excess <b>remnants</b> and {{low-density lipoprotein}} (LDL) {{to the same}} extent. Ligand blots revealed binding of <b>remnants</b> and LDL to the LDL receptor. Measures regulating LDL receptor activity greatly influenced the binding of remnants: ethinyloestradiol, the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin {{and the absence of}} LDL all increased binding, whereas high cell density or the presence of LDL decreased binding. Also, asialofetuin, asialomucin, the neoglycoprotein galactosyl-albumin and an antibody against the asialoglycoprotein receptor all decreased substantially the binding of <b>remnants.</b> At high cell density, binding internalization and degradation of chylomicron <b>remnants</b> was inhibited by up to 70 - 80 %, yet binding of LDL was inhibited by no more than 20 - 30 %. In cross-competition studies, the binding of 125 I-asialofetuin was efficiently competed for by asialofetuin itself or by the antibody, and also by LDL and <b>remnants,</b> yet <b>remnants</b> displayed an approx. 100 -fold higher affinity than LDL. Likewise, <b>remnants</b> of human triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins and asialofetuin interfered with each others' binding to HepG 2 cells or human liver membranes. It is concluded that the LDL receptor mediates the internalization of chylomicron <b>remnants</b> into hepatocytes depending on its activity, according to demand for cholesterol. Additionally, the asialoglycoprotein receptor may contribute to the endocytosis of LDL, but predominantly of chylomicron <b>remnants...</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>remnant</b> low of a {{depression}} emerged into the Arabian Sea off Kerala late on November 21 and {{developed into a}} new depression the next day as it moved west. The depression moved further west, and gradually turned toward the southwest, intensifying as it did so. It became a cyclonic storm on November 28 to the southeast of Socotra and reached its peak with 75km/h (25mph) winds soon after. The cyclone continued to move west-southwestwards and rapidly weakened into a <b>remnant</b> low pressure area off the Somalia coast the next day, ending the season.|$|E
5|$|The <b>remnant</b> trough {{proceeded}} northwestward {{into the}} Bahamas, where the NHC assessed a high chance of redevelopment based on relenting upper wind shear. Over {{the next couple}} of days, it moved over the Bahamas and proceeded east of southern Florida. Late on August6, the trough developed a new center of circulation and regenerated into a weak tropical depression by 1800UTC near Grand Bahama. Emily briefly reattained tropical storm strength six hours later, although it once again dissipated to a <b>remnant</b> low the next day owing to increasing wind shear. The low took on an accelerated east-northeastward motion, bypassing Bermuda before heading eastward over the open Atlantic. It briefly retained a broad area of gale-force winds with deep convection, which prompted the NHC to remonitor the system. The combination of strong wind shear and its rapid forward speed inhibited significant development, and the <b>remnant</b> dissipated around 1200UTC on August11, about 980mi (1,565km) west of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|This <b>remnant</b> (RX J0852.0-4622) {{had been}} found in front (apparently) of the larger Vela Supernova <b>Remnant.</b> The gamma rays from the decay of titanium-44 showed that it must have {{exploded}} fairly recently (perhaps around 1200 AD), but there is no historical record of it. The flux of gamma rays and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 600 ly). If so, this is a surprising event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.|$|E
40|$|Between 1972 and 1999 the {{clearance}} of Tasmanian runs for crops, improved pasture and dams declined dramatically, although, since then, {{there has been}} clearance {{of some of the}} least-protected vegetation types. During a six-year period in the 1990 s some vegetation <b>remnants</b> in wool-growing country were cleared or partially cleared and a substantial number of properties changed ownership. Change in ownership was often associated with changes in management of the <b>remnants.</b> Some changes were positive; more were negative. The vegetation characteristics of the edges and centres of the uncleared <b>remnants</b> did not change very much over the six years. Edge effects in <b>remnants</b> are shown to be very limited in penetration and largely related to ingress of nutrients from surrounding developed country. Mosses and liverworts, vascular plants and birds respond very differently to the characteristics and management of <b>remnants.</b> Small <b>remnants</b> in poor condition may, in some cases, be more important for the maintenance of native biodiversity than large <b>remnants</b> in good condition. The management of <b>remnants</b> for nature conservation should be primarily directed towards the maintenance of populations of threatened species, not improvement in condition...|$|R
30|$|If placental <b>remnants</b> are present, hysteroscopic {{removal of}} placental <b>remnants</b> {{is a good}} {{alternative}} [16]. Hysteroscopy {{has the advantage of}} the placental <b>remnants</b> being evacuated selectively, minimizing trauma to surrounding endometrium and basal layer [17]. Hysteroscopic removal of placenta tissue can easily be performed without increase of complications. Both in the absence as in the presence of placental <b>remnants,</b> trauma to the endometrium is reduced compared to curettage. Reduction of trauma to the endometrium reduces the risk of adhesion formation. In view of the benefits, hysteroscopic evaluation should be the treatment of choice whenever a secondary intervention is performed on suspicion of placental <b>remnants</b> [18].|$|R
40|$|Rat lymph {{chylomicron}}s and chylomicron <b>remnants</b> {{were treated}} with trypsin or Pronase. The ability of the resulting apoprotein-free lipoproteins to be {{taken up by the}} isolated perfused rat liver, and to bind to isolated rat liver membranes, was examined. Compared with control lipoproteins, the apoprotein-free chylomicrons and <b>remnants</b> retained unaltered their capacity to be differentiated by the intact liver and by the isolated membranes. Further, control <b>remnants</b> and apoprotein-free <b>remnants</b> competed for binding to the isolated membranes. We conclude that apoproteins are not required for the hepatic differentiation between chylomicrons and <b>remnants,</b> and suggest that the lipoprotein phospholipids may play a direct role in this process...|$|R
