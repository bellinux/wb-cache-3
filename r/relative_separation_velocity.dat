40|$|Abstract. Star {{clusters}} {{are subject}} to density irregularities in their host galaxy, such as giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the galactic disc and spiral arms, which are largely ignored in present day (N-body) simulations of cluster evolution. Time dependent external potentials give rise to tidal forces that accelerate stars leading to an expansion and more rapid dissolution of the cluster. I explain {{the basic principles of}} this tidal heating in the impulse approximation and show how related disruption time-scales depend on properties of the cluster. 1. Tidal heating, how does it work? Assume a cluster and a moving perturbing object (GMC, spiral arm, disc, etc.) with <b>relative</b> <b>separation</b> and <b>velocity</b> X and V, respectively. The acceleration due to the perturber is referred to as g(X). The tidal acceleration (at) on a star at a distance x from the cluster centre can be obtained by linearising g(X) : at = dvx dt dg = g(X + x) − g(X) ≃ x. (1) dX The total velocity increase (∆vx) of the star after the perturbation can be obtained by substituting dX = V dt and integrating Eq. 1. If the time it takes the perturber to pass the cluster is much shorter than the crossing time of stars in the cluster, x can be assumed constant. This {{is referred to as the}} impulsive approximation. The resulting ∆vx then simply scales with x, V and the maximum acceleration (gm) as: ∆vx ∝ xgm/V. The total kinetic energy gain per unit of cluster mass (∆E) can then be written as ∆E = 1 2 |∆vx 2 | ∝ gm 2 ¯ r...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new sample of bright galaxy pairs {{extracted}} applying an objective selection code to UZC catalog. The sample is volume limited to M_zw = - 18. 9 + 5 log h and contains 89 galaxy pairs. We analyze the kinematical, morphological and photometrical properties of galaxies belonging to this sample. We show that <b>velocity</b> <b>separation,</b> | Δ v_r |, between pair members is significantly lower in spiral type (S+S) pairs than in early-type (E+E) and mixed (E+S) pairs. This indicates that truly isolated galaxy pairs {{are more likely}} to be found among S+S pairs. We show that ellipticals are rare and underluminous in B and that late spirals (T > 4) are overluminous. We confirm that the formation of bright ellipticals is a phenomenon linked to group/cluster environment, while galaxy-galaxy interaction may enhance blue luminosity of disk galaxies through SF phenomena.

40|$|A {{collision}} {{between two}} molecular clouds is one possible candidate for high-mass star formation. The HII region RCW 36, {{located in the}} Vela molecular ridge, contains a young star cluster with two O-type stars. We present new CO observations of RCW 36 with NANTEN 2, Mopra, and ASTE using ^ 12 CO(J = 1 - 0, 2 - 1, 3 - 2) and ^ 13 CO(J = 2 - 1) line emissions. We have discovered two molecular clouds lying at the velocities V_LSR∼ 5. 5 and 9 km s^- 1. Both clouds {{are likely to be}} physically associated with the star cluster, as verified by the good spatial correspondence among the two clouds, infrared filaments, and the star cluster. We also found a high intensity ratio of ∼ 0. 6 - 1. 2 for CO J = 3 - 2 / 1 - 0 toward both clouds, indicating that the gas temperature has been increased due to heating by the O-type stars. We propose that the O-type stars in RCW 36 were formed by a collision between the two clouds, with a <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>separation</b> of 5 km s^- 1. The complementary spatial distributions and the <b>velocity</b> <b>separation</b> of the two clouds are in good agreement with observational signatures expected for O-type star formation triggered by a cloud-cloud collision. We also found a displacement between the complementary spatial distributions of the two clouds, which we estimate to be 0. 3 pc assuming the collision angle to be 45 ^∘ relative to the line-of-sight. We estimate the collision timescale to be ∼ 10 ^ 5 yr. It is probable that the cluster age by Ellerbroek et al. (2013 b) is dominated by the low-mass members which were not formed under the triggering by cloud-cloud collision, and that the O-type stars {{in the center of the}} cluster are explained by the collisional triggering independently from the low-mass star formation.

40|$|The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M 31) galaxies possess {{rotating}} {{planes of}} satellites. Their formation {{has not been}} explained satisfactorily yet. It was suggested that the MW and M 31 satellites are ancient tidal dwarf galaxies, which could explain their configuration. This suggestion gained support by an analytic backward calculation of the relative MW-M 31 orbit in the MOND modified dynamics paradigm by Zhao et al. (2013) implying their close flyby 7 - 11 Gyr ago. Here we explore the Local Group history in MOND in more detail using a simplified first-ever self-consistent simulation. We note the features induced by the encounter in the simulation and identify their possible real counterparts. The simulation was set to approximately reproduce the observed MW and M 31 masses, effective radii, <b>separation,</b> <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> and disk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code Phantom of RAMSES. In the simulation, matter was transferred from the MW to M 31 along a tidal tail. The encounter induced formation of several structures resembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably: 1) A rotating planar structure formed around M 31 from the transferred material. It had a size similar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the simulated MW, just as the real one. 2) The same structure also resembled the tidal features observed around M 31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the MW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. Moreover, a cloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with {{the extent of the}} actual MW satellite system. The encounter did not end by merging in a Hubble time. The simulation thus demonstrated that MOND can possibly explain many peculiarities of the Local Group. Future more elaborate simulations should verify and expand our conclusions.

40|$|Abstract. The {{results from}} studies of D/Shoemaker–Levy 9 and other recent split comets and comet pairs lead to the {{recognition}} of fundamental differences between breakup products of the tidally and the nontidally split comets and to the conclusive identification of the so-called dissipating comets as secondary nuclei of previously split comets, whose separately arriving principal nuclei had in most cases been missed. The primary attribute of the nontidally split comets is the leading position of the principal nucleus, with all the companion nuclei trailing behind, eventually along the orbit. No such configuration has been observed for the tidally split comets {{of more than two}} components. Dominant effects in the relative motions of fragments derived from the tidal disruptions are due to <b>separation</b> <b>velocities,</b> while differential decelerations (due, presumably, to outgassing-driven nongravitational perturbations) prevail for fragments derived from the nontidal breakups.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of symmetric extragalactic radio sources {{can be characterized}} by four distinct growth stages of the radio luminosity versus size of the source. The interaction of the jet with the ambient medium results in the formation and {{evolution of}} sources with non-standard (flaring) morphology.

The radio source population may thus be classified in morphological types that indicate the prevailing physical processes.

Analysis of CSO dynamics is presented for a sample of 24 CSOs with known redshift and hotspot <b>separation</b> <b>velocity</b> and with a large range of radio power.
