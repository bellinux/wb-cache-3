25|$|With the {{completion}} of grouping in 1923, GWR's collection of 0-6-0 tank locomotives was expanded with the stock from 28 acquired companies. The acquired tank locomotives came from different manufacturers, were a mixture of side, saddle and pannier, and varied widely by size and state of repair. In addition, GWR's stock was wearing out, and the variety of classes was problematic for maintenance and <b>rostering.</b> Collett had to produce a new standard design for 0-6-0 pannier tanks. The result was the 5700 class.|$|E

25|$|On 9 April 2004, Emirates Flight 764, an Airbus A340-300 {{operating}} {{a flight from}} Johannesburg to Dubai sustained serious damage during takeoff when it failed to become airborne {{before the end of}} the runway, striking 25 approach lights, causing four tires to burst which in turn threw debris into various parts of the aircraft, ultimately damaging the flap drive mechanism. This rendered the flaps immovable in the takeoff position. The aircraft returned for an emergency landing during which the normal braking system failed as a result of the damage. The aircraft was brought to a stop only 250 meters from the end of the 3,400 meter runway using reverse thrust and the alternative braking system. In their report, South African investigators found that the captain had used a wrong take-off technique, and criticized Emirates training and <b>rostering</b> practices.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, {{the inquiry}} was reopened to hear new evidence. The final report into the {{accident}} was published on 7 May. It was established {{that there was nothing}} mechanically wrong with the aircraft at the time it crashed, although the engines were operating at idle power. A number of issues were raised, including the <b>rostering</b> of the crew, the captain's failure to ensure that he had all necessary navigational information, the captain's decision to divert to Le Bourget instead of returning straight to England, the inability of Cormeilles to handle two aircraft at once, and the captain's decision to return to England being made too late. Five recommendations were made {{as a result of the}} investigation. These were in relation to crewing, crew route familiarisation, provision of route information to crews, the ability of airfields to handle more than one aircraft at a time by radio and the introduction of new systems of working between the United Kingdom and France in respect of the control of air traffic and the hand-over of flights between the two countries. The latter was reported as already being under consideration at the time the report was published.|$|E

2500|$|LTSS awards four degrees: the Master of Divinity (M.Div.), the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry (M.A.C.M.), the Master of Arts in Religion (M.A.R.), and the Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.). [...] In {{conjunction}} with the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, LTSS also offers students access to a Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) degree. [...] The vast majority of students at LTSS are enrolled in a program of study leading to the M.Div. degree as it is required by the ELCA for ordination as a pastor, though a sizable minority of students is also enrolled in the M.A.C.M. program since this degree is acceptable for <b>rostering</b> as a Deacon in the ELCA. [...] Those {{students enrolled in the}} S.T.M. program are usually those who already have the M.Div. or M.A. and are seeking to enhance their existing ministerial credentials or prepare themselves for doctoral work in religion.|$|E
2500|$|An ordained {{minister}} {{is called to}} the [...] "office of public ministry" [...] of [...] "Word and sacrament" [...] and considered a [...] "steward of the mysteries" [...] of the Church (i.e., the means of grace). Pastors primarily serve congregations, but this role has been expanded to include other forms of ministry as well (e.g., hospital and military chaplains). Pastors are ordinarily trained at one of eight ELCA seminaries located throughout the United States, although there are alternative paths for ordination to serve particular communities {{in which it is}} difficult to provide trained leaders or to allow <b>rostering</b> of clergy transferred from other denominations. Pastors generally hold a Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent, as well as a four-year master of divinity degree, are required to learn biblical Hebrew and Greek, spent at least a summer doing clinical pastoral education—an intensive program that gives them time to reflect on their pastoral craft, usually in a hospital setting, and are required to complete a one-year internship of full-time service in pastoral ministry. A bishop is a pastor called to serve either a synod or as presiding bishop of the ELCA. The Agreement with the Episcopal Church is that bishops be ordained in the Apostolic Succession and remain in that office after retiremen (Called to Common Ministry 2000) whereas before a man or woman servee in that office and returned to being known simply as a pastor when service as a bishop ends.|$|E
