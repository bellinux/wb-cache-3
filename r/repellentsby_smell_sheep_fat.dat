And his first sense to register something was his keen <b>smell.</b> <b>Sheep!</b> He was amazed to <b>smell</b> <b>sheep.</b> There must be a flock not far away. Then from where he glided along under the trees he saw down to open places in the willow brake and noticed sheep tracks in the dark, muddy bank of the brook. Next he heard faint tinkle of bells, and at length, when he could see farther into the open enlargement of the canyon, his surprised gaze fell upon an immense gray, woolly patch that blotted out acres and acres of grass. Thousands of sheep were grazing there. Jean knew there were several flocks of Jorth's sheep on the mountain {{in the care of}} herders, but he had never thought of them being so far west, more than twenty miles from Chevelon Canyon. His roving eyes could not descry any herders or dogs. But he knew there must be dogs close to that immense flock. And, whatever his cunning, he could not hope to elude the scent and sight of shepherd dogs. It would be best to go back the way he had come, wait for darkness, then cross the canyon and climb out, and work around to his objective point. Turning at once, he started to glide back. But almost immediately he was brought stock-still and thrilling by the sound of hoofs.|$|R

40|$|Beta-adrenergic {{agonists}} cause a {{shift in}} carcass composition of poultry, pigs, cattle and <b>sheep.</b> <b>Fat</b> content is dramatically reduced in favour of {{a higher percentage of}} muscle. Carcass yield is usually enhanced and is accompanied by muscle hypertrophy. There is a tendency for an improved growth rate and feed conversion in poultry and ruminants. In pigs, only feed conversion was positively affected. Beta-agonists alter metabolism of several important pathways. They possess lipolytic and anti-lipogenic properties and improve nitrogen retention. Glycolysis, lactate production and oxygen consumption are increased, while plasma insulin levels are decreased and adipocytes become less sensitive to insulin. Energy expenditure is increased by beta-agonists, partly due to an extra heat production. In general, meat colour is not affected by beta-agonists. However, the increased metabolism resulted in a higher ultimate muscle pH. Meat tenderness is mostly unaltered, but the carcass may be more susceptible to cold shortening due to a decreased fat cover. Proximate analysis of the whole ground carcass or individual muscles indicated less fat and more protein and moisture...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{dentition}} (eruption {{of permanent}} incisors) {{is used as}} a proxy for age to define sheep meat quality. Lamb is defined as having no permanent incisors, hogget as having at least one incisor and mutton is defined as having two or more incisors. Classification of the carcase is done at the abattoir prior to the removal of an animal’s head. Recently, an Australian Senate inquiry into meat marketing reported that there was concern that substitution of hogget and mutton for lamb may be occurring in the industry. At present, no objective method is available {{that can be used for}} classifying sheep category. The general aims of this thesis were to i) evaluate whether chemical analysis of branched chain fatty acid (BCFA) content could be used as an objective tool to determine sheep age, ii) understand the effect that some production factors had on BCFA concentrations in Australian sheep and iii) develop new approaches (whether chemical and/or statistical) for determining sheep category (age). BCFAs are implicated as the main contributors to “mutton flavour”, often associated with the cooked meat of older animals. BCFAs are reported to increase with age, which suggests that chemical analysis of these compounds could be used as an objective method. Concentrations of three BCFAs (4 -methyloctanoic (MOA), 4 -ethyloctanoic (EOA) and 4 - methylnonanoic (MNA) acids) were measured in a survey of fat samples taken from 533 sheep carcases at abattoirs in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. This thesis shows that, on its own, chemical analysis of the BCFAs is not sufficient to discriminate lamb from hogget and mutton as pre-slaughter nutrition is a significant factor in classifying sheep using this approach. Uncertainty at the BCFA concentration ranges found in Australian sheep was determined to be high making it difficult to discriminate between sheep carcases of different ages based on the BCFA level. Fast gas chromatography was evaluated as the basis for a high throughput chemical technique but was not sufficiently sensitive for BCFA measurements. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was also found to be suitable for sampling 3 -methylindole and p-cresol, compounds responsible for diet-related “pastoral flavour” in <b>sheep</b> <b>fat,</b> but further work is needed to validate this approach for measurement of these compounds in <b>sheep</b> <b>fat.</b> Statistical classification algorithms, when applied to the chromatograms measured for the 533 carcasses, showed great promise for predicting sheep category.
