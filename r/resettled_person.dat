50|$|The Inca kept great tabs {{on their}} populace {{in order to}} ensure that {{challenges}} to their authority did not occur. This included keeping detailed documents, such as a census of the population once they had been resettled. Once in their new settlement places, the mitmas participants received land to plant crops and raise livestock, as well as to build houses. By doing this, the Inca allowed mitma populations to reproduce their original social and production structure. Another way they kept the population in check was by having strict punishments for lawbreakers. If a <b>resettled</b> <b>person</b> tried to return to his native home, he was tortured. If he attempted to do so a second-time, the offender was executed. In addition, the Inca kept resettled elites in check by promoting them to bureaucratic positions in order to keep them dependent on imperial systems and ideologies for their own prestige and status.|$|E

40|$|Luxembourg {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in “resettling” refugees from various parts of the world, but a more structured policy has only recently been implemented. National legislation does not include any provisions relating to resettlement policy and there are no specific national programmes. The resettlements have always been implemented on an ad-hoc basis or within broader programmes set up by the European Commission and/or UNHCR. Since 2014, Luxembourg additionally applies a quota of refugees to be annually resettled (15 - 20 persons). The implementation and organisation of the resettlement process may vary case by case and there is no standardised procedure applicable except for regular resettlements for which the framework is to a large extent outlined in the UNHCR’s Resettlement Handbook. The selection and identification of <b>resettled</b> <b>persons</b> is coordinated by the Directorate of Immigration in close collaboration with UNHCR, who performs in principle an eligibility assessment for the refugee status, which the Luxembourgish authorities shall take over once the person arrives in Luxembourg. For each resettlement mission Luxembourg sets a general profile as well as the number of persons they intend to resettle. These criteria do basically not differ from UNHCR’s Global Resettlement Submission Criteria and thus include women, children, elderly refugees as well as refugees with disabilities and diseases, except for those suffering from pathologies {{for which there is no}} adequate treatment available in Luxembourg. Apart from the vulnerability criteria, Luxembourgish authorities also take the “integration potential” into consideration when selecting candidates eligible for resettlements. This might explain the general preference of resettling entire families rather than single persons. Resettlement implemented within the EU Turkey 1 : 1 scheme, based on the agreement between the EU and Turkey of 18 March 2016, is considered separately by national authorities. For UNHCR, who is not a party to this agreement, engagement in the resettlement of Syrian refugees from Turkey is considered part of its regular resettlement activities. Procedurally, UNHCR continues to receive resettlement referrals from Turkey’s Directorate General for Migration Management (DGMM) and further continues to undertake phone and face-to-face interviews with eligible candidates. However, as opposed to regular resettlement, the assessment undertaken by UNHCR is streamlined. The Luxembourgish Reception and Integration Agency (OLAI) coordinates the reception and integration phase of the resettled refugees. Although policy and law are the same for both, resettled refugees and other beneficiaries of international protection, in practice the support provided may differ in an initial phase. Thus, resettled refugees are accommodated upon arrival within a common reception centre where they shall be provided with a more intense support, especially during the first weeks after their arrival in Luxembourg. Since April 2016, a newly created service of the Luxembourgish Red Cross (Lisko) has been mandated, under the overall coordination of the Ministry of Family, Integration and the Greater Region, to take charge of the social support and integration of benefeciciaries of international protection, including <b>resettled</b> <b>persons.</b> Other national NGOs and associations also provide counselling and assistance. The present report identifies several challenges faced by both, the <b>resettled</b> <b>persons</b> as well as the competent authorities. These challenges prove particular significant in the post-arrival and integration phase. While some of these challenges are common to beneficiaries of international protection in general, some others may be more specifically relevant for resettled refugees, namely the absence of a transition period, coordination with local stakeholders, as well as timely provision of information to selected candidates for resettlement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} refugees and <b>resettled</b> <b>persons</b> {{in the process of}} forced migrations in the aftermath of man-made disasters. Although some of the ideas presented here could have wider application, the focus is on post-conflict zones within the former Yugoslavia, namely BiH. The paper uses the questions of ethnicity and nationalism within resettlement, dislocation and immi-gration as a backdrop, into which the issue of globalization is also briefly reflected. The intention here is not to cover a wide range of pressing topics, but simply to relate a number of issues arising in con-temporary large-scale forced migrations to a resurgence of cultural specificity and ethnicized nationa-lism as counterpoints to globalization. The paper introduces the concept of “limbo diasporas ” in the case of Bosnian refugees in Sweden through reflection and linkage with the aforementioned concepts. The paper ends with some recommendations and open questions on social rehabilitation and ethnic hea-ling as well as some general conclusions. KEY WORDS: refugees, forced migration, globalization, ethnicity, limbo diaspora “The longing of exiled people and refugees to return to their homeland, and the importance of the symbolic existence of that homeland, suggests that loss or destruction of place is as powerful an attachment as its presence. ” Irwin Altman and Setha M.

40|$|The {{issue of}} asylum has been high on both {{political}} and media agenda for years. It seems that asylum seekers are seen as economic immigrants {{who are trying to}} get the best deal in the European welfare states. European Union and its individual member states have been very keen on introducing stricter asylum practices from 1990 s onwards and gradually the number of asylum applications have declined. In 2006, almost two hundred thousand people went through the asylum system in the European Union countries. In Finland the corresponding number was 2, 324. The Finnish context in general is very particular kind. Finland has traditionally been country of outbound immigration and has been affected by the global movement of people only fairly recently. Finland also belongs to a group of Scandinavian welfare states which are characterised by relatively generous levels of state support. This thesis examines the social adaptation of asylum seekers in this context, concentrating on life domains that are controlled by the Finnish reception policies. Previous research in this field has mainly concentrated on established refugee populations and their integration processes, or simply evaluated the policy developments regarding the reception of asylum seekers. By combining the policy and the social reality that asylum seekers are facing in Finland, this research aims to explore issues that previous studies have not directly addressed. The qualitative survey data is examined in the light of acculturation, form of cultural change due to a contact with other cultures. Acculturation is a process that leads to a revaluation of cultural practises, values and norms. It is also a two way process, affecting both the <b>resettling</b> <b>persons</b> and the resettlement society and its inhabitants. Research data suggest that while asylum seekers are integrated into the welfare system they have difficulties in other areas, particularly integrating into the labour market which in turn restricts relations with the Finnish population. The failures of the Finnish resettlement policies and unsuccessful implementation of the legislation have made asylum seekers socially unprivileged and marginalised them from the Finnish society. The future policy developments in this field should aim to overcome the barriers of participation. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{displaced}} {{people around the}} world today is unprecedented in world history, with a third of those displaced below the age of 18. These children often undergo traumatic experiences which can cause serious mental health issues before and during their flight as well as afterwards when resettling in a new country. In Sweden, they are offered psychological aid in order to better deal with these issues and hence recover. However, due to the cultural stigma attached to mental health problems, psychosocial aid is often ruled out by the child themselves. In addition, up to 30 % of these unaccompanied children have been reported to suffer from PTSD, where merely speaking about one's issue can trigger a relapse of the trauma. There is therefore a shortage of pragmatic approaches to help tackle the challenges that these children faces. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how creative programs such as the organisation Clowns without Borders works with unaccompanied refugees and how their methods affect the wellbeing of these children. This thesis explores the effects that laughter and playing has on a child’s well-being using a qualitative field research approach. The research is a contribution to the field of development since it offers new grounds on how to work towards increasing the living standards of <b>resettled</b> displaced <b>persons...</b>|$|R
50|$|One late charter, from 1100, {{refers to}} the re-colonisation of some Alpine areas under Isarn's direction. Isarn's efforts at re-colonisation are not well {{evidenced}} in contemporary charters. Only one, from 976, shows the bishop granting {{a small piece of}} land as a medium plantum. Elsewhere in a charter, but with no specifics, we are told that Isarn granted castles and land to nobiles, mediores et pauperes: noblemen, the middle class, and the poor. One method used to put uncultivated soil back into use was probably also used to <b>resettle</b> wasteland. A <b>person</b> could be charged with replanting a large tract of land or rebuilding a set of houses in return for his owning a precarium or usufruct on half of them for his lifetime. This method of resettlement and redefence led to castles which were half owned by the bishop and half by those who occupied them.|$|R

40|$|A bstract Background Optimal {{adherence}} to {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) {{is required to}} promote viral suppression and to prevent disease progression and mortality. Forcibly displaced and conflict-affected populations may face challenges succeeding on HAART. We performed a systematic review of the literature on {{adherence to}} HAART and treatment outcomes in these groups, including refugees and internally-displaced persons (IDPs), assessed the quality of the evidence and suggest a future research program. Methods Medline, Embase, and Global Health databases for 1995 – 2011 were searched using the Ovid platform. A backward citation review of subsequent work that had cited the Ovid results was performed using the Web of Science database. ReliefWeb and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) websites were searched for additional grey literature. Results and conclusion We screened 297 records and identified 17 reports covering 15 quantitative and two qualitative studies from 13 countries. Three-quarters (11 / 15) of the quantitative studies were retrospective studies based on chart review; five studies included < 100 clients. Adherence or treatment outcomes were reported in <b>resettled</b> refugees, conflict-affected <b>persons,</b> internally-displaced persons (IDPs), and combinations of refugees, IDPs and other foreign-born persons. The reviewed reports showed promise for conflict-affected and forcibly-displaced populations; the range of optimal adherence prevalence reported was 87 – 99. 5 %. Treatment outcomes, measured using virological, immunological and mortality estimates, were good in relation to non-affected groups. Given the diversity of settings where forcibly-displaced and conflict-affected persons access ART, further studies on adherence and treatment outcomes are needed to support scale-up and provide evidence-based justifications for inclusion of these vulnerable groups in national treatment plans. Future studies and program evaluations should focus on systematic monitoring of adherence and treatment interruptions by using facility-based pharmacy records, understanding threats to optimal adherence and timely linkage to care throughout the displacement cycle, and testing interventions designed to support adherence and treatment outcomes in these settings. </p...|$|R
