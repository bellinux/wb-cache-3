40|$|An inverse source problem {{associated}} with a semi-linear transport or one-way wave equation in one spatial dimension is considered. It is shown an analytic solution to the inverse problem can be given and furthermore, that this inverse problem of determination of a source function is ill-posed, and must be <b>regularised.</b> <b>A</b> novel regularisation scheme which combines least squares monotone approximation and mollification of the noisy data is used to provide this regularisation. Proof of convergence of this regularisation scheme of monotone smoothing is given. Numerical solutions from the inverse problems are presented showing that the method is robust to noisy signals. The solution of this inverse problem is also shown to illustrate the behaviour of more complex problems from electromagnetism and nonlinear optics. The mathematical techniques that are developed are therefore applicable to other sets of nonlinear first order equations. The method is therefore model independent...|$|R
50|$|John Playford {{retired in}} 1684, and his place was taken {{initially}} by Henry Playford working with Richard Carr, {{but they were}} overtaken by new technology. Hitherto there had been little change in music printing since the mid sixteenth century; all of the publications discussed so far have a basic similarity in their printed appearance. Thomas Cross <b>regularised</b> <b>an</b> engraving system, and the commercial advantages were seen by John Walsh from the beginnings of his business in 1695. From there Walsh dominated music publishing through {{the first half of}} the 18th century. Further, the new method was cheaper and quicker, so publications diversified and increased in number. Though Walsh preferred the sort of anthology published in the previous century, it gradually became more common to see single-composer collections. Those anthologies that appeared usually also included glees, printed in score as compared with the separate parts which prevailed for example in 1667.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{entanglement}} entropy for smooth regions A has a logarithmic divergent contribution with a shape dependent coefficient {{and that}} for regions with conical singularities an additional log 2 term. Comparing the coefficient of this extra term, obtained by direct holographic calculation for an infinite cone, with the corresponding limiting case for the shape dependent coefficient for <b>a</b> <b>regularised</b> cone, <b>a</b> mismatch by a factor two has been observed in the literature. We discuss several aspects of this issue. In particular a regularisation of A, intrinsically delivered by the holographic picture, is proposed and applied to {{an example of a}} compact region with two conical singularities. Finally, the mismatch is removed in all studied regularisations of A, if equal scale ratios are chosen for the limiting procedure...|$|R
