25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the steering wheel {{has been criticized for}} being too big for some drivers and that <b>rear</b> <b>headroom</b> was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls on the steering wheel cannot be operated while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} mechanical {{shift lever}} {{was replaced by}} a Shift by wire shifter, as introduced in the 2007 E70 X5 and the 2008 LCI update of the E60 5 Series. The LCD and iDrive scroll button on the steering wheel became standard equipment. GPS navigation and an [...] widescreen display were included in the Technology and Navigation packages. Other options include heated front seats and split-fold rear seats. <b>Rear</b> <b>headroom,</b> leg room and shoulder room has increased, compared with its E90 predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|Riding {{the same}} {{wheelbase}} as the sedan, the liftback was {{identical to the}} sedan from the A-pillar forward and featured a sloping roof (compromising <b>rear</b> <b>headroom)</b> and a hatchback with a more shallow Kammback tail.

The Spirit offered a generous cruising range with its [...] "fuel tank capacity of 21 gallons and probable fuel mileage of 25 mpg or more... enabling the car's driver to travel over 500 miles between fill ups".|$|E
50|$|Roof line altered and {{the rear}} deck {{shortened}} for improved <b>rear</b> seat <b>headroom.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Toronado's UPP {{enabled the}} {{interior}} {{to have a}} completely flat floor, but interior space (primarily <b>rear</b> seat <b>headroom)</b> was somewhat restricted by the fastback styling.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} time since 1961 no Opel Rekord coupé was listed. However, {{customers}} wishing to enjoy style at the expense of <b>rear</b> seat <b>headroom</b> had not been abandoned to the competition, having been catered for since September 1970 by the company's stylish new Manta.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{structural}} improvement was a stronger {{design for the}} side door guard beams. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) for coupes and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels (which was also optional with the Monte Carlo), as was the instrument gauge cluster. A power moonroof was an option 1973-75. Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the <b>rear.</b> <b>Headroom</b> was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by [...] Rear seat legroom was up [...] in sedans. Another was a [...] luggage capacity, an increase of [...] over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The unusually thin windshield pillars also contributed to much better visibility.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the {{outgoing}} E38 model, the E65 7 Series has more shoulder {{room in the}} front and the rear, and increased <b>rear</b> <b>headroom.</b>|$|E
50|$|The GTC/4's coupé {{bodywork}} by Pininfarina enclosed {{two front}} and two rear seats, {{as on the}} 365 GT 2+2 it replaced directly. However, the rear seats were small and the slanting rear window limited <b>rear</b> <b>headroom,</b> so {{it can also be}} seen to trace to the two-seat 365 GTC that had been discontinued in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{later became}} known as the Kadett A. In {{addition}} to the standard saloon, from March 1963, the manufacturer offered an L (luxury model) and an estate (branded as the [...] "Opel Kadett Car-A-Van"). [...] In October 1963 Opel introduced a coupé version of the Kadett with which buyers could enjoy enhanced style at the expense of <b>rear</b> seat <b>headroom.</b>|$|R
50|$|Behind the B-pillar is a two-piece glass hatch. The {{uppermost}} {{glass panel}} normally lies flush. When pivoted-up by an electric motor, {{it acts as}} a roof spoiler, which also vents air from the interior and increases <b>rear</b> passenger <b>headroom.</b> A photovoltaic solar cell in the panel helps to control interior temperature, as well as helping recharge the battery for powering accessories. The larger glass hatch panel has side-mounted hinges {{to provide access to}} the Kabura’s cargo compartment.|$|R
25|$|In the interior, the rear-seat and {{headliner}} are redesigned to {{add more}} <b>rear</b> legroom and <b>headroom,</b> improving comfort, additional sound insulation is added and the cupholders are larger. A rear camera and a 16-gigabyte flash card system now comes with the Navi system. Furthermore, the gauge cluster is refreshed.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1973, {{because of}} the oil crisis Peugeot {{presented}} the 504 L. It featured a coil sprung live rear axle and a smaller 1796 cc engine rated at [...] ( [...] for Automatic). The different rear axle required somewhat more space; this required some alterations to the floor pan which meant marginally less boot space and <b>rear</b> <b>headroom.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The TE and KE series {{were the}} most {{aerodynamic}} car produced in Australia with a [...] This achievement was due to a sweeping roofline (which, however, compromised <b>rear</b> <b>headroom)</b> and such things as [...] "flag" [...] external rear-view mirrors, fixed to independent door posts instead of being more traditionally mounted directly {{on the front door}} A-pillar triangle.|$|E
5000|$|The Volkswagen CC (originally {{known as}} the Volkswagen Passat CC in its first generation) is a four-door sedan version of the Volkswagen Passat with a [...] "stylized {{sweeping}} roofline". reducing <b>rear</b> <b>headroom</b> and cargo space.It debuted in January 2008 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. According to Volkswagen, the suffix CC stands for Comfort Coupé despite it not being a coupé due to having four doors.|$|E
25|$|The Concord {{also came}} with {{numerous}} standard comfort and upscale features, gaining an inch (25.4mm) of <b>rear</b> seat <b>headroom,</b> {{as well as}} two additional inches (50.8mm) of rear passenger legroom. An advantage of using the aging and heavy Hornet design was its body stiffness and safety performance. Crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) showed the probability of injury in a struck vehicle to range from a low of nine percent for the four-door AMC Concord to a high of 97 percent for the two-door Nissan Sentra.|$|R
5000|$|Bonneville would {{continue}} its flagship duties on the downsized big car line that was introduced for 1977. The downsized Bonnevilles (and Catalinas) were 14 in shorter in length, over four inches (102 mm) narrower and 800 pounds lighter {{compared to their}} 1976 counterparts but had increased <b>headroom,</b> <b>rear</b> seat legroom and trunk space with much-improved fuel economy [...] - [...] a major selling point {{in the years following}} the 1973-74 energy crisis.|$|R
25|$|Although the '77 Buick LeSabre was {{considerably}} smaller on the outside, <b>headroom,</b> <b>rear</b> seat legroom and trunk space were {{increased over the}} much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built V6 and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.|$|R
50|$|As per {{the larger}} 6 Series Gran Coupé (F06), the F36 has coupe styling with a {{liftback}} rear. However, the F36 includes a C-pillar located behind the rear doors, as per the F32 coupe (but unlike the 6 Series Gran Coupé). Compared with the F30 sedan, the F36 has 13 mm less <b>rear</b> <b>headroom</b> {{and the same}} cargo volume. With the rear seats folded down, the F36 has a cargo volume of 1300 Litres.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} mechanical {{shift lever}} {{was replaced by}} a Shift by wire shifter, as introduced in the 2007 E70 X5 and the 2008 LCI update of the E60 5 Series.

5000|$|Automotive {{designer}} Peter Horbury {{described the}} contemporary three-door shooting-brake, saying [...] {{it is not}} your basic two-door hatchback, a body style with different proportions: the hatchback tends to be squatty, while a shooting brake is sleek and has [...] "a very interesting profile." [...] It makes use of the road space it covers {{a little better than}} a normal coupé, and also helps the <b>rear</b> person with <b>headroom.</b> Especially in America, every member of the family has their own car. The occasional use of the rear seat means you can do one of these cars, even if such a wagon lacks the everyday practicality of four doors.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) {{expanded}} {{the number of}} licensable automobiles, approving the first generation Odyssey {{for use in the}} city's taxi fleet [...] - [...] the Odyssey having been recommended by the seven-year-old grandson of a TLC advisory commission member.

50|$|Meanwhile, in 1963 Jaguar had {{introduced}} the Jaguar S-Type as a {{development of the}} Mark 2. It used a new intermediate-width, 54 in version of the independent rear suspension {{in place of the}} live rear axle of the Mark 2. Other differences from the Mark 2 were extended rear bodywork to provide for a larger boot, a changed roofline for more <b>rear</b> seat passenger <b>headroom,</b> a slightly plusher interior and detail differences around the nose. The S-Type was available with either 3.4 or 3.8-litre XK engines (only 3.8-litre in USA) but in twin-carburettor form because the triple-carburettor setup would not readily fit into what was essentially still the Mark 2 engine bay.|$|R

50|$|The Proton Persona (CM) was {{unveiled}} on 15 August 2007 as the decisive successor to Proton's ageing Wira saloon range. The CM Persona was {{largely based on}} the then three-year-old Proton GEN•2 hatchback platform, albeit modified to fit saloon specifications. The entire section aft of the B-pillar was re-engineered, amounting to a 167mm length extension over the GEN•2. The extended rear overhang incorporates a larger 430-litre boot, while the boot lid itself was redesigned and features space-saving twin gas strut hinges. <b>Rear</b> <b>headroom</b> in the Persona was also increased by 43mm over the GEN•2 courtesy of a redesigned rear roof design.|$|E
50|$|The Sportbrake was {{formally}} revealed in March 2012, and went on-sale date in October {{of the same}} year.It is available {{with all of the}} saloon's engines and has a loading capacity of 550 L with the seats up and 1675 L with them folded.The maximum capacity surpasses that of rivals BMW 5-Series Touring, Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon, and the Mercedes-Benz CLS Shooting Brake.The extended roofline increases <b>rear</b> <b>headroom</b> by 48 mm and the rear bench includes a 60:40 split and remote-controlled 'one-touch' folding function. The load area is fitted with multi-function rails and is 1970 mm long and 1064 mm wide.|$|E
2500|$|The 1977 Caprice Classic was {{drastically}} downsized, which {{reduced its}} weight and exterior dimensions, while increasing <b>headroom,</b> <b>rear</b> seat legroom and trunk space compared to 1976 models.

5000|$|Under {{the heading}} of Noise, the twin-cam engine was {{described}} as sounding [...] "unobtrusive." [...] Wind noise was low and tyre and suspension noise was [...] "generally low". Autocar addressed {{the matter of the}} interior design by calling it [...] "unusual" [...] and gave a full description of the dashboard which was called [...] "confusing" [...] for the driver and [...] "boring" [...] for the passenger". The seats were described as [...] "disappointing, especially when the car's potentially high lateral g forces in cornering a taken into account". The seats did not provide enough sideways bolstering. Legroom in the rear was [...] "limited" [...] as was <b>rear</b> <b>headroom.</b> The lack of interior storage for oddments was described as a [...] "glaring omission".|$|E
50|$|The 1995 Sentia used Mazda's updated HE platform, and was {{the last}} large RWD sedan from Mazda. A Japanese {{language}} automotive magazine source {{has shown that the}} car incorporates a number of styling cues from the stillborn Amati 1000. This generation Sentia had been developed with the proposed Mazda flagship in mind. Anticipating that it would take over the role of formal-use vehicles (i.e. chauffeur-driven transport for executives) in the product line, this Sentia is considerably geared towards private owners in its focus. The mechanical underpinnings are largely carried over from the previous Sentia. The exterior and interior received a mild redesign to make the car more stately, and suitable for formal corporate use. This includes a larger grille, taller roofline for improved <b>rear</b> <b>headroom,</b> as well as large expanses of woodgrain panelling.|$|E
5000|$|A heavily {{redesigned}} [...] "Type 2" [...] variant (internally designated Typ 53B) {{went on sale}} in 1981, {{although it}} remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by Karmann of Osnabrück (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the 1981 Geneva Salon in March that year. Designed by Volkswagen's own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and <b>rear</b> <b>headroom,</b> increased luggage space {{and a reduction in}} the coefficient of drag. One unique feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined [...] "SCIROCCO" [...] script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line proportioning valves and a brake light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|... 1973 models also {{introduced}} molded full foam {{front and rear}} seat construction, a flow-through power ventilation system, an inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and [...] "flush and dry" [...] rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets.Another structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) for coupes and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster. A power moonroof was an option 1973-75. Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the <b>rear.</b> <b>Headroom</b> was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by 1.6 in. Rear seat legroom was up 3.5 in in sedans. Another was a 15.3 cuft L luggage capacity, an increase of 2.5 cuft L over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The unusually thin windshield pillars also contributed to much better visibility.|$|E
5000|$|CAR {{magazine}} {{tested the}} diesel variant in July 1990. CARs opinion was that [...] "a weekend trip to Bavaria proved this latest {{addition to the}} XM range {{to be a very}} competent and economical long-hauler. At more moderate British road speeds, we have managed 43mpg in mixed running with four people aboard." [...] In this review the car was viewed as being superior to a BMW 5-series: [...] "Early in the trip the car was uncannily smooth over the bumpy back roads between Calais and Dunkirk. On German autobahns, travelling at speeds which turn bends into corners, the XM remained impressively flat as the suspension altered to cope with high cornering loads. We made the trip accompanied by a BMW 535i, which rolled appreciably more through fast bends, and passengers who tried both cars preferred the XM." [...] Points of criticism were again, the left-side mirror and rear headroom: [...] " [...] The most serious problem is ungenerous <b>rear</b> <b>headroom,</b> though three passengers of average height found the rear bench comfortable for a 12-hour journey. More irritating, because avoidable, is the nearside mirror, which is partially obscured by the A-pillar. This deficiency is particularly noticeable on the continent, when you need the mirror for overtaking." [...] The foot-operated parking brake was also criticized: [...] "... four days weren’t enough to dispel our annoyance with the US-style foot-operated parking brake. We noted sourly that you would probably fail a driving test in the XM, because you cannot apply the brake (using your left foot) until you have put the car in neutral." [...] In conclusion, CARs view was that [...] "the XM is a car that grows on you, and in Turbo Diesel form, its cheap to operate. If youre contemplating high mileages, particularly abroad where diesel is sensibly priced much cheaper than petrol, it’s well worth considering the stiff extra price of the oil-burner. If you care about reducing carbon dioxide emissions by improving fuel consumption, the XM Turbo Diesel offers dramatic gains without sacrificing big-car virtues." ...|$|E
