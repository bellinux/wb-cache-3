40|$|EEG {{coherence}} as {{a measure}} of synchronization of brain activity was used to investigate effects of irrelevant speech. In a delayed serial recall paradigm 21 healthy participants retained verbal items over a 10 -s delay with and without interfering irrelevant speech. Recall after the delay was varied in two modes (spoken vs. written). Behavioral data showed the classic irrelevant speech effect and a superiority of written over spoken <b>recall</b> <b>mode.</b> Coherence, however, was more sensitive to processing characteristics and showed interactions between the irrelevant speech effect and <b>recall</b> <b>mode</b> during the rehearsal delay in theta (4 – 7. 5 Hz), alpha (8 – 12 Hz), beta (13 – 20 Hz), and gamma (35 – 47 Hz) frequency bands. For gamma, a rehearsal-related decrease of the duration of high coherence due to presentation of irrelevant speech was found in a left-lateralized fronto-central and centro-temporal network only in spoken but not in written recall. In theta, coherence at predominantly fronto-parietal electrode combinations was indicative for memory demands and varied with individual working memory capacity assessed by digit span. Alpha coherence revealed similar results and patterns as theta coherence. In beta, a left-hemispheric network showed longer high synchronizations due to irrelevant speech only in written <b>recall</b> <b>mode.</b> EEG results suggest that mode of recall is critical for processing already during the retention period of a delayed serial recall task. Moreover, the finding that different networks are engaged with different recall modes shows that the disrupting effect of irrelevant speech is not a unitary mechanism...|$|E

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are often successfully applied to problems for which no algorithmic solution exist, but can be described by examples.

Analogue VLSI implementations of <b>recall</b> <b>mode</b> ANNs are maturing, but the equally important problem of implementing programming (or learning) hardware for these is still in its infancy. We shall present the analogue VLSI implementation of two supervised, gradient descent learning algorithms for ANNs: the error back-propagation learning algorithm (BPL) for layered feed forward ANNs and the real-time recurrent learning algorithm (RTRL) for general recurrent networks.

40|$|Contextual fear {{conditioning}} {{is thought}} to involve the synaptic plasticity-dependent establishment in hippocampus of representations of to-be-conditioned contexts which can then become associated with USs in the amygdala. A conceptual and computational model {{of this process is}} proposed in which contextual attributes are assumed to be sampled serially and randomly during contextual exposures. Given this assumption, moment-to-moment information about such attributes will often be quite different from one exposure to another and, in particular, between exposures during which representations are created, exposures during which conditioning occurs, and during recall sessions. This presents challenges to current conceptual models of hippocampal function. In order to meet these challenges, our model's hippocampus was made to operate in different modes during representation creation and recall, and non-hippocampal machinery was constructed that controlled these hippocampal modes. This machinery uses a comparison between contextual information currently observed and information associated with existing hippocampal representations of familiar contexts to compute the Bayesian Weight of Evidence that the current context is (or is not) a known one, and it uses this value to assess the appropriateness of creation or <b>recall</b> <b>modes.</b> The model predicts a number of known phenomena such as the immediate shock deficit, spurious fear conditioning to contexts that are absent but similar to actually present ones, and modulation of conditioning by pre-familiarization with contexts.

40|$|Actuated {{traffic signal}} {{controllers}} typically depend on inductive loop detectors to determine {{demand for a}} particular signal phase. The basic philosophy of these controllers is to only provide a green indication to a particular lane group {{when there is a}} vehicle waiting.

This paper describes a procedure that has been developed using directional boring equipment to install a micro loop below the surface of the pavement where it is not subject to pavement distress.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{combined}} finite element (FE) - artificial neural network (ANN) approach {{for the analysis of}} the behavior of non linear composites and hierarchical structures. Different aspects of ANN use in multiscale numerical homogenization are shown. First, the possibility to model via ANNs the effective material starting from a relatively small set of suitable virtual or real experiments performed on a unit cell is discussed. ANN based procedures can also be exploited in a multiscale analysis as a tool for the stress-strain recovery at lower levels of a hierarchical structure. In many situations a map of the strain and stress state at the lowest level is needed. To this aim, it is necessary to calculate the strain state in the most strained point for each material of the repetitive cell.

This permits a simple implementation in software {{on a personal}} computer or space instrument microprocessor. Associative List Memory has a performance comparable with Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) but differs from SDM in that convergence occurs during learning, rather than on recall, and in that the memory {{is in the form}} of a dynamic list rather than static randomly distributed locations. Associative List Memory is suitable for unsupervised finding of classes of phenomena in large databases. In particular, all of the class exemplars deduced can be easily accessed at any time to provide a summary of current database knowledge, being essentially the contents of the list.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show some {{different}} concepts {{for the use}} of Artificial Neural Networks [1 - 4] in modelling of composites and hierarchical structures. First, the possibility to identify the effective material properties from real experiments or numerical simulations or {{a combination of the two}} is investigated. Starting from a relatively small set of suitable numerical experiments performed on a unit cell, a proper set of corresponding input-output data is created to train an artificial neural network to identify the effective properties. Furthermore, ANN based procedures can be exploited in a multiscale analysis as a tool for the stress-strain recovery at lower levels of a hierarchical structure and/or to estimate the state of yielding of the materials. This kind of applications is of great computational importance, since with material non linearity it allows for a significantly improved computational efficiency. Finally ANNs may be used to define the homogenised properties for a class of cells depending on few geometrical parameters. This scheme can be applied in many engineering situation: from analysis of Functionally Graded Materials to composite with random voids (e. g. composites with cavities of not reacted alloys). This approach is applicable also when the materials depend on parameters like temperature, damage, or state of yielding. In such a case the method allows to save a huge amount of computational time, replacing the solution of several BVPs by a simple run of ANN in <b>recall</b> <b>mode.</b> The problem of the best ANN (or sufficiently good ANN) for each type of application is discussed by means of the examples presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{combined}} finite element (FE) – artificial neural network (ANN) approach for the multi-scale modeling of cables made of LTS materials. At first different aspects of ANN use in non-linear analysis of hierarchical composite are shown. The possibility to model via ANNs the *homogenized material behavior* starting from a relatively small set of suitable virtual or real experiments is discussed. ANN based procedures can also be exploited in a multi-scale analysis {{as a tool for}} the *stress-strain recovery* at the structure lower levels. For example, in SC cables a map of the strain state at the wire and filament scale is needed. The related unsmearing procedure is numerically very costly. An ANN, acting in <b>recall</b> <b>mode</b> during the execution of the homogenization loops, allows for a considerably improved computational efficiency. Secondly, the *cable mechanical behavior* is analyzed, namely the influence of the hierarchical helix geometry on the stiffness of the cable. It is proven how the stiffness matrix of these structures is different from the usual matrix of Euler-Bernoulli beams. Finally, a significant application for the *design of cables* is shown. ANNs can be used to investigate the dependence of the stiffness coefficients upon the twist pitches of the multi-level helixes. The final goal of this research is to substitute, at each level, a bundle of wires with a single equivalent wire, having the characteristics computed on the bundle of the previous scale. The presented hybrid finite element–artificial neural network approach is exploited to this aim, showing that suitably trained ANNs can replace the module that usually provides the stiffness matrix in an FE code. In the end, some real cable examples are shown, where results obtained via the FE method are compared with those calculated by an ANN-FE procedure...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Use of {{medicines}} among children is common. It {{is important to}} learn about their medicine-related perceptions to better understand potential threats children may experience especially while using medicines independently. Objectives: To explore awareness and beliefs about use {{of medicines}} and medication safety among 9 - 12 and 13 - 16 year-old schoolchildren in Tartu, Estonia. Methods: Mixed methods approach was used: 1) questionnaire with open-ended questions about medicines, 2) drawing of medicines cabinet children have at home (results not presented in this abstract), and 3) 3 - 4 children in 62 groups discussing about symptoms, spread, cure and prevention of various ailments (asthma, flu, migraine, accidents, snake bite and earache). The study was undertaken in one primary school of Tartu, Estonia, in December 2015 -January 2016 among 4 th to 9 th graders. Content {{analysis was used to}} analyse all the data. In each category found (presented in results), number of responses was calculated and for analysis of statistical differences in responses to open-ended questions, children were divided into two groups by age: 9 - 12 (n= 121) and 13 - 16 (n= 123) years. Results: Most of the discussion groups presented extensive and correct descriptions about symptoms, treatment and prevention of different ailments. Medicines were <b>recalled</b> by <b>mode</b> of action (e. g. analgesics, cough and cold medicines), active substance (e. g. paracetamol, ibuprofen) as well as by particular trade name of medicine (e. g. Xymelin®, Nospa®, Sudafed®). In comparison with other medicines, different analgesics were listed more frequently by almost all of the respondents. Half of older children and 1 / 3 of younger children described threats (adverse reactions, drug addiction, overdose of medicines, irrational use of medicines, death), connected with use of medicines. At the same time in the older age group it was suggested that children could use medicines independently starting 12 years of age in contrast to 17 years of age in the younger age group (p< 0. 01). Discussion and conclusions: Schoolchildren demonstrated awareness and sense of responsibility in prevention and treatment of various ailments. Children identified commonly used non-prescription medicines by treated symptoms, active substance or product name. Medication safety was less recognised, and independent use of medicines was suggested at a fairly young age by the children. In the future, more attention has to be paid on education of schoolchildren about safe and rational use of medicines. Pharmacists could be more involved in different educational activities in collaboration with schools...|$|R
40|$|The Pliocene and Pleistocene {{deposits}} unconformably {{covering the}} allochthonous sheets in the Southern Apennine mountain chain and disconformably overlying the autochthonous Apulia carbonates in the Bradano Trough display remarkable stratigraphic signatures closely {{controlled by the}} trajectories of the active thrusts. Thrust propagation during the Pliocene and Pleistocene followed {{in the study area}} a quite simple leitmotif that <b>recalls</b> the advancing <b>mode</b> of a caterpillar, every stage of forward nappe displacement having been preceded and followed by a telescopic shortening of the structural edifice behind the inactive front of the tectonic wedge. This behaviour allows the recognition of well-defined tectonic cycles, each cycle starting with the activation of a long thrust flat and ending with a forward propagation of the active thrusts and the incorporation of new horses into the duplex system. Tectonic cycles have been recorded in the foredeep basin and on top of the allochthonous sheets by thrust-related depositional sequences, every sequence being divided into four systems tracts representative of the principal steps that describe the caterpillar-like motion of the tectonic wedge: 1) forward transport of the Apenninic nappes on top of a long thrust flat; 2) development of a steep ramp {{at the front of the}} tectonic wedge; 3) deactivation of the leading edge of the duplex system and out-of-sequence migration of the active thrusts towards the axis of the mountain chain; 4) 	forward migration of the active thrusts beneath and beyond the previously abandoned leading edge. We carefully analysed the different systems tracts of the Ofanto and Bradano depositional sequences along the CROP- 04 transect in order to provide additional information about the relationships between thrust propagation and sedimentation in late Pliocene and early Pleistocene times. In this paper, new constraints about the kinematic evolution of the thrust belt-foredeep system in the 3. 70 - 0. 60 Ma interval will be presented. The new data have allowed us a quite accurate age determination of the growth of the principal tectonic structures both in the buried Apulia carbonates (e. g. San Gregorio Magno antiform) and in the roof units of the Apennine duplex system (e. g. San Fele antiformal stack and Ofanto synform) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{various sources}} {{of diversity in}} the vertebrate immune system. In particular, we study the differences between thediversity of lymphocytes and major istocompatibility (MHC) molecules. While any individual expresses a huge diversity of B and T ymphocytes, the diversity of MHC molecules is mainly expressed at the population level. We use various mathematical models and computer simulations to study which evolutionary selection pressures mayunderlie the diversity of lymphocytes and MHC molecules. Central is {{the hypothesis that the}} adaptive immune system stores immunological decisions in lymphocytes. Instructed lymphocytes <b>recall</b> their appropriate <b>mode</b> of response whenever they recognise their specific epitope. The vertebrate immune system thereby combines the evolutionary wisdom of the innate immune system with somatic learning by the adaptive immune system. It has been proposed that het need for self-nonself discrimination is the driving force for the diversity of the adaptive immune system. Using mathematical models {{it has been shown that}} the diversity of lymphocytes giving optimal protection against infections reflects the number of self antigens that need to be tolerized. We show, however, that avoidance of inappropriate immune responses, such as autoimmune responses against self antigens that fail to induce tolerance, calls for an even higher specificity and diversity than was concluded from these previous models. According to our calculations, lymphocytes should be as specific as possible within the constraints imposed by the size of the immune repertoire. We show that the need to avoid inappropriate immune responses can also explain the limited diversity of MHC molecules within an individual. The fact that individuals express only a limited number of different MHC molecules out of the huge MHC population diversity, is usually attributed to the need to avoid repertoire depletion during self-tolerance induction. We dispute this explanation by showing that expression of extra MHC molecules tends to increase the functional T cell repertoire and that repertoire depletion only occurs at an unrealistically high individual MHC diversity. Expression of a large individual MHC diversity, however, increases the chance of inducing inappropriate immune responses. Foreign peptides presented by MHC molecules may form complexes that [...] from the T cell point of view [...] look similar to comlexes of MHC molecules presenting ignored self molecules. Excessive MHC diversity therefore increases the chance that lymphocytes that have been triggered by foreign peptides cause autoimmune responses against so-far ignored self antigens. Despite the limited diversity of MHC molecules within any individual, we show that there is selection for a large diversity of MHC molecules at the population level. A large population diversity of MHC molecules allows an individual to respond to different epitopes of an antigen than the other individuals in the population, thereby giving protection against coevolving pathogens. We show that the MHC polymorphism arising under host-pathogen coevolution is significantly larger than the polymorphism arising under selection for heterozygosity only. Finally, using a combined theoretical-experimental approach, we have found evidence for competition between T lymphocytes for antigen-presenting sites on antigen-presenting cells. We conjecture that the immune system may employ the MHC diversity that is left at the individual level to allow the presentation of multiple epitopes per antigen. It may thereby allow the distributed storage of immunological decisions in lymphocytes, despite the presence of T cell competition...|$|R
